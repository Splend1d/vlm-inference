                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 29-year-old guy who's been having some issues since he moved to take a new job with more responsibility. He's complaining of a pounding heart, sleep problems, and feeling really restless. He's also having trouble concentrating at work and has even called in sick a few times recently. I need to figure out what's most likely going on with him based on the options given.\n\nFirst, let's look at the symptoms he's reporting:\n\n- Pounding heart: That could be related to anxiety or maybe even stress.\n\n- Poor sleep: Again, common in anxiety and stress disorders.\n\n- Generalized restlessness: Sounds like he's feeling keyed up or on edge a lot.\n\n- Trouble concentrating at work: This is impacting his performance, which is a big deal.\n\n- He's called in sick 3 days in the past 2 weeks: That suggests he's really struggling with something.\n\nNow, let's consider the context: He recently relocated for a promotion, which comes with increased responsibility. So, there's a significant life change and added stress at work.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Adjustment disorder with anxious mood\n\nB. Generalized anxiety disorder\n\nC. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate\n\nD. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\n\nLet's think about each one.\n\nStarting with A, adjustment disorder with anxious mood: This is when someone has difficulty coping with a stressful event, and they develop symptoms like anxiety that are not severe enough to meet the criteria for a more serious disorder. Given that he just moved and took a new job with more responsibility, that's a pretty significant stressor. His symptoms started around that time, so it's possible.\n\nOption B, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): This is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable anxiety and worry about a number of different things, often related to work, family, health, etc. The worry is hard to control and affects daily life. His symptoms do include worry about his ability to adapt to his new responsibilities, and he's feeling restless and having trouble concentrating, which are symptoms of GAD.\n\nOption C, major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate: While he does mention feeling restless, which can be a symptom of depression, there's no explicit mention of depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, which are key features of depression. He's mainly talking about anxiety-related symptoms like restlessness, heart pounding, and sleep problems.\n\nOption D, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder: This is a bit different. It's about a pervasive pattern of perfectionism and control, where someone is overly focused on details, rules, and organization, often at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. While someone with this disorder might experience anxiety, it's more about their need for order and control.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most likely diagnosis is adjustment disorder with anxious mood. He's recently faced a significant life change\u2014moving and taking on more responsibility at work\u2014and his symptoms started around that time. Adjustment disorders are pretty common in such situations.\n\nBut wait, generalized anxiety disorder is also a possibility because his symptoms align with GAD, and he's worrying about his ability to handle his new responsibilities.\n\nHowever, with adjustment disorder, the symptoms start in response to a specific stressor and generally resolve once the stressor is removed or the person adapts to it. In this case, it's been only two months since he moved and took the new job, so maybe he hasn't had enough time to adjust yet.\n\nOn the other hand, GAD is more long-term and not directly tied to a specific stressor. The symptoms are more pervasive and aren't solely in response to one event.\n\nGiven that his symptoms started after the move and the job change, adjustment disorder seems more fitting. Plus, he hasn't had these issues before, as far as we know.\n\nAlso, in adjustment disorder, the distress is in excess of what would be expected given the stressor, or the symptoms persist longer than expected. Here, he's calling in sick multiple times, which suggests that his reaction is more severe than what might be typically expected.\n\nMajor depressive disorder is less likely because, although he's feeling restless, there's no clear indication of depressed mood or anhedonia, which are core features of depression.\n\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder seems less fitting because there's no mention of obsessions or compulsions, or a need for excessive order and control.\n\nTherefore, I think the most likely diagnosis is adjustment disorder with anxious mood.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if perhaps he's experiencing both adjustment disorder and elements of GAD. Sometimes, these can co-occur.\n\nHowever, given that this is a multiple-choice question and I have to pick the most likely diagnosis, I'll go with adjustment disorder.\n\nJust to double-check, let's look up the DSM-5 criteria for adjustment disorder.\n\nAccording to the DSM-5, adjustment disorders are characterized by the development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor occurring within 3 months of the stressor.\n\nThe symptoms are in excess of what would be expected given the nature of the stressor and cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n\nThe symptoms do not meet the criteria for another mental disorder and are not just an exacerbation of a preexisting mental disorder.\n\nIn this case, the stressor is clear: moving to a new place and taking on more responsibility at work. The symptoms started within 2 months, which is within the 3-month window.\n\nHis symptoms include anxiety (pounding heart, restlessness), sleep disturbance, and difficulty concentrating, all of which can be part of adjustment disorder.\n\nHe's also having functional impairment, as evidenced by calling in sick to work.\n\nSo, based on this, adjustment disorder with anxious mood seems like the most appropriate diagnosis.\n\nJust to compare with GAD, the DSM-5 criteria for GAD include excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities.\n\nWhile his symptoms have been present for 2 months, which is less than the 6-month duration required for GAD.\n\nTherefore, given the recent onset and association with a specific stressor, adjustment disorder is a better fit.\n\nIn conclusion, the most likely diagnosis is adjustment disorder with anxious mood.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. adjustment disorder with anxious mood}} \\]"
