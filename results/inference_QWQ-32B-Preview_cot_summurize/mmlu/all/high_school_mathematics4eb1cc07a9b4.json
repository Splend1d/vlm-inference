                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the square root of \\( 18 \\times n \\times 34 \\) is an integer. The options are 34, 2, 17, and 3. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that for a square root to be an integer, the expression inside the square root has to be a perfect square. So, \\( 18 \\times n \\times 34 \\) needs to be a perfect square.\n\nAlright, let's start by simplifying the expression inside the square root. Maybe factoring the numbers will help.\n\nLet's factor 18 and 34.\n\n18 can be factored into \\( 2 \\times 3^2 \\), and 34 can be factored into \\( 2 \\times 17 \\). So, putting it all together:\n\n\\( 18 \\times n \\times 34 = (2 \\times 3^2) \\times n \\times (2 \\times 17) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 17 \\times n \\).\n\nNow, for this product to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization need to be even numbers because perfect squares have even exponents in their prime factorizations.\n\nLooking at what we have: \\( 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 17 \\times n \\).\n\nHere, \\( 2^2 \\) and \\( 3^2 \\) already have even exponents, which is good. But 17 has an exponent of 1, which is odd. So, to make the entire product a perfect square, we need to make the exponent of 17 even. The smallest way to do that is to multiply by another 17, making it \\( 17^2 \\), which has an even exponent.\n\nSo, it seems like \\( n \\) should be 17 to make the entire product a perfect square.\n\nWait a minute, but let's check if there's a smaller \\( n \\) that could work. Maybe if \\( n \\) includes other factors that could make the exponents even.\n\nLet me consider that \\( n \\) could be a product of different primes. For example, if \\( n \\) includes a 2 or a 3, but looking back, 2 and 3 already have even exponents.\n\nWait, \\( 2^2 \\) and \\( 3^2 \\) are already present. The only issue is the 17 with an exponent of 1. So, to make it even, \\( n \\) needs to supply at least one more 17.\n\nBut let's verify this.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 17 \\), then the product becomes \\( 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 17 \\times 17 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 17^2 \\), which is \\( (2 \\times 3 \\times 17)^2 \\), which is indeed a perfect square.\n\nNow, is there a smaller \\( n \\) than 17 that could achieve this?\n\nLet's check the options:\n\nA. 34\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 17\n\nD. 3\n\nSo, 34 is larger than 17, 2 is smaller, and 3 is also smaller. But according to my reasoning, \\( n \\) should be 17.\n\nWait, but maybe \\( n \\) can be a product of multiple primes. Let's see.\n\nIf \\( n = 2 \\), then the product is \\( 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 17 \\times 2 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 17 \\). Here, the exponent of 2 is 3, which is odd, and the exponent of 17 is 1, which is also odd. So, this is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\( n = 3 \\), then the product is \\( 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 17 \\times 3 = 2^2 \\times 3^3 \\times 17 \\). Now, the exponent of 3 is 3, which is odd, and the exponent of 17 is 1, which is odd. So, again, not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\( n = 34 \\), which is \\( 2 \\times 17 \\), then the product is \\( 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 17 \\times 2 \\times 17 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 17^2 \\). Here, the exponent of 2 is 3, which is odd, so not a perfect square.\n\nOnly when \\( n = 17 \\), the product becomes \\( 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 17^2 \\), which is a perfect square.\n\nWait, but let's think differently. Maybe \\( n \\) can be a multiple of 17, but smaller than 17. But 17 is prime, so its only positive integer multiples are 17, 34, 51, etc.\n\nWait, but 17 is prime, so its smallest multiple is 17 itself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( n \\) can be 17 times another square number to keep it as small as possible, but since 17 is already the smallest prime needed, multiplying it by another square won't make it smaller.\n\nWait, but in this case, since 17 is already the smallest \\( n \\) that makes the product a perfect square, and the other options don't work, it seems that 17 is the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 17 \\), then \\( 18 \\times 17 \\times 34 \\).\n\nCalculating that: 18 times 34 is \\( 18 \\times 30 = 540 \\), plus \\( 18 \\times 4 = 72 \\), so \\( 540 + 72 = 612 \\). Then \\( 612 \\times 17 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( 600 \\times 17 = 10,200 \\), and \\( 12 \\times 17 = 204 \\), so \\( 10,200 + 204 = 10,404 \\).\n\nNow, \\( \\sqrt{10,404} = 102 \\), which is an integer.\n\nSo, it works.\n\nNow, checking the other options:\n\nIf \\( n = 2 \\), then \\( 18 \\times 2 \\times 34 = 36 \\times 34 = 1,224 \\).\n\n\\( \\sqrt{1,224} \\) is not an integer.\n\nIf \\( n = 3 \\), then \\( 18 \\times 3 \\times 34 = 54 \\times 34 = 1,836 \\).\n\n\\( \\sqrt{1,836} \\) is not an integer.\n\nIf \\( n = 34 \\), then \\( 18 \\times 34 \\times 34 = 18 \\times 1,156 = 20,808 \\).\n\n\\( \\sqrt{20,808} \\) is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) that makes \\( \\sqrt{18 \\times n \\times 34} \\) an integer is indeed 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
