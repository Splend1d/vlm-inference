                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this question about a supervisor trying to increase their influence by being sensitive to their subordinates' needs and acting as a role model. And we need to figure out which base of power, according to French and Raven, this corresponds to. The options are A. referent, B. legitimate, C. expert, and D. charismatic.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what French and Raven's bases of power are. I think they identified five or maybe more types of power that people can use to influence others. Let me list them out to make sure I remember correctly.\n\n1. Referent power: This is when someone has power because others respect and like them. So, if a supervisor is well-liked and respected, subordinates might follow their lead because they admire them.\n\n2. Legitimate power: This is power that comes from a person's position or title. For example, a manager has legitimate power because of their role in the organization.\n\n3. Expert power: This is based on a person's knowledge or expertise. If someone is really knowledgeable in a certain area, others might listen to them and follow their advice.\n\n4. Reward power: This is the ability to give rewards or benefits to others, which can influence their behavior.\n\n5. Coercive power: This is the ability to punish or impose sanctions, which can also influence others.\n\nAnd I think there might be charismatic power as well, but I'm not sure if it's distinct from referent power.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, the supervisor is being sensitive to subordinates' needs and acting as a role model. Being sensitive to needs might make subordinates feel valued and appreciated, which could increase their respect and admiration for the supervisor. Acting as a role model suggests that the supervisor is behaving in a way that others look up to and want to emulate.\n\nThis sounds a lot like referent power, where influence comes from being liked and respected. But let's see if it could fit into another category.\n\nLegitimate power is about the position itself, not necessarily about the supervisor's behavior. So, even if the supervisor isn't sensitive or a good role model, they still have legitimate power because of their title. So, that doesn't seem to match here.\n\nExpert power is about knowledge and expertise. While acting as a role model might involve demonstrating expertise, the question emphasizes sensitivity to needs and being a role model, which seems more about personality and behavior than about expertise.\n\nCharismatic power might be similar to referent power, but I think charisma is a specific type of personal\u9b45\u529b that can inspire others. Maybe it's a subset of referent power.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is A. referent, because the supervisor is increasing their influence by being liked and respected through their sensitivity and role modeling.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's another option that could fit.\n\nReward power involves the ability to give rewards. While being sensitive to needs might sometimes involve giving rewards, the question doesn't specify that the supervisor is giving tangible rewards. It's more about being attuned to subordinates' needs in a general sense.\n\nCoercive power is about punishment, which isn't mentioned here at all.\n\nSo, again, referent power seems the most appropriate.\n\nWait a minute, the question provides options A through D, and D is charismatic. Maybe there's a distinction between referent and charismatic power that I'm missing.\n\nLet me look up French and Raven's bases of power to confirm.\n\nOkay, according to French and Raven, the five bases of power are:\n\n1. Reward power: The ability to provide rewards.\n\n2. Coercive power: The ability to punish.\n\n3. Legitimate power: Power based on formal position.\n\n4. Expert power: Power based on knowledge and expertise.\n\n5. Referent power: Power based on identification with the leader.\n\nCharismatic power isn't explicitly listed, but sometimes charisma is considered part of referent power.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is D. charismatic, but since it's not one of the original five, I'm not sure.\n\nLooking back at the question, it says \"bases of power identified by French and Raven,\" and lists options including charismatic. So, maybe in some versions, charismatic is considered a separate base.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the supervisor's sensitivity and role modeling are aspects of charismatic leadership.\n\nCharismatic leaders often are sensitive to others' needs and serve as role models, inspiring followers through their personality and vision.\n\nSo, in that sense, D. charismatic could also be a correct answer.\n\nBut to decide between referent and charismatic, I need to see if there's a clear distinction.\n\nReferent power is based on identification with the leader, meaning followers admire and like the leader and want to be like them.\n\nCharismatic power might involve that, but also includes the leader's ability to inspire and mobilize followers through their personality and vision.\n\nGiven that, perhaps charismatic power is a subset of referent power, but with added elements of inspiration and mobilization.\n\nIn the context of the question, the supervisor is being sensitive to needs and acting as a role model, which sounds like referent power, but without specifically mentioning inspiration or mobilization, which might be more characteristic of charismatic power.\n\nTherefore, referent power seems like the broader category that includes being liked and respected, while charismatic power adds the element of inspiration.\n\nSince the question doesn't specify inspiration, maybe referent power is the better answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the supervisor's sensitivity and role modeling are particularly magnetic and inspiring, then charismatic power could be applicable.\n\nBut based on the information given, I think referent power is the most appropriate answer.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. referent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
