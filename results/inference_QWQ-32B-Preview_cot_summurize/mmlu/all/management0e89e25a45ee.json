                    "text": "Worker autonomy in decision making is an example of worker empowerment.\n\nSo, let's break this down. Worker autonomy refers to the degree to which employees have the freedom and discretion to make decisions about their work without needing approval from supervisors. It's about giving workers the ability to control aspects of their job, such as how they perform tasks, set priorities, and even make certain choices about their work processes.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Worker freedom - This is somewhat related, as autonomy does involve freedom in decision making. However, \"worker freedom\" is a bit more general and could encompass a wider range of freedoms beyond just decision making.\n\nB. Greater worker negotiation - This might involve employees having more say in negotiating their wages, benefits, or work conditions. While autonomy can lead to better negotiation positions, it's not directly synonymous with negotiation itself.\n\nC. Worker empowerment - This is the most accurate choice. Empowerment in the workplace refers to granting employees more authority, responsibility, and autonomy to make decisions that affect their work. It's about giving them the power to act and make choices that can improve their performance and the overall organization.\n\nD. Increased worker power - This could be similar to empowerment, but \"power\" might imply a more hierarchical or authoritative position, which isn't necessarily the case with autonomy. Autonomy is more about individual decision-making power rather than positional power within an organization.\n\nTherefore, worker autonomy in decision making is best described as an example of worker empowerment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
