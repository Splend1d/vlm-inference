But maybe I should double-check that.\n\nLet me think about it. In Thai cuisine, there are lots of dishes with chicken, like Pad Thai with chicken or Tom Yum Goong with chicken. Wait, Tom Yum Goong is actually with shrimp, right? So, maybe Pad Thai Gai would be Pad Thai with chicken. That sounds familiar.\n\nI recall that in Thai, \"gai\" means chicken. For example, Gai Pad Krapow, which is basil chicken, or Gai Satay, which is chicken satay. So, it seems consistent that \"gai\" refers to chicken in Thai cuisine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if \"gai\" could mean something else in different contexts. For example, in some languages, certain words can have multiple meanings. However, in the context of a Thai restaurant menu, \"gai\" probably refers to chicken.\n\nLet me check if there are any Thai dishes where \"gai\" might refer to something else. I don't think so. Most Thai dishes that include chicken have \"gai\" in their name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"gai\" could refer to a type of vegetable or another protein, but I don't think so. In all the Thai restaurants I've been to, \"gai\" always refers to chicken.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is B. chicken.\n\nBut to be completely sure, maybe I should consider the other options.\n\nA. shrimp: Shrimp in Thai is \"goong,\" like in Tom Yum Goong.\n\nC. beef: Beef is \"neua,\" as in Pad Thai Neua or Gai Neua salads.\n\nD. pork: Pork is \"mu,\" as in som tum mu, which is green papaya salad with pork.\n\nSo, none of these match \"gai.\" Therefore, it must be B. chicken.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
