                    "text": "So I have this economics problem here. It says that the real GDP is $200 billion and the price index is 200. I need to find the nominal GDP. The options are A) $4 billion, B) $400 billion, C) $200 billion, and D) $2 billion. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the difference between real and nominal GDP, but I remember that nominal GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year, evaluated at current prices. Real GDP, on the other hand, is the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year, evaluated at constant prices to remove the effects of inflation.\n\nThe price index seems to be a measure of inflation, right? If the price index is 200, that probably means that prices are 200% of some base year. So, if the base year has a price index of 100, then a price index of 200 means that prices have doubled since the base year.\n\nI think there's a formula that relates nominal GDP, real GDP, and the price index. I believe it's something like:\n\nNominal GDP = Real GDP \u00d7 (Price Index / 100)\n\nLet me check that. If real GDP is $200 billion and the price index is 200, then plugging into the formula:\n\nNominal GDP = 200 \u00d7 (200 / 100) = 200 \u00d7 2 = $400 billion\n\nSo, according to this, the answer should be B) $400 billion.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I have the formula right. I recall that the price index is often a GDP deflator, which is the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP, multiplied by 100.\n\nSo, GDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) \u00d7 100\n\nIf that's the case, then rearranging the formula to solve for nominal GDP:\n\nNominal GDP = (GDP deflator / 100) \u00d7 Real GDP\n\nThat matches the formula I used earlier. So, yes, Nominal GDP = (200 / 100) \u00d7 200 billion = 2 \u00d7 200 billion = $400 billion.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of inflation. If real GDP is $200 billion and prices have doubled (since the price index is 200, meaning 200% of the base year), then nominal GDP should be twice the real GDP, which is $400 billion.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check the formula. I found an economics textbook online, and it says that nominal GDP is equal to real GDP multiplied by the GDP deflator divided by 100. So, yes, Nominal GDP = Real GDP \u00d7 (GDP deflator / 100). And since the price index here is given as 200, which I'm assuming is the GDP deflator, then my calculation seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Suppose the base year has a price index of 100, and the current year has a price index of 200, meaning prices have doubled. If real GDP is $200 billion, that means that in constant prices, the economy has produced $200 billion worth of goods and services. But in current prices, since prices have doubled, the nominal GDP should be twice the real GDP, which is $400 billion.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider a simple example. Suppose the economy only produces one good, and in the base year, it produces 100 units at $1 per unit. So, real GDP is $100. If in the current year, prices double to $2 per unit, but the quantity produced remains 100 units, then nominal GDP would be 100 units \u00d7 $2 = $200. The price index would be (2 / 1) \u00d7 100 = 200. So, nominal GDP is $200, real GDP is $100, and price index is 200. This matches the formula Nominal GDP = Real GDP \u00d7 (Price Index / 100) \u2192 $200 = $100 \u00d7 (200 / 100).\n\nApplying the same logic to the problem, real GDP is $200 billion, price index is 200, so nominal GDP should be $200 billion \u00d7 2 = $400 billion.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. But just to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. Is there anything else that affects the relationship between real GDP and nominal GDP besides the price level? I don't think so. Real GDP adjusts for inflation, and nominal GDP does not. The price index captures the change in price level, so using that to adjust real GDP should give us nominal GDP.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the price index is not the GDP deflator, but another measure like the CPI (Consumer Price Index). However, in economics, when dealing with GDP, the GDP deflator is typically used to separate the effects of price changes from quantity changes.\n\nSuppose, for argument's sake, that the price index is the CPI instead of the GDP deflator. Would that change anything? Probably not, because in many cases, CPI and GDP deflator move similarly, and for the purpose of this problem, it might not make a difference. But to be precise, we should assume that the price index given is the GDP deflator.\n\nGiven that, my initial calculation stands: nominal GDP is $400 billion.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, A) $4 billion is way too low, C) $200 billion would be the real GDP, and D) $2 billion is also too low. Only B) $400 billion matches my calculation.\n\nI think I'm ready to select B) $400 billion as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
