The question wants to know the total number of sheets that the teacher puts into the cabinet.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the total number of sheets. I have 5 packages, each with 80 sheets. I think I need to multiply the number of packages by the number of sheets per package to get the total.\n\nSo, 5 packages times 80 sheets per package. Let me do that multiplication. 5 times 80 is 400. So, the total number of sheets should be 400.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 40\n\nB. 85\n\nC. 400\n\nD. 450\n\nSo, C. 400 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If I add 80 sheets five times, 80 plus 80 is 160, plus another 80 is 240, plus 80 is 320, plus 80 is 400. Yeah, that matches the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 5 times 80. I know that 5 times 8 is 40, so 5 times 80 should be 400.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other interpretation. The question says \"each package has 80 sheets,\" and \"5 packages,\" so it's straightforward multiplication.\n\nNo tricks here, it's a basic multiplication problem.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 400.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 400} \\]"
