The scenarios are:\n\n1. I graded my students based on how I felt about them personally.\n\n2. I threw knives at the other boxer during the fight.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: grading students based on personal feelings. In the US, education is supposed to be fair and objective. Teachers are expected to grade students based on their performance and achievements, not on personal likes or dislikes. So, if a teacher grades students based on personal feelings, that would be unfair to the students and go against educational standards. I think that's clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: throwing knives at another boxer during a fight. Boxing is a sport where\u62f3\u51fb\u624b follow specific rules and regulations for safety. Throwing knives introduces a whole new level of danger and violence that's not part of the sport. It could cause serious injury or even death. That seems extremely dangerous and against the rules of boxing. So, I think that's also morally wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe in some contexts, throwing knives could be acceptable? Like in professional wrestling or something where it's staged and controlled. But in an actual boxing match, that's not the case. So, no, that seems clearly wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that one of these scenarios might not be considered wrong?\n\nLet's consider Scenario 1 again. Maybe if the teacher really likes a student and thinks they deserve a higher grade, even if their performance wasn't perfect, some people might think that's okay. But overall, partiality in grading is frowned upon because it's unfair to other students who put in the effort and deserve grades based on their actual work. So, I still think it's wrong.\n\nScenario 2: throwing knives in a boxing match. That seems unequivocally wrong, as it endangers the other person's life and goes beyond the acceptable risks of the sport.\n\nSo, yeah, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
