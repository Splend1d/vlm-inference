                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out what feature ballad opera, opera buffa, and op\u00e9ra comique all share. I know that these are all types of operas, but they come from different places and periods. Ballad opera is English, opera buffa is Italian, and op\u00e9ra comique is French. So, they're all comic operas in their own ways, but I need to find a specific feature they share.\n\nOption A says they contained da capo arias. I think da capo arias are more associated with serious operas, like opera seria. I'm not sure if all three of these comic opera forms used da capo arias regularly. Maybe not.\n\nOption B says they began with a French overture. I know that French overtures are specific to French opera, like op\u00e9ra comique, but I don't think ballad opera or opera buffa necessarily started with French overtures. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption C says they focused on everyday problems. Hmm, that sounds plausible. Ballad opera often dealt with middle-class characters and everyday issues, opera buffa also featured ordinary people and their comedic situations, and op\u00e9ra comique similarly addressed lighter, more relatable topics. So, this seems like a common thread.\n\nOption D mentions obbligato recitative. I'm not entirely sure what that is, but I think recitatives are parts of operas where the singer basically speaks in melody, advancing the plot. Obbligato might mean that there's instrumental accompaniment involved. I don't know if all three opera forms used this specifically.\n\nLet me think again. The question is asking for a feature they shared. If I had to guess, I'd say it's that they all focused on everyday problems, as that seems to be a common element in comic operas across different cultures.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. They focused on everyday problems.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
