So, there's a husband and wife who are going on vacation for a month, and they decide to have new carpeting installed in their home while they're away. They contact a reputable carpeting company, which offers to do the job for $7,000. They agree, give the company a set of keys, and leave for their vacation.\n\nA week later, the carpeting company realizes they have too many jobs and not enough staff to finish all of them. So, they contact a workman they've used before and tell him about the job for the husband and wife. The workman agrees to do the installation in exchange for the $7,000 payment from the husband and wife.\n\nWhen the husband and wife return from vacation, they're happy with the work and send a check for $7,000 to the carpeting company, which deposits the check. Now, the question is, if the workman seeks to recover for the services he performed, whom can he recover from?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. recover against the husband and wife only.\n\nB. recover against the carpeting company only.\n\nC. recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company.\n\nD. not recover, because he was not in privity of contract.\n\nAlright, so first, I need to understand the relationships here. The husband and wife contracted with the carpeting company for $7,000. The carpeting company then subcontracted the work to the workman for the same amount.\n\nSo, the husband and wife have a contract with the carpeting company, and the carpeting company has a contract with the workman.\n\nNow, the husband and wife paid the carpeting company $7,000, and the carpeting company deposited the check.\n\nThe question is, can the workman recover from either party?\n\nLet me think about this in terms of contract law. Generally, in contract law, there's a principle called \"privity of contract,\" which means that only parties to a contract can enforce it or be bound by it.\n\nSo, the workman has a contract with the carpeting company, not directly with the husband and wife. Similarly, the husband and wife have a contract with the carpeting company, not directly with the workman.\n\nSo, under the traditional rule of privity, the workman shouldn't be able to sue the husband and wife because there's no direct contract between them.\n\nBut, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, in some jurisdictions, if a contractor subcontracts work, the subcontractor can have certain rights against the original contractor's client under certain circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, there might be equitable considerations. The workman performed the work, and the husband and wife benefited from it. It might not be fair for the husband and wife to keep the benefit without paying for it, especially if the carpeting company hasn't paid the workman.\n\nWait, but the husband and wife already paid the carpeting company. So, from their perspective, they've fulfilled their obligation.\n\nBut, if the carpeting company hasn't paid the workman, then the workman might have a claim against the carpeting company, but not directly against the husband and wife.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the workman can argue that he's a beneficiary of the contract between the husband and wife and the carpeting company.\n\nIn contract law, sometimes third parties can enforce contracts if they're intended beneficiaries.\n\nSo, maybe the workman could argue that he's an intended beneficiary of the contract between the husband and wife and the carpeting company.\n\nBut, in this case, it seems like the workman was a subcontractor, and the husband and wife didn't have any direct dealing with him.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the workman could sue the carpeting company for breach of contract if he performed the work and hasn't been paid.\n\nSo, let's consider the options one by one.\n\nOption A: recover against the husband and wife only.\n\nIs this possible? Well, as I thought earlier, under the privity rule, generally, only parties to a contract can enforce it. However, there are exceptions, like intended beneficiaries.\n\nBut in this scenario, it seems unlikely that the husband and wife intended to benefit the workman directly. Their contract was with the carpeting company.\n\nSo, probably, the workman can't recover directly from the husband and wife.\n\nOption B: recover against the carpeting company only.\n\nThis seems more plausible. The workman had a contract with the carpeting company to perform the work in exchange for $7,000. If the carpeting company hasn't paid him, then he can sue them for breach of contract.\n\nSo, this seems like a valid option.\n\nOption C: recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company.\n\nThis suggests that the workman has a choice of whom to sue.\n\nBut, based on what I've thought so far, he probably can't sue the husband and wife directly, unless there's a specific exception that applies here.\n\nOption D: not recover, because he was not in privity of contract.\n\nThis option suggests that due to the lack of privity, the workman can't recover from anyone.\n\nBut, considering that he has a contract with the carpeting company, he should be able to recover from them.\n\nSo, this seems incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the specific jurisdiction's rules on privity and third-party beneficiaries.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, subcontractors can have certain rights against the property owners under certain conditions.\n\nFor example, in some states, there are laws that allow subcontractors to file liens against the property if they haven't been paid by the general contractor.\n\nBut in this case, since the husband and wife already paid the carpeting company, perhaps such liens wouldn't apply.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps the workman could argue that there's quantum meruit or unjust enrichment, meaning that he provided services to the husband and wife, and they should pay him directly.\n\nBut, again, since the husband and wife already paid the carpeting company, it might be difficult for the workman to prevail on such a claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the workman could go after the carpeting company for the amount owed.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is option B: recover against the carpeting company only.\n\nBut let me think about this some more.\n\nSuppose the carpeting company goes bankrupt or doesn't have enough assets to pay the workman. Then, could the workman go after the husband and wife?\n\nIn some cases, if there's a breach by the contractor, and the subcontractor hasn't been paid, there might be ways for the subcontractor to seek payment from the property owner.\n\nBut again, in this scenario, the husband and wife already paid the contractor in full.\n\nSo, it seems like the workman's only recourse is against the carpeting company.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider option C: recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company.\n\nThis would imply that the workman has a choice, which might not be the case here.\n\nGiven that the workman only has a contract with the carpeting company, and no direct contract with the husband and wife, it's unlikely that he can recover from the husband and wife.\n\nTherefore, option C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says the workman cannot recover because of lack of privity, but that doesn't account for the workman's contract with the carpeting company.\n\nSo, that seems incorrect as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: recover against the carpeting company only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nB) recover against the carpeting company only."
