                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this businessman who owned a nice lake and some woods, and in 1980, he gave this land to the state, but with a condition that it should only be used for recreational purposes. Then, two years later, the state decided to build a small industrial park on a corner of this land, which is against the condition that was set. Now, the businessman is saying that because the state violated the condition, the land should go back to him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what kind of interest was created by this conveyance. There are a few options here: a reverter, a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, or maybe it's an indefeasible estate.\n\nLet's start by understanding what each of these means.\n\nA reverter is a future interest that automatically returns the property to the grantor when a certain condition occurs. So, if the condition is violated, the property automatically goes back to the original owner without any action needed from them.\n\nA fee simple subject to a condition subsequent is similar, but it requires the grantor to take some affirmative action to reclaim the property once the condition is violated. It doesn't happen automatically.\n\nA fee simple subject to an executory limitation is a bit different. In this case, if the condition is violated, the property goes to a third party, not back to the original owner.\n\nAnd an indefeasible estate is one that can't be taken away once it's granted, regardless of any conditions.\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, the businessman conveyed the land \"on the condition that\" it be used as recreational property only. The key phrase here is \"on the condition that,\" which often suggests a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.\n\nBut I need to confirm this. In a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, the grantor has the right to reclaim the property if the condition is violated, but they have to take affirmative steps to do so. It doesn't happen automatically.\n\nOn the other hand, a reverter does happen automatically upon the condition being violated.\n\nSo, which one applies here?\n\nI think it's important to look at the language used in the conveyance. The phrase \"on the condition that\" typically indicates a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, which requires the grantor to take action to reclaim the property.\n\nIf it were a reverter, the language might be something like \"so long as\" or \"provided that.\"\n\nBut in this case, it's \"on the condition that,\" which suggests a condition subsequent.\n\nMoreover, in a reverter, the property automatically reverts back to the grantor without any action needed, whereas in a condition subsequent, the grantor must take some action, like serving notice or bringing a legal action.\n\nIn this scenario, the businessman is notifying the state that he's taking possession back. This sounds like he's exercising his right of entry after the condition has been violated.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems correct: the interest created is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and the original owner can get the property back only by taking affirmative steps to exercise his right of entry.\n\nOption A says it's a reverter, which would mean the property automatically reverts back without any action from the grantor, but that doesn't match the scenario where the businessman has to notify the state to reclaim the property.\n\nOption C mentions a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, but in this case, the property would go to a third party upon the condition being violated, not back to the original owner. But here, the businessman wants the property back, not to have it go to someone else.\n\nOption D suggests it's an indefeasible estate, meaning the condition can't be enforced, but that doesn't seem to fit here. There's no indication that the condition is against public policy or unenforceable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: the interest created is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and the original owner can get the property back only by taking affirmative steps to exercise his right of entry.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
