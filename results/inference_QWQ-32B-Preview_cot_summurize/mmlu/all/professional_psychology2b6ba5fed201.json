                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about age discrimination in the context of firing an employee. It's a pretty important topic, especially for psychologists who might be involved in organizational consulting or dealing with employees' mental health issues related to such decisions.\n\nSo, the question is: In order to deal with the legal issue of age discrimination, it is important for the psychologist to know that, with regard to the firing of an employee, evidence of age discrimination exists\n\nAnd then there are four options:\n\nA. only when company policy reflects adverse impact on older workers\n\nB. whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing\n\nC. whenever the affected employee can demonstrate substantial economic loss\n\nD. only when the majority of employees in a given age group are adversely affected economically\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, age discrimination typically refers to treating someone less favorably because of their age. In the workplace, this can manifest in various ways, including hiring, promotions, and, importantly, terminations.\n\nOption A says: only when company policy reflects adverse impact on older workers.\n\nThis seems to suggest that for age discrimination to be evident, there needs to be a policy in place that directly or indirectly harms older workers. While company policies can certainly contribute to age discrimination, it might not cover all instances where an individual is fired based on age. So, this seems a bit narrow.\n\nOption B: whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing.\n\nThis option points directly to the motive behind the firing decision. If the decision is based on the employee's age rather than their job performance, that sounds like direct evidence of age discrimination. This seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption C: whenever the affected employee can demonstrate substantial economic loss.\n\nEconomic loss is certainly a consequence of being fired, but it's not directly related to whether the firing was discriminatory. An employee can suffer economic loss from being fired for legitimate reasons, so this doesn't necessarily indicate discrimination.\n\nOption D: only when the majority of employees in a given age group are adversely affected economically.\n\nThis seems to suggest that discrimination only occurs if there's a pattern affecting a large number of employees in the same age group. While patterns of discrimination are certainly a concern, individual cases of age discrimination can still occur even if only one employee is affected.\n\nConsidering these points, option B appears to be the most direct and accurate description of when evidence of age discrimination exists in the context of firing an employee. It focuses on the basis for the firing decision, which is crucial in determining whether discrimination has occurred.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in real legal scenarios, proving discrimination can be complex and may require additional evidence beyond just the basis for the firing decision. Factors such as the employer's intentions, any discriminatory statements made, and comparative treatment of similarly situated employees can all play a role.\n\nFor a psychologist involved in such issues, understanding the legal standards for age discrimination is important, but so is considering the psychological impact on the affected employee and potentially on other employees who may witness such decisions.\n\nMoreover, psychologists can play a role in educating organizations about the dangers of age discrimination, not just legally but also in terms of morale, productivity, and overall organizational health.\n\nIn summary, while option B seems to be the correct answer based on the question, the broader context of age discrimination in the workplace is multifaceted and requires a comprehensive approach to address effectively.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
