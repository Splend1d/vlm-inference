                    "text": "Let's see. The bank is trying to decide between two queue systems: one where there's a single line for all tellers, and another where each teller has their own line. They want to pick the option that minimizes customer wait time, and they're planning to use a computer simulation to compare these two options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a simulation is in this context. A simulation is like a virtual model of the real-world system. It allows the bank to test different scenarios without actually implementing them and potentially causing inconvenience to customers. So, option B says that the bank can use the simulation to investigate these two options without causing inconvenience for customers. That seems true.\n\nNow, option A says that the bank can incorporate other factors, such as the number of tellers, in the simulation. That makes sense because in a simulation, you can adjust various parameters to see how they affect the outcome. So, if the bank wants to see how having more or fewer tellers impacts wait times under each queue system, they can do that in the simulation. So, A seems true as well.\n\nOption C says that the bank may consider new alternatives based on the simulation results. Well, simulations can provide insights that might lead to considering other options that weren't initially thought of. For example, maybe they'll consider having some tellers handle only certain types of transactions, or maybe implement a hybrid system. So, C also seems plausible.\n\nOption D states that the simulation will not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available. Hmm, this is interesting. Simulations often rely on data to model real-world behavior accurately. However, even without actual customer data, the bank can make assumptions based on industry standards, similar banks, or general knowledge about customer behavior. They can run the simulation with estimated parameters and still get relative comparisons between the two options. So, while actual data would improve the accuracy of the simulation, lacking it doesn't necessarily mean the simulation is useless.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking which of these options is NOT true about the bank's plan. So, I need to pick the statement that is incorrect.\n\nLet me review:\n\n- A: Can incorporate other factors like the number of tellers. That seems true.\n\n- B: Can investigate options without inconveniencing customers. True.\n\n- C: May consider new alternatives based on results. True.\n\n- D: Simulation won't produce usable results without actual customer data. Is this necessarily false?\n\nWell, simulations can be useful even with estimated data, but perhaps in some cases, without actual data, the results might not be reliable enough to make a decision. But in general, simulations are designed to provide insights even with assumptions.\n\nBut the key here is that the statement says \"will not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available.\" That's pretty absolute. In reality, simulations can still produce usable results without actual customer data, especially if reasonable assumptions are made.\n\nSo, perhaps D is the incorrect statement.\n\nWait, but is it possible that without actual customer data, the simulation might not be entirely accurate, but still provide some value? Yes, that's likely.\n\nTherefore, saying that the simulation will not produce usable results solely because actual customer data are not available might not be true. Hence, D could be the answer.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe the bank has some historical data from similar banks or general queuing theory data that they can use to approximate customer behavior. In that case, even without their own actual customer data, they can still run a meaningful simulation.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that D is the statement that is not necessarily true about the bank's plan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
