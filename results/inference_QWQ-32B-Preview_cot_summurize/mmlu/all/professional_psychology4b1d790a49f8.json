                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about brain development at birth. The question is: \"At birth, the least developed part of the brain is the...\" and then it gives options: A. visual system, B. cortex, C. brain stem, D. cerebellum.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which part of the brain is not fully developed when a baby is born. I know that human brains develop at different rates, and some parts are more mature than others at birth.\n\nLet me start by recalling what I know about each of these parts:\n\nA. Visual system: I think the visual system is somewhat developed at birth, but not fully. Babies can see, but their vision improves over the first year.\n\nB. Cortex: That's the outer layer of the brain, involved in higher functions like thinking and processing sensory information.\n\nC. Brain stem: This is more primitive and controls basic functions like breathing and heart rate. I think this is fairly developed at birth.\n\nD. Cerebellum: That's involved in motor control and coordination. I'm not sure about its development at birth.\n\nHmm. Maybe the cortex is the least developed because it's where a lot of learning and complex processing happens, and babies have a lot to learn after they're born.\n\nI remember that the brain develops in a certain order, with more primitive structures developing earlier, and higher functions developing later.\n\nSo, the brain stem is probably well-developed at birth because it handles essential functions that are necessary right away.\n\nThe cerebellum might also be somewhat developed, but perhaps not fully.\n\nThe visual system is functional at birth, but it certainly improves over time.\n\nComparing all these, I think the cortex is the least developed at birth because it has a lot of growth and maturation that happens after birth, especially in response to experiences and environmental stimuli.\n\nI recall that neural connections in the cortex increase dramatically in the first few years of life.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is B, the cortex.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look it up or think more about it.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\nA. Visual system: Babies can see, but their vision is not as sharp as adults', and they prefer high-contrast images. So, it's developing, but not fully mature.\n\nB. Cortex: This is where a lot of higher-order processing happens, and it's known that the cortex continues to develop well into childhood and even adolescence.\n\nC. Brain stem: This controls vital functions like breathing and heart rate, which need to be functioning right from birth. So, it should be fairly developed.\n\nD. Cerebellum: This is important for motor control, and while babies are not very coordinated at birth, the cerebellum is present, just not fully mature.\n\nComparing all these, the cortex seems to be the least developed at birth because it has the most growth and specialization that occurs after birth.\n\nAlso, I think the cortex is more susceptible to environmental influences, which suggests that its development continues beyond birth.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B, the cortex.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I should consider some facts about brain development.\n\nI know that the brain triples in size in the first few years of life, and most of that growth is in the cortex.\n\nAlso, processes like synaptic pruning and myelination continue for many years in the cortex.\n\nIn contrast, the brain stem is largely mature at birth.\n\nThe cerebellum also undergoes significant development after birth, but perhaps not as much as the cortex.\n\nThe visual system is functional at birth, but visual acuity and depth perception develop over the first year.\n\nTherefore, overall, the cortex seems to be the least developed at birth.\n\nI feel confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
