Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and \"The Palace\" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they \"lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied.\"\n\u2014Henry Adams, History of the United States During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson, 1889\nAlthough Jefferson believed that government should be small and limited, once in office he\n\nA. created a spoils system that bloated the size of the bureaucracy\nB. laid the foundations of the welfare state\nC. called for an ambitious program of road building and public works\nD. vigorously exercised federal power in foreign affairs\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Thomas Jefferson. So, the passage is from Henry Adams' book about Jefferson's presidency, and it describes Jefferson's physical appearance and his role in society during his time in office. It says that even though Jefferson believed in small government, once in office, he did certain things that seemed to contradict that belief.\n\nThe question is: \"Although Jefferson believed that government should be small and limited, once in office he\"\n\nAnd then there are four options:\n\nA. created a spoils system that bloated the size of the bureaucracy\n\nB. laid the foundations of the welfare state\n\nC. called for an ambitious program of road building and public works\n\nD. vigorously exercised federal power in foreign affairs\n\nI need to figure out which of these options best describes what Jefferson did while in office that might contradict his small government beliefs.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Jefferson's political philosophy was. Jefferson was a Democratic-Republican, and he generally believed in minimal government intervention in people's lives. He favored agriculture and the common man over industry and aristocracy. He also valued individual liberty and states' rights.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: created a spoils system that bloated the size of the bureaucracy.\n\nI think the spoils system is when political appointments are given as rewards for political support, rather than based on merit. I'm not sure if Jefferson is directly associated with creating the spoils system. I think that might be more associated with Andrew Jackson later on. So, maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B: laid the foundations of the welfare state.\n\nThe welfare state is a system in which the government plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of its citizens. Jefferson was against big government and preferred a limited federal role, so it seems unlikely that he laid the foundations of the welfare state. In fact, the welfare state really started developing in the 20th century with programs like Social Security. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C: called for an ambitious program of road building and public works.\n\nHmm, Jefferson did support internal improvements to some extent, like building roads and canals, but I'm not sure if it was an \"ambitious program.\" I think his views on this were somewhat limited because he believed that infrastructure should be left to the states or private sector. However, during his presidency, he did authorize the construction of the National Road, which was a significant public works project. So, maybe this is a possible answer.\n\nOption D: vigorously exercised federal power in foreign affairs.\n\nThis is interesting. Jefferson was known for his diplomatic skills and his approach to foreign affairs. One major event during his presidency was the Louisiana Purchase, where he acquired a vast territory from France, doubling the size of the United States. This was a significant exercise of federal power in foreign affairs. Also, he dealt with issues like piracy in the Mediterranean and imposed an embargo to avoid war with Europe. So, this seems like a strong candidate for an action that might contradict his small government stance.\n\nWait a minute, but in the case of the Louisiana Purchase, although it was a bold move in foreign affairs, it could also be seen as consistent with his goal of expanding American territory and opportunities for farmers, which aligned with his agrarian ideals. So, maybe it's not entirely contradictory.\n\nSimilarly, the Embargo Act of 1807, which restricted American ships from trading with foreign nations, was a major exercise of federal power, but it was done to preserve American neutrality and avoid war. Again, it might not directly contradict his small government beliefs, as he might have seen it as a necessary measure for national security.\n\nOn the other hand, his approach to foreign affairs did involve assertive use of federal power, which some might see as expanding the role of the government beyond what Jefferson originally advocated.\n\nComparing options C and D, road building is more directly related to government spending and expanding the bureaucracy, which could contradict his small government ideals. However, in reality, Jefferson was somewhat frugal in his domestic spending and reduced the size of the government in some areas.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the answer is that Jefferson, despite his small government rhetoric, actually expanded federal power in certain areas when he was in office.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Spoils system: Not sure if he created it.\n\nB. Welfare state: Doesn't fit.\n\nC. Road building: He did support some infrastructure projects.\n\nD. Foreign affairs: He exercised significant federal power in this area.\n\nI think option D is the best answer because it highlights a area where Jefferson actively used federal power in a way that might not align with his small government principles.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that Jefferson was criticized by some of his political opponents, like the Federalists, for expanding federal power beyond what was intended by the Constitution. So, it makes sense that he might have done things in office that contradicted his earlier beliefs about small government.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option D: vigorously exercised federal power in foreign affairs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
