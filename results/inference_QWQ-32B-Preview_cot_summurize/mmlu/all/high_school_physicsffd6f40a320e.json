                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about fluid flow in a pipe. The pipe has different diameters at different points, and I need to find out the flow speed at a point where the diameter is 3 cm, given that at another point where the diameter is 2 cm, the flow speed is 18 m/s. The flow rate is constant throughout the pipe.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the continuity equation, which relates the flow speed and the cross-sectional area of the pipe. The continuity equation for incompressible fluids states that the product of the cross-sectional area and the flow speed is constant at all points in the pipe. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) are the cross-sectional areas at points 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n- \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) are the flow speeds at points 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nSince the pipe has circular cross-sections, the area \\( A \\) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the pipe. The radius is half of the diameter, so:\n\n- At the first point, diameter \\( d_1 = 2 \\) cm, so radius \\( r_1 = 1 \\) cm.\n\n- At the second point, diameter \\( d_2 = 3 \\) cm, so radius \\( r_2 = 1.5 \\) cm.\n\nNow, I can express the areas as:\n\n\\[ A_1 = \\pi (1 \\, \\text{cm})^2 = \\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\]\n\n\\[ A_2 = \\pi (1.5 \\, \\text{cm})^2 = 2.25\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\]\n\nGiven that the flow speed at the first point \\( v_1 = 18 \\) m/s, I need to find \\( v_2 \\).\n\nUsing the continuity equation:\n\n\\[ A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2 \\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[ \\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\times 18 \\, \\text{m/s} = 2.25\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\times v_2 \\]\n\nI can cancel out \\( \\pi \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 18 \\, \\text{m/s} = 2.25 \\times v_2 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( v_2 \\):\n\n\\[ v_2 = \\frac{18 \\, \\text{m/s}}{2.25} \\]\n\n\\[ v_2 = 8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nSo, the flow speed at the point where the diameter is 3 cm is 8 m/s.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the areas:\n\n- \\( A_1 = \\pi (1)^2 = \\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\)\n\n- \\( A_2 = \\pi (1.5)^2 = 2.25\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\)\n\nContinuity equation:\n\n\\[ A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\pi \\times 18 = 2.25\\pi \\times v_2 \\]\n\nCancel \\( \\pi \\):\n\n\\[ 18 = 2.25 v_2 \\]\n\n\\[ v_2 = \\frac{18}{2.25} = 8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the relationship between the diameters and the flow speeds. Since the area is proportional to the square of the radius (or diameter), and the flow speed is inversely proportional to the area, the flow speed should be inversely proportional to the square of the diameter.\n\nSo, \\( v_2 = v_1 \\times \\left( \\frac{d_1}{d_2} \\right)^2 \\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ v_2 = 18 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ v_2 = 18 \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{9} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ v_2 = 18 \\times 0.444\\ldots \\]\n\n\\[ v_2 = 8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 8 m/s, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8 \\, \\text{m/s}} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
