It is also found in the exoskeletons of arthropods like insects and crustaceans.\n\nLet me explain why the other options are not correct:\n\n- Silica: Some plants, especially in the genus Diatom, have cell walls reinforced with silica, but fungi do not use silica for their cell walls.\n\n- Lignin: This is a complex organic polymer that strengthens the secondary cell walls of plants, particularly in vascular tissue. Fungi do not contain lignin.\n\n- Collagen fibers: These are proteins that provide structure and support in animal tissues, such as skin, bone, and connective tissue. Fungi do not have collagen in their cell walls.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Chitin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
