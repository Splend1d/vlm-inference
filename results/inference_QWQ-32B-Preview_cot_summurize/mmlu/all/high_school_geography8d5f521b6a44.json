So, first, I should understand what typically defines a city in a developing country.\n\nI know that developing countries are often characterized by lower levels of industrialization and lower incomes compared to developed countries. But within these countries, cities can still have certain features that are common in urban areas worldwide.\n\nOption A says \"Contains modern centers of commerce.\" Hmm, I think even in developing countries, cities might have modern business districts or areas where commerce is thriving. For example, cities like Mumbai or Shanghai have skyscrapers and modern financial districts. So, that seems like something they do have.\n\nOption B is \"Has a well-developed infrastructure.\" Now, infrastructure can vary a lot in developing countries. While some cities might have good roads, public transportation, and utilities, others might struggle with these aspects. So, this one is a bit tricky. Maybe not all cities in developing countries have a well-developed infrastructure.\n\nOption C is \"Experiences large in-migrations of rural people into the city.\" I recall that in developing countries, there's often a phenomenon called rural-urban migration, where people move from the countryside to cities in search of better opportunities. This leads to the growth of urban areas and sometimes to issues like slums and overpopulation. So, this seems like a common characteristic.\n\nOption D says \"Produces a large share of its country's GDI.\" GDI stands for Gross Domestic Income, I believe, which is similar to GDP but includes net income from abroad. In many countries, whether developed or developing, cities tend to be the economic engines, producing a significant portion of the country's income. So, that makes sense.\n\nNow, considering all these options, I need to pick the one that is NOT a characteristic. Option A seems plausible, as cities in developing countries can have modern commerce centers. Option C is probably true due to rural-urban migration. Option D makes sense because cities drive economic activity.\n\nOption B says \"Has a well-developed infrastructure.\" While many cities in developing countries are making strides in infrastructure development, it's possible that not all of them have a well-developed infrastructure. In fact, infrastructure challenges are often more pronounced in developing countries.\n\nComparing all the options, I think Option B is the one that might not always hold true for cities in developing countries. While some cities may have good infrastructure, others may not. Whereas the other options seem more universally applicable to cities in developing countries.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. Has a well-developed infrastructure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
