The scenarios are:\n\n1. I went to the pool in my bathing suit.\n\n2. I left my trash after the picnic in the park.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Going to the pool in a bathing suit. That seems pretty normal, right? When you go to a pool, you wear a bathing suit. I can't think of any moral issue with that. It's what you're supposed to do. So, I think this one is not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Leaving trash after a picnic in the park. Hmm, that doesn't sound good. Littering is generally considered bad. It's not taking care of the environment, and it's disrespectful to others who might want to enjoy the park. Plus, there are often rules against littering in public places. So, this seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe it's not always wrong. What if there were no trash cans around, and it's a matter of finding a proper place to dispose of the trash? But in general, if there are facilities provided, you should use them. And even if there aren't, you should take your trash with you and dispose of it properly later.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, leaving trash behind would be considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is not wrong, and the second one is wrong. That would be option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing about the first scenario. Is there any circumstance where wearing a bathing suit to a pool could be morally wrong? Maybe if it's inappropriate or offensive, but assuming it's a standard bathing suit, it should be fine.\n\nAnd for the second scenario, is there any argument for why leaving trash might not be wrong? Perhaps if it's biodegradable or something, but even then, it's usually expected that you clean up after yourself.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct answer: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
