                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a race car trying to jump over eight buses by accelerating down a 50-meter track and reaching a speed of 130 km/h. I need to figure out how quickly the car must accelerate to reach that speed in that distance. The options are A. 13 m/s\u00b2, B. 26 m/s\u00b2, C. 7 m/s\u00b2, and D. 17 m/s\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand all the parts of the problem. The car starts from rest, I assume, and accelerates uniformly down a 50-meter track to reach 130 km/h. I need to find the acceleration required to do that.\n\nI should probably use one of the kinematic equations for uniformly accelerated motion. The one that comes to mind is:\n\nv\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as\n\nWhere:\n\n- v is the final velocity\n\n- u is the initial velocity\n\n- a is the acceleration\n\n- s is the distance\n\nGiven that the car starts from rest, the initial velocity u should be 0 m/s. The distance s is 50 meters, and the final velocity is 130 km/h. But wait, I need to make sure all units are consistent. km/h needs to be converted to m/s.\n\nTo convert km/h to m/s, I can use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 m / 3600 s = 5/18 m/s.\n\nSo, 130 km/h = 130 * (5/18) m/s = (130 * 5)/18 m/s = 650/18 m/s \u2248 36.11 m/s.\n\nNow, plugging into the equation:\n\nv\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as\n\n(36.11)\u00b2 = 0\u00b2 + 2 * a * 50\n\n1303.21 = 0 + 100a\n\n1303.21 = 100a\n\na = 1303.21 / 100\n\na \u2248 13.03 m/s\u00b2\n\nLooking at the options, A is 13 m/s\u00b2, which is closest to my calculation. But let me double-check my conversion and calculations to be sure.\n\nConverting 130 km/h to m/s:\n\n130 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 130 * (1000/3600) = 130 * (5/18) = 650/18 \u2248 36.11 m/s. That seems correct.\n\nUsing the equation v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as:\n\nv = 36.11 m/s\n\nu = 0 m/s\n\ns = 50 m\n\nSo, (36.11)\u00b2 = 0 + 2 * a * 50\n\n1303.21 = 100a\n\na = 13.0321 m/s\u00b2\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, that's 13 m/s\u00b2, which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut wait, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the equation:\n\ns = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2\n\nSince u = 0, this simplifies to:\n\ns = (1/2)at\u00b2\n\nAnd we know that v = u + at, which with u = 0 becomes v = at, so t = v/a.\n\nSubstituting t into the first equation:\n\ns = (1/2)a*(v/a)\u00b2 = (1/2)a*(v\u00b2/a\u00b2) = (1/2)(v\u00b2/a)\n\nRearranging for a:\n\na = (1/2)(v\u00b2/s)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's double-check that step.\n\nStarting from s = (1/2)at\u00b2 and t = v/a,\n\ns = (1/2)a*(v/a)\u00b2 = (1/2)a*(v\u00b2/a\u00b2) = (1/2)(v\u00b2/a)\n\nThen, a = (1/2)(v\u00b2/s)\n\nWait, that can't be right because acceleration can't be inversely proportional to distance in this context. Let's see, the correct derivation should be:\n\ns = (1/2)at\u00b2\n\nt = v/a\n\nSo, s = (1/2)a*(v/a)\u00b2 = (1/2)(v\u00b2/a)\n\nTherefore, a = v\u00b2/(2s)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a = (36.11)\u00b2 / (2 * 50) = 1303.21 / 100 = 13.0321 m/s\u00b2\n\nAgain, that's approximately 13 m/s\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the average velocity formula.\n\nIf the car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly to v, the average velocity is v/2.\n\nThe time t to cover the distance s is t = s / (average velocity) = s / (v/2) = 2s/v\n\nThen, using v = u + at, with u = 0:\n\nv = 0 + a*t => a = v/t = v / (2s/v) = v\u00b2 / (2s)\n\nAgain, a = v\u00b2 / (2s) = (36.11)\u00b2 / (2*50) = 1303.21 / 100 = 13.0321 m/s\u00b2\n\nConsistently getting the same result confirms that the required acceleration is approximately 13 m/s\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 13 m/s\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
