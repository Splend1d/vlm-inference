                    "text": "So here's this scenario with Mort and Tony. Mort owns a property with a rental home, and there's a concrete driveway between the two houses that's entirely on Mort's side of the property line. Tony has been using this driveway for 25 years, and during that time, there were three different owners who bought and sold Mort's house. Now, Mort's appraiser found an old survey that shows the accurate property boundaries, and Mort is upset about this. So, he files a suit against Tony for trespass.\n\nWe need to figure out what the likely result of this lawsuit will be, and there are four options:\n\nA. Mort will prevail in an action for trespass because Tony's use wasn't \"hostile.\"\n\nB. Mort will prevail because Tony's use wasn't \"open and notorious,\" since it was not widely known that he was on Mort's property.\n\nC. Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period.\n\nD. Tony will prevail because the easement was due to necessity.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, trespass is basically unauthorized entry onto someone's property. So, if Tony is using the driveway without Mort's permission, that could be considered trespassing.\n\nBut here, Tony has been using the driveway for 25 years, and it's been like that through three different owners of Mort's property. That suggests that perhaps there's some sort of established use going on here.\n\nNow, option A says that Mort will prevail because Tony's use wasn't \"hostile.\" In property law, \"hostility\" in the context of adverse possession or easements doesn't mean violence or animosity; it means without the owner's permission. So, if Tony was using the driveway with Mort's permission, it wouldn't be hostile, and therefore might not constitute adverse possession or an easement by prescription.\n\nBut in this case, it seems like Tony has been using the driveway for a long time, and perhaps without Mort's permission, since now Mort is suing for trespass. So, maybe the use was hostile. But I need to think carefully here.\n\nOption B says that Mort will prevail because Tony's use wasn't \"open and notorious.\" \"Open and notorious\" use is a requirement for adverse possession or easements by prescription, meaning the use must be obvious and known to others. In this case, it's a driveway that's been in use for 25 years; it's concrete, so it's not exactly hidden. It's between the two houses, and it's entirely on Mort's side of the property line.\n\nSo, it seems like Tony's use was open and notorious because it's a visible driveway that's been in use for a long time. People would know about it. So, option B doesn't seem likely.\n\nOption C says that Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period. This sounds like it's referring to easements by prescription. An easement by prescription is similar to adverse possession but for a right to use part of someone's property.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, to establish an easement by prescription, you need to use the property in a way that is open, notorious, continuous, and without permission for a certain statutory period. In this case, Tony has been using the driveway for 25 years, which is likely longer than the statutory period in most places.\n\nSo, if Tony can prove that he used the driveway openly, notoriously, continuously, and without permission for the required time, he might be able to establish an easement by prescription.\n\nOption D says that Tony will prevail because the easement was due to necessity. An easement by necessity is different; it's established when there's a legal necessity to use a particular path or area of someone's property, usually for access to a landlocked property.\n\nIn this case, there's no mention that Tony's property is landlocked or that he has no other way to access his property except through this driveway. So, it doesn't seem like there's a necessity here.\n\nTherefore, option D is probably not the correct answer.\n\nGiven that, option C seems more plausible. Tony has been using the driveway for 25 years, which is likely beyond the statutory period required for an easement by prescription.\n\nBut let's think about the current situation. Mort is suing for trespass, which suggests that Mort is asserting his right to exclusive use of his property and that Tony's use is unauthorized.\n\nHowever, Tony has a long history of using the driveway, and if he can establish that his use was continuous, open, notorious, and without permission for the statutory period, he might be able to claim an easement by prescription.\n\nSo, in that case, Tony would prevail because he has established an easement through his long-term use.\n\nOption A seems incorrect because, in adverse possession or easement by prescription, the use needs to be hostile, meaning without permission. If Tony was using the driveway without permission, that would actually support his claim, not hurt it.\n\nOption B is also unlikely because the use was open and notorious, as it's a concrete driveway that's been in use for 25 years.\n\nTherefore, the likely result is that Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
