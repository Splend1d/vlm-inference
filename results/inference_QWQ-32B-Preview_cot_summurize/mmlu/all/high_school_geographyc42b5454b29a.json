                    "text": "I think the answer is A. It targeted crops Africans don't grow and eat. The Green Revolution focused a lot on wheat and rice, which are major crops in Asia and Latin America, but in Africa, people largely depend on crops like maize, cassava, and sorghum. So, the technologies and techniques developed during the Green Revolution weren't directly applicable to African agriculture.\n\nOption B, It required sophisticated machinery, might also be a factor because many African farmers are smallholders who can't afford expensive machinery. But I think the main issue was that the crops targeted weren't the ones Africans primarily grow and consume.\n\nOption C, Population growth has fallen so drastically that Africans don't need increased food production, doesn't make sense because Africa still has one of the highest population growth rates in the world, and there's still a need for increased food production.\n\nOption D, African agricultural production went up without its help, isn't accurate because while there have been improvements in some areas, overall, Africa hasn't seen the same level of agricultural productivity increases as other regions that adopted Green Revolution technologies.\n\nSo, I believe the primary reason the Green Revolution didn't help Africa much was that it targeted crops that aren't central to African diets and agriculture.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
