According to the problem, the sides of the square are the same length as the radius of a circle with a circumference of \\(12\\pi\\) units.\n\nLet's start by finding the radius of the circle. The formula for the circumference \\(C\\) of a circle is:\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius. We are given that \\(C = 12\\pi\\), so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n2\\pi r = 12\\pi\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(r\\), we can divide both sides of the equation by \\(2\\pi\\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{12\\pi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the radius of the circle is 6 units, this means each side of the square is also 6 units long.\n\nNext, we need to find the area \\(A\\) of the square. The formula for the area of a square is:\n\n\\[\nA = s^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(s\\) is the length of a side. Substituting \\(s = 6\\) units:\n\n\\[\nA = 6^2 = 36 \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is 36 square units.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 10\n\nB. 11\n\nC. 12\n\nD. 36\n\nThe correct answer is D. 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
