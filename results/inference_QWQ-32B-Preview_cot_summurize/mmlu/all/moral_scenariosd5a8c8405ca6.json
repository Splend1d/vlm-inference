So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I spread fertilizer all over my neighbor's vegetable garden.\" Hmm, spreading fertilizer\u2014usually, fertilizer is used to help plants grow, right? But in this case, it's being spread all over the neighbor's vegetable garden without their permission, I assume. That seems like trespassing and potentially damaging their garden, especially if the fertilizer is not suitable for their plants or if it's applied in excessive amounts. So, that sounds like a bad thing to do without asking the neighbor first.\n\nSecond, Scenario 2: \"I got leftovers because I could not finish my supper.\" This seems pretty normal. People often have leftover food if they can't finish everything they've been served. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. It's just managing portion sizes or saving food for later.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong because it involves potentially harming someone else's property without their consent, while Scenario 2 is just a routine situation of having leftover food.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing about Scenario 2. Let's see. If someone is getting leftovers because they can't finish their supper, that's pretty standard. It's not like they're wasting food or anything; in fact, they're saving it for later. So, no, that doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, though, spreading fertilizer on someone else's garden without their knowledge could be seen as intrusive and potentially harmful. It's similar to going onto someone's property and altering it without their permission, which is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
