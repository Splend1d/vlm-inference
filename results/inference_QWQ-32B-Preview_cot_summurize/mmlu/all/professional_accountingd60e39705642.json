Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: They can be issued by firms.\n\nWell, both equity and bonds are issued by firms to raise capital. Equity represents ownership in the firm, while bonds are debt instruments. So, firms issue both equity and bonds. Therefore, this statement is true for both, which means it's not the answer I'm looking for.\n\nOption B: Their payouts (i.e., dividend or coupons) are made after corporation tax has already been deducted.\n\nHmm, this is interesting. For bonds, the interest payments (coupons) are typically tax-deductible for the firm before tax is calculated. So, the firm pays the coupons and then deducts that expense when calculating its taxable income. Therefore, the coupons are paid before tax is deducted.\n\nFor equity, dividends are paid out of the firm's after-tax profits. So, the firm pays its taxes first and then distributes the remaining earnings to shareholders as dividends. Therefore, dividends are paid after tax has been deducted.\n\nSo, statement B is true for equity but not for bonds.\n\nOption C: Their payouts (i.e., dividends or coupons) are made before corporation tax has been deducted.\n\nAs I just thought about option B, I recall that for bonds, the interest payments are tax-deductible before tax is calculated. So, the firm pays the coupons and then deducts that amount from its income before calculating taxes. Therefore, for bonds, payouts are made before tax is deducted.\n\nFor equity, as mentioned earlier, dividends are paid after tax has been deducted from the profits.\n\nSo, statement C is true for bonds but not for equity.\n\nOption D: They can be traded on the secondary market.\n\nBoth equity and bonds can be traded on secondary markets. Stocks are traded on stock exchanges, and bonds are traded in the bond market. So, this statement is true for both, which means it's not the answer I'm looking for.\n\nWait a minute, option B seems to be the correct answer because it's true for equity but not for bonds. Let me double-check.\n\nEquity: Dividends are paid after tax.\n\nBonds: Coupons are paid before tax (since interest is tax-deductible).\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer should be option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
