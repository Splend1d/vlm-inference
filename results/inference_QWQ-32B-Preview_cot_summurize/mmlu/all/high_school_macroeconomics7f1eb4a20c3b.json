So, it's about how often GDP is calculated and which agency does it.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what GDP is. GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is a measure of the economic activity of a country. It's basically the total value of all goods and services produced in a country over a specific period.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the frequency of GDP calculations and which agency is responsible for it.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. quarter; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nB. week; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nC. month; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nD. month; The Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nI know that GDP is not calculated on a weekly basis. That seems too frequent and probably not practical for such a comprehensive measure. So, option B might not be correct.\n\nBetween options A, C, and D, I think GDP is calculated quarterly. I remember hearing about quarterly GDP reports. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, GDP is typically calculated on a quarterly basis, meaning every three months. So, option A seems plausible.\n\nNow, about the agency. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is part of the United States Department of Commerce, and it's responsible for calculating GDP, among other economic indicators.\n\nOption D mentions the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is another government agency that deals with labor market statistics, like unemployment rates and inflation, but not GDP.\n\nSo, based on that, option A seems correct: GDP is calculated quarterly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe GDP is also calculated monthly or annually.\n\nI know that annual GDP is important, but the quarterly reports are significant because they give a more frequent update on the economy's performance.\n\nAlso, sometimes there are advance estimates and revisions to the GDP numbers based on more complete data.\n\nBut the primary frequency is quarterly.\n\nSo, to confirm, I can think about news reports or economic data releases. I recall that GDP data is released once every quarter, with preliminary estimates and then revisions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A: quarter; The Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nOption C is monthly, which is too frequent for GDP calculations.\n\nOption D is monthly and mentions the wrong agency.\n\nSo, A is the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
