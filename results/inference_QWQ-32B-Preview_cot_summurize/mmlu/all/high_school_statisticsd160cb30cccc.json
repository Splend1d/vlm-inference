In this case, H0: \u03bc = 70 and Ha: \u03bc < 70, and we're considering the scenario where the true mean is \u03bc = 65.\n\n**Factors affecting power:**\n\n1. **Significance level (\u03b1):** Higher \u03b1 increases the power of the test because it makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis. However, it also increases the chance of a Type I error (rejecting H0 when it's true).\n\n2. **Sample size (n):** Larger sample sizes increase the power of the test because they provide more information about the population, making it easier to detect a true effect.\n\n3. **Difference between true mean and hypothesized mean:** The larger the difference, the greater the power. Here, the difference is fixed at 70 - 65 = 5.\n\nGiven that the difference is fixed, and we're comparing different \u03b1 and n, we need to see which combination maximizes power.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A: \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 15**\n\n- Moderate \u03b1, small sample size.\n\n**Option B: \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 15**\n\n- More stringent \u03b1, small sample size.\n\n**Option C: \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 30**\n\n- Same moderate \u03b1 as A, but larger sample size.\n\n**Option D: \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 30**\n\n- More stringent \u03b1 than C, but larger sample size.\n\nTo compare these, consider the following:\n\n- Increasing \u03b1 from 0.01 to 0.05 increases power because it's easier to reject H0.\n\n- Increasing n from 15 to 30 increases power because of more information.\n\nTherefore, the combination of higher \u03b1 and larger n should yield the greatest power.\n\nLet's compare A and C:\n\n- C has the same \u03b1 as A but a larger n. Therefore, C should have greater power than A.\n\nNow, compare C and D:\n\n- D has a smaller \u03b1 than C but the same n. Since \u03b1 is smaller, it's harder to reject H0, which should decrease power.\n\nTherefore, C should have greater power than D.\n\nFinally, compare A and B:\n\n- B has a smaller \u03b1 than A but the same n. Again, smaller \u03b1 leads to lower power, so A has greater power than B.\n\nBetween C and D, even though D has a larger n, the decrease in \u03b1 (from 0.05 to 0.01) likely offsets the benefit of the larger sample size.\n\nTherefore, the combination with the greatest power is C: \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
