                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about individuals with moderate mental retardation. So, the options are:\n\nA. constitute 2% - 3% of the mentally retarded population\n\nB. can be trained to perform unskilled work under close supervision\n\nC. usually acquire academic skills up to approximately eighth-grade level\n\nD. display minimal or no impairment in sensorimotor functioning\n\nFirst, I need to recall what moderate mental retardation entails. From what I remember, mental retardation is classified into different levels based on the individual's IQ score and the degree of support they need in their daily lives.\n\nModerate mental retardation is typically defined as having an IQ score ranging from 35 to 49. People in this category face significant challenges in intellectual functions and adaptive behaviors. Adaptive behaviors include skills like communication, self-care, social skills, and occupational skills.\n\nOption A says that they constitute 2% - 3% of the mentally retarded population. I think this might be incorrect. Actually, moderate mental retardation is more common than that. If I recall correctly, mild mental retardation is the most common, followed by moderate, then severe, and profound being the least common. So, perhaps moderate mental retardation makes up a larger percentage, maybe around 10% or so, but I'm not sure about the exact figures. I might need to look that up later.\n\nOption B states that they can be trained to perform unskilled work under close supervision. This seems plausible. Individuals with moderate mental retardation can learn basic job skills and perform routine tasks, especially with ongoing support and guidance. They may require more structure and supervision in the workplace compared to those with mild mental retardation.\n\nOption C says that they usually acquire academic skills up to approximately eighth-grade level. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. Eighth grade would be around age 13 or 14, and I think individuals with moderate mental retardation might have academic achievements below that level. Maybe option C is referring to mild mental retardation instead. I need to double-check the typical academic achievements for moderate mental retardation.\n\nOption D claims that they display minimal or no impairment in sensorimotor functioning. Sensorimotor functioning refers to the coordination of sensory input and motor output, essentially how we process sensory information and respond physically. I think in moderate mental retardation, sensorimotor impairments can be present, but they might not be as severe as in more profound levels of mental retardation. So, perhaps minimal impairment is possible, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOverall, based on my initial thoughts, option B seems the most accurate, but I need to verify the other options to be sure.\n\nLet me try to recall more specific information about moderate mental retardation.\n\nFirst, the classification system: traditionally, mental retardation has been classified into four levels based on IQ scores:\n\n1. Mild: IQ 50-70\n\n2. Moderate: IQ 35-49\n\n3. Severe: IQ 20-34\n\n4. Profound: IQ below 20\n\nEach level corresponds to different levels of support needed in daily life.\n\nNow, regarding option A, the percentage of the mentally retarded population that falls into the moderate category. I couldn't find the exact percentage off the top of my head, but I know that mild mental retardation is the most common, making up about 85% of cases, while moderate is less common, perhaps around 10%, severe about 4%, and profound less than 1%. So, 2% - 3% seems too low for moderate mental retardation. It's probably higher.\n\nOption B: can be trained to perform unskilled work under close supervision. This aligns with what I know about moderate mental retardation. These individuals can learn basic work skills and may be employed in supportive work environments where tasks are straightforward and supervision is available. They might require more structure and guidance compared to those with mild mental retardation.\n\nOption C: usually acquire academic skills up to approximately eighth-grade level. This seems too high for moderate mental retardation. Eighth grade would be around age 13 or 14, and I think individuals with moderate mental retardation might achieve academic levels more comparable to younger children. Maybe up to a sixth-grade level or lower. But I need to confirm this.\n\nOption D: display minimal or no impairment in sensorimotor functioning. I think this might not be accurate. While sensorimotor impairments can vary, in moderate mental retardation, there might be some impairments, but they are not as severe as in severe or profound mental retardation. So, perhaps minimal impairment is acceptable, but saying \"no impairment\" might not be accurate.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems the most accurate based on my knowledge. However, to be thorough, I should verify the typical academic achievements for individuals with moderate mental retardation.\n\nUpon recalling, I think individuals with moderate mental retardation typically achieve academic skills equivalent to those of children aged 9 to 12 years, which would be roughly third to sixth grade level. Therefore, option C, which suggests eighth-grade level, seems too high.\n\nAdditionally, regarding sensorimotor functioning, while it may be less impaired compared to severe or profound mental retardation, some degree of impairment is still possible in moderate mental retardation. So, option D might not be entirely accurate.\n\nIn conclusion, the most accurate statement among the options provided is option B: individuals with moderate mental retardation can be trained to perform unskilled work under close supervision.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
