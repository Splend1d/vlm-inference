                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out who is likely to prevail in this lawsuit between the cousin and the woman over access to the public highway across the woman's land. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a tract of vacant land that the man owned. He conveyed the eastern half to the woman with a warranty deed, and she recorded it promptly. So, the woman owns the eastern half, which fronts on a public highway, and the man retained the western half, which is now landlocked because it doesn't front on the highway.\n\nThen, the man died intestate, meaning he died without a will, and his only heir is his cousin. So, the cousin inherited the western half of the land, which is landlocked.\n\nA year after the conveyance, the cousin visits the land for the first time and realizes there's no access to the public highway. A neighbor who owns adjoining land that does front on the highway offered to sell the cousin a right to cross the neighbor's land for access to the highway, but the cousin rejected the offer.\n\nThe woman, who owns the eastern half, has refused to allow the cousin to cross her land for access to the public highway, even though her land is still vacant.\n\nNow, the cousin is suing the woman, seeking access across her land to the public highway.\n\nWe need to determine who is likely to prevail based on the given options:\n\nA. The cousin, based on necessity.\n\nB. The cousin, because the woman's land is still vacant.\n\nC. The woman, because the cousin could obtain an alternative access to the highway from the neighbor.\n\nD. The woman, because the man failed to reserve an easement in his deed to the woman.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\nOption A: The cousin, based on necessity.\n\nNecessity is a doctrine in property law that sometimes allows a landlocked owner to claim an easement over an adjacent property to access a public road, provided there's no reasonable alternative access.\n\nIn this case, the cousin inherited the western half of the land, which is landlocked. The eastern half, owned by the woman, fronts on the public highway. So, there is a direct path across the woman's land to the highway.\n\nHowever, there is an alternative access offered by the neighbor, who is willing to sell the right to cross their land for a reasonable price. So, the cousin does have an alternative access, but they rejected it.\n\nGiven that there is an alternative access available, even if it requires purchasing it from the neighbor, the necessity may not be established. Necessity typically requires that there is no other reasonable means of access.\n\nTherefore, option A might not be the strongest argument for the cousin.\n\nOption B: The cousin, because the woman's land is still vacant.\n\nI'm not sure about this one. The fact that the woman's land is still vacant might be relevant in some contexts, but I don't recall a specific property law principle that grants access based solely on the vacant status of the neighboring land.\n\nPerhaps if the woman's land were being used in a way that obstructs the cousin's access, but in this case, the woman is just refusing access. So, I don't think this is a strong argument.\n\nOption C: The woman, because the cousin could obtain an alternative access to the highway from the neighbor.\n\nThis seems like a strong argument for the woman. Since there is a reasonable alternative access available from the neighbor, the cousin might not be entitled to an easement of necessity across the woman's land.\n\nThe cousin rejected the neighbor's offer, but the fact remains that an alternative access exists. In law, easements of necessity are generally granted only when there is no other reasonable means of access.\n\nTherefore, the woman can argue that the cousin has an alternative way to access the highway through the neighbor's land, making an easement across her land unnecessary.\n\nOption D: The woman, because the man failed to reserve an easement in his deed to the woman.\n\nThis option suggests that when the man conveyed the eastern half to the woman, he didn't reserve an easement for the western half that he retained. Now that he's passed away and the cousin inherited the western half, the woman argues that since no easement was reserved, she's not bound to allow access.\n\nHowever, in property law, when land is divided, and one part is landlocked, there might be implied easements for necessary access, especially if the original owner didn't intend to create a landlocked parcel without access.\n\nBut in this case, the man conveyed the eastern half with warranty deed, and presumably, he knew that the western half would be landlocked. If he didn't reserve an easement in the deed, it might be argued that the western half was intentionally landlocked, and thus, no easement was intended.\n\nHowever, this seems a bit tricky because the cousin inherited the landlocked property and now seeks access.\n\nConsidering all options, I think option C is the most likely to prevail. The woman can argue that the cousin has an alternative means of access through the neighbor's land, making an easement across her land unnecessary.\n\nTherefore, the woman is likely to prevail based on the availability of alternative access.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
