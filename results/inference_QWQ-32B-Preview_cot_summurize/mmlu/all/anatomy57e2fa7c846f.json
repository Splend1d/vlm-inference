Urethra\n\nFirst, I know that the kidneys are involved in producing urine. They filter blood and remove waste products, creating urine in the process. So, the kidneys make urine, but do they collect it?\n\nI think the kidneys produce urine, but they don't store it for a long time. They probably send it somewhere else.\n\nNext, there are the ureters. I've heard of ureters, but I'm not entirely sure what they do. I think they are tubes that connect the kidneys to another organ where urine is stored.\n\nAh, yes, I believe the ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. So, the bladder must be where urine is collected and stored until it's time to eliminate it from the body.\n\nWait a minute, what about the urethra? I know that the urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. So, it must be for transporting urine out, not for collecting it.\n\nLet me summarize what I've gathered:\n\n- Kidneys: produce urine\n\n- Ureters: transport urine from kidneys to bladder\n\n- Bladder: stores urine\n\n- Urethra: transports urine from bladder out of the body\n\nSo, based on this, the structure that collects urine in the body is the bladder.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nI recall that the bladder is a muscular sac that expands as it fills with urine and contracts during urination to expel the urine.\n\nThe kidneys are more like filters; they don't collect urine for extended periods. The ureters are just tubes for transportation, and the urethra is for elimination.\n\nTherefore, the best answer should be A. Bladder.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
