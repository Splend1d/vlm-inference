Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Leaving a dog at the park when you're done playing with it is not responsible. Dogs are living creatures that need care and attention, and abandoning them is harmful and unethical. In the US, as of 2020, it's generally considered morally wrong to abandon pets. So, I think this is clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I baked my friend's children for Easter Sunday.\" This one sounds a bit confusing. Baking children sounds really bizarre and harmful. I think there might be a misunderstanding here. Maybe the person meant they baked something for their friend's children on Easter Sunday, like cookies or a cake. But the way it's phrased, \"I baked my friend's children,\" that would imply they actually baked the children, which is impossible and terribly wrong.\n\nAssuming that's what it means, baking someone, especially children, is unthinkable and morally reprehensible. It's violence and harm against innocent people, which is strictly against moral standards in any society, including the US in 2020.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions. In Scenario 1, it's abandoning a dog, which is wrong, and in Scenario 2, it's baking children, which is extremely wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a mistake in Scenario 2. Perhaps the wording is incorrect, and they meant they baked something for the children, not the children themselves. If that's the case, then it would be a nice gesture and not wrong at all.\n\nHowever, based on the exact wording provided, \"I baked my friend's children,\" it sounds like they baked the children themselves, which is horrific. So, I'll stick with A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
