                    "text": "So I have this case here about a 15-year-old girl who's been dealing with acne for three months. She started developing breasts and pubic hair at age 12, and she got her first period at 14. During the check-up, the doctor sees some acne on her cheeks and forehead\u2014both open and closed comedones. Her breast and pubic hair development are at Tanner stage 5, which I think means they're fully developed.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the most likely underlying cause of her acne. There are four options:\n\nA. Increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands\n\nB. Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone\n\nC. Increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands\n\nD. Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what causes acne. I remember that acne is related to the sebaceous glands in the skin. These glands produce sebum, which is an oily substance that helps keep the skin moisturized. But when too much sebum is produced, it can mix with dead skin cells and clog the pores, leading to comedones, which are what this girl has\u2014both blackheads (open comedones) and whiteheads (closed comedones).\n\nSo, the key here is figuring out what's causing the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum than usual.\n\nOption A says increased estrogen stimulation. Estrogen is a female hormone, and I know that it plays a role in female sexual development, which this girl has gone through. But I think estrogen actually has an inhibitory effect on sebaceous gland activity. So, higher estrogen levels might actually decrease sebum production. Therefore, this seems less likely.\n\nOption B mentions increased responsiveness to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is involved in stimulating the ovaries to produce eggs and is part of the menstrual cycle. I don't recall sebaceous glands responding directly to FSH. Their main regulator is thought to be androgens. So, this option seems unlikely as well.\n\nOption C talks about increased sympathetic stimulation. The sympathetic nervous system is part of the autonomic nervous system and is involved in the fight-or-flight response. While stress can affect skin health, including acne, I don't think direct sympathetic stimulation is the primary driver of sebaceous gland activity in acne. So, this seems less likely.\n\nOption D is stimulation by androgens. Androgens are hormones like testosterone that are present in both males and females, although males have higher levels. During puberty, both boys and girls experience an increase in androgen levels, which can stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum.\n\nGiven that this girl is 15 and has gone through puberty, with breast and pubic hair development complete, it's likely that her androgen levels have increased, leading to more sebum production and thus acne.\n\nMoreover, I recall that acne is very common during adolescence, precisely because of these hormonal changes, particularly the rise in androgens.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, option D seems the most plausible.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider why the other options are less likely.\n\nEstrogen, as I mentioned, tends to have an anti-sebum effect, so increased estrogen stimulation wouldn't typically cause acne.\n\nFSH is more related to ovarian function and egg development, not directly to sebaceous gland activity.\n\nSympathetic stimulation can affect various bodily functions, but it's not the primary driver of sebaceous gland activity in acne.\n\nTherefore, the most likely underlying cause is stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
