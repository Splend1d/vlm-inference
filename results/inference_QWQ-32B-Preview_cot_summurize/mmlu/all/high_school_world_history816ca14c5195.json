                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage and see what it's telling us about Mali's economy and trade practices during the time of Sultan Musa. So, Al-Zawawi is reporting a conversation with Sultan Musa, where Musa describes a town called ZKRY that has a copper mine. The copper ingots are brought to another place, BYTY, and Musa says that the only thing in his kingdom they levy a duty on is this crude copper. They sell it to the pagan Sudan in exchange for gold, at a ratio of two-thirds of its weight in gold. So, for every 100 measures of copper, they get about 66 and two-thirds measures of gold.\n\nAlso, Musa mentions that there are pagan nations in his kingdom who don't pay jizya, which is a tax usually imposed on non-Muslims in Islamic states, but instead, they are employed in extracting gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height deep, and the gold is found embedded in the sides or collected at the bottom.\n\nNow, the question is asking which inference is most supported by this discussion of copper and gold in the passage. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Mali was able to forge advanced bronze tools from its mineral resources.\n\nWell, the passage mentions copper mines and the trade of copper for gold, but it doesn't say anything about forging bronze tools. Bronze is typically made from copper and tin, and there's no mention of tin here. So, this seems like a stretch. We can probably rule this one out.\n\nB. International trade with Sub-Saharan Africa involved the exchange of mineral resources.\n\nThis seems plausible. Musa is describing trading copper from his kingdom to pagan Sudan in exchange for gold. This suggests that there was a trade relationship involving mineral resources between different regions in Sub-Saharan Africa. So, this could be a valid inference.\n\nC. The jizya could only be collected on unbelievers who had minerals to exploit.\n\nThe passage mentions that there are pagan nations in Musa's kingdom who don't pay jizya but are instead employed in extracting gold. This seems to suggest that instead of paying jizya, these pagan groups contribute to the kingdom through their labor in gold extraction. It doesn't say that jizya could only be collected from those who have minerals to exploit; it just indicates an alternative form of contribution for these particular pagan groups. So, this inference might not be fully supported by the text.\n\nD. Mali's relatively advanced mining technologies accounted for its mineral wealth.\n\nThe passage describes the method of gold extraction as digging pits about a man's height deep and finding gold embedded in the sides or at the bottom. This seems like a relatively basic mining technique, not necessarily advanced. There's no comparison to other technologies or any indication that Mali's methods were particularly advanced for the time. So, this inference doesn't seem well-supported.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems to be the most directly supported by the information in the passage. It highlights the international trade aspect involving mineral resources, which aligns with Musa's description of trading copper for gold with pagan Sudan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
