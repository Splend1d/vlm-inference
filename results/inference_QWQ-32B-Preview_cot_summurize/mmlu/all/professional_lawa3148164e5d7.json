So, there's this farmer who owns an olive grove and he takes out a bunch of loans from different people, giving them mortgages on the grove to secure the loans. The loans are:\n\n- From a friend: $90,000\n\n- From a co-worker: $120,000\n\n- From an investor: $110,000\n\nThen, the co-worker records their mortgage first, followed by the investor, and finally the friend records theirs. After that, there's a foreclosure, and the grove sells for $220,000. The question is, how much should go to the investor?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the recording statute in this jurisdiction. It says: \"any written instrument affecting title to land that is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.\"\n\nOkay, so this is a \"race\" recording statute, meaning that the first one to record their mortgage gets priority, regardless of when the mortgage was actually given.\n\nSo, the co-worker recorded first, then the investor, and then the friend.\n\nUnder a race recording statute, the first to record has the highest priority, followed by the next, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the co-worker has the first priority, then the investor, and finally the friend.\n\nNow, the grove sold for $220,000 in foreclosure. We need to see how this money is distributed among the three mortgage holders.\n\nFirst, we pay off the first priority mortgage, which is the co-worker's $120,000.\n\n$220,000 - $120,000 = $100,000 remaining.\n\nNext, we pay off the investor's mortgage of $110,000.\n\nBut there's only $100,000 left, so the investor gets $100,000, and there's nothing left for the friend.\n\nSo, the investor gets $100,000, which is less than the full amount of their mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. $100,000.00\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check.\n\nIs there any possibility that the friend could get something?\n\nUnder the race recording statute, since the friend recorded last, they have the lowest priority.\n\nSo, after paying the co-worker and the investor, there's no money left for the friend.\n\nHence, the investor gets $100,000, which is the maximum available after the co-worker is paid.\n\nSo, yes, the answer should be C. $100,000.00\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
