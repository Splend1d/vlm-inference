                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a mail clerk who slipped and fell on ice near the loading dock of their employer's headquarters in State B. The building is owned by a company in State C, and the clerk is domiciled in State A. The clerk sues the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, asking for $100,000 in personal injury damages. Now, the employer wants to intervene in this lawsuit, claiming $80,000 in damages for a computer that was damaged in the fall. The question is whether the court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to intervene in a lawsuit. Intervention allows a third party to join an ongoing lawsuit because they have a stake in the outcome or the subject matter of the suit. There are two types of intervention: as of right and permissive intervention.\n\nIntervention as of right is governed by Rule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and it requires that:\n\n1. The applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action.\n\n2. The applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest.\n\n3. The applicant's interest is not adequately represented by existing parties.\n\nPermissive intervention, under Rule 24(b), is more discretionary and allows the court to permit intervention if the applicant's claim has a question of law or fact in common with the main action.\n\nIn this case, the employer is seeking to intervene to assert its own negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. So, I need to consider whether the employer has a right to intervene or whether the court might allow permissive intervention.\n\nOption A says no, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence. This suggests that the employer's interest isn't directly at risk if they don't intervene. But, since the employer has a separate claim for the damaged computer, which is related to the same incident, it might be argued that the outcome of the clerk's suit could affect the employer's ability to recover for the computer damage. For example, if the building owner's liability is limited in the clerk's suit, it might impact the employer's potential recovery.\n\nOption B says no, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action. This seems relevant because the clerk has already filed suit on their own, and perhaps the employer should have been joined as a plaintiff from the beginning if their claims are so closely related. However, the fact that the clerk didn't include the employer doesn't necessarily preclude the employer from intervening later, especially if their interests are independent but related.\n\nOption C says yes, because the employer is an indispensable party. Indispensable parties are those whose presence in the suit is necessary for the court to completely resolve the dispute. Under Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party is indispensable if their absence would make the court's judgment unfair or incomplete. In this case, the employer isn't necessarily indispensable to the clerk's personal injury claim, as the clerk can pursue their own damages separately. However, the employer's claim for the computer damage is separate, so perhaps the employer isn't indispensable to the clerk's suit.\n\nOption D says yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action. This points towards permissive intervention under Rule 24(b), which allows intervention if the applicant's claim has a question of law or fact in common with the main action. Since both the clerk and the employer are alleging negligence by the building owner related to the same incident, there are certainly common questions of law and fact.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that the employer's motion to intervene is most likely to be granted under permissive intervention grounds, as their claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action. Therefore, option D seems the most appropriate.\n\nHowever, I should also consider whether the employer has an independent right to intervene under Rule 24(a). For intervention as of right, the employer needs to show that they have an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and that their ability to protect that interest may be impaired or impeded by disposition of the action in their absence.\n\nIn this case, the employer has a financial interest in the computer that was damaged in the incident. If the building owner is found not liable in the clerk's suit, it could impact the employer's ability to recover for the computer damage. Additionally, if the clerk's suit results in a judgment that could potentially limit the building owner's liability, it might affect the employer's recovery. Therefore, there is a possibility that the employer's interest could be impaired if they don't intervene.\n\nMoreover, it's not clear whether the clerk would adequately represent the employer's interests, as their damages are separate and the clerk might prioritize their own personal injury claims over the employer's property damage claim.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems that the employer might satisfy the requirements for intervention as of right under Rule 24(a). Therefore, option A might not be correct because the employer's interest could indeed be impaired if they don't intervene.\n\nOption B suggests that the clerk's choice not to join the employer precludes intervention, but I don't think that's necessarily the case. The clerk's decision doesn't negate the employer's right or the court's discretion to allow intervention, especially if the employer has a valid claim related to the same incident.\n\nOption C posits that the employer is an indispensable party, but as I thought earlier, while the employer's claim is related, their presence isn't strictly necessary for the court to resolve the clerk's personal injury claim. The clerk can proceed with their suit independently, and the employer could potentially file a separate suit for the computer damage. Therefore, perhaps the employer isn't indispensable.\n\nGiven this analysis, option D seems the most accurate: the court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action. This aligns with the permissive intervention standard under Rule 24(b).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
