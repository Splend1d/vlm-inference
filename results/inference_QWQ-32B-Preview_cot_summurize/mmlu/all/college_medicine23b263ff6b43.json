                    "text": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nAccording to the article, which of the following is NOT a benefit of sauna use?\n\nA. Decreased risk of heart attacks.\nB. Increase in stroke volume.\nC. Improved mental health.\nD. Decreased rate of erectile dysfunction.\n"

                    "text": "Let's see. I have this article about sauna use and its health benefits. It says that sauna bathing is when you sit in a hot room, and your body gets a bit warmer, which makes your body react in certain ways to cool down. Apparently, this can be good for your health in the long run.\n\nThe article mentions a big study called the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, which looked at lots of middle-aged men in Finland. They found that men who used the sauna more often had lower chances of dying from heart problems and other diseases. Specifically, those who went to the sauna two to three times a week had 27% lower risk of heart-related deaths, and those who went four to seven times a week had 50% lower risk. Also, frequent sauna users were 40% less likely to die from any cause prematurely.\n\nMoreover, the study found that sauna use was linked to lower risks of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Men who used the sauna two to three times a week had 66% lower risk of dementia and 65% lower risk of Alzheimer's compared to those who used it only once a week. There was also a mental health benefit: men who used the sauna four to seven times a week had 77% lower risk of developing psychotic disorders.\n\nThe article explains that when you're in the sauna, your skin temperature goes up to about 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and your core body temperature increases from 37\u00b0C to 39\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F to 102.2\u00b0F). Your heart works harder, increasing cardiac output by 60 to 70%, and your heart rate goes up, but your stroke volume stays the same. About 50 to 70% of your blood flow goes to the skin to help you sweat, and you lose about 0.5 kg of sweat during a sauna session.\n\nThere's also a mention of plasma volume increasing to help cool the body and prevent too rapid an increase in core temperature. This adaptation helps with heat tolerance.\n\nThe article talks about a concept called hormesis, where exposure to a mild stressor triggers protective mechanisms that can help repair damage and protect against more severe stressors in the future.\n\nIt's interesting that the physiological responses to sauna use are similar to those during moderate to vigorous exercise. In fact, sauna use is sometimes suggested as an alternative for people who can't exercise due to health issues.\n\nNow, the question is: According to the article, which of the following is NOT a benefit of sauna use?\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Decreased risk of heart attacks.\n\nB. Increase in stroke volume.\n\nC. Improved mental health.\n\nD. Decreased rate of erectile dysfunction.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Decreased risk of heart attacks.\n\nThe article mentions that sauna use is associated with reduced death from cardiovascular causes, which would include heart attacks. So, this seems like a benefit.\n\nB. Increase in stroke volume.\n\nThe article says that during sauna use, the stroke volume remains unchanged, and the heart rate increases to boost cardiac output. So, there's no mention of an increase in stroke volume; in fact, it says it remains unchanged.\n\nC. Improved mental health.\n\nThe article discusses reduced risks of dementia, Alzheimer's, and psychotic disorders, which are all related to mental health. So, this is a benefit.\n\nD. Decreased rate of erectile dysfunction.\n\nThis one isn't directly mentioned in the article. However, since erectile dysfunction can be related to cardiovascular health, and sauna use improves cardiovascular health, it's possible that it could indirectly help with erectile dysfunction. But since it's not explicitly stated, it's likely not a confirmed benefit based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is probably B. Increase in stroke volume, because the article says that during sauna use, stroke volume remains unchanged, and it's the heart rate that increases to boost cardiac output.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Increase in stroke volume.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
