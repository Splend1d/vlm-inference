BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2\n\nD. BMI 25-30 kg/m2\n\nI remember that BMI is a way to measure body fat based on height and weight, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact categories.\n\nI think BMI stands for Body Mass Index, and it's calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. So, BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (m^2).\n\nI recall that there are standard categories for BMI:\n\n- Underweight: BMI below 18.5\n\n- Normal weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9\n\n- Overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9\n\n- Obese: BMI 30 and above\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C, BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2, is the correct definition for overweight.\n\nBut let me double-check. Option A says BMI > 25 kg/m2, which would include BMI values above 29.9, such as obesity. So that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B is BMI = 25 kg/m2, which is just one specific point. Overweight is a range, not a single value.\n\nOption D is BMI 25-30 kg/m2, which is close but includes 30, and I think obesity starts at BMI 30.\n\nSo, yes, option C, BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2, matches the standard definition of overweight.\n\nIt's important to note that BMI is a general measure and doesn't account for muscle mass or other factors. So, some athletes might have a higher BMI but still be healthy.\n\nAlso, these categories are based on guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) and are widely used in many countries.\n\nI think I've got it figured out now. The correct answer is C. BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
