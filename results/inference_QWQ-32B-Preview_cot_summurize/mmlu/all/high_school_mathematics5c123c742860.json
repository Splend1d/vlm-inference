Let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that probabilities add up to 100%. So, if something has a 70% chance of happening, the chance of it not happening should be the remaining percentage.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nChance of rain: 70%\n\nChance of not raining: ?\n\nAnd since total probability is 100%, then:\n\nChance of not raining = 100% - Chance of raining\n\nSo, Chance of not raining = 100% - 70% = 30%\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there any chance I'm missing something here?\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the definitions.\n\nProbability of an event is P(event), and the probability of the complementary event (not happening) is P(not event) = 1 - P(event).\n\nIn percentages, that would be P(not event) = 100% - P(event).\n\nSo again, P(not raining) = 100% - 70% = 30%.\n\nOkay, that matches my first thought.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Suppose I think about odds or something, but I don't see a need for that here. This seems like a basic probability problem where the total probability must sum to 100%.\n\nLet me consider if the question is trying to trick me in some way. Is there any scenario where the chance of not raining wouldn't be 100% minus the chance of raining? I don't think so, because these are complementary events.\n\nWait, maybe if there are other factors, but in this case, it's just rain or not rain on a given day.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 30%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0%\n\nB. 30%\n\nC. 50%\n\nD. 70%\n\nOption B is 30%, which matches my calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
