                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Bale Co. incurring $100,000 in acquisition costs related to purchasing the net assets of Dixon Co. And I need to figure out what to do with these $100,000. There are four options: A, B, C, and D. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says to allocate the $100,000 on a pro rata basis to the nonmonetary assets acquired. Hmm, that sounds like spreading the cost among the different assets Bale Co. got from Dixon Co., but only to the nonmonetary ones, which I guess are things like property, equipment, inventory, that sort of thing, not cash or other monetary assets.\n\nOption B suggests capitalizing the $100,000 as part of goodwill and testing it annually for impairment. Goodwill is that intangible asset that comes from buying a company for more than the fair value of its net assets. So, if Bale Co. paid more than the fair value of Dixon Co.'s net assets, that difference is goodwill.\n\nOption C is to capitalize the $100,000 as an other asset and amortize it over five years. Amortization is like depreciation for intangible assets, where you spread the cost over time.\n\nOption D is to just expense the $100,000 as incurred in the current period. That means treating it as a cost in the year it happened, not capitalizing it into an asset.\n\nOkay, so which one is correct? I need to think about what acquisition costs are and how they should be treated in accounting.\n\nFirst, I recall that acquisition costs are costs incurred to effect a business combination. In this case, Bale Co. is purchasing the net assets of Dixon Co., which sounds like a asset acquisition rather than a full business acquisition, but maybe it's similar.\n\nIn accounting standards, particularly under GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) in the US, there are specific rules about how to handle these costs.\n\nLet me think back to my studies. I remember that direct costs associated with the acquisition should be expensed as incurred. That sounds like Option D.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are exceptions. For example, if the costs are directly attributable to acquiring a particular asset, maybe they can be capitalized as part of that asset's cost.\n\nOption A suggests allocating them pro rata to nonmonetary assets. That could make sense if these costs are considered directly attributable to those assets.\n\nOption B mentions goodwill. Goodwill is usually calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Acquisition costs are generally expensed, not added to goodwill.\n\nOption C suggests capitalizing the costs as an other asset and amortizing over five years. That seems similar to how some intangible assets are treated, but I don't recall acquisition costs being treated this way.\n\nOption D is to expense the costs as incurred. That aligns with what I initially thought.\n\nLet me try to find more concrete evidence. Maybe I should look up the authoritative literature on this.\n\nUnder GAAP, specifically ASC 805, Business Combinations, it discusses the treatment of costs related to business combinations.\n\nAccording to ASC 805, paragraph 30, \"All costs of effecting a business combination shall be expensed as incurred.\"\n\nSo, that would support Option D, expensing the costs as incurred.\n\nBut wait, the question is about acquiring the net assets of Dixon Co. Is this considered a business combination under ASC 805?\n\nSometimes, acquiring net assets is treated as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination. In asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values.\n\nIf it's an asset acquisition, then perhaps the acquisition costs should be allocated to the assets acquired.\n\nI need to clarify the difference between a business combination and an asset acquisition.\n\nIn a business combination, a company acquires a business, and the acquiree continues to operate as a business. In an asset acquisition, the acquirer buys specific assets and assumes certain liabilities, and there is no continuing business entity.\n\nGiven that Bale Co. acquired the net assets of Dixon Co., it might be considered an asset acquisition, depending on the specifics.\n\nUnder GAAP, in an asset acquisition, acquisition costs are generally allocated to the assets acquired based on their relative fair values.\n\nWait, but according to ASC 805, all costs of effecting a business combination should be expensed.\n\nSo, perhaps if it's an asset acquisition, the treatment differs.\n\nI need to look into this further.\n\nLet me consider FASB Interpretation No. 45, which provides guidance on determining whether an acquisition is a business combination or an asset acquisition.\n\nBut I might not have access to that right now, so I'll have to rely on my memory and reasoning.\n\nIf Bale Co. acquired the net assets of Dixon Co., and Dixon Co. was a separate legal entity, then it might be treated as a business combination.\n\nHowever, if Bale Co. acquired specific assets and liabilities without acquiring the business as a going concern, it might be treated as an asset acquisition.\n\nGiven the wording, \"purchase of the net assets,\" it sounds like an asset acquisition.\n\nIn asset acquisitions, acquisition costs are generally allocated to the assets acquired, similar to how acquisition costs are treated in property purchases, where closing costs are added to the basis of the property.\n\nSo, in that case, Option A might be more appropriate, allocating the costs to the nonmonetary assets acquired on a pro rata basis.\n\nBut, I'm a bit confused because ASC 805 seems to suggest that in business combinations, these costs should be expensed.\n\nWait, perhaps ASC 805 only applies to business combinations, not to asset acquisitions.\n\nSo, if this is an asset acquisition, then maybe different rules apply.\n\nI recall that in asset acquisitions, acquisition costs are capitalized as part of the cost of the assets acquired.\n\nTherefore, Option A seems more appropriate.\n\nOption B, adding to goodwill, doesn't make sense in an asset acquisition, because goodwill is related to business combinations.\n\nOption C, capitalizing as an other asset and amortizing, doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nOption D, expensing as incurred, might be correct if it's a business combination, but perhaps not for an asset acquisition.\n\nGiven that, I think Option A is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why.\n\nIf Bale Co. acquired the net assets of Dixon Co., and this is treated as an asset acquisition, then the acquisition costs should be allocated to the identifiable assets acquired, based on their relative fair values.\n\nAssuming that the assets acquired are nonmonetary (like property, plant, equipment, inventory, etc.), then allocating the $100,000 on a pro rata basis to these nonmonetary assets makes sense.\n\nThis would increase the basis of each asset by their respective shares of the acquisition costs.\n\nOn the other hand, if this were a business combination, then according to ASC 805, the acquisition costs should be expensed as incurred, which would align with Option D.\n\nBut since the question specifies the \"purchase of the net assets,\" it seems more like an asset acquisition, requiring the costs to be capitalized as part of the asset costs.\n\nTherefore, Option A is likely the correct choice.\n\nHowever, to be absolutely sure, I might want to look up some authoritative guidance or examples that similar to this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering the treatment for asset acquisitions.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nIf this were a real estate purchase, for example, where a company buys land and buildings, the acquisition costs, such as legal fees, title expenses, etc., are typically capitalized as part of the cost of the land and buildings.\n\nSimilarly, in an asset acquisition, one might capitalize the acquisition costs into the assets acquired.\n\nTherefore, Option A seems consistent with that approach.\n\nOption B, adding to goodwill, isn't appropriate because goodwill is related to business combinations, not asset acquisitions.\n\nOption C, capitalizing as an other asset and amortizing over five years, doesn't align with standard accounting practices for acquisition costs in asset acquisitions.\n\nOption D, expensing as incurred, might be correct if it were a business combination, but likely not for an asset acquisition.\n\nHence, I conclude that Option A is the correct answer: allocate the $100,000 on a pro rata basis to the nonmonetary assets acquired.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\na. allocate on a pro rata basis to the nonmonetary assets acquired."
