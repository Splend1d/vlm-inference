The Inca Empire, also known as Tawantinsuyu, was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America. It was centered in what is now Peru and extended along the Andes mountains from Ecuador to Chile and Argentina.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Pueblo - The Pueblo people are indigenous to the southwestern United States, particularly in regions like New Mexico and Arizona. They are known for their adobe and stone masonry architecture, such as the cliff dwellings and pueblo complexes. They were not rulers of the Andes Mountains.\n\nB. Aztec - The Aztec Empire was located in central Mexico and was conquered by the Spanish in 1521, not 1532. The Aztecs are famous for their capital city, Tenochtitlan, which was located where modern-day Mexico City is now. They had a complex society with a strong military and a rich cultural heritage, but they did not rule the Andes Mountains.\n\nD. Apache - The Apache peoples are Native American tribes primarily found in the southwestern United States and Mexico. They are known for their fierce resistance to Spanish and later American expansion into their territories. Like the Pueblo, they did not have a presence in the Andes Mountains.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Inca."
