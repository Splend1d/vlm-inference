                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this situation where a couple who were living together decides to get married. The man wants to make sure that if they ever divorce, all the property he owns now stays with him. The woman agrees but wants it in writing. They get married without signing anything. Then, three months later, the husband leaves her for someone else and tries to kick her out, saying there's this prenuptial agreement. She doesn't move, so he sues to enforce this oral agreement.\n\nThe question is, will the court likely enforce the husband's claim? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a prenuptial agreement is. It's a contract between future spouses that outlines how their property will be divided if they divorce. Usually, these agreements are in writing because they deal with property rights and are entered into before marriage.\n\nIn this case, they didn't put their agreement in writing; it was just oral. The woman agreed to the terms but wanted a written document, but they didn't get around to signing anything before getting married.\n\nNow, option A says yes, the court will enforce it because the consideration for the contract was the marriage, and the consummation made the contract complete and enforceable.\n\nWait, consideration is something of value exchanged between parties to make a contract binding. Here, the consideration would be the promise to marry each other, and the agreement about property.\n\nBut, generally, contracts related to marriage need to be in writing to be enforceable, especially property agreements. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption B says yes, because prenuptial agreements are given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to enforcement.\n\nHmm, I don't think that's accurate. Prenuptial agreements are scrutinized to ensure they are fair and voluntary. Courts don't automatically enforce them; they need to meet certain legal standards, including being in writing.\n\nOption C says no, because a contract in consideration of marriage must be in writing, and since the prenuptial was oral, it's not legal.\n\nThis seems plausible. There's a rule called the Statute of Frauds, which requires certain contracts, including those related to marriage like prenups, to be in writing to be enforceable.\n\nOption D says no, because the husband didn't live up to his promise to put the agreement in writing, making him guilty of fraud.\n\nWell, fraud is a separate issue. If he promised to put it in writing and didn't, that could be seen as misrepresentation, but I'm not sure if that directly affects the enforceability of the oral agreement.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is the most accurate. The agreement needed to be in writing to be enforceable, and since it wasn't, the court likely won't enforce it.\n\nBut let me think about this some more. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, oral prenuptial agreements might be enforceable under certain circumstances, like if there's sufficient evidence of the agreement and it's fair and voluntary. But generally, the Statute of Frauds requires these agreements to be in writing.\n\nAlso, the fact that they got married without signing anything, and now he's trying to enforce an oral agreement, seems problematic.\n\nMoreover, the woman agreed to the terms but specifically asked for a written document, which wasn't done. So, there might be an argument that there was a meeting of the minds on having a written agreement, but they didn't follow through.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court could consider the marriage itself as partial performance of the contract, but I'm not sure if that would be enough to enforce an oral prenuptial agreement.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A mentions consideration and consummation making the contract complete. But even if the marriage took place, without the writing, the agreement might still not be enforceable.\n\nOption B seems too broad; courts don't automatically enforce prenuptial agreements without verifying certain conditions, including whether it's in writing.\n\nOption C directly addresses the Statute of Frauds requirement for writing.\n\nOption D introduces fraud, which might be a separate issue but doesn't directly answer whether the oral agreement is enforceable.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: No, because a contract in consideration of marriage must be in writing, and the prenuptial was therefore not legal as long as it remained oral.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
