The goal is to counter the activists' campaign with accurate information about the health benefits of fluoridated water, using credible sources.\n\nOption A suggests using utility employees to write the blog, posing as dentists and physicians. This seems dishonest because they are not actually dentists or physicians. Misrepresenting one's professional identity is unethical and could backfire if discovered, damaging the utility's reputation even more.\n\nOption B proposes recruiting actual dentists and physicians to write the blog under their own names, without mentioning the utility. This could be effective because it uses credible sources directly. However, not disclosing the utility's involvement might make the blog seem less connected to the issue at hand. It's also important to ensure that these professionals are writing based on their own expertise and not being coerced or unduly influenced.\n\nOption C involves writing the blog yourself, as a utility employee, and quoting various scientific opinions. This is transparent about your affiliation but might not carry the same weight as direct statements from health professionals. Quoting scientific sources is important, but having actual practitioners speak to the benefits could be more persuasive.\n\nOption D suggests compensating dentists and physicians to write the blog, disclosing the utility as the sponsor but not the compensation. While this is somewhat transparent about the utility's involvement, not disclosing the compensation could be seen as hiding a conflict of interest. It's important to be fully transparent about any payments or incentives to maintain credibility.\n\nConsidering these points, the most appropriate course of action seems to be Option B: recruiting a group of volunteer dentists and physicians to write the blog under their own identities, with no reference to the utility. This approach uses credible, authoritative voices directly, which can be very impactful. However, to strengthen the connection to the utility's position, it might be beneficial to have a disclaimer or a note explaining that while the bloggers are independent professionals, they support the utility's stance on fluoridation based on their professional expertise.\n\nAlternatively, a hybrid approach could be considered: have the utility sponsor a series of guest posts on its blog by dentists and physicians, clearly disclosing both the utility's sponsorship and the professionals' qualifications. This way, the utility is transparent about its involvement, and the health professionals are presenting their own opinions based on their expertise.\n\nIn any case, it's crucial to ensure that all information presented is accurate, backed by scientific evidence, and presented in a respectful manner. Engaging in a smear campaign or misrepresenting facts could further undermine public trust in the utility.\n\nAdditionally, consider reaching out to public health organizations or dental associations for support. They may have resources or statements that can be shared to reinforce the message.\n\nLastly, monitor the online discourse and be prepared to address any misinformation promptly and accurately. Building a rapport with the community through open communication and transparency will be key in maintaining trust during this challenging time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
