The options are 15%, 35%, 55%, and 75%. I don't remember the exact statistic, so I need to think about where I can find this information.\n\nFirst, I recall that there are various surveys and reports that track such data, especially related to school safety and student behavior. One that comes to mind is the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). I think they collect data on fighting and other risk behaviors among youth.\n\nLet me see if I can remember any specific statistics from that survey. I know that fighting in schools has been an area of concern, and there have been efforts to reduce such incidents. I think in recent years, the rates have been decreasing, but I'm not sure about the exact percentage for 2015.\n\nLooking back at the options, 15% seems too low, considering that fighting was probably more common than that. On the other hand, 75% seems excessively high; it would mean that nearly three-quarters of teenagers aged 13-15 had been in a fight at school, which sounds unrealistic.\n\nMaybe around 35%? That seems plausible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 55% could also be a possibility, but again, I don't have any concrete evidence to choose between these options.\n\nAnother source I could consider is the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which often publishes reports on school crime and safety. They might have data on fights in schools involving students in this age group.\n\nSince I don't have access to specific data right now, I'll have to make an educated guess based on what seems reasonable. Given that fighting in schools is a significant issue but probably not as prevalent as 55% or 75%, I'm leaning towards 35%.\n\nSo, my answer is B. 35%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
