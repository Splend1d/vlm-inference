                    "text": "So I've got this passage from William Graham Sumner in 1883, and it's talking about how millionaires are a product of natural selection, and that interfering with the law of survival of the fittest would lead to the survival of the unfittest. It sounds like he's defending the idea that the rich deserve their wealth because they've been naturally selected for success.\n\nNow, the question is about how Sumner's sociological ideas reflect the thoughts of the late 1800s. The options are:\n\nA. That cultural and intellectual arguments justified the success of the top socioeconomic class as appropriate and inevitable.\n\nB. That popular writers rejected scientific ideas and based their arguments on faith.\n\nC. That intellectuals were critical of cut-throat competition and proposed cooperative alternatives.\n\nD. That cultural products ignored economics and looked back to the past.\n\nFirst, looking at Sumner's quote, he's clearly arguing that the success of millionaires is a result of natural selection, which makes their success both appropriate and inevitable. He believes that interfering with this natural process would lead to negative consequences. So, option A seems to align closely with his\u89c2\u70b9.\n\nOption B says that popular writers rejected scientific ideas and based their arguments on faith. But Sumner is actually using scientific ideas, like natural selection, to support his arguments about society. So, this seems contradictory to his approach.\n\nOption C suggests that intellectuals were critical of cut-throat competition and proposed cooperative alternatives. Again, Sumner seems to be defending cut-throat competition as a natural and necessary part of society, so this doesn't match his viewpoint.\n\nOption D says that cultural products ignored economics and looked back to the past. But Sumner's argument is very much engaged with economic ideas, particularly regarding wealth and success.\n\nTherefore, option A appears to be the best fit. Sumner's ideas reflect a trend in late 19th-century thought where cultural and intellectual arguments were used to justify the success of the upper classes as both appropriate and inevitable, using concepts like social Darwinism to support this view.\n\nTo further understand this, it's important to know that Social Darwinism was a theory that applied the principles of natural selection and \"survival of the fittest\" to society, often used to justify social inequality and the status quo. Sumner's arguments align closely with this perspective, suggesting that the wealthy have earned their position through natural selection and that any interference with this process would be detrimental.\n\nMoreover, during the late 1800s, the United States was experiencing rapid industrialization and economic growth, leading to vast inequalities in wealth. Many sociologists and thinkers of the time grappled with these changes, and some, like Sumner, argued that such inequalities were natural and just.\n\nIn contrast, other thinkers were critical of these inequalities and proposed reforms or alternative social structures, but according to the passage, Sumner is defending the existing social order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: cultural and intellectual arguments justified the success of those at the top of the socioeconomic structure as both appropriate and inevitable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
