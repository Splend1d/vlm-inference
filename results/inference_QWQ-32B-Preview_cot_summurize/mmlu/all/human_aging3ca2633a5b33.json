It says: \"Prospective memory refers to memory for some recent event, something that happened a long time ago, to do something in the future, or for the context and source of remembered information.\" And then it gives options A, B, C, and D corresponding to those descriptions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what prospective memory actually is. I remember from my psychology class that memory can be divided into different types, like declarative and procedural memory, but prospective memory seems a bit different.\n\nLooking back at my notes, I find that prospective memory is about remembering to perform a planned action or intention in the future. So, it's not about recalling past events or information, but more about keeping in mind something you need to do at some point.\n\nOption A says \"for some recent event.\" That sounds like retrospective memory, which is about remembering past events, especially recent ones. So, that doesn't match prospective memory.\n\nOption B is \"for something that happened a long time ago.\" Again, this is also about recalling past events, but over a longer period. This is still retrospective memory, not prospective.\n\nOption C is \"to do something in the future.\" Hmm, this seems to align with the definition I recalled. Prospective memory is about remembering to perform actions in the future, like remembering to pick up milk on the way home or to call someone back later.\n\nOption D says \"for the context and source of remembered information.\" This sounds like it's related to knowing where or how you acquired certain information, which is more about the metadata of memories, not about future actions.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C is the correct answer. Prospective memory is about remembering to do something in the future.\n\nBut just to make sure, I'll think about some examples. For instance, if I plan to submit a report by next Monday, prospective memory would help me remember to do that. It's not about remembering what happened in the past, but about acting on a future intention.\n\nAlso, sometimes people set reminders or make notes to help with prospective memory, especially for important tasks that could be easily forgotten.\n\nI think I've got it right. Prospective memory is indeed about remembering to perform future actions, so option C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
