So, the correct answer is B. 24.\n\nTo provide more detail, the ribs are bones that form the rib cage, which protects the thoracic cavity and its internal organs, such as the heart and lungs. They are connected to the vertebrae in the back and to the sternum in the front, except for the lower two pairs in adults, which are called floating ribs because they don't connect to the sternum directly.\n\nIt's worth noting that while most people have 24 ribs, some individuals may have variations due to genetic factors or other reasons. For example, some people might have an extra rib, known as a cervical rib, or fewer ribs. However, in the standard anatomy, there are 24 ribs.\n\nSo, to summarize, the typical number of ribs in the human body is 24, making option B the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
