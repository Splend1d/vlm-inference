                    "text": "I think this is an example of habituation. So, habituation is when an animal learns to stop responding to a stimulus that doesn't have any real importance or danger. In this case, the baby duck initially thinks the large object is dangerous and runs for cover. But after seeing the object many times and realizing nothing bad happens, it stops reacting to it. That sounds like habituation to me.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nA. Imprinting is when a young animal quickly learns to recognize and follow a parent or parent figure, usually right after birth. That doesn't seem to fit here because the duck isn't learning to follow anything; it's learning to ignore something.\n\nB. A fixed-action pattern is a series of behaviors that happen automatically in response to a specific stimulus. For example, a bird might have a fixed-action pattern for nesting or mating. Again, in this scenario, the duck isn't performing a specific sequence of actions in response to the object; it's learning to not react to it.\n\nC. Agonistic behavior refers to social behaviors related to conflict, like fighting or submitting. There's no indication of social interaction or conflict in this scenario; it's just the duck and the object.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's D. Habituation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
