                    "text": "Let's think about this problem step by step. The question is about what would happen to the Moon's motion if the force of gravity between the Moon and the Earth were to suddenly stop. We need to consider both the Moon's rotation on its axis and its revolution around the Earth.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the Moon orbits the Earth due to the gravitational force between them. This force provides the centripetal force required for the Moon's circular motion around the Earth. So, if gravity were to stop, there would be no centripetal force to keep the Moon in its orbit. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object in motion will continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed unless acted upon by an external force. Therefore, if the gravitational force suddenly disappeared, the Moon would no longer be constrained to its orbital path and would instead continue moving in a straight line tangent to its original orbit.\n\nNow, regarding the Moon's rotation on its axis, that is a different motion. The Moon rotates on its axis with a period equal to its orbital period around the Earth, which is why we always see the same face of the Moon from Earth. This is known as tidal locking. However, the rotation of the Moon on its axis is due to its own angular momentum, not directly due to the Earth's gravity. So, if the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon were to cease, the Moon's rotation on its axis would not be immediately affected. It would continue to rotate as it was before, unless there were other torques acting on it, which we can assume are negligible in this scenario.\n\nSo, putting these two points together:\n\n- The Moon would stop revolving around the Earth because there's no longer a centripetal force to maintain its orbit.\n\n- The Moon would continue to rotate on its axis, as its rotation is not directly dependent on the Earth's gravity.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be option B: It would continue rotating on its axis, but it would stop revolving around the Earth.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this reasoning. Is there any effect that Earth's gravity has on the Moon's rotation that I might have missed? For example, tidal forces can influence the rotation of celestial bodies over long periods through tidal locking, but in the short term, if gravity were to suddenly stop, would the Moon's rotation be immediately affected? I don't think so. The rotation is a property of the Moon itself, and without any external torques, it should continue rotating as before.\n\nAnother angle to consider: if the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon ceased, there would be no tidal forces acting to influence the Moon's rotation. However, since the question is about the immediate effect, and assuming that the Moon's rotation is already tidally locked, it should continue to rotate at its current rate unless acted upon by another torque.\n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion remains: the Moon would continue rotating on its axis but would stop revolving around the Earth.\n\nLet's look back at the options:\n\nA. It would continue rotating on its axis, and it would revolve around the Earth as usual.\n\nThis can't be right because without gravity, there's no force to keep it in orbit, so it wouldn't continue to revolve around the Earth.\n\nB. It would continue rotating on its axis, but it would stop revolving around the Earth.\n\nThis matches our reasoning.\n\nC. It would stop rotating on its axis, but it would revolve around the Earth as usual.\n\nThis doesn't make sense because, as discussed, the rotation should continue unless acted upon by a torque.\n\nD. It would stop rotating on its axis, and it would stop revolving around the Earth.\n\nThis seems incorrect because the rotation should continue.\n\nHence, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
