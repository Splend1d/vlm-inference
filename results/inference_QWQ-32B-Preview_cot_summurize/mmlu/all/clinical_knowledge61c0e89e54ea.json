                    "text": "Let's see. Addison's disease is something I've heard of, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I know it has something to do with hormone production, probably from the adrenal glands. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says it's due to a deficiency of prolactin hormone. Hmm, prolactin is produced by the pituitary gland, right? And Addison's disease is related to the adrenals. So maybe that's not correct.\n\nOption B mentions that it leads to generalized pigmentation. I think I've read somewhere that Addison's disease can cause darkening of the skin, but is it generalized? I'm not sure about that.\n\nOption C says it's a recognized cause of hypertension. Wait, hypertension is high blood pressure. I thought Addison's disease might be related to low blood pressure because of hormone deficiencies. So maybe this one is incorrect.\n\nOption D mentions that diabetes is a complication. Now, there are different types of diabetes, but I don't recall Addison's disease being directly linked to diabetes. Maybe it's not this one either.\n\nLet me try to recall what Addison's disease actually is. It's an endocrine disorder where the adrenal glands don't produce enough steroid hormones, specifically cortisol and aldosterone. So, it's more about deficiency in these hormones.\n\nGiven that, option A is probably incorrect because prolactin is not produced by the adrenals.\n\nOption B mentions pigmentation. Actually, one of the symptoms of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation, which is darkening of the skin. So, that seems plausible.\n\nOption C says it's a recognized cause of hypertension. But since Addison's disease involves deficiency in aldosterone, which helps regulate blood pressure and electrolytes, I think it's more associated with low blood pressure or hypotension, not hypertension.\n\nOption D suggests diabetes is a complication. Well, diabetes affects insulin production or sensitivity, which is different from adrenal hormone deficiency. So, I don't think that's correct.\n\nBetween options B and C, I think B is more accurate. Addison's disease does lead to generalized pigmentation, and it's not a cause of hypertension. In fact, people with Addison's disease might have low blood pressure because of aldosterone deficiency.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. Leads to generalized pigmentation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
