                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which allegation would be least helpful in suppressing the defendant's confession. So, I need to understand each option and see how it relates to the admissibility of the statement.\n\nOption A says that before the defendant gave the statement, he was refused permission to use the bathroom. I think this might relate to the defendant's treatment and whether he was coerced into making the statement. If he was denied basic needs, that could be seen as undue influence or coercion, which might make the statement involuntary and thus suppressible.\n\nOption B mentions that the defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement. This seems to be about the defendant's right to counsel. If he had a lawyer, and perhaps didn't know how to contact them or was not allowed to, that might impact the validity of his waiver of rights. But I'm not sure how having a lawyer on retainer directly affects the admissibility, especially since he agreed to speak to the detective after waiving his rights.\n\nOption C states that the defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause. I know that evidence obtained from an unlawful arrest might be suppressible under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine. So, if the arrest lacked probable cause, anything derived from that arrest, including statements, could be suppressed.\n\nOption D says that the defendant could not speak English, and the warnings were given in English. This seems like a clear problem because the Miranda warnings must be given in a manner that the defendant understands. If he doesn't understand English, giving the warnings in English wouldn't effectively inform him of his rights, making the waiver invalid.\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these would be least helpful in suppressing the statement. Let's consider them one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A: denied use of the bathroom. This could be seen as uncomfortable or even cruel, but I'm not sure if it rises to the level of coercion that would make the statement involuntary. Maybe it's more of a due process issue than directly related to the admissibility of the statement.\n\nOption B: having a private lawyer on retainer. This seems somewhat irrelevant unless the defendant requested to speak with his lawyer and was denied. Simply having a lawyer doesn't affect the validity of the waiver unless the defendant asserted his right to counsel.\n\nOption C: arrest without probable cause. This is a big issue because evidence from an unlawful arrest can be suppressed. So, this seems like a strong argument for suppressing the statement.\n\nOption D: warnings given in a language the defendant doesn't understand. This is a clear problem because the Miranda rights must be comprehensible to the defendant for the waiver to be valid.\n\nComparing these, Option C seems like it would be very helpful in suppressing the statement, as it questions the legality of the arrest itself. Option D is also very strong because it directly invalidates the Miranda waiver.\n\nOption A might be less straightforward. While denying bathroom use could be seen as abusive, it may not necessarily render the statement involuntary, especially if there's no direct link shown between the denial and the decision to confess.\n\nOption B seems the least relevant. Having a private lawyer on retainer doesn't automatically mean anything about the defendant's waiver of rights. The defendant still chose to speak to the detective after waiving his rights.\n\nTherefore, I think Option B would be the least helpful in suppressing the statement. The fact that the defendant had a private lawyer on retainer doesn't directly impugn the validity of his waiver or the circumstances under which he made the statement.\n\nBut I should double-check this reasoning. Maybe having a lawyer on retainer could be argued to show that the defendant had a right to counsel that wasn't properly honored. However, in this scenario, the defendant didn't request to speak to his lawyer before speaking to the detective. He voluntarily waived his rights and spoke to the detective.\n\nSo, unless there's some specific law or case precedent that says having a retained attorney requires special procedures, Option B seems indeed the least helpful in suppressing the statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
