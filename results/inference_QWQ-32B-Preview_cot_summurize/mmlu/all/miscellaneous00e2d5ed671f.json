Let me see if I can recall more details about it.\n\nSo, \"Sensation\" was an exhibition that took place in 1999 at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. It featured works by contemporary British artists, and some of the pieces were quite provocative. There was a lot of outrage, especially from politicians and religious leaders, who found some of the artwork offensive.\n\nOne of the most controversial pieces was \"Piss Christ\" by Andres Serrano, which is a photograph of a small plastic crucifix submerged in a glass of the artist's urine. Another contentious piece was \"Myra\" by Marcus Harvey, which was a portrait of Moors murderer Myra Hindley made up of children's handprints.\n\nBecause of the controversy, there were calls for the museum to close the exhibition, and even threats of withdrawing funding. The mayor of New York City at the time, Rudy Giuliani, was particularly vocal in his criticism and refused to provide funding to the museum unless the exhibition was canceled.\n\nThe museum stood its ground, arguing that the exhibition was an important expression of free speech and artistic freedom. The debate went on for months and eventually led to a court case, which the museum won.\n\nIn the end, the exhibition was allowed to continue, and it drew record numbers of visitors who were curious to see the controversial artworks for themselves.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty sure \"Sensation\" is the correct answer here. The other options don't ring any bells for me. \"Sticks & Stones\" sounds familiar, but I don't think it was a national debate about censorship. \"Pulsation\" and \"Black & White\" don't ring any bells at all.\n\nI guess \"Sticks & Stones\" might be another exhibition, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's from a different year or didn't have the same level of national attention.\n\nAnyway, based on what I remember, I'll go with D. Sensation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
