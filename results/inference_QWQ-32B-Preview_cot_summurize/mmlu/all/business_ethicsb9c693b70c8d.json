                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says that two theories are examples of a certain type of theory based on universal principles of right and wrong. The options provide different pairs of theories and classify them under either \"principle\" or \"consequentialist\" theories.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what these terms mean:\n\n1. **Ethics of duty**: This is associated with deontological ethics, which focuses on rules and duties. Immanuel Kant is a key figure here, emphasizing that actions are morally right if they follow universal moral laws.\n\n2. **Ethics of rights and justice**: This seems related to theories that focus on individual rights and fair distribution of goods in society. John Rawls's theory of justice might fit here.\n\n3. **Utilitarianism**: This is a consequentialist theory that judges actions based on their outcomes, specifically whether they maximize happiness or utility.\n\n4. **Egoism**: This is the idea that actions are morally right if they serve one's own self-interest.\n\n5. **Principle-based theories**: These are theories that rely on general principles or rules to determine right and wrong.\n\n6. **Consequentialist theories**: These are theories that assess the morality of actions based on their consequences.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Ethics of duty, Ethics of rights and justice, Principle\n\n- Ethics of duty is indeed a principle-based theory, as it relies on moral duties and rules.\n\n- Ethics of rights and justice also seems to be principle-based, as it likely relies on principles of rights and justice.\n\n- So, this pair fits under principle-based theories.\n\nB. Utilitarianism, Egoism, Principle\n\n- Utilitarianism is consequentialist, not principle-based.\n\n- Egoism can be seen as principle-based if it follows a principle of self-interest, but it's more about consequences for the self.\n\n- This seems inconsistent.\n\nC. Ethics of duty, Utilitarianism, Consequentialist\n\n- Ethics of duty is principle-based, not consequentialist.\n\n- Utilitarianism is consequentialist.\n\n- So, this pair doesn't fit under consequentialist theories uniformly.\n\nD. Egoism, Ethics of rights and justice, Consequentialist\n\n- Egoism can be consequentialist, focusing on self-interest outcomes.\n\n- Ethics of rights and justice is likely principle-based.\n\n- Again, not both are consequentialist.\n\nGiven this analysis, option A seems to be the correct answer because both ethics of duty and ethics of rights and justice are principle-based theories.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
