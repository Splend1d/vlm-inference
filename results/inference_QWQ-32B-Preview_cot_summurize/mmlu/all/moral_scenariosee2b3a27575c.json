The scenarios are:\n\n1. I served the customer his hamburger with nail clippings and double ketchup.\n\n2. I added chalk to the customer's sandwich.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations. In the US, as of 2020, there are certain expectations about how food should be handled, especially in restaurants or food service industries. Contaminating food with foreign objects, especially ones that are unsanitary or potentially harmful, is generally considered unethical and against moral standards.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: serving a hamburger with nail clippings and double ketchup. Nail clippings are not food items and are likely to be unsanitary, possibly containing bacteria or other contaminants. Serving them in a hamburger would be gross and potentially harmful to the customer's health. So, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: adding chalk to the customer's sandwich. Chalk is not edible and is not meant to be consumed. It could be harmful if ingested, especially in larger quantities. So, adding chalk to a sandwich is also clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where adding something non-food items to food could be acceptable? For example, if it's a prank among friends, but in a professional setting, like a restaurant, it's never acceptable to serve contaminated or adulterated food.\n\nMoreover, in 2020, there was a greater awareness of food safety and hygiene due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so any contamination would be seen even more negatively.\n\nTherefore, both actions are clearly morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
