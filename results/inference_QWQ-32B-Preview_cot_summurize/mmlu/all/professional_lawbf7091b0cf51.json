When the art collector described a painting by a well-known artist, the woman indicated she might like to buy that painting. The art collector said, \"I'll sell you the painting for $10,000. I'll give you 30 days to decide whether you want the painting. \" On March 25, the art collector wrote to the woman and stated that the offer of March 15 was withdrawn. The woman received the March 25 letter on March 26. On March 27, the woman wrote the art collector the following letter:\"Please be advised that I hereby accept your offer of March 15. \" The art collector received this letter on March28. Thereafter, the art collector and the woman engaged in several telephone discussions. On April 10, the woman, in a telephone conversation, told the art collector that she would pay $15,000 if the painting was delivered on or before April 15. The art collector agreed to deliver the painting for $15,000. On April 15, the art collector tendered the painting, but the woman refused to pay more than $10,000. If the art collector asserts a claim against the woman for breach of contract, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The art collector is obligated to sell the woman the painting for $10,000, because the woman, as offeree, had the right to accept the initial offer within the 30-day period.\nB.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving an art collector and a woman who's interested in buying a painting. Let's break it down step by step to understand what's going on and determine which statement is the most accurate regarding their contractual obligations.\n\nFirst, on March 15, at a party, the art collector offers to sell the painting to the woman for $10,000 and gives her 30 days to decide. This is a clear offer with specific terms and a set period for acceptance.\n\nThen, on March 25, before the 30 days are up, the art collector writes to the woman saying that the offer from March 15 is withdrawn. The woman receives this letter on March 26.\n\nOn March 27, the woman sends a letter accepting the original offer from March 15, which the art collector receives on March 28.\n\nAfter that, they have some telephone discussions, and on April 10, the woman proposes to pay $15,000 if the painting is delivered by April 15. The art collector agrees to this new terms.\n\nFinally, on April 15, the art collector tenders the painting, but the woman refuses to pay more than $10,000.\n\nNow, the question is, if the art collector sues the woman for breach of contract, which statement is most accurate?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The art collector is obligated to sell the woman the painting for $10,000 because the woman, as offeree, had the right to accept the initial offer within the 30-day period.\n\nB. Since the art collector, as offeror, had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement.\n\nC. Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay the art collector $15,000 for the painting.\n\nD. An enforceable contract does not exist between the parties because of mutual mistake of fact.\n\nAlright, let's analyze these one by one.\n\nOption A suggests that the art collector must sell the painting for $10,000 because the woman could accept the original offer within 30 days. However, the art collector revoked the offer on March 25, and the woman received that revocation on March 26. In contract law, an offer can be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance, as long as the revocation is communicated to the offeree before acceptance. Here, the revocation was communicated before the woman's acceptance on March 27. Therefore, the original offer was effectively revoked, and the woman's acceptance on March 27 is ineffective because the offer was no longer alive. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B states that since the art collector had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement. This seems more plausible. After the original offer was revoked, the parties engaged in further discussions, leading to a new agreement on April 10, where the woman offered $15,000 for delivery by April 15, and the art collector agreed. This appears to be a new contract superseding the original offer. Therefore, the woman would be obligated under this new agreement.\n\nOption C is similar to B but specifies that it's a subsequent modification. While it's true that the April 10 discussion modified the original terms, it's important to note that the original offer was revoked, so the new terms might be considered a new contract rather than a modification of the original.\n\nOption D suggests that no enforceable contract exists due to mutual mistake of fact. There's no indication in the scenario of any mutual mistake regarding a fact material to the contract. Therefore, this option seems unrelated to the issues presented.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B appears to be the most accurate statement. The art collector had the power to revoke the original offer, which was done before the woman's acceptance, making the original offer no longer valid. The subsequent agreement on April 10 establishes new terms, and the woman is obligated under those terms.\n\nHowever, there's a complicating factor: the woman refused to pay more than $10,000 on April 15. This might indicate that there was no meeting of the minds regarding the $15,000 price, but according to the scenario, the art collector agreed to the $15,000 on April 10. If both parties agreed to the new terms on April 10, then the woman is bound by that agreement unless there are other factors at play.\n\nOption C is also tempting, but it's essentially saying the same thing as B, just phrased differently. Both suggest that the parties entered into a new agreement on April 10.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the offer was revoked before acceptance.\n\nOption D is not supported by the facts provided.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is B: Since the art collector, as offeror, had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
