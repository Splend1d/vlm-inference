So, the options are:\n\nA. are a thing of the past.\n\nB. are very severe depressions.\n\nC. are marked by a sustained decline in output.\n\nD. are regular occurrences in capitalist economies.\n\nFirst off, let's think about what a recession actually is. From what I've learned in economics, a recession is typically defined as a significant decline in economic activity that lasts more than a few months. It's usually characterized by reductions in GDP, income, employment, and increased unemployment.\n\nOption A says that recessions are a thing of the past. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I mean, we've definitely heard about recessions happening in recent history, like the global financial crisis in 2008. So, I don't think recessions are something we've overcome forever.\n\nOption B says they are very severe depressions. Now, I know that depressions are more severe than recessions, but not all recessions turn into depressions. In fact, most recessions are milder and don't reach the severity of a depression. So, this might not be the best description.\n\nOption C says recessions are marked by a sustained decline in output. That aligns pretty well with the definition I recalled earlier. A decline in GDP, which is a measure of output, is a key indicator of a recession. So, this seems promising.\n\nOption D says they are regular occurrences in capitalist economies. Well, history shows that recessions do occur periodically in capitalist economies, but \"regular\" might not be the right word because their frequency and severity can vary a lot. Sometimes there are longer periods between recessions, and other times they come closer together.\n\nComparing these options, option C seems the most accurate. It directly ties recessions to a sustained decline in output, which is a fundamental characteristic of recessions.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider whether option D could also be correct. While it's true that recessions do occur in capitalist economies, and they have happened multiple times in history, saying they are \"regular\" occurrences might give the impression that they happen like clockwork, which isn't the case. The timing and severity can be quite variable.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: recessions are marked by a sustained decline in output.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
