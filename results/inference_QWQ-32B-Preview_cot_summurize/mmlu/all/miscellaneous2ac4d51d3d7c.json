He was created by Elzie Crisler Segar and first appeared in the Thimble Theatre comic strip on December 11, 1933. Swee'pea was originally an orphan, and Popeye became his guardian after defeating a gang of criminals who were trying to kidnap him.\n\nThe other options are not associated with Popeye:\n\n- Pun'kin is not a character in the Popeye series.\n\n- Lamikins does not appear in the Popeye comics or cartoons.\n\n- Suga'baby is not a character in the Popeye franchise.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. Swee'pea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
