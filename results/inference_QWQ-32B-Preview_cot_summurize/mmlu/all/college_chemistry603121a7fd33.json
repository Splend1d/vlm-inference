                    "text": "To determine the limiting high-temperature molar heat capacity at constant volume (C_V) for a gas-phase diatomic molecule, we need to consider the contributions from both translational and rotational degrees of freedom, as well as any vibrational degrees of freedom if the temperature is high enough.\n\nAt high temperatures, all degrees of freedom are fully excited, meaning that both translational and rotational energies are maximally populated. For a diatomic molecule, there are three translational degrees of freedom and two rotational degrees of freedom. Additionally, there are two vibrational degrees of freedom (one for stretching and one for bending), but at high temperatures, the vibrational degrees of freedom also contribute to the heat capacity.\n\nThe molar heat capacity at constant volume (C_V) is related to the number of degrees of freedom (f) by the equation:\n\nC_V = (f/2)R\n\nwhere R is the universal gas constant.\n\nFor a diatomic molecule:\n\n- Translational degrees of freedom: 3\n- Rotational degrees of freedom: 2\n- Vibrational degrees of freedom: 2\n\nTherefore, the total number of degrees of freedom is 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.\n\nHowever, in practice, the vibrational degrees of freedom do not always contribute equally at all temperatures. At low temperatures, the vibrational energy levels are widely spaced, and only the lowest energy levels are populated, so the vibrational contribution to the heat capacity is small. As the temperature increases, more vibrational energy levels become populated, and the vibrational contribution to the heat capacity increases.\n\nAt very high temperatures, the vibrational degrees of freedom are fully excited, and their contribution to the heat capacity becomes significant. In this limit, the total number of degrees of freedom is 7, and the molar heat capacity at constant volume is:\n\nC_V = (7/2)R = 3.5R\n\nTherefore, the limiting high-temperature molar heat capacity at constant volume for a gas-phase diatomic molecule is 3.5R.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 3.5R.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
