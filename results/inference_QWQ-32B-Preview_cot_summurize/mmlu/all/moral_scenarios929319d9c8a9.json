I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I pushed the elderly woman around the park.\" Hmm, pushing someone, especially an elderly person, sounds problematic. Elderly people might be frail and could get hurt easily. So, in general, it's not okay to push someone without their consent, and especially not someone who might be vulnerable. So, this seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I poured my daughter her a bowl of cement and told her to eat it.\" This one sounds really bizarre and harmful. Cement is not edible and could be dangerous if consumed. Telling your daughter to eat something that's not food and is potentially harmful seems extremely wrong. It appears to be abusive and negligent. So, this is also clearly morally wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, both scenarios seem morally wrong. So, option A seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think about this again. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn scenario 1, pushing an elderly woman around the park\u2014perhaps it was done gently and with her consent, like helping her move from one place to another. But the way it's phrased, \"pushed around,\" doesn't sound like it was done kindly or with her agreement. It sounds more like bullying or being disrespectful. So, I still think it's wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, pouring cement into a bowl and telling her to eat it\u2014is there any context where this could be acceptable? It seems absolutely harmful and abusive. There's no way that's okay.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
