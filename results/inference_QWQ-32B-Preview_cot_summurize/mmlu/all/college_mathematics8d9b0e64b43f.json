                    "text": "So I have this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nWe have a discrete random variable X defined on the positive integers, and the probability that X equals any positive integer n is 1/2^n. So, P(X = n) = 1/2^n for n = 1, 2, 3, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, there's another random variable Y with the same probability distribution, and X and Y are independent.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that at least one of these variables, X or Y, is greater than 3.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what it means for at least one of them to be greater than 3. That means either X > 3, or Y > 3, or both.\n\nSince X and Y are independent, maybe I can use that property to find the probability.\n\nBut sometimes, it's easier to find the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from 1.\n\nThe complementary event of \"at least one of X or Y is greater than 3\" is \"both X and Y are less than or equal to 3.\"\n\nSo, P(at least one of X or Y > 3) = 1 - P(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3).\n\nAnd because X and Y are independent, P(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) = P(X \u2264 3) * P(Y \u2264 3).\n\nSince X and Y have the same distribution, P(X \u2264 3) = P(Y \u2264 3).\n\nSo, P(at least one of X or Y > 3) = 1 - [P(X \u2264 3)]^2.\n\nTherefore, I need to find P(X \u2264 3).\n\nP(X \u2264 3) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3).\n\nGiven that P(X = n) = 1/2^n, so:\n\nP(X = 1) = 1/2\n\nP(X = 2) = 1/4\n\nP(X = 3) = 1/8\n\nSo, P(X \u2264 3) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 4/8 + 2/8 + 1/8 = 7/8.\n\nTherefore, P(at least one of X or Y > 3) = 1 - (7/8)^2 = 1 - 49/64 = 15/64.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nIs there another way to approach this?\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability that X > 3 or Y > 3.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nP(X > 3 or Y > 3) = P(X > 3) + P(Y > 3) - P(X > 3 and Y > 3).\n\nSince X and Y are independent, P(X > 3 and Y > 3) = P(X > 3) * P(Y > 3).\n\nAnd since X and Y have the same distribution, P(X > 3) = P(Y > 3).\n\nP(X > 3) = 1 - P(X \u2264 3) = 1 - 7/8 = 1/8.\n\nSo, P(X > 3 or Y > 3) = 1/8 + 1/8 - (1/8 * 1/8) = 1/8 + 1/8 - 1/64.\n\nThat's 2/8 - 1/64 = 16/64 - 1/64 = 15/64.\n\nOkay, that matches the previous result.\n\nSo, the probability is 15/64.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1/64\n\nB. 15/64\n\nC. 1/4\n\nD. 3/8\n\nOption B is 15/64, which matches our answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I confirmed that P(X \u2264 3) = 7/8.\n\nThen, P(at least one > 3) = 1 - (7/8)^2 = 1 - 49/64 = 15/64.\n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion, I got the same result.\n\nSo, I think this is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list all possible outcomes for X and Y, but since they can be any positive integer, that's not practical.\n\nAlternatively, since they're independent and have the same distribution, the probability calculations simplify as above.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 15/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{64}} \\]"
