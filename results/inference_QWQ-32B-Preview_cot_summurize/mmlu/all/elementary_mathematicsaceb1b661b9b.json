                    "text": "Let's see which of these numbers is a multiple of 7. I have options A. 27, B. 48, C. 56, and D. 74. I need to figure out which one of these can be divided by 7 without leaving a remainder.\n\nFirst, I know that a multiple of 7 is any number that can be expressed as 7 times some integer. So, if I can find an integer that, when multiplied by 7, gives me one of these numbers, then that's my answer.\n\nLet me start with option A, which is 27. I'll divide 27 by 7 to see if it's a multiple.\n\n27 \u00f7 7 = 3.857...\n\nThat's not a whole number; there's a decimal. So, 27 is not a multiple of 7.\n\nNext, option B, which is 48.\n\n48 \u00f7 7 = 6.857...\n\nAgain, not a whole number. So, 48 is not a multiple of 7.\n\nNow, option C, 56.\n\n56 \u00f7 7 = 8\n\nThat's a whole number. 7 times 8 is 56. So, 56 is a multiple of 7.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check option D, which is 74.\n\n74 \u00f7 7 = 10.571...\n\nNot a whole number, so 74 is not a multiple of 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 56.\n\nAlternatively, I could have multiplied 7 by different integers to see which one matches one of the options.\n\n7 \u00d7 1 = 7\n\n7 \u00d7 2 = 14\n\n7 \u00d7 3 = 21\n\n7 \u00d7 4 = 28\n\n7 \u00d7 5 = 35\n\n7 \u00d7 6 = 42\n\n7 \u00d7 7 = 49\n\n7 \u00d7 8 = 56\n\nAh, there it is. 7 \u00d7 8 = 56, which is option C.\n\nSo, yes, 56 is a multiple of 7.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Is there anything else I should consider?\n\nWell, maybe I should make sure that none of the other options are multiples of 7, just to be sure.\n\nI already checked them, but let me quickly verify again.\n\nOption A: 27\n\n7 \u00d7 3 = 21, which is less than 27\n\n7 \u00d7 4 = 28, which is more than 27\n\nSo, 27 is not a multiple of 7.\n\nOption B: 48\n\n7 \u00d7 6 = 42\n\n7 \u00d7 7 = 49\n\n48 is between 42 and 49, so it's not a multiple of 7.\n\nOption C: 56\n\n7 \u00d7 8 = 56\n\nYes, that's a multiple.\n\nOption D: 74\n\n7 \u00d7 10 = 70\n\n7 \u00d7 11 = 77\n\n74 is between 70 and 77, so not a multiple of 7.\n\nTherefore, the only multiple of 7 in the options provided is 56.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
