The options are A. 0.4, B. 2.5, C. 16.7, and D. 70. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what flow rate means. Flow rate is basically how much water is flowing per unit of time, and in this case, it's gallons per second. So, if I have a certain amount of water that I need to fill into the tank within a specific time, the flow rate is that amount divided by the time.\n\nSo, the formula for flow rate should be:\n\nFlow rate = Volume / Time\n\nYes, that makes sense. The volume is 50 gallons, and the time is 20 seconds. So, plugging in the numbers:\n\nFlow rate = 50 gallons / 20 seconds\n\nNow, let's do the math. 50 divided by 20 is 2.5. So, the flow rate is 2.5 gallons per second.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe I'm missing something. Is there any other factor I need to consider, like the shape of the tank or anything? The problem just says the tank holds 50 gallons and I need to fill it in 20 seconds. It seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the units. Gallons and seconds are straightforward, but sometimes there are conversions or something, but in this case, it's just gallons per second, which is the unit they're asking for.\n\nLet me see, perhaps there's a trick here. Maybe the tank has a certain shape that affects the fill rate, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It seems like a simple division problem.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, it's 2.5 gallons per second. Looking back at the options, B is 2.5, so that should be the answer.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using proportions or something. Suppose I have a flow rate of 1 gallon per second; in 20 seconds, that would fill 20 gallons. But I need 50 gallons, so I need to find out how many times 20 goes into 50, which is 2.5 times. So, 2.5 gallons per second.\n\nAlright, that matches my previous calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 2.5 gallons per second, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
