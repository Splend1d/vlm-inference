                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: There's a tournament with 393 players, and each team has 3 players. I need to find out how many teams there are in the tournament. The question is, which expression should I use to find the number of teams? The options are:\n\nA. 393 + 3\n\nB. 393 \u2013 3\n\nC. 393 \u00d7 3\n\nD. 393 \u00f7 3\n\nAlright, let's think about this. I have 393 players, and each team consists of 3 players. So, to find out how many teams there are, I need to see how many groups of 3 players there are in total.\n\nHmm, addition (option A) would mean adding more players, which isn't what I need. Subtraction (option B) would reduce the number of players, which also doesn't help me find the number of teams. Multiplication (option C) would increase the number of players, which again doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nThat leaves division (option D). Dividing the total number of players by the number of players per team should give me the number of teams. Let me test this with smaller numbers to see if it makes sense.\n\nSuppose there are 6 players and each team has 2 players. How many teams would there be? Well, 6 divided by 2 is 3, so there would be 3 teams. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, if there are 9 players and each team has 3 players, 9 divided by 3 is 3 teams again.\n\nSo, in general, to find the number of teams, I should divide the total number of players by the number of players per team.\n\nTherefore, in this problem, it's 393 divided by 3.\n\nLet me just double-check. If I add 3 to 393 (option A), I get 396, which is just more players, not the number of teams.\n\nIf I subtract 3 from 393 (option B), I get 390, which is fewer players, but again, not the number of teams.\n\nIf I multiply 393 by 3 (option C), I get 1179, which is way more than the total number of players, and doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOnly division (option D) seems to logically give me the number of teams.\n\nSo, the correct expression is 393 \u00f7 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
