                    "text": "I'm going to go with option D: tell her that you cannot discuss her son\u2019s condition with her. Here's why:\n\nFirst off, as a psychologist, I have to respect client confidentiality. That means I can't share information about a client with anyone without their consent, unless there are specific exceptions, like if the client is a danger to themselves or others.\n\nIn this case, the client is 31 years old, which means he's an adult. Even if his mother is concerned about him, I can't breach client confidentiality without his permission. It's important to maintain trust in the therapeutic relationship, and breaking confidentiality without consent can damage that trust.\n\nOption A, advising her in general terms, might seem helpful, but it could still involve sharing information about her son's condition, which isn't appropriate without his consent.\n\nOption B, suggesting she make an appointment to discuss the matter in person, is tricky. While it might be a way to have a conversation without disclosing confidential information, it could still imply that you have information to share about her son, which you don't have permission to do.\n\nOption C, suggesting she come to therapy with her son at his next appointment, could be an option if the client agrees. However, without his consent, you can't invite her to join a session. Moreover, it's the client's choice whether he wants his mother involved in his therapy.\n\nSo, the most ethical choice is D: tell her that you cannot discuss her son\u2019s condition with her. It's important to be straightforward and explain that due to confidentiality rules, you're unable to share any information about her son's treatment without his consent.\n\nAt the same time, you could offer some general support and encouragement for the mother. For example, you might say something like, \"I understand your concern for your son, and I appreciate your interest in his well-being. However, due to confidentiality rules, I'm unable to discuss any details about his treatment. I encourage you to support him in continuing his therapy, and if he feels comfortable, he can decide whether to involve you in his treatment process.\"\n\nThis way, you're acknowledging her concerns without violating professional ethics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
