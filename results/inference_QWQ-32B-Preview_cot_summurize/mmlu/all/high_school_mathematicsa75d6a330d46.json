The binomial theorem states that:\n\n\\[\n(m + n)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} m^{6 - k} n^k\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are both odd, we need to determine for which values of \\(k\\) the term \\(\\binom{6}{k} m^{6 - k} n^k\\) is odd.\n\nFirst, note that since \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are odd, any power of \\(m\\) or \\(n\\) will also be odd because odd numbers raised to any positive integer power remain odd.\n\nTherefore, the parity (odd or even nature) of each term in the expansion depends solely on the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\), because:\n\n- \\(m^{6 - k}\\) is odd for all \\(k\\).\n\n- \\(n^k\\) is odd for all \\(k\\).\n\n- The product of odd numbers is odd.\n\n- Multiplying by an even binomial coefficient will make the entire term even.\n\nHence, we need to find the number of binomial coefficients \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) that are odd.\n\nLet's compute the binomial coefficients for \\( (m + n)^6 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\binom{6}{0} &= 1 \\\\\n\\binom{6}{1} &= 6 \\\\\n\\binom{6}{2} &= 15 \\\\\n\\binom{6}{3} &= 20 \\\\\n\\binom{6}{4} &= 15 \\\\\n\\binom{6}{5} &= 6 \\\\\n\\binom{6}{6} &= 1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's identify which of these coefficients are odd:\n\n- \\(\\binom{6}{0} = 1\\) (odd)\n\n- \\(\\binom{6}{1} = 6\\) (even)\n\n- \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) (odd)\n\n- \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\) (even)\n\n- \\(\\binom{6}{4} = 15\\) (odd)\n\n- \\(\\binom{6}{5} = 6\\) (even)\n\n- \\(\\binom{6}{6} = 1\\) (odd)\n\nSo, the odd binomial coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{0}\\), \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\), \\(\\binom{6}{4}\\), and \\(\\binom{6}{6}\\). That's a total of 4 odd terms.\n\nTherefore, the number of odd terms in the expansion of \\((m + n)^6\\) is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]\n"
