                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a minor plaintiff and a witness who is also a child. So, there's a lawsuit because a young boy was permanently injured by a car accident, and his father is suing on his behalf. At trial, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer wants to call the plaintiff\u2019s friend, who was also a kid at the time\u2014four years old when the accident happened, and now seven years old when testifying.\n\nThe issue is that it\u2019s determined the friend didn\u2019t have the capacity to perceive and relate what happened when the accident occurred. So, I need to decide whether this friend is competent to testify or not, based on the options given.\n\nOption A says the friend is competent to testify because he had personal knowledge of the accident. Well, he was there, so he has personal knowledge. But the problem is that he was only four years old at the time, and it\u2019s said he lacked the capacity to perceive and relate the accident then. So, maybe his understanding wasn\u2019t sufficient.\n\nOption B says he\u2019s competent because he\u2019s seven years old now, and there\u2019s some presumption about chronological maturity. I\u2019m not sure about that. Age can be a factor, but it seems like the key issue is whether he could understand and recall the events accurately, especially since he was younger when it happened.\n\nOption C says he\u2019s incompetent because he lacked the capacity to perceive and relate the accident at the time it occurred. That seems relevant. If he couldn\u2019t understand what was happening or remember it properly, then maybe he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to testify.\n\nOption D says he\u2019s incompetent because all children under 10 are deemed incompetent to testify. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a general rule. Maybe in some places, but it doesn\u2019t sound universally true.\n\nI think the key here is the capacity to perceive and relate the events, especially at the time they occurred. If someone didn\u2019t have the mental capacity to understand and remember what happened when it happened, it might not matter how old they are now. Their testimony might not be reliable.\n\nSo, option C seems most appropriate. He\u2019s incompetent because he lacked the capacity to perceive and relate the accident at the time of its occurrence.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there\u2019s a legal principle I\u2019m missing. In law, competency to testify usually depends on whether the witness can understand the obligation to tell the truth and whether they can observe, recall, and narrate events. Age can be a factor, but it\u2019s not the only one.\n\nIn this case, the witness was very young at the time of the accident, and it\u2019s determined he lacked the capacity to perceive and relate it. So, even if now he\u2019s a bit older, his testimony about that past event might still be unreliable.\n\nTherefore, the court should rule that the friend is incompetent to testify, based on option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
