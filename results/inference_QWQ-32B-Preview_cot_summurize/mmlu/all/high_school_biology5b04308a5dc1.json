                    "text": "Let's see, I need to pick the correct characteristic of arteries from these options. Let me think about what I know about arteries.\n\nFirst, arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. I remember that \"artery\" and \"away\" both start with 'a', which might be a helpful mnemonic. So, option D says \"They carry blood away from the heart,\" which seems correct.\n\nNow, option A says \"They are thin-walled blood vessels.\" Hmm, I think arteries actually have thick walls because they need to withstand the high pressure of blood being pumped from the heart. So, thin-walled doesn't sound right for arteries.\n\nOption B mentions \"They contain valves that prevent backflow.\" I know that veins have valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards, especially when blood is moving against gravity. But I'm not sure if arteries have valves. I think in most arteries, blood flow is unidirectional due to the heart's pumping action, so valves might not be necessary. Maybe exceptions exist, like in the aorta, but generally, arteries don't have valves.\n\nOption C states \"They always carry oxygenated blood.\" Well, usually, arteries carry oxygenated blood because they're carrying it from the heart to the body's tissues. But there's an exception: the pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs to pick up oxygen. So, it's not always true that arteries carry oxygenated blood.\n\nConsidering all this, option D seems to be the most accurate characteristic of arteries. They carry blood away from the heart, regardless of the oxygen content.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
