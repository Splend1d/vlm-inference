                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find out how many odd perfect squares are between 5 and 211. The options are 2, 25, 6, and 75. Hmm, that's a range from 5 to 211, and I'm only interested in odd perfect squares within that range.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a perfect square is. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. So, for example, 1 is 1\u00b2, 4 is 2\u00b2, 9 is 3\u00b2, and so on. Now, the problem specifies odd perfect squares. So, I need to consider only those perfect squares that are odd.\n\nI know that the square of an odd number is odd, and the square of an even number is even. Therefore, to get odd perfect squares, I should consider squares of odd integers.\n\nSo, let's list out the squares of odd integers and see which ones fall between 5 and 211.\n\nLet's start with the smallest odd integer greater than the square root of 5.\n\nThe square root of 5 is approximately 2.236, so the smallest integer greater than that is 3.\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n5\u00b2 = 25\n\n7\u00b2 = 49\n\n9\u00b2 = 81\n\n11\u00b2 = 121\n\n13\u00b2 = 169\n\n15\u00b2 = 225\n\nWait, but 225 is greater than 211, so that's outside our range.\n\nSo, the odd perfect squares between 5 and 211 are:\n\n9, 25, 49, 81, 121, and 169.\n\nLet me count them: 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169. That's six numbers.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there are any more beyond 13\u00b2.\n\n13\u00b2 is 169, which is less than 211.\n\n15\u00b2 is 225, which is greater than 211, so that's out.\n\nSo, the odd perfect squares in this range are indeed 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, and 169.\n\nThat's a total of six.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 6 is one of the choices. However, let's make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there a more systematic way to approach this?\n\nYes, perhaps.\n\nI can consider that perfect squares of odd integers are (2n+1)\u00b2, where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nLet's set up inequalities:\n\n5 < (2n+1)\u00b2 < 211\n\nI need to solve for n such that this inequality holds.\n\nFirst, solve (2n+1)\u00b2 > 5.\n\nTaking square roots: 2n+1 > sqrt(5) \u2248 2.236\n\nSo, 2n > 1.236 \u21d2 n > 0.618\n\nSince n is an integer, n \u2265 1.\n\nNext, solve (2n+1)\u00b2 < 211.\n\nTaking square roots: 2n+1 < sqrt(211) \u2248 14.526\n\nSo, 2n < 13.526 \u21d2 n < 6.763\n\nSince n is an integer, n \u2264 6.\n\nTherefore, n can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\nFor n=1: (2*1+1)\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 = 9\n\nn=2: 5\u00b2 = 25\n\nn=3: 7\u00b2 = 49\n\nn=4: 9\u00b2 = 81\n\nn=5: 11\u00b2 = 121\n\nn=6: 13\u00b2 = 169\n\nThat's the same list as before: 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169.\n\nSo, there are six odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.\n\nBut wait, the options include 2, 25, 6, and 75. So, 6 is an option, but maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nIs there a possibility that 1 is included?\n\nWait, n starts from 1, but what about n=0?\n\nn=0: (2*0+1)\u00b2 = 1\u00b2 = 1\n\nBut 1 is less than 5, so it's not in the range.\n\nTherefore, n starts from 1 to 6, giving us six perfect squares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question includes both endpoints, but no, it says between 5 and 211, so 5 and 211 are excluded.\n\nWait, the problem says \"between 5 and 211\", which typically means excluding 5 and 211.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if including them changes anything.\n\nIf including 5 and 211, then we'd have to check if 5 and 211 are odd perfect squares, which they are not.\n\n5 is not a perfect square, and 211 is not a perfect square.\n\nSo, it doesn't affect the count.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6.\n\nBut why is 25 one of the options? Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps 25 is included in the list, but 25 is 5\u00b2, which is an odd perfect square between 5 and 211.\n\nYes, it is included in my list.\n\nWait, no, 25 is in the list, but 25 is one of the squares, not the count.\n\nThe count is 6.\n\nWait, maybe the options are mislabeled, but based on the problem, the count is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering 1 as included, but 1 is less than 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation of \"between.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the number of odd integers whose squares are between 5 and 211.\n\nWait, in that case, it's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the upper limit differently.\n\nLet me check the square root of 211 more precisely.\n\nsqrt(211) \u2248 14.526, so the largest odd integer less than 14.526 is 13, which is correct.\n\nSo, n=6 gives 13\u00b2=169, which is less than 211.\n\nn=7 would be 15\u00b2=225, which is greater than 211, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, n=1 to n=6, which is six perfect squares.\n\nSo, the answer should be 6.\n\nBut the options include 2, 25, 6, and 75.\n\nGiven that, and assuming the problem is correctly stated, the answer should be 6.\n\nPerhaps there is a misprint or mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the number of odd integers whose squares are between 5 and 211, inclusive or exclusive.\n\nBut based on my calculations, it should be 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering 1 as included, but 1\u00b2=1, which is less than 5.\n\nTherefore, not included.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
