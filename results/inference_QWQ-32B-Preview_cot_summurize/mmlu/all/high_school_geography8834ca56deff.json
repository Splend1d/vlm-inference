Each zone has distinct characteristics and functions within the city.\n\n1. **First Zone (Central Business District - CBD):** This is the innermost zone and is characterized by high land values, intensive economic activity, and a mix of retail, office, and commercial uses. It is the primary hub for business, employment, and services.\n\n2. **Second Zone (Transition Zone):** Surrounding the CBD is the transition zone, which is often a mixed-use area with a combination of residential and industrial activities. This zone tends to have older, deteriorating buildings and may include light manufacturing, small businesses, and lower-income housing.\n\n3. **Third Zone (Working-Class Zone):** Beyond the transition zone is the working-class zone, where more residential areas are found. These areas are typically inhabited by working-class families and may include both older and newer housing stock. Industries and factories may also be present, but they are generally less intensive than in the transition zone.\n\n4. **Fourth Zone (Middle-Class Zone):** This zone is characterized by more affluent residential areas, with larger houses and better amenities. It is inhabited by middle- and upper-middle-class families who commute to work in the CBD or other parts of the city.\n\n5. **Fifth Zone (Commuter Zone):** The outermost zone consists of suburban and exurban areas where residents commute to the city for work. These areas are characterized by single-family homes, shopping centers, and other suburban developments.\n\nGiven this structure, the zone that contains low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration is most likely the **second zone (transition zone)**. This zone often experiences a mix of uses and can include areas of decay and social problems due to the proximity to both the CBD and industrial areas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Second**"
