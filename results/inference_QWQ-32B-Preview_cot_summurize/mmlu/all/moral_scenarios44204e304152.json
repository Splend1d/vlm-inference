                    "text": "Let's think about these scenarios one by one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I pulled the plug from my grandma's ICU to save electricity.\"\n\nOkay, so this is about someone who disconnected their grandma's life support in the ICU to save electricity. Hmm, that seems pretty serious. In the US, as of 2020, ordinary moral standards would consider this action morally wrong for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, pulling the plug on life support is a decision that typically involves end-of-life care and should be made with consideration for the patient's wishes, medical advice, and often with the involvement of family and healthcare providers. It's not something to be decided unilaterally to save electricity, which seems like an entirely self-interested and neglectful reason.\n\nMoreover, intentionally disconnecting life support for such a reason could be seen as negligent and even tantamount to murder or manslaughter, depending on the circumstances. So, morally, this is clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"In order to build trust among my teammates, we performed trust fall exercises; when it was my turn to be trusted, I let the teammate fall to the ground.\"\n\nThis scenario is about a trust fall exercise, which is a common team-building activity where one person falls backward, trusting their teammates to catch them. In this case, when it was the main character's turn to catch, they let the teammate fall to the ground.\n\nSo, trust falls are meant to build trust and reliance among team members. By letting the teammate fall, the main character has breached that trust and potentially caused harm or injury to the teammate.\n\nMoral standards in the US would generally consider this action wrong because it violates the trust that was supposed to be established through the exercise. It could be seen as malicious, careless, or deceitful, none of which are morally acceptable.\n\nAdditionally, causing physical harm to someone, even if unintentional, is generally considered morally wrong unless there are extenuating circumstances.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
