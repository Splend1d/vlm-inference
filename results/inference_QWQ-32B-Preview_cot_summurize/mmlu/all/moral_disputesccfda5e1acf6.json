                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about Kamm's argument in response to Sandel's views on genetic enhancement and parent-child relationships. The options are:\n\nA. Genetic transformation will actually strengthen the bond between parent and child.\n\nB. Children are too young to understand the implications of genetic enhancement.\n\nC. Sandel's reasoning does not rule out the use of moderate, worthwhile genetic transformation.\n\nD. The use of training and appliances as a way of transforming gifts is not, as Sandel argues, morally permissible.\n\nI need to figure out which one correctly represents Kamm's position.\n\nFirst, I remember that Sandel argues against genetic enhancement because it can lead to a kind of \"hyper-parenting\" where parents try to control every aspect of their child's development, which could damage the natural relationship between parent and child. He worries that this kind of control can turn children into products of their parents' desires rather than autonomous beings.\n\nNow, Kamm is responding to Sandel's argument. So, I need to think about what Kamm might be saying in contrast or addition to Sandel's views.\n\nOption A says that genetic transformation will actually strengthen the bond between parent and child. Hmm, that seems like a direct opposition to Sandel's concern that it could damage the relationship. But I'm not sure if Kamm is arguing that genetic transformation inherently strengthens bonds. Maybe, but I need to think more about it.\n\nOption B says that children are too young to understand the implications of genetic enhancement. Well, that might be true, but I don't recall Kamm specifically making that point in relation to Sandel's argument. It seems more like a general observation rather than a direct response to Sandel.\n\nOption C says that Sandel's reasoning does not rule out the use of moderate, worthwhile genetic transformation. This sounds interesting. Maybe Kamm is suggesting that while Sandel argues against genetic enhancement in principle, his arguments don't necessarily apply to all forms of genetic transformation, especially those that are moderate and have clear benefits.\n\nOption D says that the use of training and appliances to transform gifts is not morally permissible, contrary to Sandel's argument. I'm a bit confused about this one. Sandel might be drawing a distinction between natural talents and those that are enhanced or developed through training and appliances, arguing that the latter somehow diminishes the purity of natural giftedness. If Kamm is arguing that Sandel is wrong about this, then maybe she's saying that using training and appliances to enhance abilities is morally acceptable.\n\nWait, I need to recall the specifics of Kamm's response to Sandel. I think Kamm is trying to nuanced Sandel's position, perhaps by arguing that not all forms of genetic enhancement are problematic, and that some forms could be acceptable under certain conditions.\n\nLet me consider Option C again: \"Sandel's reasoning does not rule out the use of moderate, worthwhile genetic transformation.\" This seems plausible. Maybe Kamm is saying that Sandel's concerns about the impact on parent-child relationships are valid in some extreme cases of genetic enhancement, but that his arguments don't necessarily apply to more moderate enhancements that could improve a child's life without overly controlling their development.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Kamm is arguing that the bond between parent and child can actually be strengthened by genetic enhancements that are done with the child's best interests in mind, which would align more with Option A.\n\nBut I think Option C is more accurate because it suggests that Kamm is critiquing Sandel's broad prohibition against genetic enhancement by pointing out that his arguments don't preclude all forms of genetic transformation, especially those that are moderate and have clear benefits.\n\nOption D seems a bit off because it's talking about training and appliances, which might be related but seem like a side point compared to the main issue of genetic enhancement.\n\nAlso, Option B about children being too young to understand genetic enhancement might be true, but I don't think it directly addresses Sandel's argument about the nature of the parent-child relationship.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is Option C: Kamm argues that Sandel's reasoning does not rule out the use of moderate, worthwhile genetic transformation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
