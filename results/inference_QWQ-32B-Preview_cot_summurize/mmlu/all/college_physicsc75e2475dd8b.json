                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about springs and their force constants. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are two springs involved: one with a force constant k, and another one with an unknown force constant that we need to find. The problem says that it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half the distance that the first spring is stretched. I need to find the force constant of the second spring based on that information.\n\nFirst, I should recall Hooke's Law, which relates the force exerted by a spring to its extension. Hooke's Law states that the force F is equal to the force constant k times the extension x, so F = kx. But in this problem, we're dealing with work, which is the energy transferred when a force moves an object over a distance.\n\nThe work done to stretch a spring can be calculated using the formula for elastic potential energy, which is W = (1/2)kx\u00b2, where k is the spring constant and x is the extension. So, for the first spring, the work done to stretch it by a certain distance x is W\u2081 = (1/2)kx\u00b2.\n\nNow, for the second spring, it's stretched by half that distance, so the extension is x/2. The work done to stretch the second spring is W\u2082 = (1/2)k\u2082(x/2)\u00b2, where k\u2082 is the force constant of the second spring.\n\nAccording to the problem, it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half the distance that the first spring is stretched. So, W\u2082 = 2W\u2081.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for W\u2081 and W\u2082, we get:\n\n(1/2)k\u2082(x/2)\u00b2 = 2*(1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n(1/2)k\u2082*(x\u00b2/4) = (1/8)k\u2082x\u00b2\n\nRight side:\n\n2*(1/2)kx\u00b2 = kx\u00b2\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n(1/8)k\u2082x\u00b2 = kx\u00b2\n\nNow, I can cancel out x\u00b2 from both sides, assuming x \u2260 0:\n\n(1/8)k\u2082 = k\n\nThen, solving for k\u2082:\n\nk\u2082 = 8k\n\nSo, the force constant of the second spring is 8 times that of the first spring.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nStarting again:\n\nW\u2082 = (1/2)k\u2082(x/2)\u00b2\n\nW\u2081 = (1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nGiven that W\u2082 = 2W\u2081, so:\n\n(1/2)k\u2082(x/2)\u00b2 = 2*(1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nSimplify (1/2)k\u2082(x\u00b2/4) = kx\u00b2\n\nWhich is (1/8)k\u2082x\u00b2 = kx\u00b2\n\nCancel x\u00b2:\n\n(1/8)k\u2082 = k\n\nTherefore, k\u2082 = 8k\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the force constant of the second spring is 8 times that of the first spring.\n\nBut let me think about this intuitively. If it takes more work to stretch the second spring by half the distance, that suggests that the second spring is stiffer, meaning it has a higher force constant.\n\nLet's see, work is force times distance, but since the force changes as the spring stretches, we use the integral, which gives us the (1/2)kx\u00b2 formula.\n\nSo, if W\u2082 = 2W\u2081, and x\u2082 = x/2, then plugging into W = (1/2)kx\u00b2:\n\n(1/2)k\u2082(x/2)\u00b2 = 2*(1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1/2)k\u2082(x\u00b2/4) = kx\u00b2\n\n(1/8)k\u2082x\u00b2 = kx\u00b2\n\nAgain, (1/8)k\u2082 = k\n\nThus, k\u2082 = 8k\n\nSo, the force constant of the second spring is 8 times that of the first spring.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 8k\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
