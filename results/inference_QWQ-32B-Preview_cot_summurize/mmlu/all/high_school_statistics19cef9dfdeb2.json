There are 1650 students in total, and out of these, 132 have personal investments in the stock market. Two plans are proposed for estimating the total investment:\n\n**Plan I:**\n\n- Sample 30 students at random from all 1650 students.\n\n- Find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment.\n\n- Multiply both ends of this interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment.\n\n**Plan II:**\n\n- Sample 30 students at random from the 132 who have investments in the market.\n\n- Find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment.\n\n- Multiply both ends of this interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment.\n\nWe need to determine which plan is better for estimating the total stock market investment by students in the school.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each plan is trying to estimate.\n\n**Plan I:**\n\n- This plan involves sampling from the entire student population, including those who do not have any investments.\n\n- For students without investments, their investment amount is zero.\n\n- The average investment in this sample will be the average of investments of some students who invest and some who do not.\n\n- Multiplying this average by the total number of students (1650) would give an estimate of the total investment.\n\n**Plan II:**\n\n- This plan involves sampling only from the students who have investments in the stock market.\n\n- The average investment in this sample will be the average of investments only among those who invest.\n\n- Multiplying this average by the number of students who invest (132) would give an estimate of the total investment.\n\nNow, let's think about the accuracy of each plan.\n\n**Plan I:**\n\n- Sampling from the entire student population includes many students with zero investment.\n\n- The variability in investments in this sample will be high because some students have investments (possibly ranging from small to large amounts), and many have zero investment.\n\n- This high variability can lead to a wider confidence interval, making the estimate less precise.\n\n**Plan II:**\n\n- Sampling only from students who have investments focuses on those who actually contribute to the total investment.\n\n- The variability in investments among these students might be lower or higher depending on the distribution of their investments.\n\n- However, since all students in this sample have investments, the average investment is directly related to the total investment by multiplying by the number of investors.\n\nNow, considering the goal is to estimate the total investment, which is the sum of investments by the 132 students who invest.\n\n**Plan I:**\n\n- Estimates the average investment per student in the entire school and scales it up to the total number of students.\n\n- This approach assumes that the average investment of the sample is representative of the entire school, including non-investors.\n\n- However, since most students do not invest, the average investment in the school is very small (only 132 out of 1650 students invest), and the total investment is concentrated among a small fraction of students.\n\n- This method may not accurately capture the investment behavior of the investing students because the sample includes many non-investors.\n\n**Plan II:**\n\n- Directly samples from the investing students, focusing on those who actually have investments.\n\n- This approach estimates the average investment among investors and then scales it up by the number of investors.\n\n- This seems more direct and efficient because it concentrates on the group that contributes to the total investment.\n\n- The variability in investments among investors might be higher than in the general student population, but the sample is more relevant to the total investment.\n\nComparing the two plans:\n\n- **Plan I** includes many students with zero investment, which may dilute the estimate and make it less precise.\n\n- **Plan II** focuses only on students who invest, which should provide a more accurate estimate of the average investment per investor and, consequently, a better estimate of the total investment.\n\nTherefore, **Plan II** is the better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
