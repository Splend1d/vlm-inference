                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. We have two scenarios, and we need to determine which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I led the innocent man to the gallows.\"\n\nOkay, so this sounds pretty serious. Leading an innocent man to the gallows suggests that someone is being executed for a crime they didn't commit. In the US, our justice system is based on the principle that innocent people should not be punished, especially not with the death penalty. Executing an innocent person is considered a grave miscarriage of justice and morally wrong.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character is actively leading an innocent man to his execution. That seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, let's consider Scenario 2: \"When I visited at my grandma's house, I replaced the batteries in her smoke alarms.\"\n\nHmm, this seems like a responsible thing to do. Smoke alarms are important for safety, especially in elderly people's homes where they might not be able to replace batteries themselves. By replacing the batteries, the main character is ensuring that the smoke alarm works properly, which could prevent a fire from going undetected.\n\nThis action appears to be thoughtful and considerate, aligning with moral standards that encourage helping and protecting vulnerable family members.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves leading an innocent man to execution, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves replacing batteries in smoke alarms, which is a positive and responsible action.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the correct answer should be:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
