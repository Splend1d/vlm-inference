It says: \"Applications developed by programming languages like ____ and ______ have this common buffer-overflow error.\" And then there are options:\n\nA. C, Ruby\n\nB. Python, Ruby\n\nC. C, C++\n\nD. Tcl, C#\n\nI need to pick the pair of languages that commonly have buffer-overflow errors.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a buffer-overflow error is. From what I know, a buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to put more data into a buffer than it can hold, or when data is written outside the buffer's boundaries. This can lead to corrupting data, crashing the program, or even allowing malicious code to execute.\n\nNow, not all programming languages are equally prone to buffer overflows. Some languages handle memory management automatically and have safeguards against accessing memory outside allocated buffers, while others give developers more control over memory, which can be powerful but also risky if not managed properly.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nOption A: C and Ruby.\n\nC is a language that gives developers low-level control over memory, which means you can manually manage buffers and memory allocation. This flexibility is great for performance but also means that if you're not careful, you can overwrite buffer boundaries, leading to buffer overflows.\n\nRuby, on the other hand, is a high-level language with automatic memory management. It has built-in safeguards to prevent buffer overflows, so it's less likely to have this kind of error compared to C.\n\nSo, C is prone to buffer overflows, but Ruby is not as much.\n\nOption B: Python and Ruby.\n\nBoth Python and Ruby are high-level languages with automatic memory management. They have abstraction layers that handle memory allocation and deallocation, which generally prevent buffer overflows. So, I don't think this is the correct pair.\n\nOption C: C and C++.\n\nC++ is an extension of C that adds object-oriented features, among other things. Like C, C++ also gives developers low-level control over memory, which means buffer overflows are possible if not managed carefully.\n\nSo, both C and C++ are languages where buffer overflows can be a common issue.\n\nOption D: Tcl and C#.\n\nTcl is a scripting language that, like Python and Ruby, handles memory management automatically, so it's less prone to buffer overflows.\n\nC# is a modern, managed language that runs on a virtual machine (the CLR \u2013 Common Language Runtime). It has safety features that prevent buffer overflows by managing memory and enforcing bounds checking on arrays.\n\nTherefore, neither Tcl nor C# is typically associated with buffer-overflow errors.\n\nConsidering all this, option C, C and C++, seems to be the correct answer. Both of these languages allow direct memory manipulation, which can lead to buffer overflows if not handled properly.\n\nTo confirm, I can think about real-world examples. We often hear about security vulnerabilities in software written in C and C++ because of buffer overflows. For instance, many exploits in old versions of software like browsers, operating systems, and network servers were due to buffer overflows in C or C++ code.\n\nIn contrast, high-level languages like Python, Ruby, Tcl, and C# have mechanisms in place to prevent such errors, making them safer in terms of memory management.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C. C and C++.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
