                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about monopolistic competition. So, monopolistic competition is a type of market structure where there are many firms and many customers, and firms sell products that are differentiated from one another. This means that each firm's product is a little bit different from its competitors', which gives each firm some degree of market power.\n\nNow, the question is asking which characteristic best describes monopolistic competition. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says \"strong barriers to entry.\" In monopolistic competition, barriers to entry are typically low. That's because it's usually easy for new firms to enter the market and start selling slightly differentiated products. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption B says \"a long-run price that exceeds average total cost.\" In perfect competition, in the long run, prices equal average total cost, and firms earn zero economic profit. In monopolistic competition, however, firms can earn positive economic profits in the short run, but in the long run, the entry of new firms drives profits down to zero. So, in the long run, price should equal average total cost, just like in perfect competition. Therefore, this option doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says \"a price that exceeds average variable cost, causing excess capacity.\" Hmm, in monopolistic competition, firms do set prices above marginal cost because their products are differentiated, giving them some market power. In the long run, price equals average total cost, but it's still above marginal cost. Excess capacity refers to the fact that firms in monopolistic competition operate at a point where their average total cost is not minimized, meaning they're not producing at the most efficient scale. This is because the demand for their product is downward sloping, so they have to set a higher price to cover their costs, which results in producing less than the minimum efficient scale. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D says \"many resources devoted to advertising.\" In monopolistic competition, firms often spend a significant amount on advertising and marketing to differentiate their products and attract customers. Since products are similar but not identical, firms need to convince consumers that their product is better or more desirable than others. So, this is also a characteristic of monopolistic competition.\n\nBetween options C and D, which one is the best answer? Option C talks about price exceeding average variable cost and causing excess capacity, while option D mentions resources devoted to advertising.\n\nI think option C is more directly related to the economic characteristics of monopolistic competition, whereas option D is more about the business practices in such a market. Excess capacity is a key feature of monopolistic competition, resulting from firms operating at a point where price equals marginal revenue, which is less than the price due to the downward sloping demand curve.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option C: \"a price that exceeds average variable cost, causing excess capacity.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check.\n\nFirst, in monopolistic competition, firms have some market power because their products are differentiated. This allows them to set prices above marginal cost.\n\nIn the long run, firms earn zero economic profit, meaning that price equals average total cost.\n\nHowever, because they're not producing at the minimum point of their average total cost curve (which would require P=MC), they're operating at a higher average total cost and thus have excess capacity.\n\nSo, yes, the price exceeds marginal cost, and because marginal cost is typically increasing, the price also exceeds average variable cost.\n\nTherefore, option C accurately describes a key characteristic of monopolistic competition.\n\nOption D, while true, might be more about the behavior of firms rather than a fundamental economic characteristic of the market structure.\n\nSo, my final answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
