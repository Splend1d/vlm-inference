Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV), and it typically affects the liver, leading to inflammation and associated symptoms.\n\nOption C, jaundice and abdominal discomfort, is the correct answer. Jaundice is a yellowing of the skin and eyes due to elevated bilirubin levels in the blood, which is a common sign of liver dysfunction. Abdominal discomfort can include pain or tenderness in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, where the liver is located.\n\nOption A, rash, is not a primary symptom of hepatitis A. While some viral infections can cause rashes, hepatitis A does not typically present with skin rash as a main feature.\n\nOption B, limb paralysis, is also not associated with hepatitis A. Paralysis is more commonly linked to neurological conditions or other specific viral infections, but not to hepatitis A.\n\nOption D, upper respiratory tract infection, refers to infections affecting the nose, sinuses, pharynx, or larynx. While hepatitis A can sometimes present with flu-like symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, and malaise, these are not specific to hepatitis A and do not constitute its main clinical picture.\n\nIn summary, the primary clinical manifestations of hepatitis A are jaundice and abdominal discomfort, making option C the correct choice.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
