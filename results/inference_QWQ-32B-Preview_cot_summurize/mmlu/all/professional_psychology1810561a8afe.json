The options are sleeping, studying a related subject, exercising, or studying an unrelated subject. I think sleeping might be the best because I've heard that our brains consolidate memories while we sleep. But maybe studying a related subject could help by connecting the new information to what I already know. Exercising is good for overall health, but I'm not sure if it directly helps with retention. And studying an unrelated subject might just mix things up too much. What do you think?"
