                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what filing status a surviving spouse should use in the year after their partner passed away. The scenario is that the spouse died on December 31 of year 1, and they had no dependents. So, in year 2, what should the filing status be?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Single.\n\nB. Married filing jointly.\n\nC. Qualifying widow(er).\n\nD. Head of household.\n\nFirst, I know that when both spouses are alive, they can file jointly, but since one has passed away, that might not apply anymore. But I've heard that there might be some exceptions or extensions for filing jointly even after one spouse has died.\n\nOption C, qualifying widow(er), sounds promising. I think that allows a surviving spouse to file as if they were still married for a certain number of years after the death. But I'm not sure about the specifics.\n\nOption D, head of household, might be relevant if there are dependents, but in this case, they had no dependents. So maybe that's not applicable here.\n\nOption A, single, seems straightforward, but I wonder if there's a better option that might offer some tax benefits or considerations for the surviving spouse.\n\nLet me try to recall the rules for filing status after the death of a spouse.\n\nI think that for the year in which the spouse dies, the surviving spouse can choose to file as married filing jointly, provided that the conditions are met. But in this case, the spouse died on December 31 of year 1, so for year 1, they could file jointly.\n\nBut the question is about year 2, the year after the death.\n\nI believe there's a provision for qualifying widows or widowers, where the surviving spouse can file using the married filing jointly status for a certain number of years after the death.\n\nLet me see if I can remember how many years that extension is.\n\nI think it's two years. So, for the year of death and the following two years, the surviving spouse can file as married filing jointly.\n\nBut maybe that's not exactly right.\n\nAlternatively, there's the qualifying widow(er) with dependent child status, but in this case, there are no dependents, so that might not apply.\n\nWait, qualifying widow(er) requires having a dependent child, doesn't it?\n\nLet me check that.\n\nActually, I think qualifying widow(er) allows the surviving spouse to file using the same standard deduction as married filing jointly for two years after the death, but only if they have a dependent child.\n\nBut in this scenario, there are no dependents, so that might not apply.\n\nSo, if there are no dependents, perhaps the option is to file as single.\n\nBut I have a feeling that there might be another status for surviving spouses without dependents.\n\nLet me think about this differently.\n\nWhat is the definition of each filing status?\n\nOption A, single, is for those who are not married or who are considered single for tax purposes.\n\nOption B, married filing jointly, is for married couples who choose to combine their income and file one return.\n\nOption C, qualifying widow(er), is for surviving spouses who meet certain conditions, including having a dependent child and filing jointly in the year of death.\n\nOption D, head of household, is for taxpayers who are unmarried and pay more than half the cost of maintaining a home for themselves and one or more dependents.\n\nBut in this case, there are no dependents, so head of household doesn't apply.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the only applicable options are single or qualifying widow(er), but since there are no dependents, qualifying widow(er) might not be available.\n\nTherefore, the surviving spouse would have to file as single in year 2.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about this. Maybe there's another consideration.\n\nLet me try to look up the general rules for filing status after the death of a spouse.\n\nFirst, for the year in which the spouse dies, the surviving spouse can choose to file as married filing jointly.\n\nThat seems consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nBut for the following year, it's a bit unclear.\n\nI think there's a provision that allows surviving spouses to file as qualifying widows or widowers for up to two years after the death, but only if they have a dependent child.\n\nSince in this case there are no dependents, that might not apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the surviving spouse can file as a qualifying widower without dependents, but I'm not sure if that exists.\n\nWait, I think qualifying widow(er) with dependent child is a specific status that allows the surviving spouse to use the married filing jointly standard deduction and tax rates for two years following the death, provided they have a dependent child.\n\nWithout dependents, it seems like that option isn't available.\n\nTherefore, in year 2, the surviving spouse would have to file as single.\n\nBut I recall that there might be some exceptions or elections that can be made.\n\nPerhaps the surviving spouse can elect to file as married filing jointly for up to two years after the death, regardless of dependents.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filing status is determined based on the circumstances at the end of the tax year.\n\nBut in this case, since the spouse died in year 1, in year 2, the surviving spouse would be considered unmarried for the entire year.\n\nTherefore, the applicable filing status would be single.\n\nMoreover, I think that head of household requires having a qualifying person, which in this case, there are no dependents, so that's not an option.\n\nSo, between single and qualifying widow(er), since there are no dependents, the only possible choice is single.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any other factors that could affect this.\n\nFor example, if the surviving spouse has a new spouse by year 2, that would change the filing status accordingly.\n\nBut in this scenario, there's no mention of a new spouse, so I'll assume that's not the case.\n\nAdditionally, if the surviving spouse has dependents, that would open up the option for head of household or qualifying widow(er), but again, there are no dependents.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the correct filing status for year 2 would be single.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if there are any special provisions for surviving spouses without dependents.\n\nI seem to recall that there might be a provision allowing surviving spouses to file as qualifying widows or widowers even without dependents, but for a limited period.\n\nLet me see if I can find more information on that.\n\nUpon checking, I find that the qualifying widow(er) with dependent child status allows a surviving spouse to file at the same rates as married filing jointly for two years following the year of death, provided they have a dependent child and meet certain conditions.\n\nSince there are no dependents in this scenario, that option isn't available.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a \"qualifying widower without dependents\" status.\n\nTherefore, in the absence of dependents, the surviving spouse must file as single beginning in year 2.\n\nIt's possible that filing as single could result in higher taxes compared to filing jointly, but that's the standard rule in such cases.\n\nUnless there are other circumstances that would allow for a different filing status, single is likely the correct choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the filing status for the surviving spouse in year 2 should be single.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
