In the US, telemarketing calls are often considered intrusive and annoying, especially if they come during dinner times or other personal hours. Many people find it acceptable to hang up on telemarketers without listening to their pitch, as it's a common practice to avoid unwanted sales calls. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action is not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character blows cigarette smoke towards a child's face. Smoking around children, especially blowing smoke directly at them, is generally considered harmful and irresponsible. Secondhand smoke is known to be detrimental to health, and exposing a child to it can lead to various health issues. Moreover, it shows a lack of consideration for the child's well-being. Therefore, this action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
