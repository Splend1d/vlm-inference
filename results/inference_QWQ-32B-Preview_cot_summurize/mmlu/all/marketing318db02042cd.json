                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says that a 10% increase in price leads to a 10% decrease in quantity demanded, and vice versa. So, it's talking about how quantity demanded changes in response to a change in price. That sounds like price elasticity of demand.\n\nPrice elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nIn this case, a 10% increase in price causes a 10% decrease in quantity demanded. So, the percentage change in quantity demanded is -10% and the percentage change in price is +10%. Therefore, the price elasticity of demand (PED) would be:\n\nPED = (% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in price) = (-10%) / (10%) = -1\n\nThe negative sign indicates that price and quantity demanded move in opposite directions, which makes sense because generally, when price goes up, quantity demanded goes down, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, in economics, the elasticity is often expressed as an absolute value, so we might just say the elasticity is 1.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Zero price elasticity of demand.\n\nZero elasticity means that quantity demanded doesn't change at all in response to a change in price. So, the demand is perfectly inelastic. That's not the case here because here, quantity demanded does change in response to a price change.\n\nB. Infinite price elasticity of demand.\n\nInfinite elasticity means that any small change in price leads to a huge change in quantity demanded. This is the case for perfectly elastic demand. But here, the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price, not infinitely larger.\n\nC. Unit price elasticity of demand.\n\nUnit elasticity is when the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price. So, in this case, since both changes are 10%, but in opposite directions, this matches unit elasticity. The elasticity is equal to 1 (in absolute value).\n\nD. Indefinite price elasticity of demand.\n\nI'm not sure what \"indefinite\" elasticity means in this context. It's not a standard term in elasticity discussion. Maybe it's another way of saying infinite elasticity, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that, the correct answer should be C. Unit price elasticity of demand.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about what unit elasticity implies. It means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is proportional to the percentage change in price, with a ratio of 1. So, a 10% price increase leads to a 10% quantity decrease, which is exactly what's described in the question.\n\nAlso, in terms of total revenue, when demand is unit elastic, a price increase leaves total revenue unchanged because the increase in price is exactly offset by the decrease in quantity demanded. Similarly, a price decrease would not change total revenue. But the question isn't asking about total revenue, so that's just additional information.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Unit price elasticity of demand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
