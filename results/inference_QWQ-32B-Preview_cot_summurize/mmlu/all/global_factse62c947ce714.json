                    "text": "To determine which country invested the largest fraction of its GDP in renewable energy in 2015, we need to look at the percentage of each country's GDP that was spent on renewable energy investments that year. This kind of data is typically collected and published by organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) or the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21).\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. China: China is known for its significant investments in renewable energy. In recent years, it has been one of the leading investors globally. However, in terms of the fraction of GDP, while the absolute investment is high, China's GDP is also very large, so the percentage might not be as high as that of some smaller countries.\n\nB. Japan: Japan has also made substantial investments in renewable energy, especially after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. However, similar to China, being a large economy, its percentage of GDP allocated to renewable energy might not be as high as some smaller economies that are more focused on renewable energy.\n\nC. Chile: Chile has been making notable strides in renewable energy, particularly in solar and wind power. Given its geographical advantages and policy support, it's possible that Chile invested a significant fraction of its GDP in renewable energy.\n\nD. India: India has set ambitious targets for renewable energy and has been increasing its investments in this sector. Like China and Japan, it is a large economy, so the percentage of GDP might not be as high as that of a smaller country with a stronger focus on renewables.\n\nTo get the precise answer, we would need to look up the specific data for 2015. However, based on general knowledge, smaller countries like Denmark or Costa Rica often invest a higher fraction of their GDP in renewable energy compared to larger economies. Since none of these are in the options, we need to consider the relative sizes of the economies and their investment priorities.\n\nGiven that Chile is a smaller economy compared to China, Japan, and India, and has been very active in renewable energy, it is possible that Chile invested a larger fraction of its GDP in renewable energy in 2015.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Chile.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
