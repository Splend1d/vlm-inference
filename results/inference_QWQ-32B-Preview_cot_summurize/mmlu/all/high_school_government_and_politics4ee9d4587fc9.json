                    "text": "I think I've got this one, but let me double-check. So, every 10 years, congressional districts need to be redrawn. The question is asking why this is done. There are four options:\n\nA. to reflect population shifts indicated by the national census\n\nB. to guarantee the turnover of the majority of congressional seats\n\nC. to make sure each state's congressional delegation exactly mirrors its residents' party affiliations\n\nD. to determine which party's leader will be named Speaker of the House\n\nOkay, first off, I know that every 10 years, there's a national census. That's when the government counts how many people live in each area. I think this has something to do with redrawing congressional districts.\n\nOption A says it's to reflect population shifts indicated by the national census. That makes sense because if some areas have more people moving in or out, their representation in Congress should adjust accordingly. So, districts with more people might need to have more representatives or existing representatives might need to cover more ground.\n\nOption B says it's to guarantee the turnover of the majority of congressional seats. Hmm, I don't think that's the main reason. Congressional seats do turn over naturally through elections, but redistricting isn't primarily designed to force that turnover. It's more about adjusting boundaries based on population changes.\n\nOption C says it's to make sure each state's congressional delegation mirrors its residents' party affiliations exactly. That sounds like it could be a goal for some people, but I don't think it's the main reason for redistricting. Redistricting is more about equal representation based on population, not necessarily matching party affiliation.\n\nOption D says it's to determine which party's leader will be named Speaker of the House. I don't think that's related to redistricting. The Speaker of the House is chosen by the members of the House, typically from the majority party, but that's separate from how districts are drawn.\n\nSo, going back to option A, it seems like the most accurate reason for redrawing congressional districts every 10 years is to reflect population shifts indicated by the national census. This ensures that each district has approximately the same number of people, which is a principle called \"one person, one vote.\" This way, representation is fair and equitable across the country.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are other reasons. For example, sometimes redistricting is used for political gain, like gerrymandering, where districts are drawn in a way to favor one party over another. However, that's not the intended purpose; it's more of an abuse of the redistricting process. The fundamental reason remains to account for population changes.\n\nAlso, I should note that the number of congressional districts per state can change based on census results. If a state's population increases, it might gain seats in the House of Representatives, and if it decreases, it might lose seats. This is known as reapportionment.\n\nIn summary, the primary reason for redrawing congressional districts every 10 years is to reflect population shifts indicated by the national census, ensuring that representation remains fair and aligned with where people live.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
