Bernardo.\n\nHere's a brief recap of the events leading up to his death:\n\nTony and Bernardo are leaders of rival gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, respectively. Tensions between the two gangs are high, and they agree to have a rumble to settle their differences.\n\nDuring the rumble, Tony, who is romantically involved with Maria, Bernardo's sister, tries to prevent the fight from happening. However, Riff, the former leader of the Jets, insists on going through with it.\n\nThe fight begins, and chaos ensues. Tony manages to subdue several Sharks, but Bernardo confronts him. In the heat of the battle, Bernardo kills Tony.\n\nThis tragic event sets off a chain reaction of grief and remorse among the characters, highlighting the senselessness of violence and the destructive power of hatred.\n\nIt's a powerful scene that underscores the film's themes of love, conflict, and the futility of gang warfare.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
