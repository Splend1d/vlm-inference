                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a town with 1,000 people, and initially, on January 1st, 10 people have the virus. The virus spreads such that the number of infected people doubles every 3 days. We need to find out the earliest date when the entire town, meaning all 1,000 people, would be infected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the infection is spreading. It's doubling every 3 days, which sounds like exponential growth. So, the number of infected people can be modeled by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{infected} = \\text{initial} \\times 2^{(days / 3)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- initial is 10 (the number of people infected on January 1st),\n\n- days is the number of days that have passed since January 1st.\n\nWe want to find the smallest number of days where infected is at least 1,000.\n\nSo, setting up the inequality:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 2^{(days / 3)} \\geq 1,000 \\]\n\nLet me solve for days.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 10:\n\n\\[ 2^{(days / 3)} \\geq 100 \\]\n\nNow, to solve for days, I can take the logarithm of both sides. Since the base is 2, I'll use logarithm base 2.\n\n\\[ \\frac{days}{3} \\geq \\log_2{100} \\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\log_2{100}\\):\n\nI know that \\(2^6 = 64\\) and \\(2^7 = 128\\), so \\(\\log_2{100}\\) is between 6 and 7.\n\nMore precisely, \\(\\log_2{100} \\approx 6.644\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{days}{3} \\geq 6.644 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ days \\geq 19.932 \\]\n\nSince the number of days must be a whole number, we round up to 20 days.\n\nSo, 20 days after January 1st would be January 21st (since January has 31 days).\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. Starting from January 1st, adding 20 days would land on January 21st.\n\nBut let's verify if on January 21st, the number of infected people is indeed 1,000 or more.\n\nCalculate the number of 3-day periods in 20 days:\n\n\\[ \\text{number of 3-day periods} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.666 \\]\n\nSince the infection doubles at the end of each 3-day period, we consider complete periods.\n\nSo, after 6 full 3-day periods:\n\n\\[ \\text{infected} = 10 \\times 2^6 = 10 \\times 64 = 640 \\]\n\nAfter 7 full 3-day periods, which would be 21 days:\n\n\\[ \\text{infected} = 10 \\times 2^7 = 10 \\times 128 = 1,280 \\]\n\nBut 21 days from January 1st would be January 22nd.\n\nWait, let's double-check the date calculation.\n\nJanuary 1st + 20 days is January 21st.\n\nBut according to the calculation, after 6 periods (18 days), infected = 640.\n\nAfter 7 periods (21 days), infected = 1,280.\n\nSo, 1,280 is greater than 1,000, which happens on January 22nd.\n\nBut the options given are:\n\nA. January 10th\n\nB. January 21st\n\nC. January 31st\n\nD. February 10th\n\nHmm, according to this, it seems that January 21st might not be the correct answer because on January 21st, it would be 20 days, which is 6 full periods of 3 days, leading to 640 infected, which is less than 1,000.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the infection doubles every 3 days, but not necessarily at the end of each period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as continuous growth, but the problem seems to suggest discrete doubling every 3 days.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet's list the number of infected people at each 3-day interval:\n\n- Day 0 (Jan 1st): 10\n\n- Day 3: 10 * 2 = 20\n\n- Day 6: 20 * 2 = 40\n\n- Day 9: 40 * 2 = 80\n\n- Day 12: 80 * 2 = 160\n\n- Day 15: 160 * 2 = 320\n\n- Day 18: 320 * 2 = 640\n\n- Day 21: 640 * 2 = 1,280\n\nSo, on day 21, which is January 22nd, the number of infected people reaches 1,280, which is more than 1,000.\n\nBut according to the options, January 21st is one of the choices.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion about how to count the days.\n\nLet me recount the days:\n\n- January 1st is day 0.\n\n- Day 1: January 2nd\n\n- Day 2: January 3rd\n\n- ...\n\n- Day 20: January 21st\n\n- Day 21: January 22nd\n\nSo, on January 22nd, the number exceeds 1,000.\n\nBut January 22nd is not listed in the options. The closest is January 21st.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the doubling occurs inclusively.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the doubling happens at the end of each 3-day period.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- From day 0 to day 3: doubles on day 3\n\n- From day 3 to day 6: doubles on day 6\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, on day 21, the doubling happens, reaching 1,280.\n\nWhich would be January 22nd.\n\nBut again, that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the infection starts spreading from January 1st, and we need to consider partial periods.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the doubling is continuous rather than discrete.\n\nLet me try using the continuous exponential growth formula.\n\nThe formula for continuous exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ \\text{infected} = \\text{initial} \\times e^{(rt)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- initial is 10,\n\n- r is the growth rate,\n\n- t is time in days.\n\nBut in this case, we know that the number doubles every 3 days, so we can find r such that:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times e^{(3r)} = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ e^{(3r)} = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ 3r = \\ln{2} \\]\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\ln{2}}{3} \\]\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{infected} = 10 \\times e^{(\\frac{\\ln{2}}{3} t)} \\]\n\nWe want infected >= 1,000:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times e^{(\\frac{\\ln{2}}{3} t)} \\geq 1,000 \\]\n\n\\[ e^{(\\frac{\\ln{2}}{3} t)} \\geq 100 \\]\n\nTake natural log of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\ln{2}}{3} t \\geq \\ln{100} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq \\frac{3 \\ln{100}}{\\ln{2}} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\ln{100} = 4.60517 \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln{2} = 0.693147 \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq \\frac{3 \\times 4.60517}{0.693147} \\approx \\frac{13.8155}{0.693147} \\approx 19.93 \\]\n\nSo, t >= 19.93 days.\n\nRounding up to 20 days, which is January 21st.\n\nBut earlier, with discrete doubling, on day 21 (January 22nd), infected = 1,280.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the doubling is continuous, and the formula I used for discrete doubling is not appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the formula for exponential growth with discrete compounding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for exponential growth with the number of periods.\n\nThe general formula for exponential growth with discrete periods is:\n\n\\[ \\text{infected} = \\text{initial} \\times (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nBut in this case, since it's doubling every 3 days, the growth rate r is such that:\n\n\\[ 1 + r = 2^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{infected} = 10 \\times 2^{\\frac{t}{3}} \\]\n\nWhich is similar to what I had earlier.\n\nSetting infected >= 1,000:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 2^{\\frac{t}{3}} \\geq 1,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{\\frac{t}{3}} \\geq 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{t}{3} \\geq \\log_2{100} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq 3 \\times \\log_2{100} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq 3 \\times \\frac{\\ln{100}}{\\ln{2}} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq 3 \\times \\frac{4.60517}{0.693147} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq 3 \\times 6.643856 \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq 19.931568 \\]\n\nAgain, t >= 19.93 days, so 20 days.\n\nBut according to the discrete doubling, on day 21, which is January 22nd, the number reaches 1,280.\n\nBut according to the continuous model, it's 20 days, which is January 21st.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects the continuous model approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire town is infected as soon as the number of infected people reaches or exceeds 1,000, regardless of the exact day the doubling occurs.\n\nGiven that, on January 21st, which is day 20, let's calculate the number of infected people using the continuous formula.\n\n\\[ \\text{infected} = 10 \\times 2^{\\frac{20}{3}} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 2^{\\frac{20}{3}} \\):\n\n\\[ 2^{\\frac{20}{3}} = 2^{6.\\overline{6}} \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{6} = 64 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{0.\\overline{6}} = 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\approx 1.5874 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 2^{6.\\overline{6}} = 64 \\times 1.5874 \\approx 101.97 \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ \\text{infected} = 10 \\times 101.97 \\approx 1,019.7 \\]\n\nWhich is just over 1,000.\n\nTherefore, on January 21st, the number of infected people exceeds 1,000.\n\nSo, the earliest date is January 21st.\n\nBut wait, in the discrete model, it's on January 22nd.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects the continuous model approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the date calculation.\n\nLet's recount the days from January 1st:\n\n- January 1st: day 0\n\n- January 2nd: day 1\n\n...\n\n- January 21st: day 20\n\nSo, 20 days from January 1st is January 21st.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be January 21st.\n\nBut to confirm, let's check the number of infected people on January 21st using both models.\n\nDiscrete model:\n\n- Day 18: 640\n\n- Day 21: 1,280\n\nContinuous model:\n\n- Day 20: approximately 1,019\n\nSo, depending on the model, it's either January 21st or January 22nd.\n\nGiven that the options include January 21st, and considering the continuous model reaches 1,019 on day 20, which is January 21st, that would be the earliest date the entire town is infected.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. January 21st.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
