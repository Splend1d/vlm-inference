                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about the Council of Europe is correct. There are four options, and each has a different establishment year and number of member states. I don't remember the exact details, so I'll need to think this through.\n\nFirst, I know that the Council of Europe is an important international organization in Europe, but I'm a bit fuzzy on when it was founded. I think it was established after World War II, as many European institutions were set up during that time to promote peace and cooperation.\n\nOption A says it was established in 1950 with 27 member states. Hmm, 27 seems familiar because that's the number of member states in the European Union, but the Council of Europe is different from the EU. So maybe that's a mistake.\n\nOption B says 1949 and 47 member states. That sounds plausible. I recall that the Council of Europe was one of the early organizations, even preceding the European Economic Community, which later became the EU.\n\nOption C mentions 1959 and 34 member states. That seems a bit late, and 34 doesn't ring any bells.\n\nOption D says 1984 and 19 member states. That seems way too recent for the establishment of such a foundational European body.\n\nLet me try to recall some history. I know that the Council of Europe was set up to promote human rights, democracy, and the rule of law across Europe. Its creation was inspired by the need to prevent another catastrophic war in Europe, similar to WWII.\n\nI think the Statute of the Council of Europe was signed in 1949, specifically on May 5, 1949, in London. That would make option B correct regarding the establishment year.\n\nNow, about the number of member states. I know that the Council of Europe has more members than the EU because it includes countries that are not part of the EU, such as Russia and Turkey. Currently, the EU has 27 members, but the Council of Europe has always had more members over the years.\n\nIf I remember correctly, the Council of Europe now has 47 member states. That would make option B correct again.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Maybe the number has changed recently. Or perhaps I'm misremembering.\n\nLet me consider the growth of the Council of Europe. It was founded by 10 original member states, and over the years, more countries have joined, especially after the Cold War with the inclusion of Eastern European countries.\n\nIf it started with 10 members in 1949 and has been growing, reaching 47 today, that seems reasonable. In contrast, option A says 27 members, which matches the EU's current membership, not the Council of Europe.\n\nOption C suggests 34 members in 1959. But considering that it had 10 at the start and was growing, 34 seems too low for 1959.\n\nOption D is clearly off with 1984 as the establishment year, which is when the Schengen Agreement was signed, but that's a different matter.\n\nTherefore, based on my reasoning, option B seems correct: The Council of Europe was established in 1949 and consists of 47 member states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
