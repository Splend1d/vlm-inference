When it comes to sex, I think the central function would be related to reproduction because that's the biological purpose of sex in most species, right? It's about passing on genes and ensuring the survival of the species.\n\nOption A, pleasure, is certainly a aspect of sex, but from a biological standpoint, it's more of a byproduct that encourages individuals to engage in sexual activities for reproduction. So, while pleasure is important, it might not be the central function from a sociobiological perspective.\n\nOption C, maintaining the double standard, sounds more like a social construct rather than a biological function. The double standard refers to different expectations or treatments based on gender, which is a sociological issue rather than a biological one.\n\nOption D, relieving tension, might be a psychological benefit of sex, but again, from a biological perspective, the primary function is likely reproduction.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B, reproduction. What do you think?"
