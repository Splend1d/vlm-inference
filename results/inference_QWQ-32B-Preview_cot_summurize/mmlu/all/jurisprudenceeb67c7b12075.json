                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question. It's about identifying which school of jurisprudence views law as a collection of social traditions and customs that have evolved over time. The options are Historical, Analytical, Command, and Sociological.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these schools emphasizes.\n\nThe Historical School, I think, looks at law as something that develops gradually through history, based on past practices and decisions. It considers the evolution of legal systems over time and how traditions and customs shape the law.\n\nThe Analytical School, also known as the Glanvillians or the British Empiricists, focuses on analyzing the structure and language of law. They are more concerned with the logical analysis of legal concepts and rules rather than their historical development.\n\nThe Command School, associated with thinkers like Austin, defines law as a command from a sovereign backed by sanctions. This view emphasizes the authoritative nature of law and doesn't focus on traditions or customs unless they are enacted by the sovereign.\n\nThe Sociological School looks at law in the context of society, studying how social forces influence law and how law affects society. While it considers social aspects, it's not solely focused on traditions and customs.\n\nGiven these brief overviews, the Historical School seems to align most closely with the description in the question. It emphasizes the development of law through social traditions and customs over centuries.\n\nBut let me double-check. The Historical School includes thinkers like Savigny, who believed that law is an expression of the people's spirit (Volksgeist), evolving naturally through history. This fits well with the idea of law being an aggregate of social traditions and customs.\n\nThe Analytical School, on the other hand, is more about analyzing the existing law and its language, without necessarily delving into its historical development.\n\nThe Command School sees law primarily as orders from the sovereign, which may or may not be based on traditions and customs.\n\nThe Sociological School is concerned with the social effects and functions of law, but not specifically with traditions and customs as the primary source of law.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be the Historical School.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
