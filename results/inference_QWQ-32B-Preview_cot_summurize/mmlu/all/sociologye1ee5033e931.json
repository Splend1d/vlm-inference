                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option wasn't a strategy used by the Conservative government in 1979 to weaken the labor movement. So, first, I should recall what the Conservative government did during that time regarding labor laws.\n\nI know that in 1979, Margaret Thatcher became the Prime Minister, and her government was known for taking strong measures against trade unions, which were quite powerful at the time. They passed several laws to restrict union activities and reduce their influence.\n\nOption A says \"making all strike action illegal.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty extreme. I don't recall any government making all strikes illegal outright. Usually, they regulate or restrict certain types of strikes, but not completely ban all strike actions. Maybe this is the one that wasn't implemented.\n\nOption B is \"imposing restrictions on picketing.\" Picketing is when union members picket outside a workplace during a strike to discourage others from crossing the picket line. I think the Conservative government did impose restrictions on picketing to prevent intimidation and chaos. So, this seems like something they would do.\n\nOption C is \"banning political strikes that were not primarily concerned with the worker's own conditions of work.\" Political strikes are strikes motivated by political reasons rather than direct workplace issues. I believe the government did try to limit such strikes because they could have broader political implications and were seen as more disruptive. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D is \"making secondary action (in support of workers elsewhere) illegal.\" Secondary action refers to strikes or other industrial actions taken in support of another group of workers, not directly related to their own employment. This was a big issue because it could lead to widespread disruption beyond the original dispute. I know that the government introduced laws to make secondary action illegal, so this aligns with their strategies.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be the one that wasn't implemented\u2014making all strike action illegal. It's likely that even the Conservative government recognized that completely banning strikes wouldn't be feasible or acceptable, so they focused on regulating and restricting certain types of strikes instead.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should look back at some of the actual legislation they passed. The Employment Act 1980 and the Trade Union Act 1984 are key pieces of legislation from that period. Let's see what they covered.\n\nThe Employment Act 1980 introduced measures such as requiring a secret ballot before striking, increasing notice periods for strikes, and restricting secondary picketing. So, this supports options B and D.\n\nThe Trade Union Act 1984 further restricted secondary action and imposed financial penalties on unions for breaches of the law. Again, this aligns with options B and D.\n\nI don't see any mention of banning all strike action outright or banning political strikes specifically in my quick recall. Maybe I need to dig a bit deeper.\n\nUpon a quicker look, it seems that political strikes weren't necessarily banned, but there were efforts to limit their impact. For example, the government might have required unions to poll their members before engaging in political strikes or imposed other restrictions.\n\nComparing all the options, A stands out as the most extreme measure, and it's less likely that a government would completely ban all strike action, as that could be seen as unconstitutional or against workers' rights.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A: making all strike action illegal. That was not a strategy used by the Conservative government of 1979 to reduce the power of the labor movement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
