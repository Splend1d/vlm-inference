                    "text": "Let's tackle this solubility product problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on solubility products, but I remember that it has to do with the equilibrium between a solid compound and its ions in solution. The problem gives us the maximum amount of lead(II) iodide (PbI2) that can dissolve in pure water at 25\u00b0C, and we need to find the solubility product constant, Ksp, for PbI2 at that temperature.\n\nFirst, let's understand what solubility product means. For a sparingly soluble salt like PbI2, which dissociates into ions in water, the solubility product is the product of the concentrations of the ions, each raised to the power of its coefficient in the balanced dissociation equation. The general formula for a salt like AB2 would be A2+ + 2B-, and its Ksp would be [A2+][B-]^2.\n\nIn this case, PbI2 dissociates into one Pb2+ ion and two I- ions:\n\nPbI2(s) \u21cc Pb2+(aq) + 2I-(aq)\n\nSo, the Ksp expression would be:\n\nKsp = [Pb2+][I-]^2\n\nThe problem states that the maximum amount of PbI2 that can dissolve in 1.00 L of pure water is 1.0 mmol at 25\u00b0C. Assuming complete dissociation, this means that 1.0 mmol of PbI2 dissociates into 1.0 mmol of Pb2+ and 2.0 mmol of I-.\n\nLet's convert these amounts to molar concentrations. Since the volume is 1.00 L, the concentrations will be equal to the number of moles per liter.\n\n[Pb2+] = 1.0 mmol / 1.00 L = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\n[I-] = 2.0 mmol / 1.00 L = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nNow, plug these concentrations into the Ksp expression:\n\nKsp = (1.0 \u00d7 10^-3)(2.0 \u00d7 10^-3)^2\n\nCalculate the value:\n\nFirst, square the iodide ion concentration:\n\n(2.0 \u00d7 10^-3)^2 = 4.0 \u00d7 10^-6\n\nThen, multiply by the lead ion concentration:\n\n(1.0 \u00d7 10^-3)(4.0 \u00d7 10^-6) = 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9\n\nSo, the Ksp for PbI2 at 25\u00b0C is 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3\n\nB. 1.0 \u00d7 10^-6\n\nC. 1.0 \u00d7 10^-9\n\nD. 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9\n\nOur calculated Ksp matches option D.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nSolubility of PbI2 = 1.0 mmol in 1.00 L, which is 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L.\n\nDissociation:\n\nPbI2 \u21cc Pb2+ + 2I-\n\nSo, [Pb2+] = s = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\n[I-] = 2s = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nKsp = [Pb2+][I-]^2 = (s)(2s)^2 = (s)(4s^2) = 4s^3\n\nPlugging in s = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M:\n\nKsp = 4 \u00d7 (1.0 \u00d7 10^-3)^3 = 4 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 10^-9 = 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to this problem. Maybe using the definition of solubility product in terms of molar solubility.\n\nThe molar solubility (s) of PbI2 is given as 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nFor PbI2, the Ksp expression is Ksp = [Pb2+][I-]^2 = s \u00d7 (2s)^2 = 4s^3\n\nSo, Ksp = 4 \u00d7 (1.0 \u00d7 10^-3)^3 = 4 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 10^-9 = 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nI don't see any errors in this approach. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9.\n\nHowever, let me consider if there's any other factor that might affect the Ksp value. For example, is there any possibility that the dissociation produces more or fewer ions than accounted for? Or perhaps activity coefficients need to be considered, but at such low concentrations, I think they can be neglected.\n\nAlso, ensure that the solubility is correctly interpreted. The problem says \"the maximum amount of PbI2 that can be dissolved in 1.00 L of pure water is 1.0 mmol.\" This directly translates to a molar solubility of 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M, assuming that all added PbI2 dissolves and dissociates completely.\n\nGiven that, and following the standard Ksp expression for PbI2, the calculation seems straightforward and correct.\n\nTherefore, I am confident that the answer is D. 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
