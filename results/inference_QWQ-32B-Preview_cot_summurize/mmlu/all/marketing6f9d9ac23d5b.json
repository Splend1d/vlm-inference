                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what type of probability sample is being described here. The question says it's a sample constructed so that randomly selected sub-samples of different groups are represented in the total sample. The options are:\n\nA. Stratified sample.\n\nB. Convenience sample.\n\nC. Quota sample.\n\nD. Cluster sample.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these sampling methods is.\n\nStarting with A, a stratified sample. I think this is where the population is divided into distinct subgroups, called strata, based on certain characteristics, like age or income. Then, samples are randomly selected from each stratum. The idea is to ensure that each subgroup is represented in the sample proportional to its size in the population.\n\nOption B, convenience sample, sounds like something different. This seems to be when researchers pick participants that are easiest to reach or most convenient to sample. It's not random and is often used when time or resources are limited. But it's not a probability sample, right? Because not everyone has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nOption C, quota sample, is similar to stratified sampling in that it involves dividing the population into subgroups, but instead of random selection within each subgroup, the researcher selects participants non-randomly but in proportion to the subgroup's size in the population.\n\nOption D, cluster sample, is when the population is divided into clusters, often based on geographic areas, and then entire clusters are randomly selected for inclusion in the sample. So, it's like sampling groups rather than individuals.\n\nNow, going back to the question, it mentions a probability sample where randomly selected sub-samples of different groups are represented in the total sample. So, it's emphasizing random selection and representation of different groups.\n\nGiven that, stratified sampling seems to fit best because it involves dividing the population into strata (different groups) and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum to ensure representation.\n\nConvenience sampling isn't a probability sample, so that can be ruled out.\n\nQuota sampling does involve selecting subgroups in proportion to their size, but it doesn't require random selection within those subgroups, which is a key aspect of probability sampling.\n\nCluster sampling involves selecting entire clusters randomly, but it doesn't necessarily ensure representation of different groups within those clusters, especially if the clusters are not homogeneous.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A, stratified sample.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see:\n\n- Stratified sampling: divides population into strata and randomly samples from each stratum.\n\n- Convenience sampling: non-probability, based on ease of access.\n\n- Quota sampling: divides population into subgroups and selects participants to meet quotas, not necessarily randomly.\n\n- Cluster sampling: divides population into clusters and randomly selects entire clusters.\n\nSo, again, stratified sampling is the one that matches the description of randomly selecting sub-samples from different groups to ensure their representation in the total sample.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
