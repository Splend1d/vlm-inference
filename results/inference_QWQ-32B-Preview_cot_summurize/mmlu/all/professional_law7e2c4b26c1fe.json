                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's an accounting professor who's testifying as a defense expert witness in a white-collar criminal case. He's saying that the accounting records show conclusively that the defendant didn't commit any fraud. Then, on cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asks him about a particular treatise. The professor says he's familiar with it, that it's authoritative, and that he's aware of its conclusions about accountants' ability to detect fraud.\n\nThe prosecutor then wants to read a section from this treatise into evidence, which says that it's virtually impossible to state with conclusive certainty the existence or lack thereof of fraud in most white-collar crime cases, because the defendants are sophisticated and there are various accounting methods available.\n\nThe defendant's attorney objects, and now the trial judge has to decide what to do. The options are:\n\nA. Overrule the objection and let the entire treatise be introduced into evidence.\n\nB. Overrule the objection and let only the contradictory statements be read into evidence.\n\nC. Sustain the objection, because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nD. Sustain the objection, because the professor didn't rely on the treatise in making his conclusions.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about evidence rules, specifically regarding expert witnesses and the use of treatises.\n\nFirst, expert witnesses are allowed to give their opinions based on their expertise, and they can rely on certain materials to form those opinions. But there are rules about what they can consider and what can be introduced into evidence.\n\nIn this case, the professor is testifying that the accounting records conclusively demonstrate that no fraud was committed. The prosecutor is trying to impeach this testimony by introducing a treatise that suggests it's virtually impossible to state with conclusive certainty about fraud in white-collar cases.\n\nSo, the prosecutor is trying to show that the professor's conclusion is contrary to what this authoritative treatise says.\n\nNow, treatises are considered a type of hearsay, which is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for its truth. But there are exceptions for things like learned treatises, especially when used for impeachment.\n\nIn the federal rules of evidence, Rule 803(18) used to allow for the use of learned treatises for impeachment, but that exception was removed in 2011. However, many courts still allow treatises to be used for impeachment purposes under other exceptions or common law principles.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options.\n\nOption A suggests that the judge should overrule the objection and let the entire treatise be introduced into evidence. That seems broad. Typically, only specific parts relevant to the testimony are allowed, not the entire treatise.\n\nOption B is to overrule the objection and let only the contradictory statements be read into evidence. This seems more reasonable, as it's directly related to the professor's testimony and is used to impeach his conclusion.\n\nOption C is to sustain the objection because the statements are hearsay without a recognized exception. But, as I mentioned, treatises are sometimes allowed for impeachment purposes.\n\nOption D is to sustain the objection because the professor didn't rely on the treatise in making his conclusions. This is an interesting point. If the expert didn't rely on the treatise, perhaps it shouldn't be admitted. But on the other hand, the treatise is being used to challenge the correctness of the expert's opinion.\n\nI need to think about the purpose of introducing the treatise. It's not to prove that what the treatise says is true, but to show that there's authoritative literature that contradicts the expert's conclusion. So, it's being used to impeach the expert's testimony.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, treatises can be used to impeach an expert witness by showing that there's authoritative literature that takes a different view from the expert's opinion.\n\nHowever, there are rules about how this can be done. Sometimes, the treatise must be provided to the expert in advance, or the expert must be questioned about it.\n\nIn this case, the professor has already been asked about the treatise and has affirmed that he's familiar with it and that it's authoritative. So, the foundation seems to have been laid for introducing specific parts of the treatise.\n\nBut, is the entire treatise admissible, or just the specific statements that contradict the expert's testimony?\n\nGenerally, only the specific statements that are relevant to the expert's testimony would be admitted. Introducing the entire treatise could be seen as unduly burdensome and potentially confusing to the jury.\n\nSo, option B seems plausible.\n\nOption C argues that the statements are hearsay without an exception. But, as I recall, Rule 803(18) used to allow for the use of learned treatises, but it was removed. However, Rule 803(17) allows for market reports, commercial publications, etc., and there might be arguments to admit the treatise under that or another exception.\n\nAlternatively, some courts might allow the treatise to be used for impeachment purposes despite the hearsay rule.\n\nOption D suggests sustaining the objection because the professor didn't rely on the treatise. But experts can be impeached by showing that their opinions contradict established authorities, even if they didn't rely on those authorities in forming their opinions.\n\nIn fact, if an expert's opinion goes against widely accepted principles in their field, that can be a valid basis for impeachment.\n\nSo, I think option D is not the best choice.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most appropriate action for the trial judge would be to overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence, which is option B.\n\nThis limits the introduction of evidence to only what's necessary to impeach the expert's testimony without flooding the record with irrelevant parts of the treatise.\n\nBut, to be thorough, I should consider whether the treatise can be introduced at all.\n\nIf the professor has acknowledged that the treatise is authoritative and that he's aware of its conclusions, then it seems fair to allow the specific contradictory statements to be read to challenge his testimony.\n\nHowever, the defense might object on the grounds that the treatise is being offered for its truth, which would make it hearsay unless an exception applies.\n\nIn response, the prosecution could argue that it's not being offered for its truth but to impeach the expert's testimony.\n\nSome courts might allow this, while others might require that the treatise be treated as substantive evidence, in which case its admissibility would depend on whether it meets the criteria for hearsay exceptions.\n\nGiven the potential complications, and considering that the professor has already affirmed the authority of the treatise, it might be reasonable for the judge to allow the specific statements to be read into evidence for the purpose of impeachment.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
