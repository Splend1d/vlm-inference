                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, we have an investor who bought a 100-acre tract in a rural county in 2006. Then, he prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential lots and set aside 10 acres for a public school building. In his sales brochure, he mentioned that the proposed school would benefit subdivision residents and that the county wouldn't have to spend tax money to acquire the property for the school.\n\nIn 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. Fast forward to January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on that 10-acre tract.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the investor's proposed designation of the 10-acre tract for the school building. It wants to know which of the options best describes this designation:\n\nA. Equitable servitude.\n\nB. Restrictive covenant.\n\nC. Unenforceable restriction.\n\nD. Easement for public use.\n\nAlright, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nFirst, what's an equitable servitude? It's a type of covenant that runs with the land and is enforceable in equity. It's usually related to restrictions on how property can be used. But in this case, the investor is designating a specific piece of land for a public school, which seems more like a dedication rather than a restriction on use.\n\nNext, a restrictive covenant is a promise in a deed that limits the use of the land. Typically, it's used to maintain certain standards in a neighborhood, like no commercial use or specific architectural styles. Again, designating land for a school seems different from a restrictive covenant, which is more about prohibiting certain uses.\n\nOption C is \"unenforceable restriction.\" Well, if the designation isn't properly established, it could be unenforceable, but we need to see if there's a better fit among the options.\n\nFinally, an easement for public use is a right granted to the public to use a portion of the property for a specific purpose. A common example is a public road or a park. Designating land for a school could potentially fall under this category, as it's for public use.\n\nBut let's dig deeper. The investor prepared a subdivision plan and recorded it in 2007. Recording the plan might give it some legal weight, but we need to consider the specifics.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, when a developer subdivides land and dedicates certain parcels for public use, like schools, streets, or parks, those dedications become binding once accepted by the relevant public authority.\n\nIn this case, the investor designated 10 acres for a public school building. He promoted this in his sales brochure, suggesting that subdivision residents would benefit from the school's proximity, and the county wouldn't have to spend money to acquire the land.\n\nThen, in 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on that 10-acre tract. This suggests that the school board accepted the dedication.\n\nGiven these facts, it seems like the investor dedicated the 10 acres for public use, specifically for a school, and the public authority (the school board) accepted that dedication by voting to build the school there.\n\nAn easement for public use seems to fit this scenario well. It's a right granted to the public to use the property for a specific purpose, which in this case is a school.\n\nNow, let's consider if it could be an equitable servitude or a restrictive covenant. Equitable servitudes and restrictive covenants are typically used to impose certain behaviors or restrictions on how property is used, often in a subdivision to maintain certain standards.\n\nBut here, the investor is designating land for a specific public use, which is more akin to a dedication or an easement.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the subdivision plan was recorded adds weight to the idea that this designation has legal significance.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, \"easement for public use\" seems to be the most appropriate description for the investor's proposed designation of the 10-acre tract for a school building.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Easement for public use.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
