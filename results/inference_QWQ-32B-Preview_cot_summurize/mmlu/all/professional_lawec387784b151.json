He had served as a state trooper since 1978, and in 1998, he became fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. In 2006, the trooper retired and immediately started receiving monthly state pension checks. In 2009, the governor of the state signed into law a statute, which provided in part:\"Section 8.

                    "text": "Let's see what this is about. So, there's a state trooper who was convicted of taking bribes in 2008 and got probation. He had been a trooper since 1978 and was fully qualified for his pension by 1998. He retired in 2006 and started getting his pension checks. Then in 2009, a new statute was passed that says if someone in law enforcement is convicted of bribery, they can't get any retirement benefits from the state, and this conviction is considered a breach of their employment contract. This law applies retroactively to December 31, 1975, and took effect immediately.\n\nAfter the law was passed, the state stopped his pension payments, and his lawyer is challenging this, saying the law is unconstitutional. But let's assume the state's highest court says the statute is constitutional. Now, the question is, even with that, could the trooper still get his pension back someday? And we have four options:\n\nA. He exercises his constitutional right to discretionary review in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nB. He receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense.\n\nC. He can show that he was convicted before the effective date of the statute.\n\nD. He can show that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause.\n\nOkay, let's think about each one.\n\nOption A: Exercising his right to discretionary review in the U.S. Supreme Court. So, if he appeals to the Supreme Court, and they decide to hear the case, and maybe they rule differently. But the problem is, we're assuming that the state's highest court has already held the statute constitutional. So, even if he goes to the Supreme Court, and they decide not to hear the case, which is likely since they only take a small percentage of cases, then the state court's decision stands. Or if they do hear it and agree with the state court, same thing. So, this might not necessarily lead to reinstating his pension.\n\nOption B: Receiving a presidential pardon for his bribery offense. A presidential pardon would forgive his conviction, right? So, if his conviction is pardoned, maybe that means the basis for stopping his pension goes away. Because the statute says if you're convicted of bribery, you can't get benefits. But if the conviction is pardoned, maybe that conviction no longer stands as a bar to receiving benefits. That seems promising.\n\nOption C: Showing that he was convicted before the effective date of the statute. The statute took effect immediately, and it's retroactive to December 31, 1975. His conviction was in 2008, which is after 1975, so it would apply to him. Even if he was convicted before the statute was enacted, since it's retroactive, it still applies. So, this doesn't seem like a strong argument.\n\nOption D: Showing that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause. The commerce clause is about regulating interstate commerce. This statute seems to be about state employment and pensions, which doesn't directly relate to commerce. So, arguing that it violates the dormant commerce clause might not be successful.\n\nComparing these options, option B seems the most likely to lead to reinstatement of his pension. If his conviction is pardoned, then the basis for discontinuing his benefits is gone. So, I think B is the best answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think again. If he gets a presidential pardon, does that automatically reinstate his pension? Well, a pardon forgives the conviction, but sometimes there are collateral consequences. However, in this case, since the statute relies on the conviction to deny benefits, if the conviction is pardoned, perhaps the conviction no longer has the same effect.\n\nAlternatively, if he could show that the statute is unconstitutional, but we're assuming the state's highest court has already said it's constitutional. So, that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, receiving a presidential pardon seems like the most plausible way for him to eventually have his pension reinstated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
