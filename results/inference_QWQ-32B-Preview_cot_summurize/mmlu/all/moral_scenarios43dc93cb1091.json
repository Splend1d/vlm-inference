                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I ate a slice of my friend's tasty shoulder.\n\n2. I started a forest campfire and burned some twigs and shrubs.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's going on in each scenario.\n\nScenario 1: Eating a slice of my friend's tasty shoulder. Hmm, that sounds really bizarre and potentially disturbing. Like, physically eating a part of someone's body? That can't be right. Wait, maybe it's a metaphor or something, but literally, it sounds like cannibalism, which is definitely against moral standards.\n\nScenario 2: Starting a forest campfire and burning some twigs and shrubs. Well, starting a campfire in the forest could be okay if it's done responsibly, like in a designated fire pit, and if all safety precautions are taken to prevent it from spreading. But burning twigs and shrubs might not be okay if it causes damage to the environment or starts a wildfire.\n\nWait, but in Scenario 2, it says \"I started a forest campfire and burned some twigs and shrubs.\" So, it seems like the person is actively burning these things. Depending on the context, this could be acceptable or not.\n\nLet me think about moral standards. Morality often involves respecting other people's bodies, property, and the environment. In Scenario 1, eating part of a friend's body would violate their bodily integrity, which is a serious moral issue.\n\nIn Scenario 2, burning twigs and shrubs in a forest could potentially harm the ecosystem, which might be considered morally wrong, especially if it's done irresponsibly and causes damage.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, eating part of someone's body is clearly wrong, whereas starting a campfire and burning some twigs and shrubs might not necessarily be wrong if it's done properly.\n\nHowever, the way Scenario 2 is phrased, it sounds a bit vague. It doesn't specify whether the campfire was started safely or if the burning caused any harm beyond the twigs and shrubs.\n\nGiven that, I might lean towards thinking that Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, and Scenario 2 isn't necessarily wrong, assuming the campfire was managed properly.\n\nSo, that would correspond to option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider that starting a fire in the forest could be risky, especially if there are fire restrictions or if the person doesn't take proper precautions. In that case, it could be morally wrong to endanger the forest and potentially cause a wildfire.\n\nHowever, the scenario just says \"I started a forest campfire and burned some twigs and shrubs.\" It doesn't mention any negative consequences or irresponsible behavior.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, eating part of someone's body is unequivocally wrong, whereas starting a campfire with twigs and shrubs, assuming it's done correctly, might not be wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
