The man approached the building, and saw a sign on the door that said, \"Members only \u0080\u0094No restroom facilities available for non-members. \" The owner of the gym hung up the sign because he knew that people frequently entered the gym just to use the restroom, and he was annoyed by this. However, the owner of the gym knew that the sign was not effective and that people still regularly entered the gym just to use the restroom. The man needed to use the bathroom very urgently, so he entered the building despite the sign. The restrooms were near the front door of the gymnasium. The man walked directly to the restroom as soon as he entered the building. The clerk working at the front desk in the gymnasium was busy and did not notice the man enter the building or the restroom. After making use of the restroom facilities, the man washed his hands and proceeded to turn on the electric blow dryer. The dryer, because of a malfunctioning heating coil, emitted intense heat, which caused severe burns to the man's hands. The man was unaware of the fact that 15 minutes earlier, a gym member had received similar injuries from the malfunctioning dryer and notified the gym's owner. The owner immediately taped a \"DO NOT USE\" sign to the dryer. However, the sign had fallen to the floor and was lying face down under the bathroom sink when the man was making use of the restroom. Which of the following would best describe the duty of care that the gym owed to the man?\n\nA. No duty of care.\nB. A duty to inspect the premises for unknown dangers and to disclose their existence to others.\nC. A duty to warn of any known dangerous conditions on the premises.\nD. An absolute duty of care.\n"

                    "text": "So here's this scenario: a guy needs to use the bathroom really bad and sees a gym nearby. There's a sign saying \"Members only \u2014 No restroom facilities available for non-members.\" But despite the sign, people still keep coming in to use the bathroom, and the gym owner knows this. So, the man goes in anyway, uses the bathroom, and then gets burned by a malfunctioning hand dryer that was supposed to be out of service because of a previous incident.\n\nNow, the question is about the duty of care that the gym owed to this man. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what's duty of care? It's a legal obligation that one party owes to another to ensure their safety or well-being. In premises liability, it generally means that property owners have to maintain their premises safely for people who are lawfully on their property.\n\nBut here, the man is a non-member using the bathroom despite a sign saying not to. So, is he lawfully on the property? That's a bit tricky.\n\nOption A says no duty of care. That could be if the person was a trespasser or not supposed to be there at all. But in some jurisdictions, even for trespassers, there might be a limited duty of care, especially if the owner knows people are coming in for a specific reason, like using the bathroom.\n\nOption B says a duty to inspect the premises for unknown dangers and to disclose their existence to others. That sounds like due diligence. The gym should check for hazards and inform people about them.\n\nOption C says a duty to warn of any known dangerous conditions on the premises. This seems directly applicable here. The owner knew about the malfunctioning dryer and even taped a \"DO NOT USE\" sign on it, but the sign fell off, and the man didn't see it.\n\nOption D says an absolute duty of care. That sounds like the gym owes a very high standard of care, maybe even to ensure complete safety, which is pretty stringent.\n\nGiven that the gym knew people were coming in to use the bathroom despite the sign, they might still have a responsibility to ensure that the areas being used are safe. Especially since there was a known issue with the dryer.\n\nThe man didn't see the \"DO NOT USE\" sign because it had fallen off, so he couldn't have known about the danger. The gym owner was aware of the malfunction and had taken some steps to warn people, but those steps weren't sufficient in this case.\n\nSo, considering all this, option C seems the most appropriate: a duty to warn of any known dangerous conditions on the premises. The gym knew about the faulty dryer and had a sign, but the sign wasn't effectively in place, so they may have failed in their duty to warn the man.\n\nOption B is also about inspecting and disclosing dangers, which is similar, but option C specifically mentions warning about known dangers, which fits better with the situation.\n\nOption A, no duty of care, might not hold because the gym knew people were using the bathroom and didn't prevent it, so they might still have some responsibility.\n\nOption D, absolute duty of care, seems too broad and isn't typically how duty of care is categorized in premises liability.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: a duty to warn of any known dangerous conditions on the premises.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
