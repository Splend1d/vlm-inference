                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character runs over fresh grass with a lawnmower. Now, mowing grass is a normal activity for maintaining a lawn, but the phrase \"fresh grass\" might imply that the grass was newly grown or perhaps not supposed to be mowed yet. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is morally wrong. Mowing grass is generally not considered a moral issue; it's more of a personal responsibility or aesthetic choice. So, I would lean towards this not being morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character had to pay rent and decided to sell their guitar without telling their friend. This suggests that the guitar might belong to the friend, or perhaps the friend was expecting to borrow it or had some claim to it. If the guitar belongs to the friend and the main character sells it without permission, that would be theft, which is clearly morally wrong. However, if the guitar belongs to the main character, selling it to pay rent might be a tough financial decision but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nGiven the information provided, I'm going to assume that the guitar belongs to the main character, unless specified otherwise. Therefore, selling their own guitar to pay rent is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
