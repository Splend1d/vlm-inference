                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out who is liable for the debt that Pete Smith is owed by Wilson and Lamar Hardware. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, Bob Wilson borrowed $20,000 from Ted Lamar to open the hardware store. The loan was unsecured and had a term of 5 years with an initial interest rate of 9 percent, which was later reduced to 8 percent at Ted's discretion.\n\nBob named the business \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and used signs and advertising with this name. He also listed both himself and Ted as \"partners\" on the stationery. Ted, upon finding out, was flattered and reduced the interest rate.\n\nPete Smith sold goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware, assuming that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the store, and now he can't collect the debt.\n\nSo, the question is: who is liable for this debt?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Only Bob Wilson is liable.\n\nB. Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.\n\nC. Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount, and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.\n\nD. Only the de facto partnership arising from the relationship between Wilson and Lamar is liable.\n\nFirst, we need to determine if there is an actual partnership between Bob and Ted.\n\nFrom the information given, it seems that Ted Lamar is simply a lender to Bob Wilson. Ted's only interest was the repayment of the loan, and he didn't actively participate in the business. Bob named the store \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and listed them as partners on stationery without Ted's consent, and Ted only found out after the fact and was flattered, leading him to reduce the interest rate.\n\nThis suggests that there was no formal partnership agreement between Bob and Ted. Ted was not involved in the day-to-day operations of the business, and his only involvement was lending money.\n\nHowever, Bob represented them as partners in the business by using the name \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and listing them as partners on stationery. Pete Smith, who sold goods to the business, assumed that both were operating the store.\n\nThis could create a situation where Ted Lamar might be held liable as a partner due to the way the business was represented, even if there was no actual partnership.\n\nIn law, there's a concept called \"apparent authority\" or \"ostensible partnership,\" where if a person represents themselves as partners, third parties can rely on that representation, and both can be held liable.\n\nSo, in this case, even though Ted didn't actively participate in the business, by allowing his name to be used and not correcting the misrepresentation, he might be held liable.\n\nOption A says only Bob Wilson is liable. But given the misrepresentation, this might not be entirely accurate.\n\nOption B says both are liable jointly. This could be possible if Pete Smith can argue that he was led to believe both were partners and relied on that representation.\n\nOption C suggests that Bob is primarily liable, and Ted only secondarily, to the extent Bob can't pay. This might reflect a situation where Ted is liable but to a lesser extent.\n\nOption D mentions a de facto partnership. A de facto partnership is one that exists in fact, even if not formally established. However, in this case, there doesn't seem to be an actual partnership; it's more about the appearance of a partnership.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the best answer is Option B: Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.\n\nPete Smith, relying on the representation that both were partners, can hold both of them liable for the debt.\n\nTed might have a claim against Bob for misrepresenting their relationship, but that's separate from Pete's claim.\n\nSo, my advice to Pete would be that both Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly for the debt.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
