                    "text": "Let's see, I need to figure out who was the first American in space. The options are John Glenn, Buzz Aldrin, Alan Shepard, and Neil Armstrong. I think I remember something about this from school, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nFirst, I know that John Glenn was an astronaut, and he was the first American to orbit the Earth. But was he the first one in space? I think there might have been someone else before him.\n\nThen there's Buzz Aldrin. He's one of the astronauts who walked on the Moon during Apollo 11, right? So that was in 1969, which is probably after the first American in space.\n\nAlan Shepard\u2014I believe he was the first American in space. I think he flew on a Mercury mission, maybe Mercury-Redstone 3, which was called Freedom 7. Was that the first one?\n\nAnd Neil Armstrong, of course, he was the first person to walk on the Moon, but again, that would be later.\n\nLet me try to recall the timeline here. The Soviet Union sent Yuri Gagarin into space in April 1961, right? And I think the Americans followed shortly after that with their own manned spaceflight.\n\nSo, if Gagarin was the first human in space, who was the first American? I think it was Alan Shepard. Yes, I believe he flew in May 1961, just a few weeks after Gagarin.\n\nWait, but John Glenn orbited the Earth in 1962, which is later than that.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Yuri Gagarin (USSR): first human in space, April 1961\n\n- Alan Shepard (USA): first American in space, May 1961\n\n- John Glenn (USA): first American to orbit Earth, February 1962\n\n- Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin (USA): part of Apollo 11, first humans on the Moon, July 1969\n\nSo, based on that, the first American in space should be Alan Shepard.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's some confusion here.\n\nI recall that Alan Shepard's flight was suborbital, meaning he didn't complete an orbit around the Earth. He went up and came back down, without going all the way around the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, John Glenn was the first American to actually orbit the Earth, which is a bigger achievement in terms of spaceflight.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the first American in space, not the first to orbit Earth or the first to walk on the Moon.\n\nSo, even though Shepard's flight was suborbital, he still went into space, which is defined as above 100 kilometers (62 miles) in altitude.\n\nTherefore, Alan Shepard should be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, was there anyone else before him? Let me think.\n\nNo, Shepard's Mercury-Redstone 3 flight was in May 1961, and that was before Glenn's Mercury-Atlas 6 flight in February 1962.\n\nSo, unless there was another astronaut who flew before Shepard, but I don't think so.\n\nI think Mercury-Redstone 3 was the first manned Mercury flight.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there were any earlier flights that I'm not remembering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a test flight or something like that.\n\nWait, there was Mercury-Redstone 1, which was an unmanned test flight, and then Mercury-Redstone 1 Liberty Bell 7, which was a chimpanzee named Ham in January 1961.\n\nBut that was a primate, not a human.\n\nSo, Shepard's flight in May 1961 was indeed the first manned American spaceflight.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Alan Shepard.\n\nBut let's consider the other options briefly.\n\nJohn Glenn: first American to orbit Earth, which is a significant achievement, but not the first in space.\n\nBuzz Aldrin: second person on the Moon, but that's much later.\n\nNeil Armstrong: first person on the Moon, but again, later than the first American in space.\n\nSo, unless there's some misunderstanding about the timeline, it seems clear that Alan Shepard was the first American in space.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
