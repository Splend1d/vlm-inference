So, you'll divide 185.9 feet by 14.3 feet per floor.\n\nLet me do the calculation:\n\n185.9 \u00f7 14.3 = ?\n\nFirst, I'll make sure the numbers are aligned correctly. 14.3 goes into 185.9.\n\nLet's see:\n\n14.3 times 12 is 14.3 * 12 = 171.6.\n\n185.9 - 171.6 = 14.3.\n\nSo, 14.3 goes into 14.3 exactly once.\n\nSo, 12 + 1 = 13.\n\nTherefore, the building has 13 floors.\n\nWait, but let me check again to be sure.\n\n14.3 * 13 = 14.3 * 10 = 143, plus 14.3 * 3 = 42.9; total is 143 + 42.9 = 185.9.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 13 floors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
