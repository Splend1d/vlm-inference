The digits are divided into groups, typically separated by spaces or hyphens for readability, but the total number of digits is 16.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the structure of a Visa card number:\n\n- **First digit:** 4 (identifies it as a Visa card)\n\n- **Digits 2-6:** Issuer identification number (IIN), which identifies the institution that issued the card\n\n- **Digits 7-12:** Account number, which is unique to the cardholder\n\n- **Digits 13-15:** Check digit, used to verify the overall validity of the card number\n\n- **Digit 16:** Check digit, calculated using the Luhn algorithm to verify the overall validity of the card number\n\nIt's worth noting that some Visa cards may have additional digits for specific purposes, such as business cards or cards with additional features, but the standard consumer Visa card has 16 digits.\n\nOther types of credit cards have different numbers of digits:\n\n- **Mastercard:** 16 digits, starting with 51-55 or 2221-2720\n\n- **American Express (AmEx):** 15 digits, starting with 34 or 37\n\n- **Discover:** 16 digits, starting with 6011 or 65\n\n- **Diners Club:** 14 digits, starting with 300-305 or 36 or 38\n\nSo, for Visa, the standard is 16 digits.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- Visa Inc. (n.d.). [Credit Card Number Guide](https://usa.visa.com/card-tech/credit-card-number-guide.html). Visa USA.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The structure and number of digits can vary slightly based on the type of Visa card and the issuing bank, but 16 digits is the standard for most Visa credit and debit cards.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, including credit card numbers. It was created by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn and is in the public domain. The algorithm is designed to protect against accidental errors, such as transposed digits, and can detect about 98% of all possible single-digit errors.\n\n- Credit card numbers also often include other elements such as the cardholder's name, expiration date, and a CVV (Card Verification Value) code, which is a security feature to prevent fraud in card-not-present transactions.\n\n**Example:**\n\nA typical Visa card number might look like this: 4532 0151 1284 5310\n\n- First digit: 4 (Visa)\n\n- Digits 2-6: 53201 (Issuer identification number)\n\n- Digits 7-12: 511284 (Account number)\n\n- Digits 13-15: 531 (Check digits)\n\n- Digit 16: 0 (Final check digit)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is C. 16 digits for a standard Visa credit card number.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 16} \\]"
