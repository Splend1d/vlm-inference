It's a bit tricky, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, we have a tenant who lived in a small apartment building owned by a landlord. The landlord passed away in July, and in August, the tenant sues the administrator of the landlord's estate. The tenant claims there was a contract where the landlord was supposed to pay him $50 a week for mowing the lawn and doing small maintenance repairs for other tenants. He says the landlord didn't pay him for the past six months.\n\nThe tenant testified that there was a written contract, and the landlord had the only copy at his home. At trial, the tenant calls the landlord's accountant to testify about the contract. The accountant says she saw the contract and describes its terms, which match the tenant's testimony. She also says that the contract and other business documents were likely destroyed in a robbery at the landlord's business office a few months earlier.\n\nNow, the question is about the admissibility of the accountant's testimony. The options are:\n\nA. Admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.\n\nB. Admissible as a written admission by the party opponent.\n\nC. Inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence.\n\nI need to think about each option carefully.\n\nStarting with option A: Admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.\n\nSecondary evidence is generally allowed when the original document is unavailable. In this case, the contract was presumably destroyed in a robbery. So, if the original contract is unavailable due to circumstances beyond the tenant's control, then secondary evidence like the accountant's testimony might be acceptable.\n\nBut I need to consider whether this qualifies as secondary evidence. Secondary evidence typically includes copies of documents or testimony about the document's contents when the original can't be produced. Here, the accountant is testifying about the contract's terms based on her memory of having seen it, not necessarily from a copy or the original itself.\n\nSo, maybe not the best fit for secondary evidence. Maybe I should look at other options.\n\nOption B: Admissible as a written admission by the party opponent.\n\nThis seems interesting. A written admission would be a statement by the opposing party that admits to something, like the existence of the contract.\n\nBut in this case, the contract was between the landlord and the tenant. The landlord is deceased, and the suit is against the administrator of his estate. The landlord wouldn't be a party opponent in the traditional sense, but his estate is being represented by the administrator.\n\nI'm not sure if the contract itself counts as a written admission by the party opponent. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption C: Inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nThe Dead Man's Statute is a law in some jurisdictions that prevents certain parties from testifying about communications or transactions with a deceased person, to prevent fraud or perjury.\n\nIn this case, the tenant is testifying about a contract with the deceased landlord, and the accountant is testifying about the same contract.\n\nSo, perhaps the Dead Man's Statute would apply here, making the accountant's testimony inadmissible.\n\nBut I need to consider whether the accountant is testifying about communications with the deceased or about the contract itself.\n\nWait, the accountant says she saw the contract and knows its terms. She's not testifying about any communications with the landlord, just about the existence and terms of the contract.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how the Dead Man's Statute applies in this scenario.\n\nOption D: Inadmissible, because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence.\n\nThe best evidence rule generally requires that to prove the content of a writing, the original document must be produced. If the original is unavailable, then secondary evidence may be allowed, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nIn this case, the original contract is unavailable due to the robbery. So, perhaps the best evidence rule allows for secondary evidence, making the accountant's testimony admissible.\n\nBut option D says it's inadmissible because it's not the best evidence. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe the best evidence rule would require that if the original is unavailable, there must be proper foundation laid to admit secondary evidence, like testimony about the document.\n\nSo, perhaps the accountant's testimony could be admissible as secondary evidence, provided that the tenant establishes that the original is unavailable due to the robbery.\n\nBut in the question, it's the accountant who says the documents were likely destroyed. Maybe the tenant needs to provide more proof that the original contract was destroyed.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.\n\nThis seems plausible, but I need to make sure that the conditions for admitting secondary evidence are met.\n\nOption B: Admissible as a written admission by the party opponent.\n\nI don't think this applies here, because the contract isn't an admission; it's a contractual agreement between two parties.\n\nOption C: Inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nThis could be a possibility, but I'm not entirely sure how it applies to testimony about a contract, especially since the accountant is not a party to the contract.\n\nOption D: Inadmissible, because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence.\n\nThis might not be correct, because secondary evidence is sometimes allowed when the original is unavailable.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider the purpose of the accountant's testimony. She's testifying about the terms of the contract, which the tenant claims exists.\n\nSince the contract is written, and the original is unavailable, the best evidence rule would typically require that the original be produced. However, if it's shown that the original is lost or destroyed without bad faith, then secondary evidence can be admitted.\n\nIn this case, the accountant testifies that the documents were likely destroyed in a robbery. If the tenant can show that the original contract was destroyed in the robbery and that he didn't cause its destruction, then the accountant's testimony might be admissible as secondary evidence.\n\nSo, option A seems like the best choice.\n\nBut I should also consider the Dead Man's Statute. In some jurisdictions, the Dead Man's Statute prevents certain parties from testifying about transactions or communications with a deceased person in cases where the deceased's estate is a party.\n\nIn this case, the tenant is suing the administrator of the landlord's estate, so the estate is a party.\n\nIf the Dead Man's Statute applies, it might bar the tenant's testimony about the contract with the deceased landlord.\n\nSimilarly, it might bar the accountant's testimony about the contract, depending on the specifics of the statute in that jurisdiction.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how the Dead Man's Statute works in this context, but it's something to consider.\n\nPerhaps option C is also a possible answer.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the accountant's testimony, not the tenant's.\n\nMaybe the Dead Man's Statute only applies to the tenant's testimony, since he's a party to the action.\n\nI need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Dead Man's Statute doesn't apply to the accountant because she's not a party to the action and is testifying about a document she saw in her capacity as the landlord's accountant.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me look back at the options.\n\nA. Admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.\n\nB. Admissible as a written admission by the party opponent.\n\nC. Inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence.\n\nI think option D is incorrect because secondary evidence is allowed when the original is unavailable, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nOption B doesn't seem to apply because the contract isn't an admission.\n\nOption C might apply, but I'm not sure how it affects the accountant's testimony.\n\nOption A seems the most plausible, as the accountant's testimony could be considered secondary evidence of the contract's terms, given that the original is unavailable due to the robbery.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option A: admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
