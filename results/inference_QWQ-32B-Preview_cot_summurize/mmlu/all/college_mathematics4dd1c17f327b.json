The parametric equations \\( x = \\cos t \\) and \\( y = \\sin t \\) for \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq \\pi \\) describe the upper half of the unit circle. The circumference of a full unit circle is \\( 2\\pi \\), so the length of the upper half should be \\( \\pi \\), which matches our calculation.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 3\n\nB. \\( \\pi \\)\n\nC. \\( 3\\pi \\)\n\nD. \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\)\n\nOption B is \\( \\pi \\), which aligns with our calculation. However, the user mentioned that the answer is D, which is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\), but based on the standard calculation, it seems that \\( \\pi \\) is the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check the parametric equations and the interval. The equations \\( x = \\cos t \\) and \\( y = \\sin t \\) for \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq \\pi \\) indeed describe a semicircle, and its length should be \\( \\pi \\).\n\nPerhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement or in the options provided. Alternatively, maybe there is a different interpretation of the parametric equations or the interval.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the general formula for the circumference of an ellipse, but since both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are defined in terms of sine and cosine with the same coefficient, it's still a circle.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the parameterization is not for a unit circle. Let's check the coefficients of \\( \\cos t \\) and \\( \\sin t \\). In the given problem, \\( x = \\cos t \\) and \\( y = \\sin t \\), which suggests a unit circle. But maybe there is a scaling factor involved that I'm missing.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: \"the curve with parametric equations \\( x = \\cos t \\) and \\( y = \\sin t \\), \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq \\pi \\), has length\"\n\nGiven that, and the options, I still think \\( \\pi \\) is the correct answer. Maybe there is a mistake in the options or in the user's recall of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parametric equations are different, or the interval is different. But based on what's provided, the length should be \\( \\pi \\).\n\nWait, maybe the parametric equations are \\( x = \\cos t \\) and \\( y = \\sin t \\), but with a different scaling. For example, if \\( x = a \\cos t \\) and \\( y = a \\sin t \\), then the circumference would be scaled by \\( a \\). But in this case, \\( a = 1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parametric equations are not for a circle but for some other curve, but given \\( x = \\cos t \\) and \\( y = \\sin t \\), it's clearly a circle.\n\nAnother possibility is that the parameter \\( t \\) is not in radians but in some other unit, but that would be highly unusual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interval is different. The user specified \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq \\pi \\), which is half the circle, so length \\( \\pi \\). If it were \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq 2\\pi \\), it would be the full circle, length \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\nWait, maybe the user misremembered the interval. If the interval were \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq \\frac{3}{2} \\), that would make less sense because \\( t \\) is typically in radians, and \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) radians is less than \\( \\pi \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different parametrization or a different curve altogether.\n\nGiven that, and the options provided, I'm inclined to stick with \\( \\pi \\) as the correct answer, which corresponds to option B.\n\nHowever, the user mentioned that the answer is D, which is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\), but based on standard calculations, that doesn't seem correct for the given parametric equations and interval.\n\nPerhaps there is additional context or a different problem altogether. In any case, based on the information provided, the length should be \\( \\pi \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\pi} \\]"
