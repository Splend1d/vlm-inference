The options are given in interval notation, and I need to choose the correct one among A. (0, 9), B. (1, 1), C. (6, 0), D. (6, 6).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the inequality to have real solutions for $x$. This means there are real numbers $x$ that make the quadratic expression less than zero.\n\nI know that a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has real roots if its discriminant is positive. The discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac$. For the quadratic inequality $ax^2 + bx + c < 0$, to have real solutions, the quadratic equation must have two distinct real roots, which means the discriminant must be positive.\n\nSo, for the inequality $x^2 - 6x + c < 0$, the corresponding quadratic equation is $x^2 - 6x + c = 0$. The discriminant is $(-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c$.\n\nFor the quadratic to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive:\n\n$36 - 4c > 0$\n\nSolving for $c$:\n\n$36 > 4c$\n\n$9 > c$\n\n$c < 9$\n\nBut the problem asks for positive values of $c$, so $c > 0$. Therefore, combining these two inequalities, $0 < c < 9$.\n\nNow, I need to express this in interval notation. The interval from 0 to 9, not including 0 and 9, is written as (0, 9).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (0, 9)\n\nB. (1, 1)\n\nC. (6, 0)\n\nD. (6, 6)\n\nOption A matches the interval I found.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about what happens at the boundaries. If $c = 9$, the discriminant is zero, meaning there is exactly one real root, and the quadratic touches the x-axis at one point. In this case, the inequality $x^2 - 6x + 9 < 0$ becomes $(x - 3)^2 < 0$, which has no real solutions because a square is always non-negative.\n\nIf $c = 0$, the quadratic is $x^2 - 6x < 0$, which factors to $x(x - 6) < 0$. This inequality holds for $0 < x < 6$, so there are real solutions, but since $c = 0$ is not positive, it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the correct interval is indeed (0, 9).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ (0,\\ 9)} \\]\n\n**Confirming with code**\n\nTo further verify, we can use Python to check the discriminant for values of $c$ within and outside the interval (0, 9).\n\nLet's write a simple Python function to compute the discriminant and check if it's positive for different values of $c$.\ndef discriminant(c):\n    return 36 - 4 * c\n\n# Test values\ntest_values = [1, 5, 9, 10, -1]\nresults = {}\n\nfor c in test_values:\n    disc = discriminant(c)\n    if c > 0:\n        if disc > 0:\n            results[c] = \"Two real roots (inequality has solutions)\"\n        elif disc == 0:\n            results[c] = \"One real root (inequality has no solutions)\"\n        else:\n            results[c] = \"No real roots\"\n    else:\n        results[c] = \"c is not positive\"\n\nprint(results)\n```output\n{1: 'Two real roots (inequality has solutions)', 5: 'Two real roots (inequality has solutions)', 9: 'One real root (inequality has no solutions)', 10: 'No real roots', -1: 'c is not positive'}\n```\nThe results from the Python code confirm our earlier analysis:\n\n- For $c = 1$ (which is in the interval (0, 9)), the discriminant is positive, indicating two real roots and hence the inequality has real solutions.\n\n- For $c = 5$ (also in (0, 9)), similarly, the discriminant is positive, indicating two real roots and real solutions for the inequality.\n\n- For $c = 9$ (the upper boundary), the discriminant is zero, meaning one real root, and the inequality has no real solutions.\n\n- For $c = 10$ (greater than 9), the discriminant is negative, meaning no real roots and hence no real solutions for the inequality.\n\n- For $c = -1$ (not positive), the discriminant is positive, but since $c$ must be positive, this value is invalid for our problem.\n\nTherefore, the inequality $x^2 - 6x + c < 0$ has real solutions for $x$ when $c$ is in the interval $(0, 9)$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ (0,\\ 9)} \\]"
