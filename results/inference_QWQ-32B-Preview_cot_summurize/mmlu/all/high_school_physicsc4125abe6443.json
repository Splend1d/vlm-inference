                    "text": "Let's consider the interaction between a very slow-moving positron and a stationary electron. Positrons and electrons are antiparticles of each other, so when they meet, they can annihilate each other, converting their mass into energy. This process is governed by the principles of conservation of energy, momentum, and charge.\n\nOption A suggests that if a single new particle were created in the reaction, it must have a total mass equal to the combined masses of the electron and positron, based on conservation of mass. However, in modern physics, mass is not conserved; instead, the total energy is conserved. The mass-energy equivalence principle (E=mc\u00b2) tells us that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa. So, in this interaction, the masses of the electron and positron are converted into energy, typically in the form of gamma rays. Therefore, option A is incorrect because it refers to conservation of mass, which doesn't hold in this context.\n\nOption B states that conservation of charge indicates that all new particles created in the reaction would have no electric charge. Electrons have a negative charge, and positrons have a positive charge, so their total charge is zero. Therefore, the new particles produced must also have a total charge of zero. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that all individual particles created are electrically neutral; it just means their charges must sum to zero. For example, two gamma rays, which are electrically neutral, would satisfy this condition, as would other particle-antiparticle pairs with opposite charges. So, while conservation of charge is indeed a principle at play, option B is too restrictive in suggesting that all new particles must be uncharged.\n\nOption C proposes that conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created. Gamma rays are massless particles (photons) that travel at the speed of light and carry momentum proportional to their energy. In the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum before the annihilation is zero because the positron is moving slowly and the electron is stationary. Therefore, to conserve momentum, the total momentum after the annihilation must also be zero. If two gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions with equal energy, their momenta would cancel each other out, satisfying the conservation of momentum. This seems like a plausible outcome.\n\nOption D suggests that conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind. However, this doesn't make much sense because annihilation typically involves both particles converting into energy. If the positron annihilates and leaves the electron behind, it would imply that only the positron's mass is converted into energy, which wouldn't conserve energy because the electron's mass would still be present. Additionally, this scenario doesn't align with the known processes of electron-positron annihilation.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to be the most accurate description of a possible outcome of the reaction, based on the conservation of momentum. It's worth noting that in reality, electron-positron annihilation can produce one or more gamma rays, but the simplest and most common outcome is the production of two gamma rays moving in opposite directions to conserve both energy and momentum.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
