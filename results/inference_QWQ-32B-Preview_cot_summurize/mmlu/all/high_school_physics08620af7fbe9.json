                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which object reaches the bottom of the ramp first: a rolling sphere or a sliding block, both starting from rest at the same height on an inclined plane. The sphere rolls without slipping, and the block slides without friction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the energy transformations for each object.\n\nFor the block sliding down without friction, it should have only translational kinetic energy because there's no rotation involved. The potential energy at the top is converted entirely into translational kinetic energy at the bottom.\n\nSo, for the block:\n\nPotential Energy (PE) = Translational Kinetic Energy (TKE)\n\nmgh = (1/2)mv\u00b2\n\nWhere:\n\n- m is the mass\n\n- g is the acceleration due to gravity\n\n- h is the height\n\n- v is the final velocity\n\nSolving for v:\n\nv = sqrt(2gh)\n\nNow, for the sphere that's rolling without slipping, it has both translational and rotational kinetic energy. The potential energy at the top is converted into both types of kinetic energy at the bottom.\n\nSo, for the sphere:\n\nPotential Energy (PE) = Translational Kinetic Energy (TKE) + Rotational Kinetic Energy (RKE)\n\nmgh = (1/2)mv\u00b2 + (1/2)I\u03c9\u00b2\n\nWhere:\n\n- I is the moment of inertia for the sphere\n\n- \u03c9 is the angular velocity\n\nFor a solid sphere, the moment of inertia I = (2/5)mr\u00b2\n\nAnd since it's rolling without slipping, v = r\u03c9, so \u03c9 = v/r\n\nSubstituting I and \u03c9 into the equation:\n\nmgh = (1/2)mv\u00b2 + (1/2)(2/5)mr\u00b2*(v/r)\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\nmgh = (1/2)mv\u00b2 + (1/5)mv\u00b2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nmgh = (7/10)mv\u00b2\n\nSolving for v:\n\nv\u00b2 = (10/7)gh\n\nv = sqrt((10/7)gh)\n\nNow, comparing the velocities:\n\nBlock: v = sqrt(2gh)\n\nSphere: v = sqrt((10/7)gh)\n\nWhich one is larger? Let's compare 2 and 10/7:\n\n2 = 14/7\n\n10/7 is less than 14/7, so the block has a higher velocity at the bottom.\n\nBut velocity is related to acceleration and time. Since both start from rest and cover the same distance, the one with higher acceleration reaches bottom first.\n\nWait, but actually, velocity is a function of acceleration and time, and distance is (1/2)at\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of energy and how it affects acceleration.\n\nAlternatively, since both have the same potential energy at the top, and block converts all to translational kinetic energy, while sphere converts some to rotational kinetic energy, the block should have higher translational speed, meaning it reaches bottom first.\n\nBut let's think about the forces involved.\n\nFor the block sliding down without friction, the only force acting down the incline is the component of gravity, which is m*g*sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle of inclination.\n\nSo, acceleration a = g*sin\u03b8\n\nFor the sphere rolling down without slipping, there is also the torque due to friction, which provides the angular acceleration.\n\nBut the problem states that the sphere rolls without slipping, so friction is present, but it's static friction, which doesn't do work.\n\nSo, for the sphere, the net force down the incline is also m*g*sin\u03b8, minus the frictional force.\n\nBut since it's rolling without slipping, the frictional force provides the torque for rotation.\n\nThe net force down the incline for the sphere is m*g*sin\u03b8 - f, where f is the static frictional force.\n\nThe torque is f*r = I*\u03b1, where \u03b1 is the angular acceleration.\n\nAnd since v = r\u03c9 and a = r\u03b1, then \u03b1 = a/r.\n\nSo, torque = f*r = I*(a/r)\n\nSolving for f:\n\nf = (I*a)/(r\u00b2)\n\nFor a solid sphere, I = (2/5)mr\u00b2, so:\n\nf = ( (2/5)mr\u00b2 * a ) / r\u00b2 = (2/5)ma\n\nNow, back to the net force for the sphere:\n\nm*g*sin\u03b8 - f = m*a\n\nSubstitute f:\n\nm*g*sin\u03b8 - (2/5)ma = m*a\n\nFactor out a:\n\nm*g*sin\u03b8 = a*(1 + 2/5)m\n\nSimplify:\n\na = (g*sin\u03b8)/(1 + 2/5) = (g*sin\u03b8)/(7/5) = (5/7)g*sin\u03b8\n\nSo, acceleration for the sphere is (5/7)g*sin\u03b8\n\nFor the block, acceleration is g*sin\u03b8\n\nSince (5/7) < 1, the block has a higher acceleration.\n\nTherefore, the block reaches the bottom first.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The sphere, because it gains rotational kinetic energy, but the block does not\n\nB. The sphere, because it gains mechanical energy due to the torque exerted on it, but the block does not\n\nC. The block, because it does not lose mechanical energy due to friction, but the sphere does\n\nD. The block, because it does not gain rotational kinetic energy, but the sphere does\n\nOption D seems closest, but it's worded a bit strangely. It says the block does not gain rotational kinetic energy, which is true, but the reason for reaching first is because it has higher translational speed, not directly because it doesn't gain rotational kinetic energy.\n\nOption C might also be tempting, but the sphere doesn't lose mechanical energy due to friction; static friction doesn't do work. So, mechanical energy is conserved for both.\n\nI think the best answer is D, because the block doesn't gain rotational kinetic energy, so all its potential energy goes into translational kinetic energy, resulting in higher speed and thus reaching first.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
