I know that space exploration has been a big deal for a few countries, but I'm not entirely sure about Venus missions.\n\nFirst, I recall that the Soviet Union, which is referred to here as the U.S.S.R., had a program called Venera, which was dedicated to exploring Venus. I think they sent several probes there, some of which actually landed on the surface. So, option A seems likely.\n\nAs for the U.S., I know they have done a lot in space, like landing on the Moon and sending rovers to Mars. But I'm not sure if they've sent landers to Venus. I think they might have sent orbiters, but maybe not landers. So, option B might not be correct.\n\nFrance? I don't recall any French missions to Venus, at least not landers. Maybe they've been involved in some way, but it doesn't ring a bell.\n\nOption D is A and B, which would mean both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. sent landers to Venus. But based on what I'm remembering, only the U.S.S.R. did.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific missions. The Venera program by the Soviets had multiple missions, like Venera 7, which was the first spacecraft to land on another planet, and it was Venus. Venera 9 and 10 also landed and even sent back images from the surface. So, that confirms that the U.S.S.R. definitely sent landers to Venus.\n\nNow, did the U.S. ever do that? I think their missions to Venus were mostly orbiters, like the Magellan mission, which mapped the surface of Venus. But I don't think they've ever successfully landed a probe there. Maybe they tried but failed, or maybe they just focused on other aspects of Venus exploration.\n\nFrance doesn't seem to have a notable Venus lander mission that I know of. Perhaps they've collaborated with other countries on Venus missions, but I don't think they've sent their own landers.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is A. The U.S.S.R.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should check some facts quickly. Let's see, Venera program was indeed by the Soviet Union, and they had several successful landers on Venus. The U.S. had the Pioneer Venus mission, which included multiple probes, but I believe those were atmospheric probes, not surface landers. Magellan was an orbiter, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nThere was also the Soviet Union's Venera-D mission planned, but that's in the future. And the European Space Agency has the Venus Express, which was also an orbiter.\n\nSo, it seems like only the U.S.S.R. has successfully landed probes on Venus.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. The U.S.S.R.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
