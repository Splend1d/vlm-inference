I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I wanted to enliven the zoo fundraiser, so I quickly let out the tigers and monkey and let them swarm the dining hall.\n\nScenario 2: I made a copy of the answer key.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on general US standards around 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: letting out tigers and a monkey into a dining hall for a zoo fundraiser. Hmm, that seems dangerous. Tigers are wild animals, and letting them loose in a place full of people could cause harm, injury, or even death. Also, it's a fundraiser, which is probably for a good cause, but the way to enliven it seems extreme and reckless.\n\nIn US moral standards, causing harm to others or putting people's safety at risk is generally considered wrong. So, this seems like a clear case of something morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: making a copy of an answer key. This seems like cheating or dishonesty, which is also generally considered wrong morally. Copying someone else's work or answers without permission is fraudulent and unfair to others who are playing by the rules.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, even if the intention was to make the fundraiser more exciting, the means are highly irresponsible and could lead to severe consequences. It's not just about breaking rules; it's about endangering lives.\n\nIn Scenario 2, copying an answer key is clearly cheating, which is dishonest and unfair to others who study and work hard honestly.\n\nTherefore, both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a twist I'm missing. Let's consider if there are any contexts where these actions might be acceptable.\n\nFor Scenario 1, perhaps if it was part of a pre-planned event with proper safety measures in place, like a controlled animal show. But the way it's described, it's done quickly and seemingly without proper planning or safety precautions. So, still, that would likely be considered wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, there might be situations where copying an answer key is allowed, like if it's for study purposes and not for submission. But the scenario says \"made a copy of the answer key,\" which implies using it for one's benefit, probably to cheat on a test or assignment.\n\nTherefore, both actions are indeed morally wrong.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
