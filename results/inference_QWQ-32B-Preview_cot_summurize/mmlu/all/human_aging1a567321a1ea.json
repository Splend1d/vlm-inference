The options are African-American, White, Native-American, and Asian-American. I know that different ethnic groups may have varying cultural attitudes towards alcohol, which could influence their drinking habits. But I'm not sure about the specific statistics.\n\nI remember that in some studies, Asian-Americans have lower rates of alcoholism compared to other groups. I think this might be because of cultural reasons, like certain Asian cultures having a genetic predisposition to flushing when they drink, which can deter heavy drinking. Also, some Asian cultures may have more restrictive attitudes towards alcohol.\n\nOn the other hand, I've heard that Native-Americans have higher rates of alcohol abuse, but I'm not sure if that's still accurate or if it's a stereotype. I should look up recent data on alcohol abuse rates among these different ethnic groups in the United States.\n\nLet me see. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Asian-Americans have the lowest prevalence of alcohol use disorder compared to other ethnic groups in the U.S. They report that Asian-Americans are less likely to drink alcohol altogether, and when they do, they tend to drink less heavily.\n\nIn contrast, white Americans have higher rates of alcohol use disorder, and Native-Americans also have significant issues with alcohol abuse, although the rates can vary among different tribes and regions.\n\nAfrican-Americans have rates of alcohol use disorder that are similar to or slightly lower than whites, but higher than Asian-Americans.\n\nSo, based on this information, it seems that Asian-Americans have the lowest rate of alcohol abuse among the options given.\n\nBut I should double-check this with other sources to make sure. Let me look at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) data. According to SAMHSA, Asian-Americans have the lowest rates of past-month alcohol use and binge drinking compared to other racial and ethnic groups.\n\nAdditionally, the CDC has reported that Asian-Americans are the least likely to drink alcohol, with only about 30% reporting current alcohol use, compared to about 50% of whites and African-Americans.\n\nTherefore, it appears that Asian-Americans have the lowest rate of alcohol abuse among the groups listed.\n\nI think the answer is D. Asian-American.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
