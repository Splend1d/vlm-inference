                    "text": "So here's this contract scenario between a buyer on the West Coast and a seller on the East Coast for flanges. They agreed on 1,000 flanges for $10,000, and the contract says it's FOB at the seller's place of business. The seller handed over the flanges to a delivery company, which was supposed to take them to the buyer, but there was an accident, and all the flanges were destroyed. The buyer asked the seller to ship replacements, but the seller refused. Now, the buyer is suing the seller for breach of contract, and I need to figure out who's going to win.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what FOB means in this context. FOB stands for \"Free On Board,\" and when it's specified as FOB at the seller's place of business, it usually determines where the title and risk of loss pass from the seller to the buyer. In general, FOB origin means that the seller is responsible up to the point of shipment, and after that, the risk transfers to the buyer.\n\nSo, in this case, since it's FOB at the seller's place, does that mean the risk of loss transfers to the buyer once the goods are shipped? I think that's the case, but I should double-check.\n\nLet me look up FOB terms in contracts. According to standard commercial practices, FOB origin means that the seller is responsible for getting the goods to the shipping point, and once they're shipped, the buyer assumes the risk of loss during transit. So, in this scenario, once the seller handed the flanges to the delivery company, the risk of loss passed to the buyer.\n\nWait, but the accident happened while the flanges were en route. So, if the risk of loss is on the buyer once the goods are shipped, that means the buyer bears the risk of the accident.\n\nBut the buyer is suing the seller for breach of contract, asking for replacement flanges. If the risk is on the buyer, does that mean the seller doesn't have to provide replacements?\n\nI think so. If the risk of loss is on the buyer, then the seller has already fulfilled their obligation by shipping the goods. Any loss in transit isn't the seller's responsibility.\n\nSo, in an action by the buyer against the seller for breach of contract, the buyer won't succeed because the risk of loss was on the buyer.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Succeed, because the risk of loss was on the seller.\n\nBut according to my understanding, the risk of loss was on the buyer, so this wouldn't be correct.\n\nB. Succeed, because the carrier was the seller's agent.\n\nHmm, was the carrier the seller's agent? The seller hired the delivery company to transport the goods, so probably the carrier was the seller's agent in this transaction. But even if that's the case, since the risk of loss passed to the buyer upon shipment, I'm not sure if this would make a difference.\n\nC. Not succeed, because the risk of loss was on the buyer.\n\nThis seems consistent with what I've gathered so far.\n\nD. Not succeed, because of frustration of purpose.\n\nFrustration of purpose is a doctrine in contract law where an event occurs that destroys the fundamental purpose of the contract, through no fault of either party. In this case, the flanges were destroyed in transit, which might seem frustrating to the buyer, but it's not like the purpose of the contract was fundamentally destroyed; it's just that the goods were lost in transit.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the correct answer is C. The buyer won't succeed because the risk of loss was on the buyer.\n\nBut let me think about this again. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any reason why the risk of loss wouldn't pass to the buyer upon shipment? Is there something in the FOB terms that I'm misunderstanding?\n\nLet me check the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), since this deals with the sale of goods. Under UCC Section 2-401, the risk of loss passes to the buyer once the seller has performed their duty to deliver the goods, which in the case of FOB origin, is when the goods are shipped.\n\nSo, according to UCC 2-401, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the seller tenders the goods to the carrier. In this case, the seller delivered the flanges to the delivery company, so the risk transferred at that point.\n\nTherefore, any loss during transit is the buyer's responsibility, and the seller isn't obligated to provide replacements.\n\nSo, in court, the buyer's claim for breach of contract wouldn't hold up, because the seller had already fulfilled their part of the contract by shipping the goods.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. The buyer won't succeed because the risk of loss was on the buyer.\n\nAlright, I think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
