                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Norcross's discussion on Fred's behavior and the behavior of consumers of factory-raised meat. The question is asking which potentially morally relevant difference doesn't Norcross discuss among the options provided. Let's look at each option to understand better.\n\nOption A says that Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies, whereas the behavior of meat-eaters \"merely\" involves the suffering of chickens, pigs, cows, calves, sheep, and the like. So, this is about the types of animals involved. Norcross might discuss whether the species of the animal makes a moral difference, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption B mentions that the suffering of puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure in Fred's case, whereas the suffering of farm animals is just a by-product of economic conditions. This seems to be about the necessity of the suffering for the desired outcome.\n\nOption C states that Fred could prevent the puppies' suffering, whereas meat-eaters can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume. This is about the ability to prevent suffering.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" meaning that Norcross discusses all of these points.\n\nTo answer this question, I need to recall Norcross's arguments. Norcross is known for his work on the moral relevance of species, particularly in his paper \"Puppies, Pigs, and People.\" In that paper, he compares the intuition that it's wrong to kill a puppy for food with the practice of killing animals like pigs for food. He argues that if it's wrong to kill a puppy for food, then it's also wrong to kill a pig for food, based on the idea that species membership shouldn't be a morally relevant characteristic.\n\nGiven that, let's see which of these options he doesn't discuss.\n\nOption A talks about different species suffering. Norcross directly addresses this in his paper, arguing that species differences aren't morally relevant. So, he likely discusses this difference.\n\nOption B mentions that in Fred's case, suffering is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas in factory farming, suffering is a by-product of economic conditions. I'm not sure if Norcross specifically contrasts the necessity of suffering in these two cases. He might focus more on the fact that both involve unnecessary suffering, but the necessity aspect might not be a central point in his discussion.\n\nOption C is about the ability to prevent suffering. Norcross might discuss whether consumers can prevent the suffering by choosing not to consume factory-farmed meat, but the idea that meat-eaters can't prevent suffering seems contrary to the point that they can choose not to eat meat. So, perhaps he would argue that consumers can prevent suffering by changing their consumption habits.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Option B might be the one Norcross doesn't discuss, or at least doesn't focus on, in his comparison between Fred's behavior and that of meat-eaters. He might not draw a distinction between the necessity of suffering for gustatory pleasure in Fred's case and the suffering being a by-product of economic conditions in factory farming.\n\nTherefore, the answer is probably B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
