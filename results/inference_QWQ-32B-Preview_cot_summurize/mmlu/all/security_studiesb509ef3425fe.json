Revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them.\n\nLet me explain why I think this is the case. First, global inequality is a significant issue where a small portion of the world's population holds a disproportionate amount of wealth and resources. This disparity can lead to feelings of injustice and frustration among those who feel left behind.\n\nWhen people feel that they are not sharing in the benefits of globalization, they may become disenchanted with existing political and economic systems. This disenchantment can sometimes lead to radicalization, where individuals or groups adopt extreme ideologies that advocate for violent or revolutionary change.\n\nThese radicalized groups may target those they perceive as benefiting from the current system, leading to acts of terrorism, insurgency, or other forms of political violence. Such actions can threaten global security by destabilizing regions, causing humanitarian crises, and potentially drawing in international actors.\n\nOption A suggests that human security is threatened by global inequality, but it downplays the potential for political instability and military action. However, history has shown that economic disparities can indeed lead to political unrest and, in some cases, military conflict.\n\nOption B claims that disenfranchised populations lack the agency to rebel or protest. But this is not necessarily true. Throughout history, marginalized groups have found ways to organize and challenge oppressive systems, sometimes leading to significant social and political change.\n\nOption D simply denies that global inequality poses a threat to global security, which contradicts the experiences of many regions where economic disparities have been linked to political instability and violence.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option C is the most accurate in describing how global inequality can present a threat to global security through the potential for revolutionary uprisings and radicalization.\n\n**References:**\n\n1.
