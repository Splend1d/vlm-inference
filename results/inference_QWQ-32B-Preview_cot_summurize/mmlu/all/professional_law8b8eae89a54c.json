                    "text": "So here's this scenario: A man's brother gets murdered, and he puts a reward in the newspaper offering $10,000 to anyone who helps catch the killer. An amateur detective, who didn't know about this reward, starts investigating out of his own curiosity. He ends up finding crucial information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the murderer. Only after the trial does he learn about the reward and tries to claim the $10,000. Now, if he sues to get that money, will he succeed?\n\nLet's break this down. First, there's a reward offer published in the newspaper. That's like an offer to the world: \"If you do this, I'll pay you that.\" In contract law, that's similar to an offer that can be accepted by anyone who performs the required act.\n\nThe detective, however, didn't know about this offer when he started his investigation. He was just curious and interested in solving the crime on his own. So, he didn't act with the intention of accepting the offer or fulfilling a promise to get the reward.\n\nNow, in contract law, for a contract to be formed, there usually needs to be an offer and acceptance, and some consideration\u2014something of value exchanged between the parties. Here, the man offered a reward for certain action, and the detective performed that action without knowing about the offer.\n\nOption A says he'll succeed because his apprehension of the murderer created a contract implied in law. An implied-in-law contract, or quasi-contract, is when the law creates an obligation to prevent unjust enrichment. So, if the detective helped catch the murderer, and the man benefitted from that (by having his brother's killer caught), maybe the law would imply a contract to pay the detective, even if there wasn't a direct agreement.\n\nOption B says he'll succeed because he was unaware of the offer. But that seems contradictory. If he didn't know about the offer, how can he accept it? Generally, to accept an offer, you need to know about it and agree to it.\n\nOption C says he won't succeed because he didn't have knowledge of the reward. That makes sense. If he didn't know about the offer, he couldn't have accepted it. So, no contract was formed based on the offer.\n\nOption D says he won't succeed because his investigation was not a bargained-for exchange. This also makes sense. A bargained-for exchange is when both parties agree to give something in exchange for something else. Here, the detective didn't know about the offer, so there was no bargaining or exchange agreed upon.\n\nConsidering this, it seems like options C and D are stronger. The detective didn't know about the reward, so he couldn't have accepted the offer, and his actions weren't based on any bargain to get the money.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another angle. Perhaps the law implies a contract in these situations to encourage people to help solve crimes. So, even if the detective didn't know about the reward, since his actions fulfilled the condition of the offer, the man should still pay the reward.\n\nOn the other hand, the detective might argue that he acted to help justice, not for the reward, but since his actions coincidentally fulfilled the offer's condition, he should still get the money.\n\nHowever, in contract law, generally, to accept an offer, you need to have knowledge of it and intend to accept it. Since the detective didn't know about the offer, he didn't intend to accept it, so no contract was formed based on that offer.\n\nBut perhaps there's a quasi-contractual obligation. Quasi-contracts are imposed by law to prevent unjust enrichment. So, if the man receives a benefit (the catcher of his brother's murderer) and the detective incurred expenses or spent time and effort, maybe the law would imply a contract to pay him.\n\nHowever, in reward cases, the general rule is that the reward offer is accepted by performing the requested act, even if the performer didn't know about the offer. The theory is that the offer is out there, and anyone who performs the act is deemed to accept it.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. If the detective didn't know about the offer, did he intend to accept it? Intent seems important in forming a contract.\n\nMaybe I should look up some case law on reward offers and whether knowledge is required.\n\nI recall a case called \"Brogan v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.\" where the court held that a reward offer could be accepted by performing the requested act, even if the performer didn't know about the offer. The rationale was that the offer was to the world, and anyone who performed the act would be deemed to have accepted the offer.\n\nIf that's the case, then maybe option A is correct: the detective did create a contract implied in law by performing the act, even without knowledge of the offer.\n\nBut wait, in Brogan, the plaintiff had knowledge of the offer, I think. Let me check.\n\nActually, in Brogan, the plaintiff didn't know about the reward offer when he performed the act, but the court still held that by performing the act, he accepted the offer.\n\nIf that's the case, then maybe the detective should succeed in getting the reward, even without knowledge.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. If someone does something good without knowing about a reward, should they still get paid once they find out?\n\nOn one hand, it encourages people to help, knowing that rewards are out there. On the other hand, it might be unfair to the person offering the reward, who expected that people would perform the act knowing about the reward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the detective can only claim the reward if he had knowledge of the offer at the time of performing the act.\n\nI think I need to consider the elements of a contract. There's offer, acceptance, and consideration.\n\nThe offer was made by the man in the newspaper: \"$10,000 to anyone who supplies information leading to arrest and conviction.\"\n\nAcceptance is typically communicated to the offeror, but in reward offers, acceptance is by performing the act.\n\nHowever, does performance without knowledge of the offer constitute acceptance?\n\nIn some cases, courts have held that performance of the act is acceptance, regardless of knowledge, because the offer is to the world, and anyone who performs the act is accepting the offer.\n\nBut perhaps there are limitations to this rule.\n\nAnother angle: did the detective intend to accept the offer? If he didn't know about it, he couldn't have intended to accept it.\n\nIntent seems crucial in forming a contract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a quasi-contractual obligation based on unjust enrichment. The man gets the benefit of having his brother's murderer caught, and the detective incurred expenses or spent time and effort. So, to prevent unjust enrichment, the man should pay the detective.\n\nBut in reward cases, the law might treat it differently because the offer was made publicly.\n\nI think the key here is whether knowledge of the offer is required for acceptance.\n\nIf the law says that performance itself constitutes acceptance, regardless of knowledge, then the detective should get the reward.\n\nBut if knowledge is required, then he shouldn't get it.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Succeed, because his apprehension of the murderer created a contract implied in law.\n\nB. Succeed, because he was unaware of the offer.\n\nC. Not succeed, because he did not have knowledge of the reward.\n\nD. Not succeed, because his investigation was not a bargained-for exchange.\n\nOption B seems contradictory because it says he succeeds because he was unaware of the offer. But if he was unaware, how can he accept the offer?\n\nSo, option C seems more plausible: he doesn't succeed because he didn't have knowledge of the reward.\n\nOption D also makes sense: his investigation wasn't a bargained-for exchange because he didn't know about the offer.\n\nOption A is interesting. Maybe there's a quasi-contract imposed by law, but I'm not sure if that would apply here.\n\nI think the correct answer is C: he doesn't succeed because he didn't have knowledge of the reward.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another perspective.\n\nSuppose the detective had known about the reward and investigated with the intention of getting the money. In that case, it's clear that he's entitled to the reward if he fulfills the conditions.\n\nBut since he didn't know about it, his investigation was motivated by curiosity, not by the desire to get the reward.\n\nTherefore, it wouldn't be fair to force the man to pay the reward in this situation.\n\nMoreover, the detective didn't rely on the reward offer when performing his actions because he wasn't aware of it.\n\nSo, no contractual obligation was created.\n\nTherefore, the detective cannot recover the $10,000.\n\nHence, the answer is C: not succeed, because he did not have knowledge of the reward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
