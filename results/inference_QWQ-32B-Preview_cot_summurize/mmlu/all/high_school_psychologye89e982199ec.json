                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which diagnosis fits Odette's symptoms best. She's nearing her 70th birthday, so she's in her late 60s. Over the last year, she's had a loss of appetite, trouble sleeping, and lost interest in activities she used to enjoy like gardening and bridge. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Alzheimer's disease: This is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time. Common early symptoms include memory loss, especially forgetting recently learned information, and difficulties with planning or solving problems. While Odette has some changes in her behavior, like losing interest in activities, the main symptoms don't seem to match Alzheimer's disease directly. She's not mentioned to have memory problems or confusion, which are typical in Alzheimer's.\n\nB. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD): This is a type of depression that's related to changes in seasons, typically starting in the fall and continuing through winter. Symptoms include depression, increased appetite, especially for carbohydrates, and increased sleep. But Odette has a loss of appetite and difficulty sleeping, which are opposite to what's usually seen in SAD. So, this doesn't seem to fit well.\n\nC. Insomnia and bulimia: Insomnia is difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, which Odette experiences. Bulimia is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging, but Odette has a loss of appetite, not binge eating. So, combining insomnia with bulimia might not fit her symptoms, especially since she's not showing signs of binge eating or purging.\n\nD. Major depressive disorder: This is a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, fatigue, and other symptoms. Given Odette's loss of appetite, sleep difficulties, and loss of interest in gardening and bridge, these symptoms align well with major depressive disorder.\n\nConsidering all options, D. major depressive disorder seems to be the most likely diagnosis for Odette's symptoms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
