                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is: which algebraic expression represents four times the quantity 22 less than x?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"22 less than x\" means. \"Less than\" can be a bit tricky because it reverses the order of the numbers in English compared to how we write it in math. So, \"22 less than x\" means I take x and subtract 22 from it. In mathematical terms, that's x - 22.\n\nNext, the problem says \"four times the quantity\" of that previous expression. So, I need to multiply that entire quantity by 4. That means I should put parentheses around x - 22 and then multiply it by 4. So, it should look like 4(x - 22).\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. 4(x \u2013 22)\n\nB. (4 \u2022 22) \u2013 x\n\nC. 4(22 \u2013 x)\n\nD. (x \u2022 4) \u2013 22\n\nOption A matches what I came up with: 4(x - 22).\n\nOption B is (4 \u2022 22) \u2013 x, which is 88 - x. That's different from what we need.\n\nOption C is 4(22 \u2013 x), which is 4 times (22 - x). This is close, but the order inside the parentheses is reversed. Instead of x - 22, it's 22 - x, which would give a different result.\n\nOption D is (x \u2022 4) \u2013 22, which is 4x - 22. That's also different from what we need.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. 4(x \u2013 22).\n\nTo make sure, let's consider an example. Suppose x = 30.\n\n\"22 less than x\" would be 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nFour times that quantity would be 4 * 8 = 32.\n\nNow, let's plug x = 30 into the expressions to see which one gives us 32.\n\nOption A: 4(30 - 22) = 4*8 = 32. Correct.\n\nOption B: (4*22) - 30 = 88 - 30 = 58. Not 32.\n\nOption C: 4(22 - 30) = 4*(-8) = -32. Not 32.\n\nOption D: (30*4) - 22 = 120 - 22 = 98. Not 32.\n\nSo, only option A gives the correct result. Therefore, the answer is A. 4(x \u2013 22).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
