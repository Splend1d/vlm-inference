The division and sharing of power between the national and state governments\n\nFederalism is a political system in which power is divided and shared between a central government and various regional governments, such as states or provinces. In the context of the United States, federalism refers to the constitutional division of powers between the federal government and the state governments. This system allows both levels of government to have their own areas of authority and responsibility, promoting a balance of power and preventing any one level from becoming too dominant.\n\nOption A, the system of checks and balances within the national government, refers to the arrangement among the three branches of the federal government\u2014the legislative, executive, and judicial branches\u2014to ensure that no single branch becomes too powerful. This system allows each branch to check the powers of the others, promoting accountability and preventing abuses of power.\n\nOption B, the power of the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of laws, is known as judicial review. This power enables the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution and determine whether laws passed by Congress or actions taken by the executive branch are constitutional. Judicial review is a crucial aspect of the system of checks and balances, as it allows the judiciary to check the powers of the legislative and executive branches.\n\nOption C, the Bill of Rights' protection of the rights of the accused, refers to the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which outline various individual liberties and protections, including those related to criminal proceedings. These protections ensure that individuals accused of crimes are treated fairly and that their rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.\n\nWhile all these options are important aspects of the American government, only option D directly refers to the concept of federalism, which is the division and sharing of power between national and state governments."
