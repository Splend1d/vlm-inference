                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, students are doing a plant pigment separation exercise using a closed chromatography chamber with a small amount of acetone at the bottom. There are some safety warnings about acetone: it's an eye and skin irritant and has flammable vapors. We need to choose the best safety precaution from the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what acetone is and why it's being used here. Acetone is a common solvent, and in chromatography, it's likely used to help separate the pigments based on their solubility in the solvent. Since it's flammable and irritant, proper safety measures are crucial.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Putting on fire-retardant gloves to carry the chamber to a fume hood if the acetone catches fire.\n\nWell, this seems like a response to a fire emergency. While it's good to be prepared for emergencies, this option doesn't cover the general safety precautions that should be taken during the exercise. Also, carrying a chamber with acetone that's on fire sounds dangerous. Maybe there are better ways to prevent fires in the first place.\n\nB. Placing the chamber in a closed, darkened cabinet for the duration of the pigment separation.\n\nHmm, a closed cabinet might limit exposure to vapors, which is good, but darkened cabinet\u2014why? Maybe to prevent light from affecting the pigments, but that's not directly related to safety concerning acetone. Also, if the cabinet is closed, vapors might accumulate, which could be hazardous if there's poor ventilation.\n\nC. Wearing leather gloves and covering the nose and mouth with a particle mask.\n\nLeather gloves might protect against some chemicals, but for acetone, which is a solvent, nitrile gloves are generally recommended because leather can absorb liquids and might not provide adequate protection against solvents. A particle mask might not be sufficient to protect against vapors; a respirator might be needed if there's significant vapor exposure.\n\nD. Wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed.\n\nThis seems comprehensive. Goggles protect the eyes from splashes or spills, nitrile gloves protect the skin from contact with acetone, and keeping containers closed minimizes vapor release, which addresses both the irritant and flammable properties of acetone.\n\nComparing all options, D seems to be the most appropriate and comprehensive safety precaution for handling acetone during this exercise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
