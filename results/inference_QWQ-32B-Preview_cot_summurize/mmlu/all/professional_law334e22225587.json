                    "text": "Let's see. I have this scenario here about a defendant who was smoking marijuana while driving and got pulled over by a police officer for speeding. The officer smelled burnt marijuana, saw a joint and an open envelope that looked like it had marijuana in it. So, the officer arrested the defendant for unlawful possession of marijuana and then searched him, finding a sealed envelope in his back pocket. The officer opened the envelope without permission and found cocaine. Then, the officer unzipped a jacket pocket and found more cocaine, leading to another arrest for possession of cocaine. Later, at the police station, the defendant waived his Miranda rights and admitted to possessing both cocaine and marijuana.\n\nNow, the question is asking for a correct statement of the applicable legal principles regarding the search of the defendant. There are four options provided:\n\nA. When a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of an individual, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the person of the individual.\n\nB. The exclusionary rule requires that if an officer conducts an unconstitutional search, the evidence acquired in the course of the officer's subsequent activities is inadmissible.\n\nC. If an individual effectively consents to a search of their person, the evidence gathered during the search is admissible.\n\nD. One who drives an automobile on a public highway does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy.\n\nI need to think about which of these statements correctly reflects the legal principles involved in this scenario.\n\nStarting with option A: It seems to be referring to the search incident to arrest doctrine. I think this is a established principle that allows officers to search a person they have lawfully arrested to ensure their own safety and to prevent the destruction of evidence. So, this seems relevant to the situation where the officer arrested the defendant and then searched him, finding the sealed envelope.\n\nOption B is about the exclusionary rule. This rule generally says that evidence obtained in violation of a person's constitutional rights is not admissible in court. So, if the officer conducted an unconstitutional search, any evidence from that search and any evidence derived from it might be excluded. This could be relevant if, for example, the search of the defendant's person or the opening of the sealed envelope was unconstitutional.\n\nOption C talks about consent. If a person consents to a search, then the search is generally considered lawful, and the evidence found can be admitted. However, in this scenario, the officer opened the sealed envelope without the defendant's permission, so consent doesn't seem to be a factor here.\n\nOption D is about the reduced expectation of privacy when driving on public highways. This is true; when you drive on public roads, you subject yourself to certain regulations and inspections, like sobriety checks and vehicle inspections. But in this case, the search was of the defendant's person, not of the vehicle per se, so while there might be some relevance, it may not directly address the search of the defendant's pockets and jacket.\n\nConsidering the sequence of events, the officer arrested the defendant for marijuana possession and then searched him, finding the sealed envelope with cocaine. The question is whether this search was lawful.\n\nUnder the search incident to arrest doctrine (option A), the officer is allowed to search the arrestee's person and the area within their immediate control at the time of arrest. This is to ensure officer safety and prevent destruction of evidence.\n\nHowever, there's a distinction between searching the person and searching containers found on the person. In this case, the sealed envelope was found in the defendant's back pocket. The question is whether the officer could open the envelope as part of the search incident to arrest.\n\nI recall that in United States v. Robinson, the Supreme Court held that a full search of the person and the effects found on them is allowed as a search incident to a lawful arrest, even if there's no concern for officer safety or destruction of evidence.\n\nBut in this case, the envelope was sealed, and the officer opened it without permission. I wonder if there's a difference between searching the person and opening sealed containers found on them.\n\nAnother case, Arizona v. Gant, limited the scope of searches incident to arrest, holding that officers may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it's reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.\n\nBut that's about vehicle searches, not personal searches.\n\nWait, perhaps Riley v. California is relevant here, which dealt with searching cell phones incident to arrest, but that might not apply to a sealed envelope.\n\nAlternatively, I think there's a principle that allows officers to search containers found on a person at the time of arrest as part of the search incident to arrest.\n\nSo, if the officer lawfully arrested the defendant for marijuana possession and then searched his person, finding the sealed envelope, it seems that the search of the envelope would be permissible under the search incident to arrest doctrine.\n\nBut the officer didn't just feel the envelope and search it; he opened it without permission. Is that allowed?\n\nI think that in some cases, officers are allowed to open containers found on a person during a search incident to arrest, but there might be limitations based on the nature of the container and the circumstances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plain feel doctrine applies, where an officer can seize and open a container if its contents are immediately apparent from the exterior.\n\nBut in this case, the envelope was sealed, so maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the officer had probable cause to believe that the envelope contained contraband based on the circumstances.\n\nGiven that the officer had already seen marijuana and smelled burnt marijuana, perhaps he had reason to believe that the envelope contained more marijuana or related contraband.\n\nIn any event, it seems that option A is the most directly applicable legal principle here, as it pertains to the search incident to arrest.\n\nOption B, the exclusionary rule, could come into play if the search was unconstitutional, but assuming the search was lawful, the evidence would be admissible.\n\nOption C, consent, isn't relevant because there was no consent given by the defendant for the search.\n\nOption D, about driving on public highways, may relate more to the initial stop and search of the vehicle, but the question is specifically about the search of the defendant.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: When a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of an individual, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the person of the individual.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider whether there are any limitations or exceptions that might make this search unconstitutional.\n\nFor example, if the search wasn't contemporaneous with the arrest, or if the officer exceeded the scope of the search incident to arrest, then the exclusionary rule would apply, and the evidence would be inadmissible.\n\nIn this case, the search occurred immediately after the arrest, so it seems contemporaneous.\n\nAlso, the sealed envelope was found on the defendant's person, so it should be within the scope of the search incident to arrest.\n\nTherefore, the search should be lawful, and the evidence admissible.\n\nThus, option A is the correct statement of the applicable legal principle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
