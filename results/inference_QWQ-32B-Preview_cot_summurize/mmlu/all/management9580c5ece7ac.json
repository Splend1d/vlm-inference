Let's see what the options are.\n\nOption A is \"Synergy planning.\" Hmm, I think synergy is when different parts come together to create something greater than the sum of their parts. Maybe planning for that, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what's happening here.\n\nOption B is \"Strategy formulation.\" That sounds familiar. Strategy is about making decisions on how to achieve long-term goals, right? So, formulating a strategy would involve analyzing the situation and planning accordingly. This might be the one.\n\nOption C is \"Functional planning.\" I think functional planning is more about planning within specific departments or functions in an organization, like marketing planning or financial planning. It seems more narrow than what the question is asking.\n\nOption D is \"SWOT analysis.\" SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. It's a tool used to evaluate these aspects of an organization. While it's part of the process of understanding the current situation, it's just one tool, not the overall action of analyzing and planning.\n\nSo, looking back, the question is about the overall action that includes analyzing the current situation and developing plans to achieve the mission and goals. Strategy formulation sounds like the broad term that encompasses all of that.\n\nLet me double-check. Synergy planning might be a part of strategy, but it's not the overall process. Functional planning is more specific to certain functions. SWOT analysis is a tool used in the analysis phase, but not the entire process of strategy development.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. Strategy formulation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
