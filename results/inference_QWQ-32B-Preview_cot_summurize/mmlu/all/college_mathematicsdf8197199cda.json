In vector spaces, the norm is defined to be non-negative, meaning |x| \u2265 0 for all x \u2208 R^k, and |x| = 0 only if x is the zero vector. So, this statement is always true.\n\nOption B: |x \u00b7 y| \u2264 |x||y|\n\nThis is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that the absolute value of the dot product of two vectors is less than or equal to the product of their magnitudes. This inequality holds for all vectors x, y \u2208 R^k, so this statement is always true.\n\nOption C: |x| = 0 if and only if x = 0\n\nThis statement says that the norm of a vector is zero if and only if the vector itself is the zero vector. This is a fundamental property of norms, and it holds for all vectors in R^k. Therefore, this statement is always true.\n\nOption D: |x + y| = |x| + |y|\n\nThis statement claims that the norm of the sum of two vectors is equal to the sum of their norms. However, this is not generally true for vectors in R^k. The norm of the sum of two vectors is equal to the sum of their norms only if the vectors are positive scalar multiples of each other (i.e., they are in the same direction).\n\nIn general, the norm satisfies the triangle inequality: |x + y| \u2264 |x| + |y|, but equality holds only under specific conditions, not always.\n\nTherefore, option D is not always true for vectors x, y, z \u2208 R^k.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
