                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about which culture, previously known as the temple-mound builders, based their subsistence primarily on maize and squash agriculture. The options are Ancestral Puebloan, Hohokam, Mississippian, and Adena.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"temple-mound builders\" refers to. I think this is talking about cultures that built mound structures, which often had religious or ceremonial purposes, hence the term \"temple-mounds.\"\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Ancestral Puebloan: I know that the Ancestral Puebloans are associated with the Four Corners area of the Southwest United States. They are famous for their cliff dwellings and multi-story buildings. They did practice agriculture, primarily growing corn, beans, and squash, known as the Three Sisters. But were they known for temple-mounds?\n\nB. Hohokam: The Hohokam culture was also in the Southwest, particularly in Arizona. They are known for their extensive irrigation systems and also grew corn, beans, and squash. I don't recall them being particularly known for temple-mounds.\n\nC. Mississippian: The Mississippian culture was in the Southeast, covering a large area including the Mississippi River valley. They are well-known for their large earthen mounds, many of which had temples or elite residences on top. They also practiced maize agriculture.\n\nD. Adena: The Adena culture was an early Native American culture in the Eastern Woodlands, primarily in the Ohio Valley. They are known for their burial mounds and hilltop enclosures. They practiced some agriculture but were more mobile than some of the other cultures.\n\nGiven this, the Mississippian culture seems to fit the description of temple-mound builders who based their subsistence on maize and squash agriculture.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\n- Ancestral Puebloans did build some mounds, but they are more famous for their pueblos and cliff dwellings.\n\n- Hohokam built platform mounds, but I'm not sure if they are referred to as temple-mound builders.\n\n- Mississippian culture is renowned for their large ceremonial mounds.\n\n- Adena built mounds, but they predate the Mississippian culture and had a different lifestyle.\n\nAlso, regarding agriculture:\n\n- All these cultures practiced agriculture to some extent, but the Mississippian culture was heavily dependent on maize agriculture.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. Mississippian.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
