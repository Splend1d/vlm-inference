                    "text": "So I've got this question about two identical capacitors connected in parallel to an external circuit. I need to figure out which quantities must be the same for both capacitors from the options given: charge stored, voltage across, and capacitance. The options are A. I only, B. II only, C. II and III only, D. I, II, and III.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how capacitors behave when they're connected in parallel. In a parallel configuration, each capacitor is connected directly to the same two points of the circuit, meaning both capacitors experience the same voltage across them. That makes sense because, in parallel, the voltage across each component is the same.\n\nSo, for option II, the voltage across the capacitor, that should be the same for both capacitors. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the capacitors are identical, which means they have the same capacitance. Capacitance is a property of the capacitor itself, so if they're identical, their capacitances are equal. So, option III, the capacitance of the capacitor, must also be the same for both.\n\nNow, for option I, the charge stored on the capacitor. The charge stored on a capacitor is given by Q = C * V, where C is the capacitance and V is the voltage across the capacitor. Since both capacitors have the same capacitance (because they're identical) and the same voltage across them (because they're in parallel), it follows that the charge stored on each capacitor should be the same.\n\nWait a minute, but in a parallel circuit, the total charge is the sum of the charges on each capacitor. So, if each capacitor has the same charge, then the total charge is twice that of one capacitor. But is it correct to say that each capacitor has the same charge?\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the voltage across both capacitors is the same, and their capacitances are the same, then Q = C * V would indeed be the same for both. So, yes, the charge stored on each capacitor should be the same.\n\nBut I remember that in parallel, the total capacitance is the sum of individual capacitances. So, if each capacitor has capacitance C, then the total capacitance is 2C. If the total voltage is V, then the total charge is Q_total = 2C * V. Since each capacitor has charge Q = C * V, then indeed, both capacitors have the same charge.\n\nWait, but in reality, in a parallel circuit, each capacitor can hold a different charge, right? But in this case, since they're identical and have the same voltage, their charges should be equal.\n\nLet me check if there's any exception or special case where the charges might differ even if the capacitors are identical and in parallel. I think not; in parallel, same voltage, same capacitance, so same charge.\n\nTherefore, all three quantities should be the same for both capacitors: charge stored, voltage across, and capacitance.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where two identical capacitors in parallel would have different charges? I can't think of one. If they're identical and in parallel, they should have the same voltage and capacitance, hence the same charge.\n\nAlright, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
