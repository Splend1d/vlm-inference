The owner of a summer cottage in the area hired the company to provide 24- hour protection during the winter months when his home was unoccupied. According to the security arrangement, the company's uniformed guards would periodically patrol the property and, if necessary, provide an \"armed response\" to any unauthorized individuals who were found trespassing on the property. The company provided security protection to the owner's property for two years. The owner then notified the company that he was planning to sell the cottage. As a result, he requested that the company discontinue its home-protection service, effective immediately. Two weeks later, a burglar broke into the cottage and was ransacking it. As the burglar was exiting from the owner's house carrying a portable television set, he was seen by a security guard working for the company. The security guard, who was driving past the home on security patrol, had not been informed that the owner had discontinued protection services. The security guard suddenly stopped his patrol vehicle and ran toward the burglar shouting, \"Stop! Don't move or I'll shoot!\" Startled, the burglar dropped the television set and began to flee.

So, there's a home security company that provides protection services in an area, and a cottage owner hired them to protect his property during the winter when it's unoccupied. The arrangement includes periodic patrols and an \"armed response\" if there are any unauthorized individuals on the property. The company provided services for two years, and then the owner decided to sell the cottage and notified the company to discontinue the protection services immediately.\n\nA couple of weeks later, a burglar broke into the cottage and was caught by a security guard who was on patrol. The guard hadn't been informed that the owner had discontinued the services, so he responded as usual, shouting at the burglar and eventually shooting him in the leg.\n\nNow, the burglar is asserting a claim against the owner for negligently failing to supervise those providing security services for the owner's property. The question is asking which option is most likely to be correct.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Prevail, because the burglar was unarmed when he was shot.\n\nThis seems to be about the use of force by the security guard. However, the question is about the owner's negligence in supervising the security services, not directly about the guard's actions. So, while it's relevant that the burglar was unarmed, it might not be the primary issue here.\n\nB. Prevail, because the owner knew or had reason to know that the company provided an \"armed response\" to suspected trespassers.\n\nThis option suggests that the owner is liable because he was aware of the type of response the security company provided. If the owner knew about the armed response and didn't take steps to ensure that the services were properly discontinued, that could be seen as negligence.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the owner was not present when the shooting occurred.\n\nJust because the owner wasn't present doesn't necessarily mean he's not liable for the actions of the security company he hired. In fact, employers can be liable for the actions of their employees under certain circumstances, even if they weren't present.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the owner had discontinued protection services from the company when the shooting occurred.\n\nThis seems like a strong argument. If the owner had already discontinued the services, then he might not be responsible for the actions of the security company after that point.\n\nBut wait, the owner notified the company to discontinue services immediately, but the shooting happened two weeks later. Did the company immediately stop all patrols, or was there a lag in communication?\n\nProbably, the company might have continued some patrols without updating their schedules immediately. So, it's possible that the guard was still patrolling under the old agreement.\n\nHowever, the owner thought he had discontinued the services, but if the company didn't communicate that to their guards, that might not relieve the owner of liability.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's think about negligence in this context.\n\nFor the burglar to succeed in a negligence claim against the owner, he would need to show that the owner had a duty to supervise the security services, that the owner breached that duty, and that the breach caused harm to the burglar.\n\nFirst, did the owner have a duty to supervise the security services?\n\nWell, when you hire a company to provide services, you generally rely on them to carry out those services properly. However, once you've discontinued the services, your duty might end.\n\nBut in this case, the discontinuation was recent, and there might have been a communication gap.\n\nSecond, did the owner breach that duty?\n\nIf the owner had a reasonable belief that the services had been discontinued, and he had notified the company accordingly, then perhaps he didn't breach his duty.\n\nHowever, if there was some fault on the owner's part in assuming that the discontinuation was effective immediately, and if he had reason to know that there might be a delay in implementing the discontinuation, then maybe he did breach his duty.\n\nThird, did the breach cause harm to the burglar?\n\nThe harm occurred because the guard acted under the impression that he was still providing services, even though the owner had discontinued them.\n\nBut was the owner's action or inaction the cause of the harm?\n\nThis is a bit tricky. The direct cause of the harm was the guard's decision to shoot the burglar. The owner's discontinuation of services, coupled with inadequate communication, might have contributed to the situation, but it's a stretch to say that the owner's action directly caused the shooting.\n\nAlternatively, if the owner had a ongoing relationship with the security company and should have foreseen that there might be lingering effects after discontinuation, then perhaps there is some liability.\n\nBut overall, it seems that the owner had notified the company to discontinue services, and it was the company's responsibility to inform their guards accordingly.\n\nTherefore, it's probably unfair to hold the owner liable for the guard's actions after the services had been discontinued.\n\nSo, option D seems most appropriate: not prevail, because the owner had discontinued protection services from the company when the shooting occurred.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A: Prevail, because the burglar was unarmed when he was shot.\n\nThis seems more related to the guard's use of force, not directly to the owner's negligence.\n\nOption B: Prevail, because the owner knew or had reason to know that the company provided an \"armed response\" to suspected trespassers.\n\nWhile the owner was aware of the armed response, he had discontinued the services, so perhaps this knowledge doesn't impose a continuing duty on him.\n\nOption C: Not prevail, because the owner was not present when the shooting occurred.\n\nAgain, presence isn't necessarily relevant to liability.\n\nOption D: Not prevail, because the owner had discontinued protection services from the company when the shooting occurred.\n\nThis seems most accurate, as the owner had discontinued services, and it was the company's responsibility to manage their operations accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the burglar will probably not prevail because the owner had discontinued protection services from the company when the shooting occurred.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) not prevail, because the owner had discontinued protection services from the company when the shooting occurred."
