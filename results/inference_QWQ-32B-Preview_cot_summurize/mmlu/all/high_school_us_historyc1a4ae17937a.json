                    "text": "Let's see. This passage is from the Married Women's Property Act of New York State in 1848. It's talking about the rights of married women to own and control their property, both real and personal, and that this property shouldn't be subject to their husband's sole disposal or liable for his debts. So, it's clearly about the legal rights and status of women, especially in the context of marriage.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Debates about access to voting rights.\n\nWell, voting rights are important, and there have been long debates about who can vote in U.S. history, including women's suffrage. But this act is specifically about property rights of married women, not about voting. So, while related to women's rights in general, it's not directly about voting rights.\n\nB. Debates about the role of federal government in marriage law.\n\nMarriage laws have been mostly under the jurisdiction of the states in U.S. history, with some federal involvement over time, especially regarding issues like same-sex marriage. But this act is a state law from New York, and it's about the property rights of married women. It doesn't seem to be directly about the role of the federal government in marriage law. It's more about the rights within marriage.\n\nC. Debates about discrimination in employment.\n\nDiscrimination in employment is another important area where there have been\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u6539\u9769\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6cd5\u6848\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u5df2\u5a5a\u5987\u5973\u7684\u8d22\u4ea7\u6743\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u5979\u4eec\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u7684\u6743\u5229\u6216\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u90fd\u662f\u5987\u5973\u6743\u5229\u7684\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u592a\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u3002\n\nD.
