                    "text": "Let's tackle this multiple-choice question about adolescence. I need to pick the statement that is correct. Here are the options again:\n\nA. Brain growth is faster than at any other stage in life.\n\nB. Peak bone mass occurs before the growth spurt ends.\n\nC. Girls physiologically increase their percentage body fat.\n\nD. Type 2 obesity-related diabetes remains a very rare problem.\n\nOkay, first, I need to recall what happens during adolescence. Adolescence is the period between childhood and adulthood, typically associated with puberty and significant physical and psychological changes.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Brain growth is faster than at any other stage in life.\" Hmm, I think brain development continues into adolescence, but is it the fastest stage? I remember that the brain undergoes significant reorganization during adolescence, but I'm not sure if growth is the fastest then. Maybe I should look into that.\n\nOption B: \"Peak bone mass occurs before the growth spurt ends.\" I know that during adolescence, there's a growth spurt where kids grow quickly, and bone mass increases. But does peak bone mass occur before the growth spurt ends? I think bone mass continues to increase during the growth spurt.\n\nOption C: \"Girls physiologically increase their percentage body fat.\" I believe that during adolescence, girls do tend to have an increase in body fat percentage compared to boys, as part of sexual dimorphism. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D: \"Type 2 obesity-related diabetes remains a very rare problem.\" With the rising rates of childhood obesity, I'm not sure if this is still the case. I think type 2 diabetes was once considered rare in adolescents, but nowadays, it's becoming more common.\n\nAlright, let's evaluate each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: Brain growth. I recall that the brain goes through significant development during adolescence, including pruning of neural connections and myelination, which enhances brain function. However, the period of most rapid brain growth is actually in infancy and early childhood. During adolescence, brain development is more about refinement and specialization rather than rapid growth. So, I think statement A is incorrect.\n\nMoving on to option B: Peak bone mass occurring before the growth spurt ends. I need to think about bone development during adolescence. Adolescence is a critical period for bone growth, and peak bone mass is achieved as growth velocity slows down and approaches its adult value. So, peak bone mass is typically reached near the end of the growth spurt, not before. Therefore, statement B seems incorrect.\n\nOption C: Girls increasing their percentage body fat. During adolescence, there are sexual dimorphisms in body composition, and girls do tend to have a higher percentage of body fat than boys, partly due to hormonal differences and the need for pregnancy preparation. So, this statement seems accurate.\n\nFinally, option D: Type 2 obesity-related diabetes being very rare. Historically, type 2 diabetes was indeed rare in adolescents, but with the increase in childhood obesity, it has become more common. So, I think this statement is no longer accurate.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it seems that option C is the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
