                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. So, there's a woman who needs her microwave repaired. She contacts a local handyman, who offers to fix it for $100, and she agrees. She gives the microwave to the handyman, who promises to have it ready in two weeks.\n\nBut then, after one week, the handyman realizes he has too much work and can't fix it on time. So, he takes the microwave to a repair store, which agrees to fix it for $80 within one week. Importantly, the owner of the repair store doesn't know that the woman actually owns the microwave.\n\nNow, the question is, if the repair store fails to repair the microwave, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.\n\nB. The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.\n\nC. The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.\n\nD. The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"cause of action\" means. It basically means that the woman can legally sue someone for not fulfilling their obligations.\n\nSo, who did the woman have a contract with? She had a contract with the handyman to repair the microwave for $100, with a promise to have it ready in two weeks.\n\nThe handyman, without the woman's knowledge, subcontracted the work to a repair store for $80.\n\nNow, the repair store doesn't know that the woman owns the microwave. So, the repair store has a contract with the handyman, not with the woman.\n\nIf the repair store fails to repair the microwave, who is the woman entitled to hold responsible?\n\nWell, the woman had a contract with the handyman, not with the repair store. So, even though the handyman subcontracted the work, the woman only dealt with the handyman.\n\nIn contract law, generally, you can only sue the party you have a contract with, not third parties.\n\nSo, if the repair store fails to repair the microwave, the handyman is still responsible to the woman, because she contracted with him.\n\nTherefore, the woman should have a cause of action against the handyman.\n\nBut what about the repair store? Since the woman doesn't have a contract with them, she can't sue them directly.\n\nHowever, there might be some exceptions or additional considerations.\n\nLet me think about agency principles. If the handyman was acting as an agent for the woman when he subcontracted the work to the repair store, then maybe the woman could have some recourse against the repair store.\n\nBut in this case, it doesn't seem like the handyman was acting as the woman's agent. The handyman contracted with the repair store on his own behalf, without informing the repair store about the woman's ownership.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's some doctrine of assignment or delegation that applies here.\n\nDelegation occurs when one party to a contract assigns their duty to perform to a third party. In such cases, the original party remains liable if the third party fails to perform.\n\nIn this scenario, the handyman delegated the repair work to the repair store.\n\nSo, even if the handyman delegated the work to the repair store, he remains liable to the woman if the repair store doesn't perform.\n\nTherefore, the woman should have a cause of action against the handyman, but not directly against the repair store.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider option C: the woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.\n\nAs I thought earlier, she only has a contract with the handyman, so she should only be able to sue the handyman.\n\nOption A says she has a cause of action against the repair store only, but that doesn't make sense because she doesn't have a contract with them.\n\nOption D says she has no cause of action against either, but that can't be right because she has a contract with the handyman.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider if the handyman's action of subcontracting the work without the woman's knowledge affects his liability.\n\nGenerally, in contract law, delegation is permitted unless the contract specifically prohibits it or the task requires personal skills that can't be delegated.\n\nIn this case, repairing a microwave seems like a task that could be delegated.\n\nSo, even if the handyman delegated the work to the repair store, he's still responsible to the woman if the repair isn't done properly.\n\nTherefore, the woman can sue the handyman for breach of contract if the repair isn't done as promised.\n\nAs for the repair store, since they have a contract with the handyman, the handyman could sue the repair store for not performing their part.\n\nBut the woman doesn't have a direct relationship with the repair store, so she can't sue them directly.\n\nUnless there's some other legal theory that applies, like negligent repair or something, but that would be a tort claim, not based on contract.\n\nBut the question seems to be focusing on contract rights.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.\n\nSo, option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
