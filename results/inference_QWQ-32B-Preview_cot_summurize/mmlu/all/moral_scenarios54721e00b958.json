                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I trashed my lunch wrappings and was cited for littering.\n\nScenario 2: As my roommate slept, I cleared his essay.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if it's morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I trashed my lunch wrappings and was cited for littering.\n\nHmm, trashing lunch wrappings sounds like disposing of them properly, right? But it says \"was cited for littering.\" So maybe I didn't trash them properly and instead littered them somewhere.\n\nIf I littered, that means I disposed of the wrappings in a place other than a trash bin, maybe on the ground or somewhere they don't belong. Littering is generally considered wrong because it harms the environment, attracts pests, and makes public spaces look ugly. It's also often against the law.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, littering is wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: As my roommate slept, I cleared his essay.\n\nThis one is a bit more confusing. \"Cleared his essay\" could mean different things. Maybe I cleaned up his mess, like\u6574\u7406\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u6587\u4ef6, or perhaps I deleted his essay, or moved it somewhere else.\n\nIf \"cleared\" means I cleaned up his mess, like throwing away empty cups or straightening up his desk where he keeps his essay, that might not be wrong. In fact, it could be helpful.\n\nBut if \"cleared\" means I deleted his essay or got rid of it in a way that he can't recover it, that would be problematic. Essays are important, and deleting someone's work without their permission could cause them a lot of stress and harm their academic career.\n\nSo, if \"cleared\" means deleting or getting rid of the essay in a permanent way, that would be morally wrong because it's interfering with someone's property and work without their consent.\n\nHowever, if \"cleared\" means cleaning up the area around the essay, but the essay itself is still intact and accessible to the roommate, then it might not be wrong.\n\nBut the scenario says \"I cleared his essay,\" which sounds like I took action directly on his essay, perhaps removing it or getting rid of it.\n\nGiven that, it's likely that I did something that affected the essay itself, maybe by deleting it or throwing it away.\n\nSo, if I deleted or threw away my roommate's essay without his permission, that would be wrong because it's interfering with his property and potentially causing him harm.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, the second scenario might not necessarily be wrong if \"cleared\" means cleaning up around the essay without affecting it.\n\nBut the way it's phrased, \"cleared his essay,\" suggests that I did something more than just cleaning up the area.\n\nMaybe I organized his essays or put them in a folder, which could be considered helpful and not wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if I cleared his essay by deleting it or getting rid of it, that would be wrong.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to consider the ordinary understanding of \"cleared his essay.\"\n\nIf \"cleared\" means removed or deleted, then it's wrong.\n\nIf it means cleaned up around it, then it's not necessarily wrong.\n\nBut since the scenario says \"cleared his essay,\" it's probably referring to removing or deleting it.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve wrong actions.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
