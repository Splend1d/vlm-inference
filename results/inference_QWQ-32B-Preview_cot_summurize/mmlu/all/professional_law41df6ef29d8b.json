                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal scenario. We've got a truck driver who's been drinking and ends up hitting a young girl while driving a tractor-trailer loaded with logs. The girl's parents are suing the lumber company for their daughter's injuries. Now, we need to figure out which piece of evidence is least likely to be admissible in court.\n\nFirst, let's understand the context. The truck driver was assigned to drive the tractor-trailer by the lumber company, which also loaded the vehicle with logs. After stopping at a lounge and consuming five bottles of beer, the driver continued his journey and ended up hitting the girl. At trial, the girl's parents are seeking damages for her injuries.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n**Option A:** Evidence that the truck driver's reputation for driving is poor, if the lumber company and truck driver argue that the latter was not negligent.\n\nIn legal terms, character evidence is generally not admissible to prove that someone acted in accordance with their character on a specific occasion. However, there are exceptions, especially in negligence cases. If the defendant is arguing that the truck driver was not negligent, evidence of his poor driving reputation might be admissible to suggest that he was more likely to act negligently. So, this evidence could be admissible under certain circumstances.\n\n**Option B:** Evidence that the truck driver pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of DUI arising from this incident.\n\nThis is a straightforward one. Evidence of a guilty plea for a DUI related to the same incident is highly relevant. It directly implicates the truck driver's state at the time of the accident and suggests negligence or recklessness. This evidence is very likely to be admissible.\n\n**Option C:** Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if an investigator for the lumber company's insurance company testified for the lumber company that they deny ownership of the truck.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky. First, evidence of insurance is generally inadmissible to show that the defendant was negligent or liable. The reasoning is to prevent parties from being unduly influenced by the presence of insurance. However, there are exceptions. If the insurance is relevant to show control or ownership, it might be admissible. In this case, the investigator is testifying that the lumber company denies ownership of the truck. So, the insurance evidence might be used to show that the lumber company had an insurable interest in the truck, which could suggest ownership or control. Therefore, this evidence might be admissible for that purpose, but not to suggest negligence.\n\n**Option D:** Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if the lumber company argues that the truck driver was an independent contractor.\n\nAgain, evidence of insurance is generally inadmissible to prove negligence or liability. However, if the lumber company is arguing that the truck driver was an independent contractor, the fact that they carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer might be relevant to show the extent of their control or responsibility over the truck and the driver. In some jurisdictions, insurance evidence might be admissible to show the relationship between the parties. So, it could be admissible for that limited purpose.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the option that is LEAST likely to be admissible.\n\nComparing the options:\n\n- Option A: Evidence of the truck driver's poor driving reputation could be admissible to show negligence.\n\n- Option B: Evidence of a DUI plea is highly relevant and admissible.\n\n- Option C: Insurance evidence might be admissible to show ownership or control, especially since the investigator is testifying about ownership.\n\n- Option D: Insurance evidence might be admissible to show the relationship between the lumber company and the truck driver.\n\nGiven that, Option C seems to be the least likely to be admissible because the investigator is testifying that the lumber company denies ownership, and introducing evidence of insurance to contradict that might be seen as impermissibly trying to show that insurance implies ownership, which could be seen as a stretch. Additionally, courts are cautious about allowing insurance evidence to imply liability.\n\nHowever, it's a close call between Options C and D. Option D seems more directly related to the issue of control or relationship, making it more likely to be admissible.\n\nWait a minute. Let's think differently. Maybe the least likely to be admissible is Option A, because character evidence is generally not admissible to prove conduct on a specific occasion. But in negligence cases, it might be allowed under certain exceptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Option B is too directly relevant to be considered least likely to be admissible.\n\nWait, the question is about evidence least likely to be admissible in the claim against the lumber company. So, we need to consider admissibility in that context.\n\nOption A: The truck driver's reputation for driving poor might be admissible to show negligence, but it's more about the driver than the lumber company.\n\nOption B: The DUI plea is directly relevant to the driver's negligence, which could implicate the lumber company if they are liable for the driver's actions.\n\nOption C: Insurance evidence, generally inadmissible to show liability, but possibly admissible to show ownership or control.\n\nOption D: Similar to Option C, but here the lumber company is arguing that the driver was an independent contractor, so insurance evidence might be used to suggest that they still had control or liability.\n\nPerhaps the least likely to be admissible is Option C because it involves an investigator testifying about ownership, and introducing insurance evidence in that context might be seen as more prejudicial than probative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Option D is the least likely because if the lumber company is arguing that the driver was an independent contractor, evidence of insurance might still be seen as irrelevant to that issue.\n\nWait, no. If the lumber company is arguing that the driver was an independent contractor, evidence that they carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer could suggest that they still had some control or liability, making the insurance evidence relevant to rebut that argument.\n\nTherefore, Option D might actually be admissible for that purpose.\n\nGiven that, Option C seems like it would be more tenuously admissible, especially since the investigator is testifying about ownership denial.\n\nSo, I think Option C is the least likely to be admissible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
