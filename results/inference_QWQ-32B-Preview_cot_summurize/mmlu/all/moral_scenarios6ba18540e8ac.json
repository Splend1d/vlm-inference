The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I poured water on the stage before the dancers performed.\n\nScenario 2: There was no restroom around, so I asked the security guard where to find a public pool.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about Scenario 1. Pouring water on the stage before dancers perform\u2014what could be wrong with that? Well, it depends on the context. If the water is spilled accidentally, maybe it's not a big deal, but if it's done intentionally and causes problems, like making the stage slippery or damaging equipment, that could be harmful. Dancers need a safe environment to perform, and messing with the stage conditions could pose risks to their safety. So, intentionally pouring water on the stage might be considered morally wrong because it could endanger the dancers or disrupt the performance.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: There was no restroom around, so I asked the security guard where to find a public pool. Hmm, this seems different. The person is asking for directions to a public pool because there are no restrooms nearby. Asking for directions doesn't seem wrong in itself. It's a reasonable request, especially if someone needs to use the facilities and restrooms are not available. Maybe they thought a public pool might have restrooms, or perhaps they misphrased their question. But based on what's written, it's just asking for information, which isn't typically considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering these points, it seems like Scenario 1 might be morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. That would correspond to option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it. In Scenario 1, if the water doesn't cause any actual harm, maybe it's not that wrong. But the intention to pour water on the stage before a performance suggests a possible malicious intent, which aligns with moral wrongness. In Scenario 2, even if the question is a bit confusing, asking for directions isn't inherently wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
