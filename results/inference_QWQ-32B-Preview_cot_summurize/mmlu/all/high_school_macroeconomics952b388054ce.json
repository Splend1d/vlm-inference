                    "text": "So I've got this question here about unemployment, and it's asking which of the three persons listed is considered unemployed. The options are:\n\nI. Mary, who has quit her job to look for another.\n\nII. John, who retired from work at age 45 after fulfilling his dream.\n\nIII. Diane, who works part-time but would like to work full-time.\n\nAnd then there are choices A through D to select which one or more of these are considered unemployed.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of unemployment. Unemployment typically refers to people who are without work, available for work, and actively seeking employment. So, it's not just about not having a job, but also about being in the labor force and looking for work.\n\nLet's look at each case:\n\nI. Mary quit her job to look for another. So, she's actively seeking employment. According to the definition, she should be considered unemployed because she's without work but looking for it.\n\nII. John retired at age 45. Retirement generally means leaving the labor force, often because of age or personal choice. Retirees are not considered part of the labor force and therefore are not counted as unemployed. They're outside the labor force altogether.\n\nIII. Diane works part-time but wants to work full-time. This sounds like she's underemployed. Unemployment statistics sometimes include underemployment, but technically, since she has a job, even if it's part-time, she's employed, just not in the way she'd prefer.\n\nSo, based on this, Mary (I) is unemployed because she's actively looking for work, John (II) is retired and not in the labor force, and Diane (III) is employed, just part-time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. I only.\n\nBut wait, I remember that sometimes underemployment is considered part of unemployment. Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nLet me think about it. Underemployment includes people who are working part-time but would prefer full-time work, or people working in jobs that don't fully utilize their skills. Some economic metrics include underemployment in broader measures of labor market slack.\n\nHowever, the standard unemployment rate, often denoted as U-3, only includes people who are jobless and actively seeking work. There's a broader measure, U-6, which includes part-time workers who want full-time work and some other categories.\n\nGiven that the question is probably referring to the standard unemployment definition, it's likely that only Mary qualifies as unemployed.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if Diane falls into the category of unemployed.\n\nDiane is working part-time but wants full-time work. According to the standard definition, she's employed, just part-time. But in some economic analyses, she might be considered underemployed or marginally attached to the labor force.\n\nHowever, in the context of this question, which seems to be testing basic understanding of unemployment, it's probably safest to consider that only Mary is unemployed, as she's the one who is actively looking for work but doesn't have a job.\n\nJohn is retired and not seeking work, so he's out of the labor force. Diane has a job, even if it's not the one she prefers, so she's employed.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. I only.\n\nBut to make sure, let's look at the options again:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and III\n\nGiven our analysis, A seems correct. But perhaps the question is considering Diane as unemployed because she's not fully employed. That would be stretching the definition, though.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a broader definition of unemployment that includes underemployment. If that's the case, then both Mary and Diane could be considered unemployed, leading to choice D.\n\nHowever, without specifying that it's using a broader definition, I think it's safer to go with the standard definition.\n\nAdditionally, the question asks which person is \"considered\" unemployed, implying that it's referring to the conventional definition used by labor statistics.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with A. I only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
