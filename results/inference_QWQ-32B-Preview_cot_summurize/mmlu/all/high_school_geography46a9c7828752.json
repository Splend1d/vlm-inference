The options are: independent territory, internationally recognized, boundaries, and a national language. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I know that a state typically has an independent territory, meaning it has land that it controls without being subject to another country's rule. That sounds like a fundamental part of being a state.\n\nNext, internationally recognized means that other countries acknowledge its existence and status as a state. I think that's also important for a state to be considered legitimate in the international community.\n\nBoundaries are probably necessary too, to define where the state's territory begins and ends. Without boundaries, it would be unclear what area the state has authority over.\n\nNow, a national language: is that essential for a state? I'm not so sure about that. I know there are many countries that have multiple official languages or don't specify a single national language. For example, Canada has two official languages, English and French, and the United States doesn't have an official national language, although English is widely spoken.\n\nMaybe a national language isn't a required characteristic for a state. I recall that the Montevideo Convention, which defines the criteria for statehood, includes a permanent population, defined territory, government, and capacity to enter into relations with other states. It doesn't mention anything about a national language.\n\nLet me double-check. The four criteria from the Montevideo Convention are:\n\n1. A permanent population\n\n2. A defined territory\n\n3. A government\n\n4. Capacity to enter into relations with other states\n\nNone of these mention a national language. So, perhaps a national language is not a necessary characteristic for a state.\n\nBut, on the other hand, having a common language can be useful for governance and national unity. However, it's not necessarily required for statehood.\n\nI think the answer is D, a national language, because it's not a mandatory characteristic for a state, unlike the others.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
