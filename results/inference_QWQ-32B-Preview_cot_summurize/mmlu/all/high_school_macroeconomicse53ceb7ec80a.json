Aggregate demand is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time. It's made up of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.\n\nOption A is higher levels of imported goods. Imports are part of net exports, which is exports minus imports. So, if imports go up, net exports go down, which would decrease aggregate demand. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B is lower levels of consumer wealth. If people have less wealth, they probably won't spend as much, which would decrease consumption and therefore decrease aggregate demand.\n\nOption C is a higher real interest rate. When interest rates are higher, borrowing costs more, so people might spend less and save more. This would likely decrease investment and consumption, leading to lower aggregate demand.\n\nOption D is lower taxes on personal income. If taxes are lower, people have more disposable income, which means they can spend more. This would increase consumption and therefore increase aggregate demand.\n\nSo, based on this, it looks like option D would increase aggregate demand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
