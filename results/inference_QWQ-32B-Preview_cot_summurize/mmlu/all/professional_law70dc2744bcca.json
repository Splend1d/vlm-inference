The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the retiree and begins formulating plans for constructing single- family dwelling units. The original deed between the retiree and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called tract I. Two years later, the president sold the remaining 250-acre parcel, which had not been included in the tract 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single- family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as tract 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in tract 2. In a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots by any of the present owners of lots in the tract 1 development, the most probable judicial determination would be\n\nA. that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.\nB. that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.\nC. that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.\nD. that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this real estate conundrum. So, we've got a retiree who's selling off parts of his 1,000-acre farm in 250-acre parcels. The president of a development company buys three of these four parcels, with a deed that includes a restriction saying any further subdivisions must be into minimum two-acre lots for single-family homes, and this binds all future grantees, their heirs, and assigns.\n\nFirst off, the president subdivides two of the parcels into three, four, and five-acre lots and starts building homes, all in line with the deed restrictions since these are larger than two acres. These subdivisions are part of what's called Tract I, and the deed restrictions are passed on to the homebuyers there.\n\nThen, two years later, the president sells the remaining 250-acre parcel to a contractor. This deed also includes the same two-acre minimum restriction. But here's where things get interesting: the contractor subdivides this last parcel into one-acre lots and starts building single-family homes on them, which violates the two-acre minimum specified in the deed restriction.\n\nNow, the owners of lots in Tract I want to sue to stop the contractor from subdividing the last parcel into these one-acre lots, arguing that it breaches the original deed restrictions. The question is, what's the most likely outcome in court?\n\nOption A says the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue. Standing is about whether the plaintiffs have a legitimate interest in the case. In real estate, people who are affected by deed restrictions often have standing to enforce them. Since the Tract I owners are bound by these restrictions and might be affected by the contractor's actions (perhaps through decreased property values or changes in the character of the neighborhood), they likely have standing. So, option A might not be the best choice.\n\nOption B suggests dismissing the action because there's no privity of estate between the Tract I owners and the contractor. Privity of estate generally means that there's a direct relationship through a property interest. Since the Tract I owners bought from the president, who got the property from the retiree, and the contractor bought directly from the president, there might be a chain of title that connects them. Deed restrictions that run with the land can bind parties who aren't in direct privity, especially if they're intended to benefit and burden successive owners. So, option B might not hold water.\n\nOption C says the action would be successful if Tract 2 is considered part of a common development scheme. This is an interesting point. If Tract 2 is seen as part of the same overall development plan as Tract I, the court might enforce the restrictions across both tracts, even if the contractor didn't include the restrictions in the deeds for Tract 2. However, the contractor didn't mention the restrictions in Tract 2 deeds, which could complicate things.\n\nOption D states that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed are enforceable. This seems promising. Deed restrictions, especially those that run with the land and bind future grantees, are generally enforceable by and against subsequent owners. The fact that the restriction was included in the deed to the president and then to the contractor suggests that it should bind the contractor as well.\n\nBut let's dig deeper. For a restrictive covenant to run with the land, certain legal requirements must be met:\n\n1. **Intention:** The original parties must have intended for the restriction to run with the land.\n\n2. **Notice:** Subsequent grantees must have notice of the restriction, either actual or constructive.\n\n3. **Privity:** There must be a privity of estate between the original parties and the subsequent grantees.\n\nIn this case, the deed explicitly states that the restriction binds \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" which strongly indicates intent for the restriction to run with the land.\n\nAs for notice, the president had notice since it was in the deed from the retiree, and the contractor had notice from the president's deed. Even though the contractor didn't include the restriction in the deeds for Tract 2, the contractors may still be bound by it, especially if the restriction is recorded and readily available through public records.\n\nPrivity is a bit trickier, but given the chain of title, it's plausible that the court would find privity sufficient for the restriction to run.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the president already subdivided two parcels into larger lots suggests that the restriction has been acknowledged and followed to some extent.\n\nNow, considering that the contractor is subdividing the last parcel into one-acre lots, which violates the two-acre minimum, the Tract I owners might have a strong case to enforce the restriction.\n\nHowever, there's a potential complication: if the contractor can argue that the last parcel was sold separately and that the restriction doesn't apply to it, or that the president didn't enforce the restriction uniformly, which might weaken the restriction's enforceability.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems that the restriction should apply to all parcels acquired by the president and then passed on to subsequent grantees, including the contractor.\n\nTherefore, the most probable judicial determination would be that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider why the other options might not be as strong.\n\nOption A, about lack of standing, doesn't hold because the Tract I owners are directly affected by the restriction and have a\u5229\u76ca in enforcing it.\n\nOption B, about no privity of estate, might not be applicable because the restriction is intended to run with the land and bind subsequent grantees.\n\nOption C introduces the concept of a common development scheme, which might be relevant, but it's not as directly on point as option D, which focuses on the enforceability of the original deed restrictions.\n\nIn conclusion, the most probable outcome is that the action would be successful due to the enforceability of the original deed restrictions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
