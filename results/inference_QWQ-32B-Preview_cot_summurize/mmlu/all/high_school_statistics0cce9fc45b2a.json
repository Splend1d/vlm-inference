                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about the correlation coefficient is true. I remember that the correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, and it ranges from -1 to 1. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line may have opposite signs.\" Hmm, I think the correlation coefficient and the slope should have the same sign because both indicate the direction of the relationship. If the correlation is positive, the slope should be positive, and vice versa. So, I don't think they can have opposite signs. Maybe A is false.\n\nOption B says: \"A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship between the variables.\" Now, I know that correlation measures the strength of a linear relationship, but it doesn't imply causation. There could be a perfect linear relationship without one variable causing the other to change. So, I think B is false because correlation doesn't imply causation.\n\nOption C says: \"Correlations of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line.\" This one is tricky. I know that the absolute value of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship, so both +0.87 and -0.87 indicate a strong relationship. The sign just indicates the direction, positive or negative. So, in terms of how closely the data points cluster around the regression line, both correlations would indicate similar clustering, just in different directions. So, I think C is true.\n\nOption D says: \"Correlation applies equally well to quantitative and categorical data.\" I don't think this is correct. Correlation coefficients are calculated for quantitative variables, not for categorical data. Categorical data would require other measures, like chi-square tests or other association measures. So, D seems false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I believe that option C is the correct statement about the correlation coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
