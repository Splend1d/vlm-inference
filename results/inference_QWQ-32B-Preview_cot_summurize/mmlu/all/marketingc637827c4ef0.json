So, the question is about a company that builds its sales message, advertising message, and promotion theme to influence how a particular market sector perceives a good or service compared to the competition. And we need to figure out which marketing strategy this describes: segmentation, mass customization, concentrated targeting, or positioning.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nSegmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared characteristics. So, it's about identifying different groups within a larger market.\n\nMass customization is a marketing strategy that allows customers to customize products to their individual preferences, while still achieving the efficiencies of mass production. It's about offering personalized products without the high cost.\n\nConcentrated targeting is a strategy where a company focuses all its marketing efforts on a single market segment. So, instead of trying to appeal to everyone, they target one specific group.\n\nPositioning is about how a product is perceived by the market in relation to competing products. It's about creating a unique image or place in the mind of the customer for the product or brand.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it mentions that the company is building its sales and advertising messages to influence how a particular market sector perceives its good or service compared to the competition. That sounds a lot like positioning to me.\n\nSegmentation is about identifying different market segments, but not necessarily about influencing perceptions. Mass customization is about allowing customers to customize products, which isn't directly related to influencing perceptions through messaging. Concentrated targeting is about focusing on one segment, but again, not specifically about shaping perceptions.\n\nPositioning, on the other hand, is all about shaping how the product is perceived in the market relative to competitors. So, by crafting specific sales and advertising messages, the company is trying to position its product in the mind of the customer in a certain way.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. positioning.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. If the company is building messages to influence perception compared to competitors, it's definitely trying to position its product in a favorable light. Maybe it's emphasizing certain features, benefits, or values that set it apart from others in the market.\n\nFor example, a company might position its soda as the refreshment choice for athletes, or its car as the safest option on the market. These are positioning strategies designed to influence how customers perceive the product relative to alternatives.\n\nSo, yes, I believe positioning is the right answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
