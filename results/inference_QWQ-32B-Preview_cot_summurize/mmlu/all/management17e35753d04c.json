These norms guide how group members should act, communicate, and interact with one another. They serve to maintain order, facilitate cooperation, and ensure that the group functions effectively towards its goals.\n\nOption A is correct because group norms are indeed modes of behavior that are acceptable to and shared by group members. These norms are typically developed over time through the group's experiences and are agreed upon by the members as acceptable ways to behave within the group context.\n\nOption B is incorrect because norms are not just shared by some members but are expected to be followed by all members of the group. If only some members share certain behaviors, those would not qualify as group norms but might be considered sub-group behaviors or individual preferences.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because behaviors that challenge group values and beliefs would typically be considered deviations from norms rather than the norms themselves. Group norms are about what is accepted and expected, not about what is contested or opposed.\n\nOption D is wrong because group norms are about behaviors that are similar and expected across group members, not about behaviors that are different from those of other group members. While it's possible for different groups to have different norms, within a single group, norms are about shared behaviors.\n\nUnderstanding group norms is crucial for effective group functioning. They help in predicting and guiding behavior, reducing uncertainty, and fostering a sense of belonging and identity among group members. Additionally, norms can influence individual behavior, sometimes leading to conformity even when personal opinions differ.\n\nIn some cases, group norms can be explicit, such as rules or policies stated in a group's charter or code of conduct. In other instances, norms are implicit, understood through observation and socialization within the group. Both types are important in shaping group dynamics and member behavior.\n\nIt's also worth noting that group norms can evolve over time as the group's circumstances change or as new members bring different perspectives and behaviors into the group. Adapting to these changes is part of maintaining healthy and functional group norms.\n\nIn summary, group norms are the shared and acceptable modes of behavior among group members, guiding how they should act and interact within the group. They are essential for maintaining order and facilitating the group's objectives."
