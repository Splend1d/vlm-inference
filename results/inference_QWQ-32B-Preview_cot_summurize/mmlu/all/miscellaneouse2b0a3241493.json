                    "text": "I've got this question here: \"Elephant tusks are made of what material? A. Coral B. Ivory C. Bone D. Calcium.\" Hmm, I need to choose the correct answer. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that elephant tusks are like big teeth that stick out of their mouth. I've seen pictures of elephants with these long, curved teeth. So, they must be some kind of tooth, right?\n\nI remember hearing about ivory. Isn't ivory comes from elephant tusks? My grandma has some old piano keys that she says are made from ivory, and I think they come from elephants. So, maybe the answer is B. Ivory.\n\nBut let me double-check. What is ivory exactly? I think ivory is the material that makes up the tusks of elephants. It's a hard, white substance. So, if tusks are made of ivory, then that would make sense.\n\nWait a minute, but isn't ivory also used for other things, like ornaments and stuff? And I've heard that ivory comes from elephants, so that reinforces the idea that tusks are made of ivory.\n\nNow, let's look at the other options. A. Coral. Coral is something that grows in the ocean, like a reef. It's not related to elephants, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nC. Bone. Well, tusks are like teeth, and teeth are different from bones. Teeth have enamel and dentin, while bones have different components. So, maybe bone isn't the right answer here.\n\nD. Calcium. Well, I know that bones and teeth both contain calcium, but calcium is a mineral, not a material like ivory. So, maybe that's too general.\n\nLet me see if I can find a better way to think about this. I recall that ivory is a hard, white material that comes from the tusks of elephants and some other animals, like walruses and mammoths. It's been used for carving and making various products for a long time.\n\nSo, if ivory is the material that makes up the tusks, then the correct answer should be B. Ivory.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the composition of elephant tusks. I think tusks are enlarged incisor teeth. Teeth generally have layers, like enamel on the outside and dentin inside, with a pulp cavity containing nerves and blood vessels.\n\nIn the case of elephant tusks, which are basically elongated incisors, they would have a similar structure. So, perhaps the main material is dentin, which is a calcified tissue that makes up the bulk of the tooth.\n\nWait, does that mean that ivory is dentin? I need to clarify this.\n\nUpon checking, I find that ivory is indeed dentin. It's the bulk material of the tooth, beneath the enamel. In tusks, which are large teeth, the main composition is dentin, which is the ivory.\n\nSo, in that case, is the answer C. Bone? But bone is different from dentin. Bone is a different type of calcified tissue, with a different structure.\n\nTherefore, even though both bone and dentin contain calcium, they are not the same thing. So, bone isn't the correct answer.\n\nOption D. Calcium is a component of both bones and teeth, but as I said earlier, it's too general. The material of the tusk is more specifically ivory, which is dentin.\n\nSo, considering all this, the most accurate answer is B. Ivory.\n\nAdditionally, I should note that trading in elephant ivory is illegal in many places because of the impact on elephant populations. It's important to be aware of that.\n\nIn conclusion, elephant tusks are made of ivory, which is the hard, white dentin material that forms the bulk of the tusk. So, the correct answer is B. Ivory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
