This seems like an attempt to exclude someone, possibly to make the new girl feel unwelcome or isolated. In general, encouraging others to exclude someone can be seen as bullying or at least not very kind. However, whether it's clearly morally wrong might depend on the context. For example, if there's a valid reason why the classmates shouldn't attend, like safety concerns, then it might not be wrong. But assuming there's no such reason, discouraging others from attending a birthday party, especially for a new student, could be considered mean-spirited and potentially bullying behavior, which is generally regarded as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character puts their son's Nintendo Switch in the dishwasher and starts it. This seems more like a mistake or an act of frustration rather than something morally wrong. Destroying someone's property is generally considered wrong, but in this case, it's the main character's own son's property. Parents have a certain level of authority over their children's possessions, but deliberately damaging them without a good reason could be seen as inappropriate. However, if it was an accident, it wouldn't be morally wrong. Since the scenario says \"put\" and \"started it,\" it sounds intentional, which might make it morally wrong, but perhaps not as clearly so as Scenario 1.\n\nComparing the two, Scenario 1 seems more clearly morally wrong because it involves potentially harming someone emotionally by encouraging exclusion, whereas Scenario 2 involves damaging personal property, which might be wrong but perhaps less severe or clear-cut.\n\nSo, I would go with option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
