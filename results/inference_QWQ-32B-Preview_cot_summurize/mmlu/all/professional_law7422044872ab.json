The owner of a publication company was prosecuted and convicted of violating the state obscenity law by mailing adults sexual literature that appealed to their prurient interests. During the owner's trial, the judge instructed the jury that determining if the mailed materials were obscene depended in part on whether they were offensive to the average or normal person under contemporary community standards, and that the community standards test must be considered in light of the fact that many children reside in the community. Furthermore, the judge instructed the jury that in determining whether the materials were obscene, it could also consider evidence of pandering, or whether the materials were marketed purposely to appeal to the recipients' prurient interest in sex. The owner appealed her conviction, alleging a denial of her First Amendment rights. Which of the following is the strongest argument why the appellate court should reverse the owner's conviction?\n\nA. The method by which materials are marketed or advertised is not probative of whether they are obscene.\nB. It is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy for the government to interfere with the content of closed mailings intended for the private use by consenting adults.\nC. Under the First Amendment, the community's standards for children may not be applied in determining what constitutes obscenity for adults.\nD. Obscenity is to be determined by applying national standards, not contemporary community standards.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which argument is the strongest for reversing the owner's conviction in this case. Let's break down the options one by one.\n\nOption A says that the method by which materials are marketed or advertised isn't probative of whether they are obscene. So, the idea is that just because something is marketed in a certain way, that doesn't make it obscene. But in this case, the judge allowed the jury to consider evidence of pandering, meaning whether the materials were marketed to appeal to prurient interests in sex. Now, pandering is often considered a factor in determining obscenity because it suggests that the material is being distributed with the intent to titillate rather than for any serious purpose. So, while marketing methods might not be the sole determinant of obscenity, they can be relevant. Therefore, arguing that marketing methods are not probative of obscenity might not be the strongest argument.\n\nOption B claims that it's an unconstitutional invasion of privacy for the government to interfere with the content of closed mailings intended for private use by consenting adults. This seems like a plausible argument because adults should have the right to receive materials of their choice in private, as long as it doesn't harm others. The First Amendment protects the freedom to receive information and ideas, and private mailings could be seen as a form of protected speech between the sender and the recipient. However, the state has enacted a law prohibiting the mailing of obscene materials, so there's a balance between privacy rights and the state's interest in preventing the distribution of obscene materials. This argument might have some merit, but I'm not sure if it's the strongest.\n\nOption C states that under the First Amendment, the community's standards for children may not be applied in determining what constitutes obscenity for adults. This seems like a significant point. The judge instructed the jury to consider contemporary community standards, taking into account that many children reside in the community. But the issue here is whether adult materials should be judged by the standards applicable to children. Generally, what is considered obscene for children might differ from what is considered obscene for adults. Adults have a higher tolerance for explicit material, and their right to receive such material is more protected under the First Amendment. Applying children's standards to adult materials could unjustly restrict adult access to constitutionally protected speech. This seems like a strong argument for reversal.\n\nOption D proposes that obscenity should be determined by applying national standards, not contemporary community standards. This touches on the debate about whether obscenity should be defined locally or nationally. Historically, the Supreme Court has allowed for community standards to determine what is obscene, recognizing that different communities have different sensibilities. However, there is an argument to be made that obscenity should be defined by national standards to ensure uniformity and to protect speech that might be acceptable in some communities but not in others. But this argument might not be as directly applicable to this case as option C, because the issue here isn't just about community standards versus national standards, but about applying children's standards to adults.\n\nComparing all these options, I think option C is the strongest argument for reversing the owner's conviction. It directly challenges the application of children's community standards to adult materials, which is a clear violation of adult First Amendment rights. Adults are entitled to receive materials that may not be suitable for children, and the state shouldn't impose children's standards on them. Therefore, the appellate court should reverse the conviction on this ground.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
