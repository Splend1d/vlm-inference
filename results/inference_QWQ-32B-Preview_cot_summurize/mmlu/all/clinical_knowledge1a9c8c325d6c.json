                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which group of patients should be assessed using an Early Warning Score (EWS). The options are:\n\nA. Only patients over 60 years of age.\n\nB. Only patients admitted to the Emergency Department.\n\nC. Only patients who have been on an Intensive care/High dependency unit.\n\nD. Any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an Early Warning Score (EWS) is. From what I know, EWS is a tool used in hospitals to identify patients who are getting worse and may need more intensive care or closer monitoring. It's based on various physiological measurements like heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and sometimes other parameters like oxygen saturation.\n\nNow, looking at option A: only patients over 60 years of age. Age is a factor that can increase risk, but EWS is used more broadly to assess the stability of a patient's vital signs, regardless of age. So, limiting it to patients over 60 might not be comprehensive.\n\nOption B suggests only patients admitted to the Emergency Department. While EWS is certainly used in EDs to triage and monitor patients, it's also used in other areas of the hospital, like general wards, to monitor patients' conditions over time.\n\nOption C mentions only patients who have been on an Intensive care/High dependency unit. Again, while EWS is used in ICUs and HDUs, its utility isn't limited to these areas. In fact, one of the purposes of EWS is to identify patients on general wards who might need escalation of care, possibly to ICU.\n\nOption D says any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery. This seems broad and inclusive of patients who are at higher risk of deterioration. Pre-operative and post-operative patients, especially those who have undergone major surgery, are indeed at higher risk and could benefit from close monitoring using EWS.\n\nBut, is this the only group that should be assessed with EWS? What about other acutely unwell patients who aren't surgical patients? For example, medical patients with acute illnesses like pneumonia, heart failure, or sepsis. These patients can also deteriorate quickly and would benefit from EWS monitoring.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm a bit unsure because EWS is used more widely than just in surgical patients. Maybe I need to consider that the question is asking about a specific group, and D describes a specific group: acutely unwell patients around surgery.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct interpretation is that EWS should be used for any acutely unwell patient, not just those in the surgical pathway. But according to the options provided, D seems to be the best choice.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the question is testing the understanding that EWS is particularly important for surgical patients due to the higher risk of post-operative complications. In that case, D would make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants to emphasize that EWS is used for patients who are acutely unwell, regardless of their location in the hospital or their age. But again, looking at the options, D is the one that specifies acutely unwell patients, particularly around surgical procedures.\n\nI think I need to go with D, but it does feel a bit narrow. Maybe the question is trying to highlight the importance of EWS in surgical patients, especially those who have undergone major surgery or are at risk pre-operatively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a specific guideline or protocol that suggests EWS should be used for this particular group. If that's the case, then D would be the correct answer.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll choose D: Any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
