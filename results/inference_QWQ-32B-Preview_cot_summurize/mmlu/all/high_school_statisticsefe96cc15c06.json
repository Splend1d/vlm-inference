                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about rainfall in a city. It says that the rainfall per month is approximately normally distributed with a mean of six inches and a standard deviation of 1.6 inches. I need to find the highest amount of rainfall that would still be considered among the 10 percent driest months the city has seen. The options are A. 8.05, B. 7.6, C. 3.95, and D. 3.37 inches.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a month to be among the 10 percent driest months. I think that means I'm looking for the rainfall amount below which only 10% of the months fall. In other words, I'm looking for the 10th percentile of the rainfall distribution.\n\nSince the rainfall is normally distributed with a mean (\u03bc) of 6 inches and a standard deviation (\u03c3) of 1.6 inches, I can use the properties of the normal distribution to find this value.\n\nTo find the 10th percentile in a normal distribution, I need to find the z-score that corresponds to cumulative probability of 0.10. The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nWhere X is the value I'm trying to find.\n\nI need to look up the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.10 in a standard normal distribution table or use a z-score calculator.\n\nLooking at a standard normal distribution table, I find that a z-score of approximately -1.28 corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.10.\n\nSo, z = -1.28\n\nNow, I can plug this into the z-score formula and solve for X:\n\n-1.28 = (X - 6) / 1.6\n\nNow, solve for X:\n\nX = (-1.28 * 1.6) + 6\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, -1.28 * 1.6 = -2.048\n\nThen, X = -2.048 + 6 = 3.952 inches\n\nSo, the 10th percentile is approximately 3.952 inches.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 3.95, which matches closely.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the highest amount of rainfall that is still among the 10 percent driest months. So, that would be the upper limit of the driest 10%, which is the 10th percentile.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 3.95 inches.\n\nHowever, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03bc = 6 inches\n\n\u03c3 = 1.6 inches\n\nI need to find the 10th percentile, which corresponds to z = -1.28 (from the z-table).\n\nUsing the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n-1.28 = (X - 6) / 1.6\n\nSolving for X:\n\nX = (-1.28 * 1.6) + 6\n\nCalculate -1.28 * 1.6:\n\n-1.28 * 1.6 = -2.048\n\nThen, X = -2.048 + 6 = 3.952 inches\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 8.05\n\nB. 7.6\n\nC. 3.95\n\nD. 3.37\n\nC is the closest to 3.952, so C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any chance that D. 3.37 could be correct.\n\nIf I look back at the z-score for the 10th percentile, z = -1.28 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a more precise z-score.\n\nUsing a z-table, the exact z-score for the 10th percentile is approximately -1.2816.\n\nLet's use that for more precision.\n\nSo, z = -1.2816\n\nThen, X = (-1.2816 * 1.6) + 6\n\nCalculate -1.2816 * 1.6:\n\n-1.2816 * 1.6 = -2.05056\n\nThen, X = -2.05056 + 6 = 3.94944 inches\n\nStill very close to 3.95 inches.\n\nTherefore, option C. 3.95 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the highest amount that is still considered among the driest 10%, meaning that any amount less than or equal to this value is in the driest 10%.\n\nIn that case, the value should be the 10th percentile, which is what I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's confusion about the wording.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"the highest amount of rainfall this city could have this month for the month to be among the 10 percent driest months the city has seen?\"\n\nSo, it's asking for the highest rainfall amount that is still within the driest 10% of months.\n\nThat means I need the value below which 10% of the months fall, which is indeed the 10th percentile.\n\nTherefore, my calculation stands.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is interpreted differently.\n\nSometimes, \"driest months\" could be confusing.\n\nThe driest months would be those with the least amount of rainfall.\n\nSo, the 10 percent driest months are the months with the lowest 10% of rainfall amounts.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the rainfall amount that is greater than only 10% of all months, which is the 10th percentile.\n\nMy calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the question said \"the highest amount of rainfall for the month to be among the 10 percent wettest months,\" that would be the top 10%, and I'd need to find the 90th percentile.\n\nBut in this case, it's the driest 10%, which is the bottom 10%, so the 10th percentile.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 3.95 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
