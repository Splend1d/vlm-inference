                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about continuously compounded returns, also known as log-returns. We need to identify which statement among the options is NOT a feature of log-returns. Let's examine each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"They can be interpreted as continuously compounded changes in the prices.\" Hmm, that sounds familiar. In finance, log-returns are indeed interpreted as the continuous compounding of returns over time. The formula for log-return is ln(Pt / Pt-1), where Pt is the price at time t, and Pt-1 is the price at the previous time period. This measures the instantaneous rate of change in the price, which aligns with the concept of continuous compounding. So, this seems like a valid feature of log-returns.\n\nMoving on to Option B: \"They can be added over time to give returns for longer time periods.\" Another key property of log-returns is that they are additive over time. This means that if you have log-returns for multiple periods, you can simply sum them up to get the total log-return over that entire period. This is in contrast to simple returns, where you would need to multiply the growth factors. So, this is also a feature of log-returns.\n\nOption C states: \"They can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns.\" This is also true for log-returns. When you have a portfolio consisting of multiple assets, you can calculate the log-returns for each asset and then sum them according to their weights in the portfolio to get the overall portfolio log-return. This additivity across assets is another advantageous feature of using log-returns in financial analysis.\n\nNow, Option D says: \"They are usually fat-tailed.\" Fat-tailed distributions are those that have heavier tails compared to a normal distribution, meaning they are more prone to extreme values or outliers. In financial returns, it's well documented that returns often exhibit fat tails, which means that extreme price movements are more likely than what a normal distribution would predict.\n\nBut here's the thing: log-returns themselves don't inherently possess fat tails. The distribution of log-returns can vary depending on the underlying asset and the time period considered. While it's possible for log-returns to be fat-tailed, it's not a universal characteristic. In fact, in some models, log-returns are assumed to be normally distributed, which is not fat-tailed.\n\nComparing this with the other options, which are all general features of log-returns, this seems like the statement that might not always hold true. Therefore, I would say that Option D is the correct answer to this question\u2014that \"they are usually fat-tailed\" is not necessarily a feature of continuously compounded returns.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A: Correct feature of log-returns.\n\n- Option B: Correct feature of log-returns.\n\n- Option C: Correct feature of log-returns.\n\n- Option D: Not necessarily a feature of log-returns, as log-returns can have various distributions, including normal, which is not fat-tailed.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
