                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, when the price of pears increases, what happens? I need to recall some basic economics here.\n\nFirst, there's the law of demand, which says that, generally, as the price of a good goes up, the quantity demanded goes down, assuming everything else stays the same. So, if pears get more expensive, people might buy fewer pears.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking about what we expect when the price of pears increases. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Quantity demanded of pears rises.\n\nThat seems contrary to the law of demand. If pears get more expensive, people would probably buy less, not more.\n\nB. Quantity supplied of pears falls.\n\nHmm, the law of supply usually says that as price increases, quantity supplied increases, because suppliers want to sell more when they can get a higher price. So, if the price of pears goes up, suppliers would likely want to supply more, not less.\n\nC. Quantity demanded of pears falls.\n\nThis aligns with the law of demand. If pears are more expensive, people will likely buy fewer pears.\n\nD. Demand for pears falls.\n\nWait, demand is different from quantity demanded. Demand refers to the entire relationship between price and quantity, while quantity demanded is a specific point on that demand curve.\n\nSo, if the price of pears increases, and assuming demand doesn't change, the quantity demanded should decrease, according to the law of demand.\n\nBut let's make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any scenario where an increase in price could lead to an increase in quantity demanded? I think that's possible in the case of a Giffen good, but pears don't typically fall into that category. Giffen goods are inferior goods for which demand increases as price increases, but they're rare.\n\nAlso, there's the substitution effect: if pears get more expensive, people might switch to buying other fruits instead, like apples or bananas.\n\nSimilarly, there's the income effect: if the price of pears increases, people might feel poorer because they have to spend more to buy the same amount of pears, so they might buy less.\n\nSo, both substitution and income effects suggest that quantity demanded would decrease when price increases.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Quantity demanded rises. That doesn't seem right.\n\nB. Quantity supplied falls. That also doesn't seem right, because suppliers would likely want to supply more at a higher price.\n\nC. Quantity demanded falls. This seems correct based on the law of demand.\n\nD. Demand for pears falls. Wait, demand is different from quantity demanded. Demand falling would mean the entire demand curve shifts downward, which isn't directly related to a change in price. A change in price typically moves along a stable demand curve, causing a change in quantity demanded.\n\nSo, in this case, since the question is about the effect of a price increase, which is a movement along the demand curve, the appropriate expectation is that quantity demanded falls.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Quantity demanded of pears falls.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if any other options could be correct.\n\nOption D says \"Demand for pears falls.\" That would involve a shift in the demand curve, which isn't directly caused by a change in price. Instead, demand might fall due to factors like a decrease in consumers' income, a change in tastes, or a rise in the price of complementary goods. So, a price increase wouldn't cause demand to fall; it would cause a movement along the demand curve, changing the quantity demanded.\n\nTherefore, option D isn't correct in this context.\n\nOption B suggests that the quantity supplied falls when the price increases. Again, that contradicts the law of supply, which generally states that suppliers are willing to supply more at higher prices.\n\nSo, the only option that makes sense is C: Quantity demanded of pears falls.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
