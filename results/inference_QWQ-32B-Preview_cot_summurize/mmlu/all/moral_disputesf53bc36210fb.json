                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about Nagel's views on moral dilemmas. So, Nagel believes that there can be genuine moral dilemmas, which means situations where a person has conflicting moral obligations and no clear way to resolve them. Now, the question is asking which moral principle Nagel denies because of this belief.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Can implies should.\n\nB. Can implies ought.\n\nC. Ought implies can.\n\nD. Ought implies should.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these principles means.\n\nOption A: \"Can implies should.\" This would mean that if something is possible (can), then one should do it. That seems like a stretch, but I need to see how it relates to moral dilemmas.\n\nOption B: \"Can implies ought.\" This is similar to A, suggesting that possibility entails moral obligation. Again, not sure how this connects to dilemmas.\n\nOption C: \"Ought implies can.\" This is a more familiar principle, which suggests that one ought to do something only if it is possible to do it. This seems relevant because in moral dilemmas, even if there are conflicting obligations, people might still have the ability to act on them.\n\nOption D: \"Ought implies should.\" This seems redundant because \"ought\" and \"should\" are often used interchangeably in moral language.\n\nGiven that Nagel thinks there can be genuine moral dilemmas, where people have conflicting obligations, I need to see which of these principles he would deny.\n\nIf there are genuine moral dilemmas, that means sometimes people have obligations that conflict, and they can't fulfill both. So, if \"ought implies can\" is accepted, then if someone ought to do something, they must be able to do it. But in a dilemma, they might ought to do two things that are in conflict, and can't do both.\n\nWait, maybe Nagel is denying that \"ought implies can.\" Because if he accepts that, then in a dilemma, where someone ought to do two things they can't both do, there's a problem. So perhaps he denies \"ought implies can\" to allow for the possibility of genuine dilemmas.\n\nBut looking back, option C is \"ought implies can,\" and if Nagel denies that, it would mean that one can ought to do something even if they can't do it, which seems problematic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he denies \"can implies ought\" or \"can implies should,\" meaning that just because something is possible, doesn't mean one ought to or should do it. But I'm not sure how that directly relates to the existence of moral dilemmas.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the relationship between ability and obligation. If Nagel accepts \"ought implies can,\" then in a dilemma, where one ought to do two things but can't do both, there's a contradiction. To avoid that contradiction, maybe he denies \"ought implies can,\" thus allowing for the possibility of genuine dilemmas where one ought to do things that are beyond one's ability to complete without sacrifice.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because \"ought implies can\" is a widely accepted principle in moral philosophy, meant to prevent imposing impossible obligations on people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Nagel denies that \"ought\" statements are necessarily connected to ability, or perhaps he has a different view on the nature of obligations in conflicting situations.\n\nLet me consider the context of moral dilemmas. In a dilemma, a person faces conflicting obligations, and no matter what they choose, they will fail to fulfill one of the obligations. If \"ought implies can\" holds, then perhaps in such a situation, one doesn't truly ought to do both things, or perhaps the obligations are not as rigid as they seem.\n\nNagel, however, believes that these dilemmas are genuine, meaning that the obligations are genuine and conflicting, and people genuinely ought to do both, even if they can't.\n\nTherefore, to maintain that position, he might deny \"ought implies can,\" because accepting it would require that if one ought to do something, they must be able to do it. But in a dilemma, one ought to do multiple things they can't all do together.\n\nSo, by denying \"ought implies can,\" Nagel can allow for the possibility that people ought to do things even if they can't accomplish all of them due to the nature of the dilemma.\n\nTherefore, the answer seems to be option C: \"ought implies can.\"\n\nWait, but option C is \"ought implies can,\" and if he denies it, that's what allows for genuine dilemmas.\n\nBut the question says: \"Nagel thinks there can be genuine moral dilemmas, he denies the moral principle that...\"\n\nSo, denying \"ought implies can\" would be consistent with accepting genuine moral dilemmas.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's look at the other options.\n\nOption A: \"can implies should.\" Denying this would mean that just because something is possible, doesn't mean one should do it. That seems plausible, but it's not directly related to the concept of moral dilemmas.\n\nOption B: \"can implies ought.\" Similar to A, it's about possibility leading to obligation, which isn't directly connected to dilemmas.\n\nOption D: \"ought implies should.\" This seems tautological, as \"ought\" and \"should\" are synonymous in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is C: \"ought implies can,\" which Nagel denies to allow for the existence of genuine moral dilemmas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
