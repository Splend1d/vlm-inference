                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the chi-square (\u03c7\u00b2) probability distribution function. I need to identify which statement is NOT true among the options provided. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"The area under the \u03c7\u00b2 curve is 1.\" Hmm, I know that for any probability distribution function, the total area under the curve should equal 1. This is a fundamental property of probability distributions. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B states: \"\u03c7\u00b2 is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable.\" Chi-square distributions are indeed always nonnegative because they are based on the sum of squared standard normal variables, and squares are always positive or zero. So, this also seems accurate.\n\nOption C says: \"For small degrees of freedom, the curve displays strong right-skewness.\" I recall that chi-square distributions are typically skewed to the right, especially when the degrees of freedom are small. As the degrees of freedom increase, the distribution becomes more symmetric and approaches a normal distribution. So, this statement appears to be true.\n\nOption D states: \"For the same \u03b1, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases.\" Now, this one requires some careful thought. In chi-square tests, the critical value depends on the significance level \u03b1 and the degrees of freedom. Generally, as the degrees of freedom increase, the critical value for a given \u03b1 also increases. This is because with more degrees of freedom, the chi-square distribution spreads out more, and thus the critical value needs to be larger to capture the same tail probability.\n\nWait a minute, that seems contrary to what option D is saying. It claims that the critical value decreases as degrees of freedom increase, which doesn't align with my understanding.\n\nLet me double-check this. In chi-square distributions, as degrees of freedom increase, the mean of the distribution increases (mean equals degrees of freedom), and the variance decreases (variance equals twice the degrees of freedom). So, the distribution shifts to the right and becomes less spread out relative to its mean.\n\nIn hypothesis testing, for a right-tailed test (which is common in chi-square tests), the critical value is the point beyond which we reject the null hypothesis. If the distribution is shifting to the right as degrees of freedom increase, then for the same \u03b1, the critical value should increase.\n\nFor example, consider \u03b1 = 0.05. For 1 degree of freedom, the critical value is approximately 3.841. For 10 degrees of freedom, it's around 18.307. Clearly, as degrees of freedom increase, the critical value increases.\n\nTherefore, option D is stating the opposite of what actually happens. It says that the critical value decreases as degrees of freedom increase, which is not correct.\n\nSo, the statement that is NOT true is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
