                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in the 1990s is false. So, I have options A, B, C, and D, each suggesting different reasons for reforming the court during that time.\n\nFirst, I should understand what was happening with the ECHR in the 1990s. I know that the ECHR was established to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe, as defined in the European Convention on Human Rights. In the 1990s, there were significant changes in Europe, particularly with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which led to the expansion of the Council of Europe and the ECHR to include many new member states.\n\nOption A says: \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because it wasn't examining enough cases.\" Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. Usually, when a court is overwhelmed, it's because there are too many cases to handle, not too few. So, this might be the false statement.\n\nOption B states: \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because the workload had increased.\" This makes sense. With more member states and more individuals able to submit complaints, the workload would probably increase.\n\nOption C says: \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because it was a part-time court that could not process the growing number of complaints.\" I think the ECHR has always been a full-time court, but I might be wrong. I need to verify this.\n\nOption D: \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because of the growth in the number of individuals who could access the Court after the increase in the number of member states.\" This also makes sense. More member states mean more potential complainants.\n\nLet me cross-reference these points. The ECHR was indeed established in 1959 and has seen significant growth in its caseload over the years, especially with the accession of new member states in the 1990s and 2000s. The court has had to reform several times to handle the increasing number of applications.\n\nOption A suggests that the court wasn't examining enough cases, which doesn't align with the general understanding of the court's workload in the 1990s. Typically, the issue was the opposite: the court was struggling to keep up with the volume of cases.\n\nOption B directly mentions that the workload had increased, which is consistent with historical records.\n\nOption C mentions that the court was part-time, which I believe is incorrect. The ECHR is a full-time court, and its judges are professional jurists who dedicate their time to the court's work.\n\nOption D correctly identifies that the increase in member states led to more individuals being able to access the court, thus increasing the number of complaints.\n\nGiven this information, both options A and C seem problematic. A because it contradicts the general issue of the court being overwhelmed by cases, and C because the court was already a full-time institution.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps in the 1990s, there were discussions about the court's structure or functioning that might have involved part-time aspects. I need to check the history of the ECHR to see if there were any part-time elements in its composition or functioning during that period.\n\nUpon checking, I find that the ECHR has always been a full-time court, with its judges serving full-time and not in a part-time capacity. Therefore, option C seems false.\n\nOption A also seems false, but option C directly contradicts the known structure of the court.\n\nHowever, I should consider that the court might have been facing issues with examining cases efficiently, but the primary problem was an excess of cases, not a lack thereof.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is likely option C: that the European Court of Human Rights was a part-time court in the 1990s. It was, in fact, a full-time court, and the need for reform stemmed from the increased workload due to more member states and more applications.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
