                    "text": "This question is about a trust set up by Walter, who died in 1997, leaving $1,000,000 to Trend Trust Company. The trust is supposed to pay income to his son, Stan, for life. After Stan's death, the income goes to Stan's widow, and after the widow's death, it goes to the living children of Walter's sister, Harriet, in equal shares.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\n- Walter died in 1997.\n\n- Stan was married to Morgana and had two children, Andrew and Beverly.\n\n- Walter's will specifies that after Stan and his widow die, the income should go to the living children of Harriet.\n\n- Harriet's only surviving child is Grace, born in 2001.\n\n- Both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash in 2009.\n\nNow, Harriet, on behalf of Grace, is suing Trend Trust Company and Walter's estate to allow the distribution of the income from the trust to Grace.\n\nThe question is: Is Harriet likely to prevail in this action?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. No, because Grace was not a life in being at the time of Walter's death.\n\nB. No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nC. Yes, because that was Walter's intent.\n\nD. Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal concepts involved here, particularly the Rule against Perpetuities and the concept of \"lives in being.\"\n\nThe Rule against Perpetuities is a common law rule that says that any interest in property must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after some life in being at the time of the creation of the interest. If there's a possibility that the interest could vest later than that, it's void.\n\nIn this case, Walter died in 1997, so the trust was created then. The relevant lives in being at that time would be Stan, Morgana, and Harriet's children, if any.\n\nGrace was born in 2001, so she was not a life in being at the time of Walter's death in 1997.\n\nThe trust provides that after Stan and his widow die, the income goes to the living children of Harriet.\n\nStan and Morgana both died in 2009. At that point, Harriet's only surviving child is Grace, born in 2001.\n\nSo, the question is whether Grace can receive the income from the trust, given that she was not alive at the time the trust was created.\n\nOption A says no, because Grace was not a life in being at the time of Walter's death.\n\nOption B says no, because the provisions violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nOption C says yes, because that was Walter's intent.\n\nOption D says yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income are deceased.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\nOption A: No, because Grace was not a life in being at the time of Walter's death.\n\nThis seems relevant because the Rule against Perpetuities often involves lives in being at the time the interest is created.\n\nHowever, under the trust, the income is to go to the living children of Harriet at the time of the termination of the prior interests. Grace was born after Walter's death, so she wasn't a life in being at that time.\n\nBut, in some jurisdictions, contingent beneficiaries who weren't alive at the creation of the trust can still receive benefits if the contingency occurs within the perpetuity period.\n\nI need to think about how the Rule against Perpetuities applies here.\n\nOption B: No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nThis seems similar to Option A but specifically mentions the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nI need to determine if the trust violates this rule.\n\nThe Rule against Perpetuities says that any interest must vest within 21 years of some life in being at the time the interest was created.\n\nIn this case, the interest is the right to receive income from the trust, which is contingent on Stan and his widow dying, and then Harriet having living children.\n\nStan was alive in 1997, so his life could be considered a measuring life.\n\nMorgana was also alive in 1997.\n\nHarriet was alive in 1997, and her children's lives could be considered as well.\n\nBut Grace was born in 2001, after Walter's death.\n\nSo, is there a possibility that the interest could vest more than 21 years after the measuring life?\n\nLet's see.\n\nSuppose Harriet has a child many years later, say in 2020, and that child is still alive after Stan and Morgana die.\n\nWould that child's interest vest more than 21 years after any life in being at Walter's death?\n\nWell, Stan was alive in 1997, and if Harriet has a child in 2020, and that child is still alive after Stan and Morgana die (which happened in 2009), then the interest would vest in 2020, which is more than 21 years after Stan's death in 2009, but Stan was alive in 1997.\n\nWait, the 21-year period runs from the death of Stan, or from his life in being at the time of the creation of the trust.\n\nI think it's from the death of Stan.\n\nBut actually, the Rule against Perpetuities measures from the creation of the interest, which is Walter's death in 1997.\n\nSo, any interest must vest within 21 years after the death of Stan, who was alive in 1997.\n\nStan died in 2009, so 21 years after that would be 2030.\n\nSo, if Harriet has a child in 2025, and that child is alive in 2009 when Stan and Morgana die, then the interest would vest in 2009.\n\nWait, but Harriet's child has to be alive at the time the interest becomes possessory, which is after Stan and Morgana die.\n\nIn this case, Stan and Morgana died in 2009, and Grace was born in 2001, so she was alive in 2009.\n\nSo, her interest would vest in 2009, which is within 21 years of Walter's death in 1997 (2009 - 1997 = 12 years).\n\nSo, in this specific case, Grace's interest vested within 21 years of Walter's death.\n\nBut what if Harriet had a child in 2010? That child would be born after Stan's death in 2009.\n\nWould that child's interest vest after 21 years from Walter's death?\n\nLet's see: Walter died in 1997, plus 21 years is 2018.\n\nIf Harriet has a child in 2015, who is alive in 2009, but born after Stan's death, but the interest vests in 2009, which is within 21 years of Walter's death.\n\nWait, but if the child is born in 2015, they weren't alive in 2009 when the interest becomes possessory.\n\nSo, in that case, the interest wouldn't vest because the child wasn't alive in 2009.\n\nBut in Grace's case, she was born in 2001 and was alive in 2009, so her interest vested in 2009, which is within 21 years of Walter's death in 1997.\n\nTherefore, her interest complies with the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nSo, Option B seems incorrect in this specific case.\n\nOption C: Yes, because that was Walter's intent.\n\nWhile Walter intended for the income to go to Harriet's living children, the problem is that Grace wasn't alive at the time the trust was created, and there might be legal restrictions based on the Rule against Perpetuities or other doctrines.\n\nHowever, since in this specific case, Grace was alive in 2009, and her interest vested within the perpetuity period, Walter's intent can be carried out without violating the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nSo, Option C could be correct.\n\nOption D: Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.\n\nThis suggests that since Stan and Morgana are deceased, and presumably there are no other beneficiaries before Grace in the distribution sequence, Grace should receive the income.\n\nThis seems logical, but we need to consider if there are any legal barriers, such as the ones mentioned in Options A and B.\n\nGiven that Grace was alive in 2009 and her interest vested within the perpetuity period, there don't seem to be any legal barriers preventing her from receiving the income.\n\nTherefore, Option D also seems correct.\n\nBetween Options C and D, I need to decide which one is more likely to prevail.\n\nOption C focuses on Walter's intent, while Option D focuses on the absence of other claimants.\n\nI think Option D is stronger because it not only considers Walter's intent but also the factual situation that all prior beneficiaries are deceased, making Grace the next in line according to the trust provisions.\n\nMoreover, since the legal requirements are satisfied (vesting within the perpetuity period), there's no reason to deny Grace's claim.\n\nTherefore, Harriet is likely to prevail in this action, and the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
