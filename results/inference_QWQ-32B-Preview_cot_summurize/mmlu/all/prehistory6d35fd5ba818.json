                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this anatomy question. It's about a feature on the skull, specifically a ridge of bone above and across the eye orbits. The options are sagittal crest, supraorbital torus, maxilla, and occipital bone. I need to choose the correct term for this feature.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms refers to.\n\nStarting with the sagittal crest. I think that's a ridge that runs along the midline of the skull, from front to back. It's where the jaw muscles attach, and it's more prominent in species with strong jaw muscles, like some primates. So, that's probably not the answer because the question is about a ridge above the eye orbits, not necessarily along the midline.\n\nNext, the supraorbital torus. The prefix \"supra\" means above, and \"orbital\" refers to the eye sockets. So, a supraorbital torus would be a ridge above the eye orbits. That sounds promising. I've heard of this feature in some human skulls, particularly in certain populations or in archaeological specimens.\n\nThen there's the maxilla. I know that the maxilla is one of the bones of the face, forming the upper jaw and part of the orbit. But it's more of a whole bone, not specifically a ridge above the eyes. So, maybe not the correct term here.\n\nFinally, the occipital bone. That's the bone at the back of the skull, where it connects to the spine. It doesn't sound like it's related to a ridge above the eye orbits.\n\nSo, between these options, the supraorbital torus seems to be the most appropriate term for a continuous, projecting ridge of bone above and across the eye orbits.\n\nTo double-check, I can think about the anatomy of the skull. The supraorbital margin is the bony ridge above the eyes, and in some individuals or species, this ridge can be more pronounced, forming a torus or browridge. This is especially notable in archaic humans or in some non-human primates.\n\nThe sagittal crest is indeed a different structure, located along the midline of the skull, and it's associated with heavy jaw musculature.\n\nThe maxilla is involved in forming the floor of the orbits and the upper jaw, but it doesn't describe a ridge above the eyes.\n\nThe occipital bone is at the base of the skull and is involved in the formation of the cranial cavity and the connection to the spine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. supraorbital torus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
