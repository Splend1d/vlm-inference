                    "text": "So I've got this problem: find the remainder when 25^1059 is divided by 23. The options are A. 11, B. 13, C. 8, and D. 5. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, 25^1059 is a huge number, right? It's way too big to calculate directly, so I need a smarter way to find the remainder when it's divided by 23. I remember that in modular arithmetic, there are some properties that can help simplify calculations like this.\n\nOne thing I recall is that if I have a number a and I want to find a^b mod c, I can reduce a mod c first to make the numbers smaller. So, let's see, 25 mod 23 is 2, because 23*1 = 23, and 25 - 23 = 2. So, 25 \u2261 2 mod 23. That means 25^1059 \u2261 2^1059 mod 23.\n\nAlright, so now I need to find 2^1059 mod 23. That's still a pretty big exponent, but maybe I can find a pattern or use some theorem to simplify this further.\n\nI think Fermat's Little Theorem might be useful here. Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) \u2261 1 mod p. In this case, 23 is a prime number, and 2 is not divisible by 23, so Fermat's Little Theorem applies.\n\nSo, according to Fermat's Little Theorem, 2^(23-1) \u2261 2^22 \u2261 1 mod 23.\n\nThat's helpful because 2^22 \u2261 1 mod 23, which means that every 22 exponents, the pattern repeats. So, I can reduce the exponent 1059 modulo 22 to find an equivalent exponent between 0 and 21.\n\nLet me calculate 1059 mod 22.\n\nFirst, find how many times 22 fits into 1059.\n\n22 * 48 = 1056, because 22 * 50 = 1100, which is too big, and 22 * 48 = 1056.\n\nSo, 1059 - 1056 = 3.\n\nTherefore, 1059 \u2261 3 mod 22.\n\nThat means 2^1059 \u2261 2^3 mod 23.\n\n2^3 is 8.\n\nSo, 2^1059 \u2261 8 mod 23.\n\nWait a minute, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I reduced 25 mod 23 to get 2, which seems correct.\n\nThen, I applied Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that 2^22 \u2261 1 mod 23, since 23 is prime and 2 is not divisible by 23.\n\nNext, I reduced the exponent 1059 mod 22, which gave me 3, because 1059 - 1056 = 3, and 1056 is 22 * 48.\n\nThen, 2^3 = 8.\n\nSo, 2^1059 \u2261 8 mod 23.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 8 is one of them, it's option C.\n\nWait, but the other options are 11, 13, and 5. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me check Fermat's Little Theorem again. Yeah, it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated 1059 mod 22.\n\nLet me do that again.\n\n22 * 48 = 1056, as before.\n\n1059 - 1056 = 3, yes.\n\nSo, 1059 \u2261 3 mod 22.\n\nTherefore, 2^1059 \u2261 2^3 \u2261 8 mod 23.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I can check with another method.\n\nAnother approach is to find the pattern of powers of 2 modulo 23.\n\nLet's compute some powers of 2 modulo 23:\n\n2^1 \u2261 2 mod 23\n\n2^2 \u2261 4 mod 23\n\n2^3 \u2261 8 mod 23\n\n2^4 \u2261 16 mod 23\n\n2^5 \u2261 32 \u2261 32 - 23 = 9 mod 23\n\n2^6 \u2261 18 mod 23\n\n2^7 \u2261 36 \u2261 36 - 23 = 13 mod 23\n\n2^8 \u2261 26 \u2261 26 - 23 = 3 mod 23\n\n2^9 \u2261 6 mod 23\n\n2^10 \u2261 12 mod 23\n\n2^11 \u2261 24 \u2261 24 - 23 = 1 mod 23\n\nWait a second, 2^11 \u2261 1 mod 23. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, but according to Fermat's Little Theorem, it should be 2^22 \u2261 1 mod 23, but here, 2^11 \u2261 1 mod 23.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating 2^11 mod 23.\n\nLet me compute 2^11:\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\n2^11 = 2048\n\nNow, 23 * 89 = 2047, because 23 * 90 = 2070, which is too big, and 23 * 89 = 2047.\n\nSo, 2048 - 2047 = 1.\n\nTherefore, 2^11 \u2261 1 mod 23.\n\nOh, so the order of 2 modulo 23 is 11, not 22.\n\nThat means 2^11 \u2261 1 mod 23.\n\nSo, in that case, I can reduce the exponent 1059 mod 11, not mod 22.\n\nWait, but Fermat's Little Theorem says 2^22 \u2261 1 mod 23, but in reality, the order might be a divisor of 22.\n\nIn this case, it seems the order is 11.\n\nSo, since 2^11 \u2261 1 mod 23, then 2^1059 = 2^(11*96 + 3) = (2^11)^96 * 2^3 \u2261 1^96 * 8 \u2261 8 mod 23.\n\nSo, again, I get 8.\n\nBut according to the options, 8 is one of them.\n\nWait, maybe I should check 2^3 mod 23.\n\n2^3 = 8, which is less than 23, so 8 mod 23 is indeed 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming 2^11 \u2261 1 mod 23.\n\nLet me verify that again.\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\n2^11 = 2048\n\n23 * 89 = 2047\n\n2048 - 2047 = 1, so yes, 2^11 \u2261 1 mod 23.\n\nTherefore, 2^1059 = 2^(11*96 + 3) = (2^11)^96 * 2^3 \u2261 1^96 * 8 \u2261 8 mod 23.\n\nSo, the remainder is 8.\n\nBut let's see, the options are A. 11, B. 13, C. 8, D. 5.\n\nSo, option C is 8.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake somewhere, as the other options are also possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nWait, perhaps 23 is not a prime number. Is 23 a prime number?\n\nYes, 23 is a prime number.\n\nSo, Fermat's Little Theorem applies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use Euler's Theorem.\n\nEuler's Theorem states that a^(phi(n)) \u2261 1 mod n, where phi is Euler's totient function, provided that a and n are coprime.\n\nIn this case, n = 23, which is prime, so phi(23) = 22.\n\nSo, Euler's Theorem gives 2^22 \u2261 1 mod 23, which is the same as Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nBut earlier calculation shows that 2^11 \u2261 1 mod 23, so the order of 2 modulo 23 is 11, which divides 22.\n\nSo, everything seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, 2^1059 \u2261 2^3 \u2261 8 mod 23.\n\nSo, the remainder is 8.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute 2^3 mod 23 again.\n\n2^1 = 2\n\n2^2 = 4\n\n2^3 = 8\n\nYes, 8 mod 23 is 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 8.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can check another power to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, 2^11 \u2261 1 mod 23, as previously calculated.\n\nThen, 2^12 = 2^11 * 2 \u2261 1 * 2 \u2261 2 mod 23.\n\n2^13 = 2^12 * 2 \u2261 2 * 2 \u2261 4 mod 23.\n\n2^14 = 2^13 * 2 \u2261 4 * 2 \u2261 8 mod 23.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems consistent with the earlier pattern.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the remainder is 8.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
