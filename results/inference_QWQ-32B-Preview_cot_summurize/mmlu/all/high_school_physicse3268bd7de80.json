                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an electron moving into a magnetic field, and I need to figure out how it's going to move in that field. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's an electron that's moving upwards into a region with a uniform magnetic field. The magnetic field is directed into the plane of the page. The electron has a mass m and a charge of -e, and it's moving with a speed v.\n\nI remember that when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. This force is given by the Lorentz force law:\n\nF = q (v \u00d7 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- F is the force on the particle,\n\n- q is the charge of the particle,\n\n- v is the velocity vector,\n\n- B is the magnetic field vector.\n\nSince the electron has a negative charge, I need to be careful with the direction of the force.\n\nGiven that the velocity is upwards and the magnetic field is into the page, I can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the force. But because the electron is negatively charged, the force will be in the opposite direction to what the right-hand rule gives.\n\nLet me apply the right-hand rule:\n\nPoint my index finger in the direction of the velocity (upwards),\n\nPoint my middle finger in the direction of the magnetic field (into the page),\n\nThen my thumb points in the direction of v \u00d7 B.\n\nSo, if velocity is up and magnetic field is into the page, then v \u00d7 B should be to the right (according to the right-hand rule).\n\nBut since the electron is negatively charged, the force will be in the opposite direction, which is to the left.\n\nSo, the force is to the left.\n\nNow, since the force is always perpendicular to the velocity and the magnetic field, and it's constantly changing the direction of the velocity, the electron should move in a circular path.\n\nNext, I need to figure out the direction of this circular motion: is it clockwise or counterclockwise?\n\nGiven that the force is to the left, and the velocity is upwards, the electron will start curving to the left. If I imagine looking at the page, that would correspond to a clockwise rotation.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the force is to the left, and the velocity is upwards, the electron will start moving in a circular path clockwise.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, for the radius of the circular path.\n\nI recall that in uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is given by:\n\nF_centripetal = m v^2 / r\n\nWhere:\n\n- m is the mass,\n\n- v is the speed,\n\n- r is the radius of the circular path.\n\nIn this case, the magnetic force provides the centripetal force, so:\n\nF_magnetic = F_centripetal\n\nSo,\n\n|q| v B = m v^2 / r\n\nWait, no. The magnitude of the magnetic force is |q| v B sin(theta), but since v and B are perpendicular, sin(theta) = 1, so it's |q| v B.\n\nBut the electron has a negative charge, so I should use -e instead of q.\n\nSo,\n\nF_magnetic = -e v B (direction determined earlier)\n\nAnd F_centripetal = m v^2 / r (towards the center of the circle)\n\nSince the magnetic force is providing the centripetal force, their magnitudes are equal:\n\n|-e| v B = m v^2 / r\n\nSo,\n\ne v B = m v^2 / r\n\nNow, solve for r:\n\nr = m v / (e B)\n\nAlright, so the radius of the path is m v / (e B).\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Clockwise rotation; radius of path = m v / (e B)\n\nB. Counterclockwise rotation; radius of path = m v / (e B)\n\nC. Clockwise rotation; radius of path = e B / (m v)\n\nD. Counterclockwise rotation; radius of path = e B / (m v)\n\nI think it's A: clockwise rotation with radius m v / (e B).\n\nWait a minute, but in my earlier thinking, the force is to the left, which would make it clockwise.\n\nBut let me double-check the direction of the force.\n\nUsing the formula F = q (v \u00d7 B), and q = -e.\n\nSo, F = -e (v \u00d7 B)\n\nUsing the right-hand rule for v \u00d7 B: v is up, B is into the page, so v \u00d7 B is to the right.\n\nThen, F = -e (to the right) = to the left.\n\nSo, force to the left, which would make the electron move in a clockwise circle.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnd the radius is m v / (e B), which matches option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the direction again.\n\nIf the electron is moving upwards and feels a force to the left, it will start curving to the left, which is clockwise.\n\nIf it were a positive charge moving upwards with the same magnetic field, it would feel a force to the right (using F = q v B, with q positive), and thus move in a counterclockwise circle.\n\nBut since it's an electron with negative charge, the force is in the opposite direction, leading to clockwise motion.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should make sure that the radius formula is correct.\n\nStarting from F_magnetic = F_centripetal,\n\n|-e| v B = m v^2 / r,\n\nSo r = m v / (e B),\n\nYes, that matches what I have.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people write it as r = m v / (|q| B), but since q = -e, |q| = e.\n\nSo, r = m v / (e B) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A: clockwise rotation; radius of path = m v / (e B).\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any effect due to gravity or anything else? The problem says it's moving in the plane of the page into a uniform magnetic field, so I think magnetic force is the only one acting here.\n\nAlso, the electron's mass and charge are given, and the magnetic field is uniform, so no additional complications.\n\nHence, I think A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
