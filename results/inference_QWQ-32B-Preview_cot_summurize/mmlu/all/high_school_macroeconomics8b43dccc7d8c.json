                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. We've got a table showing labor hours needed to produce a unit of wine and cheese in two countries: France and Belgium. The options are giving us statements about absolute and comparative advantages, and suggesting who should specialize in what. I need to figure out which of these statements is true based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I should understand what absolute and comparative advantages mean.\n\nAbsolute advantage refers to the ability of a country to produce more of a good or service using the same amount of resources compared to another country. In this case, it's about which country can produce a unit of wine or cheese with fewer labor hours.\n\nComparative advantage, on the other hand, is about opportunity cost. It's about which country can produce a particular good at a lower opportunity cost compared to the other country. This determines who should specialize in what for mutual benefit.\n\nSo, let's look at the data:\n\n- France:\n\n  - Wine: 40 hours\n\n  - Cheese: 80 hours\n\n- Belgium:\n\n  - Wine: 15 hours\n\n  - Cheese: 60 hours\n\nOption A says: \"France has the absolute advantage in both products.\"\n\nTo check this, I need to see which country has fewer labor hours for each product.\n\nFor wine:\n\n- France: 40 hours\n\n- Belgium: 15 hours\n\nBelgium has fewer hours, so Belgium has the absolute advantage in wine.\n\nFor cheese:\n\n- France: 80 hours\n\n- Belgium: 60 hours\n\nBelgium again has fewer hours, so Belgium has the absolute advantage in cheese.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect because France does not have the absolute advantage in both products.\n\nOption B: \"France should specialize in and export wine while Belgium should specialize in and export cheese.\"\n\nThis seems to suggest a specific specialization based on comparative advantage. But based on absolute advantage, Belgium is better at both. However, specialization is generally based on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage. So, I need to calculate the comparative advantages.\n\nFirst, let's find the opportunity cost for each country.\n\nOpportunity cost is what a country gives up to produce one more unit of a good. It's the ratio of the labor hours required for one good to the labor hours required for the other good.\n\nFor France:\n\n- Opportunity cost of producing one unit of wine = labor hours for cheese / labor hours for wine = 80 / 40 = 2 units of cheese\n\n- Opportunity cost of producing one unit of cheese = labor hours for wine / labor hours for cheese = 40 / 80 = 0.5 units of wine\n\nFor Belgium:\n\n- Opportunity cost of producing one unit of wine = labor hours for cheese / labor hours for wine = 60 / 15 = 4 units of cheese\n\n- Opportunity cost of producing one unit of cheese = labor hours for wine / labor hours for cheese = 15 / 60 = 0.25 units of wine\n\nNow, comparative advantage is about having a lower opportunity cost.\n\nFor wine:\n\n- France's opportunity cost: 2 units of cheese\n\n- Belgium's opportunity cost: 4 units of cheese\n\nFrance has a lower opportunity cost in producing wine, so France has a comparative advantage in wine.\n\nFor cheese:\n\n- France's opportunity cost: 0.5 units of wine\n\n- Belgium's opportunity cost: 0.25 units of wine\n\nBelgium has a lower opportunity cost in producing cheese, so Belgium has a comparative advantage in cheese.\n\nTherefore, based on comparative advantage, France should specialize in wine, and Belgium should specialize in cheese. So, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption C: \"France has the comparative advantage in cheese.\"\n\nFrom the calculations above, Belgium has a lower opportunity cost in cheese (0.25 units of wine) compared to France (0.5 units of wine). Therefore, France does not have a comparative advantage in cheese. So, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"France has the absolute advantage in cheese.\"\n\nAs we saw earlier, Belgium has fewer labor hours for cheese (60 hours) compared to France (80 hours), so Belgium has the absolute advantage in cheese. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct statement is option B: \"France should specialize in and export wine while Belgium should specialize in and export cheese.\"\n\nThis makes sense because each country is specializing in the product where it has a comparative advantage, which leads to efficient allocation of resources and potential gains from trade.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
