Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\n\"A bulletin board can be covered completely by 30 square pieces of paper without any gaps or overlaps. If each piece of paper has side lengths of 1 foot, what is the total area of the bulletin board?\n\nA. 1 foot\nB. 30 feet\nC. 1 square foot\nD. 30 square feet\"\n\nOkay, so the bulletin board is covered by 30 square pieces of paper, each with side lengths of 1 foot. The question is asking for the total area of the bulletin board.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what area means. Area is the amount of space inside a two-dimensional shape, and it's measured in square units, like square feet, square meters, etc.\n\nEach piece of paper is a square with side lengths of 1 foot. So, the area of one piece of paper is 1 foot times 1 foot, which is 1 square foot.\n\nNow, there are 30 such pieces covering the bulletin board without any gaps or overlaps. That means the total area of the bulletin board should be the area of one piece of paper multiplied by the number of pieces.\n\nSo, total area = area of one piece \u00d7 number of pieces\n                = 1 square foot \u00d7 30\n                = 30 square feet\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 30 square feet, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here. The problem says \"covered completely by 30 square pieces of paper without any gaps or overlaps.\" That sounds straightforward. Each piece is 1 foot by 1 foot, so area of each is 1 square foot. Thirty pieces would be 30 square feet.\n\nOption A is 1 foot, which is just a length, not an area. Option B is 30 feet, which is also a length. Option C is 1 square foot, which is too small because it's only the area of one piece, not all 30. Option D is 30 square feet, which makes sense.\n\nI think the answer is D. 30 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
