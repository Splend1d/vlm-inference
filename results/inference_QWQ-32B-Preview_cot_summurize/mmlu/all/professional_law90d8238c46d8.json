                    "text": "A farmer owned a 40-acre tract of farmland located in a small southern town. The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:\"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. \" The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?\n\nA. The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.\nB. The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.\nC. The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.\nD. The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the best defense the farmer can use against the tenant's suit for specific performance. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says the option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule. The parol evidence rule generally prevents parties from introducing evidence outside the written contract to change its terms, but it doesn't make the contract unenforceable. So, this might not be the strongest defense.\n\nOption B suggests that the farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract. But in the lease, there's a separate option for the tenant to purchase 10 acres at the end of the lease. The survey was an oral promise before the lease was executed, which might not be directly linked to the written option. So, this could be a bit tricky.\n\nOption C states that the description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought. The option is to purchase \"10 acres of the tract,\" which seems fairly specific, but maybe the lack of a survey makes it indefinite. I need to think about that.\n\nOption D says the option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration. In contract law, options usually require consideration to keep them open. Here, the option is part of the lease, and the tenant is paying rent. Maybe the rent serves as consideration for the option.\n\nLet me consider this step by step.\n\nFirst, the lease has a provision allowing the tenant to purchase 10 acres at the end of the lease for $150,000. This is a standard option clause.\n\nSecond, before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised to have the 10-acre tract surveyed. This seems like an additional promise separate from the lease terms.\n\nNow, the tenant wants to exercise the option, but the farmer refuses and says he never had the tract surveyed.\n\nIf the tenant sues for specific performance, the farmer needs a good defense to avoid being forced to sell the property.\n\nOption A about the parol evidence rule doesn't seem directly applicable because the option is in writing, and the parol evidence rule typically deals with prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict written terms.\n\nOption B suggests that the farmer's failure to survey excused him from the option. But the survey was an oral promise separate from the written option. Unless the survey was a condition precedent to the option, the farmer's failure might not excuse him from the option.\n\nOption C mentions that the description is too indefinite. The option is to buy \"10 acres of the tract.\" The tract is 40 acres, so 10 acres is a quarter of it. But without a survey, it might be unclear which 10 acres are being referred to. If the boundaries are not specified, that could make the description indefinite, making it hard to enforce specific performance.\n\nOption D suggests that the option lacks consideration. In contract law, options usually require consideration to keep them open. Here, the tenant is paying rent, which could be considered sufficient consideration for the option. So, this might not hold up as a defense.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems like the farmer's best defense. If the description of the property is too indefinite, the court might refuse to enforce specific performance because it's unclear what exactly is being purchased.\n\nAdditionally, the tenant built an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property without the farmer's knowledge. This could potentially be seen as an improvement to the property, but since it was done without the farmer's consent, it might not affect the option agreement directly.\n\nIn conclusion, the farmer's best defense is likely that the description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
