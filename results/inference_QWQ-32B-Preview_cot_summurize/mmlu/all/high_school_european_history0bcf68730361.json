                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A. Freeman, British historian and politician, The Chief Periods of European History, 1885\nAccording to the author, Italy's connections to its history and traditions were most \"fully snapped\" when\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage by Edward A. Freeman. He's talking about the unification of Italy and how it affected the historical and traditional ties of the region, particularly regarding Rome and Sicily.\n\nFirst, he mentions that the unification of Italy was something to rejoice, but he has some reservations about how quickly and thoroughly it was done. He specifically points out that making Sicily just seven provinces of the mainland kingdom might be going too far, as it erases the independent identity and even the name of Sicily to some extent. This suggests that he values the distinct identities of different regions within Italy.\n\nThen, he talks about another aspect of Italian unity that he sees as a significant change: the liberation of Rome and its establishment as the capital of Italy. He describes this as the \"greatest novelty in European history\" because Rome, which had a universal (\u0153cumenical) position and traditions, is now the head of a local Italian kingdom. He seems to have mixed feelings about this development. On one hand, he acknowledges that it's something to rejoice in, but on the other hand, there's a sense of sadness because it marks the end of a particular phase in European history.\n\nFreeman emphasizes that Rome, by becoming the willing head of the Italian kingdom, has formally cast aside its imperial traditions. This seems to be the main point where he sees the \"ties with the past\" being \"fully snapped.\" He contrasts this with a situation where brute force made Rome the head of a French department, implying that even under forced circumstances, Rome's imperial traditions were not entirely abandoned.\n\nNow, to answer the question: According to the author, Italy's connections to its history and traditions were most \"fully snapped\" when...\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Sicily ceased to be an independent kingdom.\n\nB. Italians liberated Rome.\n\nC. Rome became the head of a French department.\n\nD. French troops abandoned Rome to fight in the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nFrom the passage, it's clear that Freeman sees the liberation of Rome and its establishment as the capital of Italy as the point where connections to history and traditions were most fully snapped. Option B seems to align with this.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the other options to ensure we're not missing something.\n\nOption A mentions Sicily ceasing to be an independent kingdom. While Freeman does express some regret over this, calling it perhaps too speedy and thorough, he doesn't present it as the point where ties to the past were fully snapped. Instead, he uses stronger language when discussing Rome's transformation.\n\nOption C mentions Rome becoming the head of a French department. Freeman refers to this as a situation where brute force made Rome part of France, but even then, Rome's imperial traditions were not cast aside in the same way as when it became the capital of Italy.\n\nOption D about French troops abandoning Rome to fight in the Franco-Prussian War isn't directly mentioned in the passage, so it's less relevant to Freeman's argument here.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Italians liberated Rome. This is the event that Freeman sees as marking the full snapping of Italy's connections to its history and traditions, particularly regarding Rome's universal role and imperial traditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
