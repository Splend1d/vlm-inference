                    "text": "All of the options you've listed\u2014new antivirals, humanized monoclonal antibodies, hygiene and social distancing, and new vaccines\u2014play crucial roles in restricting the spread of filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg viruses. However, if I had to choose the most comprehensive approach, I would say that a combination of these methods is necessary for effective control.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. **New antivirals**: Antiviral drugs are medications that treat viral infections. For filoviruses, antivirals can help manage the disease in infected individuals, potentially reducing the severity and duration of illness. This, in turn, could limit the amount of virus shed and thus reduce transmission. However, antivirals alone may not be sufficient to control an outbreak, as they do not prevent infection in the first place.\n\nB. **New humanized monoclonal antibodies**: Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made molecules designed to mimic the immune system's ability to fight off harmful antigens, such as viruses. Humanized monoclonal antibodies specific to filoviruses can be used for both treatment and prevention. They can provide passive immunity to exposed individuals, helping to prevent or mitigate infection. Like antivirals, they are more of a treatment option and may not fully prevent the spread without combined use with other strategies.\n\nC. **Hygiene and social distancing**: These are fundamental public health measures that can significantly reduce the transmission of many infectious diseases, including filoviruses. Filoviruses are primarily transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids from infected individuals, contaminated surfaces, or infected animals. Practicing good hygiene, such as regular handwashing, avoiding contact with infected materials, and implementing social distancing measures, can help break the chain of transmission. These practices are especially important in settings where medical resources are limited.\n\nD. **New vaccines**: Vaccines are one of the most effective tools for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. For filoviruses, vaccines can provide active immunity to individuals, protecting them from infection. Vaccination campaigns can be targeted at high-risk populations, such as healthcare workers and individuals in outbreak regions, to create a barrier against the virus's spread. The development and deployment of effective vaccines have the potential to markedly reduce the impact of filovirus outbreaks.\n\nIn conclusion, while all these options are important, a multi-faceted approach that includes vaccination, antiviral treatments, the use of monoclonal antibodies, and robust public health practices like hygiene and social distancing, would be the most effective way to restrict the spread of filoviruses. Each method has its strengths and plays a unique role in controlling outbreaks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
