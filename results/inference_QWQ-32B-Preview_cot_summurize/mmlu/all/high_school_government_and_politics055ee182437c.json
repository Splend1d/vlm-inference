                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these options is an example of devolution. I know that devolution is when power or authority is transferred from a central government to lower levels, like states or local governments. So, I need to see which option shows that kind of transfer.\n\nOption A says: \"Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets.\" Hmm, this seems like the federal government is setting the overall goal, but giving states the flexibility to decide how to achieve it. That sounds like devolution because the states have more say in how to implement the policy.\n\nOption B is: \"A 'race to the bottom' in which states compete with one another to have the fewest environmental regulations.\" This seems more like states are lowering their standards independently, maybe to attract business. It's not necessarily about devolution; it's more about inter-state competition.\n\nOption C: \"A state that legalizes marijuana possession in conflict with federal law.\" This is about a state making its own law that contradicts federal law. It's related to states' rights, but I'm not sure if it's devolution. Devolution is more about the central government intentionally giving power to the states, not about states acting against federal law.\n\nOption D: \"A state being prevented from implementing a fuel efficiency standard that is more stringent than that set by the federal government.\" This seems like the federal government is overriding the state's authority, which is the opposite of devolution.\n\nSo, between these options, I think Option A is the best example of devolution because it shows the federal government setting a standard but allowing states to decide how to meet it. That seems like a transfer of authority to the states.\n\nBut wait, I remember that devolution can also involve the central government giving more power to regional governments. So, maybe Option C could be considered devolution if the federal government is allowing states to make their own laws about marijuana. But in this case, the state is acting in conflict with federal law, which might not be a planned devolution.\n\nOption B doesn't seem directly related to devolution; it's more about states competing with each other.\n\nOption D is clearly the federal government asserting its authority over the states, which is the opposite of devolution.\n\nTherefore, I still think Option A is the best answer. It shows a deliberate transfer of authority from the federal government to the states to implement policies within a federal framework.\n\nMaybe I should look up the definition of devolution to make sure I have it right. Devolution is the transfer of power or authority from a central government to local or regional governments. It's different from delegation because it's a permanent transfer, and it's different from federalism because federalism is a system where power is divided between central and regional governments.\n\nIn Option A, the federal government is setting the overall policy goal but delegating the implementation to the states. If this is a permanent arrangement, it could be considered devolution.\n\nOption C might be seen as devolution if the federal government is intentionally allowing states to set their own policies on marijuana, even if they conflict with federal law. But in reality, the relationship between federal and state laws on marijuana is complex, and it's not entirely clear if this is a case of devolution.\n\nGiven that, I think Option A is the most straightforward example of devolution among the choices provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
