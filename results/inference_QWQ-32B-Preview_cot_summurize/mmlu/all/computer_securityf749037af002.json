                    "text": "SQL injection is a common web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally occurs when user input is incorrectly inserted into a SQL query. To prevent SQL injection, the best practice is to use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This approach ensures that user input is treated as data and not as part of the SQL command.\n\nOption A, \"Escape queries,\" can be a part of preventing SQL injection, but it's not the most reliable method. Escaping special characters in user input can help, but it's error-prone and not as effective as using parameterized queries.\n\nOption B, \"Interrupt requests,\" is not a standard method for preventing SQL injection. Interrupting requests could be part of a broader security strategy, but it doesn't directly address the vulnerability.\n\nOption C, \"Merge tables,\" is unrelated to preventing SQL injection. Merging tables is a database operation used for combining data from different tables, not for securing against injections.\n\nOption D, \"All of the above,\" is incorrect because not all the options are effective methods for preventing SQL injection.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is not explicitly listed, but the closest correct approach is in option A, provided that \"Escape queries\" is understood to mean properly escaping user input, though parameterized queries are preferable. However, in a multiple-choice format, if only these options are provided, the question might be considered flawed because none of the options perfectly captures the best practice for preventing SQL injection.\n\nIn summary, to prevent SQL injection, use parameterized queries or prepared statements, and ensure that your application follows best security practices."
