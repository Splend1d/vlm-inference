Hmm, it seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can simplify it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the expression means.\n\nWe have `a[i] == max`, which checks if the element at index `i` in array `a` is equal to the variable `max`.\n\nThen there's `max != a[i]`, which is the opposite: it checks if `max` is not equal to `a[i]`.\n\nThe expression has `!(max != a[i])`, which is the negation of `max != a[i]`. So, if `max != a[i]` is true, then `!(max != a[i])` is false, and vice versa.\n\nWait a minute, `!(max != a[i])` is the same as `max == a[i]`, because negating \"not equal\" gives \"equal\".\n\nSo, `!(max != a[i])` is equivalent to `a[i] == max`.\n\nNow, the original expression is `a[i] == max || !(max != a[i])`.\n\nSubstituting the equivalent expression, it becomes `a[i] == max || a[i] == max`.\n\nWell, that's the same as `a[i] == max`.\n\nBecause in boolean logic, `A || A` is just `A`.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to `a[i] == max`.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. `a[i] == max`\n\nB. `a[i] != max`\n\nC. `a[i] < max || a[i] > max`\n\nD. `FALSE`\n\nIt seems that option A is the correct simplification.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any case where `a[i] == max || !(max != a[i])` would be true when `a[i] == max` is false?\n\nIf `a[i] != max`, then `a[i] == max` is false.\n\nThen, `!(max != a[i])` is `!(true)`, which is false.\n\nSo, `false || false` is false.\n\nTherefore, the expression is only true when `a[i] == max`, which matches option A.\n\nOption C is `a[i] < max || a[i] > max`, which is the same as `a[i] != max`.\n\nBut we just saw that the original expression is true only when `a[i] == max`, so option C would be the opposite.\n\nOption D is `FALSE`, which is not correct because there are cases where the expression is true, specifically when `a[i] == max`.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. `a[i] == max`.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
