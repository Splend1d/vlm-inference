                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles, and both piles had an equal number of pins. That means each pile has half of the total pins.\n\nLet's denote the total number of pins John originally had as \\( p \\). Therefore, each pile has \\( \\frac{p}{2} \\) pins.\n\nNext, John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. Let's break that down:\n\nFirst, one-third of one pile is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{p}{2} = \\frac{p}{6} \\).\n\nThen, one-half of that is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{p}{6} = \\frac{p}{12} \\).\n\nSo, John gave his brother \\( \\frac{p}{12} \\) pins.\n\nAfter giving away that amount, John had 66 pins left. That means the original number of pins minus the pins he gave away equals 66.\n\nSo, \\( p - \\frac{p}{12} = 66 \\).\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( p \\).\n\nFirst, find a common denominator for the terms on the left side. The common denominator is 12.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{12p}{12} - \\frac{p}{12} = 66 \\).\n\nCombining the terms gives \\( \\frac{11p}{12} = 66 \\).\n\nNow, to find \\( p \\), multiply both sides by 12 and then divide by 11.\n\n\\( 11p = 66 \\times 12 \\)\n\n\\( 11p = 792 \\)\n\n\\( p = \\frac{792}{11} \\)\n\n\\( p = 72 \\)\n\nSo, John originally had 72 pins.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that.\n\nIf John had 72 pins, each pile would have 36 pins.\n\nOne-third of one pile is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12 \\) pins.\n\nOne-half of that is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\) pins.\n\nSo, John gave his brother 6 pins.\n\nTherefore, the number of pins left is \\( 72 - 6 = 66 \\), which matches the information given.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 72.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 396\n\nB. 72\n\nC. 66\n\nD. 36\n\nThe correct choice is B. 72.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
