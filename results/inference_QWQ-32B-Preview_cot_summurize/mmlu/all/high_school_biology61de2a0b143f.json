                    "text": "I'm trying to understand which option best describes the theory of evolution. Let's look at each choice carefully.\n\nOption A says, \"an educated guess about how species originate.\" Well, in science, an educated guess is often referred to as a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon, but it's not as comprehensive as a theory. So, if the theory of evolution were just an educated guess, that might not fully capture its significance.\n\nOption B states, \"one possible explanation, among several scientific alternatives, about how species have come into existence.\" This seems to suggest that there are multiple scientific theories competing to explain species origin, and evolution is just one of them. But in reality, the theory of evolution by natural selection is the widely accepted scientific explanation for how species originate and diversify. There aren't multiple scientific alternatives that are accepted in the same way.\n\nOption C says, \"an opinion that some scientists hold about how living things change over time.\" This makes it sound like the theory of evolution is just a personal belief held by certain scientists, which isn't accurate. Scientific theories are not opinions; they are well-substantiated explanations based on a broad range of evidence.\n\nOption D is, \"an overarching explanation, supported by much evidence, for how populations change over time.\" This seems promising. The theory of evolution is indeed a comprehensive explanation supported by a vast amount of evidence from various fields such as biology, geology, and genetics. It explains how populations of organisms change over generations.\n\nLet me think about this some more. The theory of evolution is not just about species origin; it's about how populations change over time, leading to the diversity of life we see today. It's supported by empirical evidence and is fundamental to modern biology.\n\nComparing all the options, option D seems to be the most accurate description. It acknowledges that evolution is a broad explanation backed by evidence, focusing on how populations change over time.\n\nI think the best answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
