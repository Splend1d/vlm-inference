I have this question here: \"What disease causes a buildup of fluid pressure in the eyeball and damages the optic nerve at the back of the eye?\" And there are options: A. astigmatism, B. cataract, C. glaucoma, D. retinitis.\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what each of these terms means and which one matches the description given.\n\nStarting with astigmatism, I think that's when the cornea is irregularly shaped, causing blurred vision. It's not really about fluid pressure or damaging the optic nerve.\n\nNext, cataract. I know that cataracts are when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy, which can also cause vision problems, but again, it's not directly related to fluid pressure or the optic nerve.\n\nNow, glaucoma. I've heard of this before, and I think it has something to do with increased pressure in the eye. Yeah, that sounds right. It's supposed to be when there's too much fluid in the eyeball, which increases the pressure and can damage the optic nerve. That seems to match the description in the question.\n\nLastly, retinitis. I'm not as familiar with this term, but I think it has to do with inflammation of the retina. Doesn't seem directly related to fluid pressure or the optic nerve in the way described.\n\nSo, based on what I know, glaucoma seems to be the correct answer here. It's the disease that causes a buildup of fluid pressure in the eyeball, which can then damage the optic nerve at the back of the eye.\n\nI should probably double-check this to make sure I'm not misremembering. Let me think about it again.\n\nAstigmatism is about the shape of the cornea affecting how light focuses on the retina.\n\nCataracts are about the lens becoming cloudy.\n\nGlaucoma is definitely associated with increased intraocular pressure and optic nerve damage.\n\nRetinitis is inflammation of the retina, which is different.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm fairly confident that the answer is C. glaucoma.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
