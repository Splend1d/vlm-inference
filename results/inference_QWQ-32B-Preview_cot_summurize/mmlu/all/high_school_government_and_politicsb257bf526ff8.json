The options are:\n\nA. redrawing congressional district boundaries\n\nB. electing a new state governor\n\nC. evaluating the physical accessibility of polling venues\n\nD. deciding where to construct new elementary schools\n\nI think I remember something about redrawing district boundaries related to the census, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, every ten years, the United States conducts a census to count the population. The data from the census is used for various purposes, one of which is to adjust the boundaries of congressional districts. This process is called redistricting or reapportionment.\n\nSo, option A mentions redrawing congressional district boundaries. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption B is about electing a new state governor. I don't think governors are elected every ten years. From what I know, governors are elected on a regular schedule, usually every four years, but it might vary by state. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C is about evaluating the physical accessibility of polling venues. While ensuring that polling places are accessible is important, I don't recall this being a responsibility that state legislatures undertake every ten years. Maybe this is handled by local election boards or other authorities on an ongoing basis.\n\nOption D is about deciding where to construct new elementary schools. That seems like it would be handled by local school districts or education authorities, not necessarily by state legislatures on a ten-year cycle.\n\nGoing back to option A, redrawing congressional district boundaries makes the most sense in the context of the census, which occurs every ten years. The census data is used to determine the number of representatives each state gets in the House of Representatives and to redraw district boundaries to ensure equal representation.\n\nI recall that the Supreme Court has ruled that district boundaries should be drawn in a way that each district has approximately the same population, a principle known as \"one person, one vote.\" This is to prevent gerrymandering, which is the manipulation of district boundaries for political advantage.\n\nMoreover, state legislatures are typically responsible for drawing these boundaries, although in some states, independent commissions are tasked with this job to reduce political influence.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I believe the correct answer is A. redrawing congressional district boundaries.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider each option again.\n\nOption B: Electing a new state governor every ten years doesn't align with standard electoral practices. Governors are usually elected on a set term basis, not tied to the census schedule.\n\nOption C: Evaluating polling venue accessibility is important for ensuring voter rights, but it's not specifically a task that state legislatures undertake every ten years. This might be part of ongoing election administration.\n\nOption D: Deciding where to construct new elementary schools is typically handled by local school boards or education departments, based on enrollment trends and other factors, not necessarily every ten years.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is A. redrawing congressional district boundaries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
