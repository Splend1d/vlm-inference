It says, \"A sound bite would most likely be used during a presidential election in order to...\" and then it gives four options. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a sound bite is. From what I know, a sound bite is a short clip of audio, usually from a speech or interview, that's edited to highlight a particular point or statement. It's often used in news broadcasts or political advertisements to convey a message quickly.\n\nOkay, so in the context of a presidential election, why would someone use a sound bite? Let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A is \"avoid 'horse race' politics.\" I think \"horse race\" politics refers to focusing on the competition and polls rather than the issues. So, using a sound bite to avoid that might mean using it to discuss policies instead of just who's leading in the polls. But I'm not sure if that's the primary purpose of a sound bite.\n\nOption B is \"provide the audience with a candidate's view in a limited amount of time.\" That makes sense because sound bites are short and concise, perfect for delivering a quick message or opinion. Maybe this is the main reason they're used in elections.\n\nOption C is \"reduce the amount of negative advertising used.\" I don't see a direct connection between using sound bites and reducing negative ads. Sound bites can be used in both positive and negative contexts, so I don't think that's the primary purpose.\n\nOption D is \"ensure a candidate is presented in the best light.\" While sound bites can be edited to make a candidate look good, I think that's a bit too vague. It's more about selecting the right clip to convey a specific message, which might or might not be to present the candidate in the best light.\n\nComparing all the options, option B seems the most straightforward and accurate. Sound bites are used to provide the audience with a candidate's view in a limited amount of time. That aligns with their purpose in media and political communications.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any overlap or if I'm missing something.\n\nOption A, avoiding horse race politics, might be a secondary benefit, but it's not the primary purpose of a sound bite. Option C, reducing negative advertising, doesn't seem directly related. Option D, presenting the candidate in the best light, is more about the editing and selection process rather than the use of sound bites themselves.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option B: to provide the audience with a candidate's view in a limited amount of time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
