                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this genetics question. It's about autosomal recessive disorders and the probability of their children being affected. Both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder. I need to find out what the probability is that each of their children will also be affected. The options are 1 in 4, 1 in 2, 2 in 3, or 1.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what an autosomal recessive disorder is. Autosomal means that the gene responsible for the disorder is located on one of the autosomes, which are chromosomes that are not sex chromosomes. Recessive means that you need two copies of the abnormal gene to express the disorder. So, if someone has one normal gene and one abnormal gene, they are a carrier but do not show symptoms.\n\nNow, both parents are affected, which means they both have two copies of the recessive allele. Let's denote the normal allele as \"A\" and the recessive allele as \"a\". Since both parents are affected, their genotypes are both \"aa\".\n\nWhen they have children, each parent will pass one allele to their offspring. Since both parents only have the \"a\" allele to pass on, all of their children will receive an \"a\" allele from each parent. Therefore, all of their children will have the \"aa\" genotype and will be affected by the disorder.\n\nSo, the probability that each of their children will be affected is 100%, which is equivalent to 1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1 in 4 (which is 25%)\n\nB. 1 in 2 (which is 50%)\n\nC. 2 in 3 (which is approximately 66.67%)\n\nD. 1 (which is 100%)\n\nThe correct answer should be D. 1.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that in autosomal recessive inheritance, if both parents are carriers (heterozygous, Aa), then there's a 25% chance that their child will be affected (aa), 50% chance of being a carrier (Aa), and 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier (AA). But in this case, both parents are affected, meaning they are homozygous recessive (aa), so they can only pass on the \"a\" allele.\n\nLet me double-check this with a Punnett square.\n\nParent 1: aa\n\nParent 2: aa\n\nPossible gametes from each parent: a and a.\n\nSo, the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n|   | a | a |\n\n|---|---|---|\n\n| a | aa | aa |\n\n| a | aa | aa |\n\nAs you can see, all possible offspring are aa, meaning all will be affected.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 100%, or 1.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility of variation. In autosomal recessive disorders, the only way to express the disorder is to have two recessive alleles. Since both parents only have the recessive allele, there's no chance of a child receiving a dominant allele from them.\n\nSo, the answer should indeed be D. 1.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
