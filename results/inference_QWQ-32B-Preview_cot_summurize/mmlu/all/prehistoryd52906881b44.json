                    "text": "I've got this question here: \"Which continent features the earliest evidence of etching into a rock face? A. Europe B. Africa C. Asia D. Australia\" Hmm, etching into rock faces, that sounds like some really old stuff, probably related to early human art or something. I need to think about when and where the earliest known rock art was found.\n\nI remember that rock art is really important in understanding early human behavior and culture. There are different types of rock art, like paintings and engravings. Engravings would be etching into the rock face, right? So, I need to find out where the oldest engravings are found.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Europe - I know that Europe has some famous rock art, like the cave paintings in Lascaux and Chauvet in France, but those are paintings, not engravings. Although, there might be engravings there too, but are they the oldest?\n\nB. Africa - Africa is often considered the cradle of humanity, so maybe the earliest rock art is there. I've heard about rock art in places like South Africa, like the Blombos Cave. I think there are some really old engravings there.\n\nC. Asia - Asia is a big continent, and there's a lot of history there. I know about rock art in places like India and Indonesia, but are there any that date back earlier than those in Africa or Europe?\n\nD. Australia - Australia also has ancient rock art, some of which is quite old, but I'm not sure if it's the oldest in the world.\n\nI think I need to recall specific examples. Let's start with Africa. Blombos Cave in South Africa has some very old engravings. I think there are pieces of ochre with geometric patterns that date back around 70,000 to 100,000 years ago. That sounds pretty ancient.\n\nNow, in Europe, the cave art is spectacular, but it's generally dated to around 30,000 to 40,000 years ago, which is later than the Blombos engravings.\n\nIn Asia, rock art varies, but I don't recall any engravings that old. For example, the Bhimbetka rock shelters in India have paintings that are up to 30,000 years old, but again, that's later than the African engravings.\n\nAustralia's rock art is also old, with some sites dating back around 28,000 years, but again, that's younger than the African examples.\n\nWait a minute, is there any rock art in Africa older than the Blombos engravings? Maybe in other parts of Africa? I think in Namibia, there are some engravings that might be even older, but I'm not sure about the exact dates.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether there are any engravings from the Middle Stone Age in Africa, as that period is around 250,000 to 30,000 years ago. There might be older engravings out there that I'm not aware of.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are engravings in Africa from even earlier times. For example, there was a discovery in South Africa a few years ago of some cross-hatched engravings on a piece of silcrete that was dated to around 100,000 years ago.\n\nComparing that to other continents, it seems like the African examples are the oldest. Europe has some very early art, like the Neanderthal art, which is pushing back the dates for when non-Homo sapiens were creating art, but in terms of Homo sapiens, Africa still seems to have the earliest evidence.\n\nSo, based on what I know, I would go with Africa as the continent with the earliest evidence of etching into a rock face.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should double-check if there are any other sites in other continents that might have older engravings. For example, in Australia, there was a claim about extremely old rock art, but upon verification, the dates weren't as old as the African sites.\n\nAlso, in Asia, there's the Bhimbetka site, but again, the dates are not as old as those in Africa.\n\nIn Europe, the earliest art is from the Upper Paleolithic, which is still younger than the African examples.\n\nTherefore, it seems safe to conclude that Africa is the continent with the earliest evidence of etching into a rock face.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
