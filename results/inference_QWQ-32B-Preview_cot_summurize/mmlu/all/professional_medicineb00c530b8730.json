                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this 10-year-old girl who's been brought to the office because the school nurse thinks she might have Marfan syndrome. She's really tall\u201495th percentile for height\u2014but pretty slim, only 25th percentile for weight. During the physical exam, they notice she has a narrow palate with crowded teeth, long slender arms and legs, and her joints are pretty flexible.\n\nThey did some molecular testing on a gene called FBN1, which is associated with Marfan syndrome, and they found a single nucleotide difference. But here's the thing: this difference doesn't change the amino acid at that position in the protein. So, it's a silent mutation, basically.\n\nHer mom is also tall\u20145 ft 4 in\u2014and doesn't have any clinical signs of Marfan syndrome, but she has the same single nucleotide change as the daughter. And interestingly, this same nucleotide change was found in 15 out of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome.\n\nSo, the question is: what does this single nucleotide change represent in both the patient and her mother?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother.\n\nB. It is a polymorphism.\n\nC. It is a sequence variant of unknown significance.\n\nD. It will change the folding of the protein.\n\nFirst, Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue. It's often characterized by being tall and slender, with long arms and legs, joint hypermobility, and specific eye and heart issues. The gene involved is FBN1, which codes for fibrillin-1, a protein important for connective tissue structure.\n\nIn this case, the daughter has features suggestive of Marfan syndrome, like being tall and slim, having a narrow palate with dental crowding, and joint laxity. However, her mom doesn't have clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome, despite having the same genetic change.\n\nThe molecular testing found a single nucleotide difference in FBN1, but it doesn't change the amino acid. So, it's a synonymous mutation, meaning the protein sequence remains the same.\n\nNow, option A suggests it's a disease-causing mutation in both. But if it's present in the mom who doesn't have the disease, that doesn't make sense. Unless it's incompletely penetrant, but that seems less likely because the mom is asymptomatic.\n\nOption B is that it's a polymorphism. Polymorphisms are common genetic variations that don't necessarily cause disease. They're often silent mutations or ones that don't affect protein function.\n\nGiven that this nucleotide change is found in 15 out of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome, it seems fairly common in the general population. Since it doesn't change the amino acid and is present in healthy individuals, it's possible that it's just a benign polymorphism.\n\nOption C is that it's a sequence variant of unknown significance. This is a category for variations where it's not clear whether they cause disease or are just harmless variations. Given that it's found in both affected and unaffected individuals, and it's a synonymous mutation, it might fall into this category, but perhaps there's enough information to lean towards it being a polymorphism.\n\nOption D suggests that it will change the folding of the protein. But since it's a synonymous mutation\u2014meaning the amino acid sequence doesn't change\u2014it shouldn't directly affect the protein's structure. Protein folding is determined by the amino acid sequence, so if that doesn't change, the folding should remain the same.\n\nConsidering all this, option B, it is a polymorphism, seems the most appropriate. It's a common genetic variation that doesn't appear to cause disease, as evidenced by its presence in multiple individuals without Marfan syndrome and in the asymptomatic mother.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that sometimes synonymous mutations can have indirect effects on gene expression or protein function, but based on the information provided, there's no evidence of that here.\n\nSo, the best answer is B. It is a polymorphism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
