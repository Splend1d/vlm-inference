Let me read the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, there's a lawyer who owned a 70-acre tract of land. In 1989, he sold 15 acres to a friend. The deed had a special clause that says: if the lawyer wants to sell any part of the remaining 55 acres during the friend's lifetime, the friend has the right of first refusal to buy it on the same terms as anyone else offering to buy it. And vice versa, if the friend wants to sell any part of the 15 acres during the lawyer's lifetime, the lawyer has the right of first refusal to buy it on the same terms.\n\nThen, the friend was approached by a co-worker who offered to buy his 15 acres for $100,000. The friend didn't give the lawyer a chance to exercise his right of first refusal; he just sold it to the co-worker. After the co-worker took possession, the lawyer found out about the sale and sued both the friend and the co-worker to enforce his right of first refusal.\n\nThe question is asking which of the four options is correct based on the facts provided.\n\nOption A: The lawyer will win because the friend has a reciprocal right of first refusal.\n\nOption B: The lawyer will win because his right of first refusal doesn't violate the Rule against Perpetuities since it's limited to his lifetime.\n\nOption C: The lawyer will lose because the rights of first refusal are unreasonable restraints on alienation.\n\nOption D: The lawyer will lose because the rights of first refusal relate only to land that is not conveyed by deed.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a right of first refusal is. It's a contractual right that gives one party the opportunity to buy property before it's offered to anyone else, usually on the same terms and conditions as any third-party offer.\n\nIn this case, there's a reciprocal right of first refusal: the friend has a right of first refusal on the lawyer's remaining land, and the lawyer has a right of first refusal on the friend's land.\n\nThe friend sold his 15 acres to a co-worker without giving the lawyer the chance to exercise his right of first refusal. So, the lawyer is suing to enforce that right.\n\nNow, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says the lawyer will win because the friend has a reciprocal right of first refusal. I'm not sure if the reciprocal right has any bearing on whether the lawyer's right is enforceable. It seems like the reciprocal right is just part of the agreement, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the lawyer's right is enforceable in this situation. So, I'm not convinced by this option.\n\nOption B mentions the Rule against Perpetuities. I know that the Rule against Perpetuities is a legal rule that invalidates interests in property that are too remote or uncertain in their vesting. It's designed to prevent land from being tied up indefinitely.\n\nIn this case, the right of first refusal is limited to the lawyer's lifetime. Since lives in being (the lawyer's life) are used to measure the duration, and it's limited to his lifetime, it might satisfy the Rule against Perpetuities. But I'm not sure if this is directly relevant to whether the lawyer can enforce his right of first refusal in this specific instance.\n\nOption C talks about unreasonable restraints on alienation. A restraint on alienation is a restriction on the owner's ability to sell or transfer their property. Some restraints are enforceable, while others are not, depending on whether they unduly restrict the owner's rights.\n\nIn this case, the right of first refusal is a type of restraint on alienation because it gives the lawyer the right to match any offer for the friend's land. But rights of first refusal are generally considered reasonable restraints because they don't prevent the owner from selling; they just give someone else the first chance to match the offer.\n\nSo, it's unlikely that the court would consider this an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\n\nOption D says the lawyer will lose because the rights of first refusal relate only to land that is not conveyed by deed. But in this case, the 15 acres were conveyed by deed to the friend, and the right of first refusal was included in that deed. So, this option doesn't make sense because the right of first refusal is part of the deed.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the issue is whether the right of first refusal is enforceable against third parties, like the co-worker who bought the land from the friend.\n\nIn general, a right of first refusal is enforceable against the party who agreed to it, but not necessarily against third parties who buy the property without notice of the right.\n\nIn this case, the lawyer is suing both the friend and the co-worker. Against the friend, who is a party to the deed and thus bound by the right of first refusal, it seems like the lawyer should be able to enforce it.\n\nBut against the co-worker, who may or may not have known about the right of first refusal, it's less clear.\n\nHowever, the question is phrased in terms of the lawyer enforcing his right of first refusal in the deed, and it's asking for a general outcome based on the facts.\n\nGiven that, I think the key is whether the right of first refusal is enforceable against the friend, who is bound by the deed.\n\nSince the friend sold the land without giving the lawyer the opportunity to match the offer, it seems like the lawyer should be able to enforce his right of first refusal.\n\nBut let's look back at the options.\n\nOption A doesn't seem directly relevant.\n\nOption B might be a red herring, as while the Right against Perpetuities is important in property law, it may not be directly pertinent here.\n\nOption C is unlikely because rights of first refusal are generally considered reasonable.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the right is in the deed.\n\nPerhaps the answer is not immediately obvious, and I need to consider more angles.\n\nWait a minute. Maybe the issue is the reciprocal nature of the right. Since both parties have a right of first refusal, perhaps that makes the agreement more enforceable.\n\nBut I don't think that's the determining factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a question of whether the right of first refusal was properly invoked. Did the friend give the lawyer proper notice of the offer?\n\nThe fact pattern says that the friend did not afford the lawyer an opportunity to exercise his right of first refusal. That suggests that the friend didn't give proper notice or allow the lawyer to match the offer.\n\nIn that case, it seems like the lawyer should be able to enforce the right of first refusal against the friend.\n\nTherefore, the lawyer should win the lawsuit.\n\nLooking back at the options, Option A says the lawyer will win because the friend has a reciprocal right of first refusal.\n\nBut I don't think the reciprocal right is the reason the lawyer wins; it's because the friend breached the right of first refusal in the deed.\n\nOption B mentions the Rule against Perpetuities, which might be a reason why the right of first refusal is enforceable, but it's not directly related to the friend's failure to honor the right.\n\nOption C suggests that the rights are unreasonable restraints on alienation, which is unlikely.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the right is in the deed.\n\nTherefore, none of the options seem to correctly state why the lawyer would win.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lawyer cannot enforce the right of first refusal because the friend already sold the land to the co-worker, and the co-worker is a bona fide purchaser without notice.\n\nBut that doesn't align with my initial thoughts.\n\nLet me consider the legal principles again.\n\nA right of first refusal gives the holder the right to match an offer from a third party before the owner can sell to that third party.\n\nIn this case, the friend received an offer from the co-worker to buy the 15 acres for $100,000.\n\nBefore selling to the co-worker, the friend was obligated to notify the lawyer of the offer and give him the opportunity to match it.\n\nThe friend did not do that; he sold directly to the co-worker.\n\nTherefore, the friend breached the right of first refusal in the deed.\n\nAs a result, the lawyer should be able to enforce the right against the friend, possibly seeking specific performance or damages.\n\nAs for the co-worker, it's less clear. If the co-worker bought the property without knowledge of the right of first refusal, they might be a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, and thus protected.\n\nBut the question is about enforcing the right in the deed, and it mentions suing both the friend and the co-worker.\n\nGiven that, I think the lawyer's main claim is against the friend for breaching the right of first refusal.\n\nTherefore, the lawyer should win the lawsuit against the friend.\n\nLooking back at the options, Option A is incorrect because the reciprocal right isn't the reason for winning.\n\nOption B might be partially correct in that the right of first refusal doesn't violate the Rule against Perpetuities, but that's not directly related to enforcing the right in this situation.\n\nOption C is unlikely because rights of first refusal are generally reasonable.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the right is in the deed.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is Option B, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is not provided, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is the duration of the right of first refusal.\n\nThe right is limited to the lawyer's lifetime, which is a condition that might make it enforceable under the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure if that's directly relevant to enforcing the right in this particular scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the right of first refusal is unenforceable because it's a restraint on alienation.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, rights of first refusal are generally considered reasonable restraints.\n\nGiven that, I think the lawyer should win the lawsuit because the friend breached the right of first refusal by selling to the co-worker without giving the lawyer the opportunity to match the offer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that the lawyer will win, but the only option that says that is Option B, which adds the reason about the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nPerhaps Option B is the correct answer, even though I'm not entirely sure if that's the primary reason.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether the right of first refusal violates the Rule against Perpetuities, and since it's limited to the lawyer's lifetime, it doesn't, thus the lawyer can enforce it.\n\nIn that case, Option B makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll go with Option B: The lawyer will win, because his right of first refusal does not violate the Rule against Perpetuities because it is limited to his lifetime.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
