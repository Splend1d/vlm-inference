                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"How much does it cost to air condition all American automobiles for a year (as of 2018)?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. $10 million\n\nB. $100 million\n\nC. $1 billion\n\nD. $10 billion\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one of these is closest to the actual cost. I don't have all the exact numbers memorized, so I'll need to make some estimates and assumptions.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many automobiles there are in America. According to the FBI, there were about 276.6 million registered vehicles in the US as of 2018. But not all of these are automobiles; some are trucks, motorcycles, etc. I'd say about 80% of these are passenger cars and light trucks that have air conditioning. So, 276.6 million times 0.8 is roughly 221.3 million vehicles with AC.\n\nNext, I need to estimate how much it costs to run the AC in one vehicle for a year. This will depend on how much people use their AC and the efficiency of the AC system.\n\nLet's assume that on average, people use their AC for half of the year, say 6 months, and they drive about 12,000 miles per year. So, 6,000 miles with AC on.\n\nNow, I need to find out how much extra fuel is consumed when the AC is on. I've heard that AC can reduce fuel economy by about 5-25%, depending on the vehicle and how hot it is outside. Let's assume an average reduction of 10%.\n\nSo, if a car gets, say, 25 miles per gallon without AC, with AC it gets 22.5 mpg.\n\nNow, for 6,000 miles, the extra fuel consumed due to AC is:\n\nWithout AC: 6,000 / 25 = 240 gallons\n\nWith AC: 6,000 / 22.5 = 266.67 gallons\n\nSo, the extra fuel used is 266.67 - 240 = 26.67 gallons per year per vehicle.\n\nNow, what's the cost of gasoline? In 2018, the average gas price was around $2.70 per gallon.\n\nSo, extra cost per vehicle is 26.67 gallons * $2.70 = approximately $72 per vehicle per year.\n\nNow, for 221.3 million vehicles, the total extra cost would be:\n\n221,300,000 * $72 = $15,917,600,000 per year.\n\nWait, that's $15.9 billion per year.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the closest one is D. $10 billion.\n\nHmm, maybe my assumptions are too high. Maybe people don't use AC for that much of the time or the fuel efficiency impact is less.\n\nLet me try with different assumptions.\n\nSuppose people only use AC for 3 months of the year, so 3,000 miles with AC.\n\nAnd the fuel efficiency reduction is only 5%.\n\nSo, without AC: 3,000 / 25 = 120 gallons\n\nWith AC: 3,000 / 23.75 (since 25 - 5% is 23.75 mpg) = approximately 126.32 gallons\n\nExtra fuel: 126.32 - 120 = 6.32 gallons\n\nAt $2.70 per gallon, extra cost is 6.32 * 2.70 = approximately $17 per vehicle per year.\n\nFor 221.3 million vehicles: 221,300,000 * $17 = $3.762 billion per year.\n\nThat's closer to C. $1 billion, but still higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fuel efficiency impact is less. Let's assume 2% reduction in fuel economy due to AC.\n\nSo, without AC: 3,000 / 25 = 120 gallons\n\nWith AC: 3,000 / 24.5 (25 - 2%) = approximately 122.45 gallons\n\nExtra fuel: 122.45 - 120 = 2.45 gallons\n\nAt $2.70 per gallon, extra cost is 2.45 * 2.70 = approximately $6.62 per vehicle per year.\n\nFor 221.3 million vehicles: 221,300,000 * $6.62 = approximately $1.46 billion per year.\n\nStill higher than $1 billion, but closer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of vehicles with AC is less. Perhaps not all vehicles have AC. In older times, some cars didn't have AC, but by 2018, I think most do, especially in hotter states.\n\nAlternatively, maybe people drive less with AC on. I don't know.\n\nAnother approach: maybe look at the energy consumption directly.\n\nI recall that the average AC system in a car might use around 4-5 kW of power when running.\n\nBut wait, cars generate their own electricity, so it's not like they're plugging in to the grid. The AC system draws power from the car's alternator, which is powered by the engine.\n\nSo, the extra fuel consumption is due to the engine having to work harder to generate that extra power.\n\nI think my earlier approach is better.\n\nGiven that, even with conservative estimates, the total cost seems to be in the billions.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. $10 billion seems closest to my estimates, even if it's a bit high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps considering that in homes, air conditioning can cost several hundred dollars per year, but in cars, it's likely less because the AC is used for shorter periods.\n\nBut in cars, the AC is less efficient per unit of cooling compared to home AC units.\n\nAlso, in terms of energy consumption, maybe looking at the total energy used for vehicle AC in the US and then valuing that at the cost of gasoline.\n\nBut I don't have those exact figures memorized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at the overall energy consumption for transportation and trying to estimate what portion is due to AC.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll stick with my initial calculation.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. $10 billion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
