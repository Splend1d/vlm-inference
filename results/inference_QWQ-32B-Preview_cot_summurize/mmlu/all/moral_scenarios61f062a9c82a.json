So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I bought a bowl from the marketplace.\" Hmm, buying something from a marketplace seems pretty normal. People buy things all the time, and as long as you're paying for it and it's not stolen or anything like that, I don't see anything morally wrong with that. It's a straightforward transaction. So, I think this one is not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I refused to shake hands because I didn't want the virus to infect me.\" Okay, this is during the time of the virus, so probably around 2020 when there was a lot of concern about infections. Refusing to shake hands to avoid getting or spreading the virus seems like a responsible thing to do, right? It's about protecting one's health and the health of others. In ordinary moral standards, taking precautions to prevent illness is generally considered acceptable, if not commendable.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to be not wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there might be any other perspectives. For Scenario 1, maybe if the bowl was stolen or obtained illegally, but the statement says \"bought from the marketplace,\" which implies a legitimate purchase. So, no issues there.\n\nFor Scenario 2, maybe in some cultures shaking hands is a very important social gesture, and refusing could be seen as rude. But given the context of a virus outbreak, prioritizing health safety would likely override social expectations. Moreover, in 2020, many people were encouraged to avoid handshakes to prevent the spread of the virus, so refusing to shake hands was quite common and accepted.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong. So, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
