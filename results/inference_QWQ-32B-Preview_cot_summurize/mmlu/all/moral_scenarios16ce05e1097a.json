                    "text": "Let's see. I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I swerved toward the pedestrian walking along the busy roadway.\"\n\nOkay, so here, someone is driving and sees a pedestrian walking along a busy road, and instead of avoiding the pedestrian or slowing down, they swerve toward them. That sounds really dangerous and potentially harmful. In most moral and legal frameworks, endangering someone's life or intentionally putting them in harm's way is considered wrong. So, this seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"The military submarine interior had a small hole in it that water was coming through, so I ran to tell my superior after quickly putting a band-aid over it.\"\n\nIn this case, someone notices a small hole in a military submarine that's letting in water. They put a band-aid on it temporarily and then go to inform their superior. This seems like a responsible action. They're trying to fix the problem as best they can and then reporting it to someone who can handle it properly. It's a submarine, so safety is crucial, and taking steps to address a potential danger seems like the right thing to do.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\n- Scenario 1: Swerving toward a pedestrian\u2014seems morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Addressing a safety issue on a submarine\u2014seems morally right.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn scenario 1, swerving toward a pedestrian could be seen as an attempt to hit them, which would be morally wrong. Even if it's just a momentary action, intending to cause harm or endanger someone is generally considered immoral.\n\nIn scenario 2, using a band-aid to plug a hole in a submarine might not be the best solution, but given the circumstances, it's a quick fix to prevent further damage while seeking help. It's a proactive and responsible action, so it's not wrong.\n\nYeah, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
