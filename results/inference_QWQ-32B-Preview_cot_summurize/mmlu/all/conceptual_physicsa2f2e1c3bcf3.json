I think I remember something about period, but let me make sure.\n\nFirst, what's a pendulum? It's like a weight hanging from a string that swings back and forth. The time it takes to complete one full swing\u2014that's what I need to identify.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Frequency: I think frequency is how many times something happens in a certain period, maybe per second. So, if a pendulum swings back and forth many times in a second, that's its frequency.\n\nB. Period: This sounds familiar. I think the period is the time it takes for one complete cycle of the motion. So, for a pendulum, it would be the time from when it starts swinging to the right and back to the left and back to the starting point.\n\nC. Wavelength: That sounds more like a property of waves, like light or sound waves. I don't think it applies to a pendulum's motion.\n\nD. Amplitude: I think amplitude has to do with the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. For a pendulum, it would be how far it swings away from the center.\n\nSo, based on this, the time it takes for one complete swing should be the period.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If frequency is the number of cycles per second, then period should be the reciprocal of frequency, right? So, period is the time per cycle.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for a pendulum, the period is the time it takes to swing back and forth once.\n\nWavelength, as I thought, is more related to waves, like the distance between two crests in a wave.\n\nAmplitude, for a pendulum, is how far it swings away from the center, usually measured in angles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
