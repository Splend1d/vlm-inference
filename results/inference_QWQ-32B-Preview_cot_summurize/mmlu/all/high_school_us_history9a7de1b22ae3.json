We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the Progressive Party Platform from 1912, and it's asking which regulatory law was passed as a result of Upton Sinclair's book, \"The Jungle.\" The options are the Clayton Antitrust Act, the Hepburn Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act, and the Pure Food and Drug Act. I need to figure out which one connects to \"The Jungle.\"\n\nFirst, I should probably remember what \"The Jungle\" is about. I think it's a novel that exposes the harsh conditions in the meatpacking industry back in the early 1900s. It's known for its detailed descriptions of unsanitary practices and poor working conditions in slaughterhouses. I believe it led to some public outrage and prompted changes in how food was processed and regulated.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The Clayton Antitrust Act - I think this is from 1914 and it's about restricting anticompetitive practices. It's more related to business practices and monopolies, not directly to food safety.\n\nB. The Hepburn Act - This is from 1906, I believe, and it gave more power to the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroads and other transportation. Again, seems more about regulating industries rather than food safety.\n\nC. The Sherman Antitrust Act - This is from 1890, which is before \"The Jungle\" was published in 1906. It's also about antitrust regulations, so probably not directly related to the book.\n\nD. The Pure Food and Drug Act - This is from 1906, the same year \"The Jungle\" was published. It was part of the Progressive Era reforms aimed at ensuring that foods and drugs were safe and properly labeled.\n\nGiven that \"The Jungle\" exposed the unsanitary conditions in meatpacking, it makes sense that it would lead to regulations ensuring the purity and safety of food. So, the Pure Food and Drug Act seems like the most direct result of the book.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there's another act related to meat inspection specifically. I think there was also the Meat Inspection Act of 1906, which was passed around the same time as the Pure Food and Drug Act. Maybe I should consider if that's another possible answer, but it's not listed here.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them are specifically about meat inspection, except perhaps implied through the Pure Food and Drug Act.\n\nLet me see what each act pertains to:\n\n- Clayton Antitrust Act: deals with antitrust laws, aimed at preventing anticompetitive practices that harm consumers.\n\n- Hepburn Act: expands the regulatory power of the ICC over railroads and express companies.\n\n- Sherman Antitrust Act: the first antitrust law, prohibiting monopolistic business practices.\n\n- Pure Food and Drug Act: aims to prevent the manufacture and sale of adulterated or misbranded food and drugs.\n\nGiven that \"The Jungle\" focused on the unsanitary conditions in meatpacking, which directly relates to food safety, the Pure Food and Drug Act seems like the most appropriate answer.\n\nMoreover, I recall that President Theodore Roosevelt commissioned an investigation after \"The Jungle\" was published, which confirmed the horrible conditions Sinclair wrote about. This public outcry likely pressured Congress to pass legislation to improve food safety standards.\n\nSo, even though the Meat Inspection Act is more directly related to meatpacking, it's not listed in the options. The Pure Food and Drug Act is the closest match among the given choices and was indeed passed in the same year as \"The Jungle\" was published, 1906.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. The Pure Food and Drug Act.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
