                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about social constructivism. So, social constructivism is a theory in international relations that focuses on how shared ideas, beliefs, and norms shape state behavior. It's different from realist or liberal theories because it emphasizes the role of ideas and identities over material power or institutions.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options doesn't constitute a fundamental ontological principle of social constructivism. Ontological principles are about what exists and how we understand reality in this theoretical framework.\n\nOption A says: \"Normative or ideational structures are important and matter as much as, if not more than, material structures.\" This is central to social constructivism. Constructivists argue that ideas, norms, and beliefs are crucial in shaping state interests and identities, sometimes even more so than material capabilities like military power or economic resources. So, this seems to be a core principle.\n\nOption B: \"Identities are important.\" Again, this aligns with social constructivism, which places a strong emphasis on how states construct their identities and how these identities influence their actions and interactions. Identities are not given but are shaped through social interactions and shared norms.\n\nOption C: \"Anarchy is an inescapable feature of the international system.\" This statement is more associated with neorealism, particularly Kenneth Waltz's theory in \"Theory of International Politics.\" Neorealists argue that the international system is characterized by anarchy\u2014meaning there's no central authority above states\u2014and this structural condition shapes state behavior in terms of survival and power maximization.\n\nHowever, social constructivists also recognize anarchy as a structural feature but interpret it differently. They argue that anarchy doesn't determine state behavior; instead, it's the norms and ideas that states share that shape how they perceive and act within the anarchic system. So, while anarchy is acknowledged, its impact is mediated by ideational factors.\n\nOption D: \"Agents and structures are mutually constituted.\" This is a key concept in social constructivism, drawing from social theory. It means that actors (agents) and the social structures they operate within influence each other. Agents create and reproduce structures through their actions, and these structures in turn shape the possibilities and constraints for future actions.\n\nGiven this, option C seems to be the one that doesn't directly constitute a fundamental ontological principle of social constructivism. While constructivists do acknowledge anarchy, their focus is more on how norms and ideas shape behavior within that anarchic structure, rather than anarchy being the primary determinant of state behavior.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. Anarchy is an inescapable feature of the international system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
