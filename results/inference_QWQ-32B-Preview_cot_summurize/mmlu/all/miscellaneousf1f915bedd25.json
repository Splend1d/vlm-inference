So, the correct answer is B. a protozoan.\n\nHere's a bit more information about toxoplasmosis:\n\n- Toxoplasma gondii is a single-celled organism that can infect most warm-blooded animals, but it primarily reproduces sexually in cats.\n\n- Humans can become infected by eating undercooked meat containing the parasite, by ingesting oocysts from contaminated water or soil, or by handling cat litter containing infected feces.\n\n- In healthy adults, toxoplasmosis often causes mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. However, in pregnant women, the infection can be transmitted to the fetus and cause serious complications, including miscarriage, stillbirth, or birth defects.\n\n- People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or who are undergoing chemotherapy, are also at higher risk for severe complications from toxoplasmosis.\n\n- Prevention measures include cooking meat thoroughly, washing fruits and vegetables carefully, avoiding contact with cat feces, and practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
