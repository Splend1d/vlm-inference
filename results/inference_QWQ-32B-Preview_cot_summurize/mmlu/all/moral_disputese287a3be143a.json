The options are Immanuel Kant, Aristotle, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill. I need to recall their philosophies and see who among them extended moral consideration to non-human animals.\n\nFirst, let's think about Immanuel Kant. He's known for his deontological ethics, where morality is based on duties and obligations. Kant believed that humans have intrinsic worth because they can make rational decisions, but he didn't extend this moral consideration to animals. For Kant, animals are means to an end, and their treatment is only morally relevant insofar as it affects human morality. So, he probably wouldn't recognize the equal consideration of interests to other species.\n\nNext, Aristotle. He had a hierarchical view of the natural world, where humans are at the top because of our rational capabilities. Aristotle thought that some things exist for the sake of others, and animals were for the benefit of humans. He didn't advocate for equal consideration of interests across species. So, it's unlikely that Aristotle recognized the principle applying to other species.\n\nNow, Jeremy Bentham. He's a key figure in utilitarianism, which focuses on the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Bentham is famous for arguing that the ability to suffer is what gives an entity moral significance, not the ability to reason. His famous quote is: \"The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\" This suggests that Bentham believed animals, being capable of suffering, should be included in the moral circle and their interests considered equally. So, he seems like a strong candidate for recognizing the equal consideration of interests across species.\n\nFinally, John Stuart Mill. He was also a utilitarian and built upon Bentham's ideas. Mill would likely agree with Bentham's extension of moral consideration to animals, but I need to check if he specifically recognized the equal consideration of interests to other species. Mill did discuss animal welfare and opposed unnecessary suffering to animals, but I'm not sure if he explicitly stated that their interests should be considered equally to humans.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Jeremy Bentham is the most likely candidate to have recognized that the principle of equal consideration of interests applies to members of other species as well as to our own. His focus on suffering as the key moral consideration includes animals, whereas the others seem more anthropocentric in their moral theories.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
