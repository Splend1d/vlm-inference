                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option best describes the doctrine of original intent. Let me look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"When a law is unclear, the Supreme Court may consider the intent of a law or the letter of the law, but not both.\" Hmm, this seems to be about how courts interpret laws in general, but I think original intent is specifically related to interpreting the Constitution, not just any law. So maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nOption B: \"Copyright laws exist to protect the rights of those who create original works.\" This seems to be about copyright law, which is a specific area of law unrelated to the interpretation of the Constitution. So, this doesn't seem relevant to the doctrine of original intent.\n\nOption C: \"Appellate judges should respect the original decisions of trial judges.\" This appears to be about the relationship between appellate and trial courts, perhaps regarding the doctrine of stare decisis or respect for precedent. Again, this doesn't directly relate to interpreting the Constitution based on the framers' intent.\n\nOption D: \"The Constitution should be interpreted in light of the intent of those who wrote it.\" This sounds directly related to the doctrine of original intent. It suggests that when interpreting the Constitution, one should consider what the framers meant or intended when they wrote it.\n\nLet me think about this a bit more. The doctrine of original intent is a theory of constitutional interpretation that argues the constitution should be understood based on the intentions of its framers and ratifiers. This is often contrasted with other theories like original meaning or living constitution approaches.\n\nOption D seems to capture this idea precisely. It mentions interpreting the Constitution in light of the intent of those who wrote it, which aligns with the doctrine of original intent.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, seems to be discussing judicial interpretation more broadly, perhaps referring to the choice between intent-based and text-based approaches in statutory interpretation. But it's not specifically about the Constitution or the framers' intent.\n\nOptions B and C are clearly off-topic for this question.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option D is the best answer here. It directly articulates the core principle of the doctrine of original intent, which is to interpret the Constitution based on the intentions of its authors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
