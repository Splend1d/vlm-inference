Liberalism is a fundamentally pessimistic approach that regards the international system as destined to the escalation of conflict. It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics.\nB. Liberalism is a novel conception in the theory of international politics. It is an optimistic approach that defines the ways in which states should relate to one another, particularly during conflict situations.\nC. Liberalism is an optimistic approach, offering an orientation for the better conduct of international affairs in the belief that a more peaceful world is possible. It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics.\nD. Liberalism does not exist as a mainstream theory within International Relations, but rather offers a set of guidelines and advice for states and political actors wishing to accrue power within the international system independently from the restrictions of traditional security paradigms.\n"

It's also the main way that countries handle their relationships with each other today.\n\nOption A says liberalism is pessimistic and thinks conflicts will always get worse, but that doesn't sound right because liberalism usually promotes cooperation and peace.\n\nOption B calls liberalism a new idea in international politics, but actually, it's been around for a while. Also, it says it defines how states should relate during conflicts, but liberalism is more about promoting peace and cooperation overall, not just in conflicts.\n\nOption D says liberalism isn't a main theory in International Relations, which isn't accurate because it is one of the key theories. It also says it's about accruing power independently from security paradigms, but liberalism actually often emphasizes international institutions and cooperation to achieve security and peace.\n\nSo, C seems the most accurate: liberalism is optimistic, aims for a better and more peaceful world, and it's dominant in how countries practice international politics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
