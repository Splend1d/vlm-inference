It's talking about explicit and implicit memory and how they might decline or stay the same over the adult life span. Let's see what each option says.\n\nOption A says that both forms of memory show a fairly consistent, gradual decline over the adult life span. That means both explicit and implicit memory get worse as we get older, and it happens gradually.\n\nOption B says that implicit memory capacity declines with age, but explicit memory capacity remains stable. So here, only implicit memory gets worse, while explicit memory stays the same.\n\nOption C is the opposite: explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit memory capacity remains stable. So explicit memory gets worse, but implicit memory stays the same.\n\nOption D says that both forms of memory remain stable, except when affected by a disease process like Alzheimer\u2019s. That means normally, both types of memory don't decline with age, unless there's a disease like Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nNow, I need to think about what I know about explicit and implicit memory and how they are affected by aging.\n\nExplicit memory, also known as declarative memory, is the type of memory that involves conscious recollection of facts and events. Things like remembering your birthday, your home address, or the capital of France are examples of explicit memory.\n\nImplicit memory, on the other hand, is non-declarative. It's about unconscious recall, like skills or habits. For example, riding a bike or tying your shoes are things you do without really thinking about them, thanks to implicit memory.\n\nFrom what I've read and studied, aging seems to affect these two types of memory differently.\n\nExplicit memory is more vulnerable to age-related decline. As people get older, they might have trouble remembering names, dates, or recent events. This is why older adults might rely on lists or other memory aids.\n\nImplicit memory, however, tends to be more resilient to aging. Skills that were learned earlier in life, like playing an instrument or speaking a language, are often preserved well into older age. Even if an older person hasn't played an instrument in years, they might find that the skill comes back relatively easily.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like explicit memory declines with age, while implicit memory remains more stable.\n\nLooking back at the options, that matches with option C: explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit memory capacity remains stable.\n\nOption A says both decline, but we know that implicit memory tends to stay stable.\n\nOption B says implicit declines and explicit stays stable, which is the opposite of what I've understood.\n\nOption D says both remain stable unless affected by a disease, but that doesn't align with the general understanding that explicit memory does decline with normal aging.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should consider if there are any exceptions or additional factors.\n\nFor example, some studies might show that certain aspects of implicit memory do decline with age, but overall, it's more resilient compared to explicit memory.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s can affect both types of memory, but the question is about normal aging, not disease processes.\n\nSo, in the context of normal adult aging, explicit memory declines while implicit memory remains relatively stable.\n\nHence, option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
