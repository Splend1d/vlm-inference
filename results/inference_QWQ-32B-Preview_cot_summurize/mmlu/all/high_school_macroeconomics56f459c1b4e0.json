                    "text": "So I've got this question here about real GDP per capita and how it relates to the standard of living. It says that real GDP per capita was $20,000 in 1980 and $21,000 in 1990, and I need to figure out by what percentage the standard of living increased based on these numbers.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what real GDP per capita is. GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a year. \"Real\" GDP means it's adjusted for inflation, so it gives a more accurate picture of economic growth. \"Per capita\" means per person, so it's averaged out across the population.\n\nThe standard of living is often measured by real GDP per capita because it indicates the average economic output per person, which can suggest how much wealth and resources each person has on average.\n\nSo, from 1980 to 1990, real GDP per capita increased from $20,000 to $21,000. I need to find the percentage increase over this 10-year period.\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{21,000 - 20,000}{20,000} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{1,000}{20,000} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 0.05 \\times 100\\% = 5\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the standard of living increased by 5 percent over that decade.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.5 percent.\n\nB. 5.0 percent.\n\nC. 50 percent.\n\nD. 3.3 percent.\n\nThe correct answer seems to be B. 5.0 percent.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculation. From $20,000 to $21,000 is indeed a $1,000 increase. Dividing that by the original amount, $20,000, gives 0.05, which is 5%. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might calculate the average annual growth rate over the 10 years, but the question is about the total increase from 1980 to 1990, which is a 10-year period.\n\nAlternatively, if they wanted the annual growth rate, they might use the formula for compound growth, but that doesn't seem to be what's being asked here.\n\nSo, I think B. 5.0 percent is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe they want the growth rate per year. If it grew from $20,000 to $21,000 over 10 years, what was the annual growth rate?\n\nTo find the average annual growth rate, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Annual Growth Rate} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\text{Number of Years}}} - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Annual Growth Rate} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{21,000}{20,000} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{10}} - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\left( 1.05 \\right)^{0.1} - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(1.05^{0.1}\\):\n\nUsing a calculator, \\(1.05^{0.1}\\) is approximately 1.004889.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Annual Growth Rate} \\approx (1.004889 - 1) \\times 100\\% = 0.4889\\%\n\\]\n\nBut that's the annual growth rate, and the question seems to be about the total increase over the 10 years, which is 5%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect the average growth rate over the period, but again, the question says \"the standard of living has increased,\" and it's followed by total percentage increases, not annual rates.\n\nGiven that, I think B. 5.0 percent is the correct answer.\n\nJust to consider all options, let's see what 0.5 percent would be. That would be $20,000 plus 0.5% of $20,000, which is $100, totaling $20,100, which is not the case here.\n\n50 percent would be $30,000, which is also not the case.\n\n3.3 percent would be approximately $20,000 plus $660, totaling $20,660, which again doesn't match the given $21,000.\n\nTherefore, the only logical answer is B. 5.0 percent.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. Sometimes these questions can be tricky with different time periods or different ways of calculating growth, but in this case, it seems pretty straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
