                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a particle with a charge that's twice that of an electron, moving through a uniform magnetic field. The magnetic field strength is \u03c0/4 tesla, and it's perpendicular to the particle's velocity. We're given that the cyclotron frequency is 1,600 hertz, and we need to find the particle's mass.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what cyclotron frequency is. The cyclotron frequency, also known as the gyrofrequency, is the frequency of the circular motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field. The formula for cyclotron frequency is:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi m} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( f \\) is the cyclotron frequency,\n\n- \\( q \\) is the charge of the particle,\n\n- \\( B \\) is the magnetic field strength,\n\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle.\n\nWe need to solve for \\( m \\), so let's rearrange the formula:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi f} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Actually, the correct formula for cyclotron frequency is:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi m} \\]\n\nSo, solving for \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi f} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's plug in the values we know.\n\nFirst, the charge \\( q \\) is twice that of an electron. The elementary charge \\( e \\) is approximately \\( 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\) coulombs. So, \\( q = 2e = 2 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\) C.\n\nThe magnetic field \\( B \\) is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) tesla.\n\nThe cyclotron frequency \\( f \\) is 1,600 Hz.\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{(2 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}) \\times \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\, \\text{T} \\right)}{2\\pi \\times 1600 \\, \\text{Hz}} \\]\n\nLet's simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ \\text{Numerator} = 2 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ = 2 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\times \\frac{3.1416}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ = 2 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 0.7854 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2 \\times 1.259 \\times 10^{-19} \\]\n\n\\[ = 2.518 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C} \\cdot \\text{T} \\]\n\nNow, the denominator:\n\n\\[ \\text{Denominator} = 2\\pi \\times 1600 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 1600 \\]\n\n\\[ = 6.2832 \\times 1600 \\]\n\n\\[ = 10,053.12 \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nNow, divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{2.518 \\times 10^{-19}}{10,053.12} \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\n\\[ m \\approx 2.504 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems too small. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the angular frequency formula for cyclotron motion, which is:\n\n\\[ \\omega_c = \\frac{qB}{m} \\]\n\nAnd frequency \\( f = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} \\), so:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi m} \\]\n\nYes, that's the same formula I started with.\n\nLet me double-check the values:\n\n- \\( q = 2e = 2 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\) C\n\n- \\( B = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) T\n\n- \\( f = 1600 \\) Hz\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{(2 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (\\frac{\\pi}{4})}{2\\pi \\times 1600} \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{3.204 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 0.7854}{2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 1600} \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{2.518 \\times 10^{-19}}{10,053.12} \\]\n\n\\[ m \\approx 2.504 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nHmm, that matches my previous calculation. But looking at the options, option A is \\( 2.5 \\times 10^{-23} \\) kg, which matches my calculation.\n\nWait, but option B is \\( 1.2 \\times 10^{-22} \\) kg, which is ten times larger. Maybe I made a mistake in units or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic effects, but the problem says the particle is nonrelativistic, so that should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the formula. Let me look up the cyclotron frequency formula again.\n\nUpon checking, the formula \\( f = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi m} \\) is correct for the cyclotron frequency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the magnetic field is not perpendicular to the velocity, but the problem says it is perpendicular.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the sine of the angle between velocity and magnetic field, but since it's perpendicular, sine(90\u00b0) = 1, which is already accounted for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the value of the magnetic field. \\( B = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) T is approximately 0.7854 T.\n\nLet me try plugging in the numerical values again:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{(2 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times 0.7854}{2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 1600} \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{2.518 \\times 10^{-19}}{10,053.12} \\]\n\n\\[ m \\approx 2.504 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the charge is not twice that of an electron, but maybe it's twice in magnitude but negative. But since charge cancels out in the formula, the sign doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the magnitude of the mass, regardless of the sign.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the value of the elementary charge. Let me confirm: the elementary charge \\( e \\) is approximately \\( 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\) C, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different level of precision or significant figures.\n\nGiven that, option A, \\( 2.5 \\times 10^{-23} \\) kg, matches my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me by providing a magnetic field in terms of \u03c0, and I should keep \u03c0 in the calculation to get a more precise answer.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{(2 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right)}{2\\pi \\times 1600} \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{3.204 \\times 10^{-19} \\times \\pi / 4}{2\\pi \\times 1600} \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{3.204 \\times 10^{-19} \\times \\pi}{4 \\times 2\\pi \\times 1600} \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{3.204 \\times 10^{-19}}{4 \\times 2 \\times 1600} \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{3.204 \\times 10^{-19}}{12,800} \\]\n\n\\[ m = 2.503 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nStill the same result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A, \\( 2.5 \\times 10^{-23} \\) kg.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ kg}} \\]"
