                    "text": "So I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure out how much the government needs to increase its expenditures to reach full employment. The full-employment GDP is $1.3 trillion, and the actual GDP is $1.2 trillion. The marginal propensity to consume is 0.8. And it says to ignore inflation for this problem. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the gap is between full employment and actual GDP. That should tell me how much output needs to be increased to reach full employment. So, full-employment GDP is $1.3 trillion, and actual GDP is $1.2 trillion. So, the gap is $1.3 trillion minus $1.2 trillion, which is $0.1 trillion, or $100 billion. So, we need to find out how much government spending needs to increase to close this $100 billion gap.\n\nNow, I recall that there's something called the spending multiplier in economics that relates changes in government spending to changes in GDP. The formula for the spending multiplier is 1 divided by (1 minus the marginal propensity to consume), or MPC. Given that the MPC is 0.8, let's plug that in.\n\nSpending multiplier = 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5.\n\nSo, the spending multiplier is 5. That means that every dollar increase in government spending will lead to a $5 increase in GDP.\n\nNow, we have a GDP gap of $100 billion that we want to close. So, if each dollar of government spending increases GDP by $5, then the required increase in government spending should be the GDP gap divided by the spending multiplier.\n\nSo, required government spending increase = GDP gap / spending multiplier = $100 billion / 5 = $20 billion.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Some options are $100 billion, which is the GDP gap itself, $80 billion, $20 billion, and $10 billion. According to my calculation, it's $20 billion, which is option C.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of the expenditure multiplier. The expenditure multiplier is also 1 / (1 - MPC), which is the same as the spending multiplier. So, that confirms that the multiplier is 5.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula for the impact of government spending on GDP: change in GDP = spending multiplier * change in government spending.\n\nWe know the change in GDP needed is $100 billion, and the spending multiplier is 5, so:\n\n$100 billion = 5 * change in government spending.\n\nTherefore, change in government spending = $100 billion / 5 = $20 billion.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there's any role for the marginal propensity to save or other factors, but since we're given the MPC and the multiplier only depends on MPC, I think this is sufficient.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions ignoring inflation, so I don't need to worry about any inflation adjustments in this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the necessary increase in government expenditures to produce full employment is $20 billion.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. $20 billion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
