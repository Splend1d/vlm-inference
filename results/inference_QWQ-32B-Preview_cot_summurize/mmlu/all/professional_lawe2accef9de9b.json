The sporting goods store said it would deliver the basketballs by that date. On October 10, one of the sporting goods store's employees was moving items in the warehouse and accidentally destroyed a container of basketballs. As a result, the owner of the sporting goods store telephoned the coach on October 11 and said, \"We had an accident in our warehouse yesterday, and as a result we do not have enough basketballs to fill all of our orders. Therefore, I won't be able to deliver your basketballs on October 15. However, I have contacted our supplier to see if they can rush a delivery of basketballs to us. Although I can't promise it, I should be able to deliver the basketballs you ordered by October 20. \" The coach replied, \"No problem. I think I'll be able to get by until then. \" When the coach failed to receive the basketballs on October 20, he sent the following e-mail to the sporting goods store:\"I must have the basketballs no later than October 23. \" The e-mail was received and read the same day by the owner of the sporting goods store.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this contract problem involving a basketball coach and a sporting goods store. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the coach ordered 25 basketballs to be delivered no later than October 15. The store agreed to this delivery date. But on October 10, there was an accident in the store's warehouse, damaging some basketballs, which means they couldn't fulfill all their orders on time.\n\nOn October 11, the store owner called the coach to explain the situation and said they might not be able to deliver by October 15 but thought they could deliver by October 20 instead. The coach responded, \"No problem. I think I'll be able to get by until then.\" So, it seems like they agreed to extend the delivery date to October 20.\n\nBut then, when the coach didn't receive the basketballs by October 20, he sent an email saying, \"I must have the basketballs no later than October 23.\" The store owner received this email on the same day.\n\nNow, the question is: If the store doesn't deliver the basketballs by October 23, can the coach cancel the contract?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, provided both parties are viewed as being merchants.\n\nB. Yes, provided that the three-day notice afforded the sporting goods store a reasonable time in which to perform.\n\nC. No, because the coach's October 11 statement effectuated a waiver of any condition of timely delivery.\n\nD. No, because the sporting goods store, by its October 11 statement, did not promise to deliver the basketballs by October 20.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's happening here in terms of contract law, specifically regarding conditions and remedies for breach.\n\nInitially, there was a contract for delivery by October 15. But due to an unforeseen accident, the store couldn't meet that date and informed the coach, proposing a new delivery date of October 20. The coach seemed okay with that, saying \"no problem, I think I'll be able to get by until then.\" This sounds like an agreement to extend the delivery date to October 20.\n\nThen, when October 20 passed and the basketballs still hadn't been delivered, the coach sent an email setting a new deadline of October 23. The store owner received this email on October 20.\n\nNow, if the store doesn't deliver by October 23, can the coach cancel the contract?\n\nI think this involves the concept of \"time is of the essence\" and the coach's right to cancel for breach of the delivery date.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Yes, provided both parties are viewed as being merchants.\n\nThis seems relevant because under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs transactions between merchants, there are specific rules about delivery times and remedies for breach.\n\nUnder UCC \u00a72-609, if the seller fails to make delivery within the time prescribed, the buyer may cancel the contract if the failure is material and not cured within a reasonable time.\n\nIn this case, the store failed to deliver by October 15, then by October 20, and now potentially by October 23. If the store doesn't deliver by October 23, it might be considered a material failure, especially if the season is starting soon.\n\nSo, option A could be correct, but let's look at the other options.\n\nB. Yes, provided that the three-day notice afforded the sporting goods store a reasonable time in which to perform.\n\nThis refers to the email setting a new deadline of October 23, which is three days from October 20. Whether three days is a reasonable time depends on the context. If it's feasible for the store to deliver within three days, then it might be reasonable.\n\nHowever, this option seems a bit vague. It's not clear if the three-day notice is sufficient in this particular situation.\n\nC. No, because the coach's October 11 statement effectuated a waiver of any condition of timely delivery.\n\nThis suggests that by agreeing to the extended delivery date of October 20, the coach waived his right to insist on timely delivery.\n\nBut in reality, he did agree to extend the date to October 20, but then set another deadline of October 23 when the initial extension wasn't met. So, it's not clear that he waived the condition entirely.\n\nD. No, because the sporting goods store, by its October 11 statement, did not promise to deliver the basketballs by October 20.\n\nWait, the store owner said, \"I should be able to deliver the basketballs you ordered by October 20.\" That sounds like a promise or at least an expectation to deliver by October 20.\n\nBut in contract law, promises are key. If the store owner didn't explicitly promise to deliver by October 20, then perhaps there was no binding agreement for that date.\n\nHowever, the coach seemed to accept October 20 as the new delivery date.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me try to summarize:\n\n- Original contract: delivery by October 15.\n\n- Store informs coach of delay on October 11, proposes delivery by October 20.\n\n- Coach says \"no problem, I think I'll be able to get by until then.\"\n\n- Store fails to deliver by October 20.\n\n- Coach sets new deadline of October 23 via email.\n\n- Question: if store doesn't deliver by October 23, can coach cancel the contract?\n\nUnder UCC \u00a72-609, the buyer may cancel if the seller fails to make delivery within the time prescribed and the failure is material.\n\nIn this case, the delivery dates have been extended, so the time prescribed is now October 23.\n\nIf the store fails to deliver by October 23, and this failure is material (which it likely is, since the season is starting), then the coach may have the right to cancel.\n\nHowever, we need to consider whether the store's initial statement on October 11 constituted a promise to deliver by October 20.\n\nThe store owner said, \"I should be able to deliver the basketballs you ordered by October 20.\" This seems like an expectation or a plan, but not a firm promise.\n\nBut the coach accepted this, indicating willingness to wait until October 20.\n\nThen, when October 20 passed, the coach gave another extension until October 23.\n\nSo, it seems like the delivery date was repeatedly extended, with the coach showing flexibility.\n\nIf the store fails to meet the final deadline of October 23, the coach may cancel the contract, especially if this failure is material.\n\nTherefore, option A seems plausible: yes, provided both parties are viewed as being merchants.\n\nOption B is also tempting, but the three-day notice might or might not be reasonable, depending on the circumstances.\n\nOption C suggests that the coach waived the condition of timely delivery by agreeing to the October 20 date. However, he still set a final deadline of October 23, indicating that he still expects delivery by that time.\n\nOption D says that the store didn't promise to deliver by October 20, which might be true if the store owner only said \"I should be able to\" rather than a firm\u627f\u8bfa.\n\nBut overall, considering that both parties are likely merchants (the coach is likely purchasing for a school or organization, and the store is a sporting goods store), and under UCC \u00a72-609, the coach may cancel if the store fails to deliver by the prescribed time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A: Yes, provided both parties are viewed as being merchants.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
