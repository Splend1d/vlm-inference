                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about family therapy. So, there's this 14-year-old boy who's been arrested three times for shoplifting, and his family reacts in these particular ways when he has a court hearing. His mom seems unconcerned, his dad goes fishing instead of going to the hearing, and his sister says she has too much homework to go. I need to figure out which type of family pattern this represents according to structural family therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what structural family therapy is all about. It's a type of therapy that looks at the family's structure and interactions to understand and resolve issues. It was developed by Salvador Minuchin, right? He identified different types of dysfunctional family structures that can contribute to problems in the family or in individual members.\n\nSo, the options are:\n\nA. disengaged.\n\nB. closed.\n\nC. \"emotionally 'cut-off'.\"\n\nD. skewed.\n\nI think \"disengaged\" might be related to family members not connecting or communicating with each other. \"Closed\" might refer to families that are rigid and don't adapt well to changes. \"Emotionally 'cut-off'\" sounds like family members don't express their feelings or are distant emotionally. \"Skewed\" could mean that the family roles are distorted or unequal.\n\nLet me think about the family's reactions. The boy is facing legal issues, which is a serious matter, and each family member is responding in a way that seems to avoid or minimize the situation.\n\nHis mom says he's just going through a phase, which might indicate that she's downplaying the severity of his actions. She doesn't seem overly concerned, which could suggest a lack of engagement or emotional involvement in his problems.\n\nHis dad decides to go fishing on the day of the court hearing. That seems like a clear avoidance of facing the issue and supporting his son during a crucial time. It's almost like he's choosing to do something else instead of dealing with the family problem.\n\nHis sister uses homework as an excuse not to go to the court hearing. Now, homework is important, but prioritizing it over supporting a family member in need might indicate that the family has norms where emotional support isn't a priority.\n\nConsidering these reactions, it seems like the family is not coming together to address the boy's issues. They're each pursuing their own activities or excuses to avoid dealing with the problem.\n\nComparing this to the options:\n\nA. disengaged - this seems plausible because family members are not engaging with each other or with the problem at hand.\n\nB. closed - I'm not sure if this fits as well, because \"closed\" might refer more to a rigid family system that doesn't allow for flexibility or change.\n\nC. emotionally \"cut-off\" - this could also be a possibility, as family members are not expressing concern or providing emotional support.\n\nD. skewed - this might refer to distorted roles, but I'm not sure if that's the primary issue here.\n\nBetween A and C, I need to decide which one best describes the family's behavior.\n\nDisengaged families are those where there is a lack of connection and communication between members. Each person might be doing their own thing without much regard for the others.\n\nEmotionally \"cut-off\" suggests that family members are not expressing their emotions or are distant in their emotional connections.\n\nIn this scenario, the family members are not engaging with the boy's problem. His mom is downplaying it, his dad is avoiding it, and his sister is using homework as an excuse not to be there. It seems like there's a general lack of emotional support and engagement with the boy's issues.\n\nSo, both disengaged and emotionally \"cut-off\" could apply, but I need to choose the best fit.\n\nPerhaps disengaged is a broader term that includes emotional disconnection. But emotionally \"cut-off\" might specifically refer to the absence of emotional expression or support.\n\nGiven that, maybe option C is more precise for this situation because it highlights the emotional aspect of their disengagement.\n\nBut let me check what Minuchin says about these terms.\n\nFrom what I recall, Minuchin describes disengaged families as those where there is too much distance between members, leading to a lack of connection and support.\n\n\"Emotionally cut-off\" isn't a term I remember specifically from Minuchin, but it might be used to describe a aspect of disengagement where emotions are not expressed or acknowledged.\n\nOption D, \"skewed,\" might refer to distorted boundaries or roles within the family, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that, perhaps A, disengaged, is the best answer.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because \"closed\" families, which are another type in Minuchin's framework, are characterized by rigidity and resistance to change, which doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nWait, maybe B, closed, isn't the right choice because closed families are more rigid and less flexible, whereas this family seems more loose and disinterested.\n\nIn contrast, disengaged families lack connection and don't provide support for one another.\n\nSo, considering the family's reactions to the boy's problem, it seems like they are not engaging with his issues or providing the necessary support.\n\nTherefore, disengaged might be the most appropriate description.\n\nHowever, I should consider that the mother is saying he's just going through a phase, which might indicate that she doesn't take his actions seriously. Is that a sign of disengagement or something else?\n\nPerhaps it's a combination of disengagement and emotional distance.\n\nGiven the options, I think disengaged is the best fit.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. disengaged.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
