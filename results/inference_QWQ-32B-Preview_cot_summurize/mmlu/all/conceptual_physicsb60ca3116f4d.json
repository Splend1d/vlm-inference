                    "text": "To determine which gas molecules are the fastest on average in a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen at a given temperature, we need to consider the kinetic theory of gases. According to this theory, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the absolute temperature and inversely proportional to their molar mass.\n\nThe root-mean-square speed (vrms), which is a measure of the average speed of gas molecules, can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3RT}{M}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( v_{\\text{rms}} \\) is the root-mean-square speed,\n\n- \\( R \\) is the universal gas constant,\n\n- \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature,\n\n- \\( M \\) is the molar mass of the gas.\n\nFrom this equation, it's clear that the vrms is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass (\\( M \\)). This means that lighter molecules will have higher average speeds compared to heavier molecules at the same temperature.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Hydrogen (H\u2082)\n\nB. Oxygen (O\u2082)\n\nC. Nitrogen (N\u2082)\n\nD. All have the same average speed\n\nWe need to compare the molar masses of these gases:\n\n- Hydrogen (H\u2082): approximately 2 g/mol\n\n- Oxygen (O\u2082): approximately 32 g/mol\n\n- Nitrogen (N\u2082): approximately 28 g/mol\n\nSince hydrogen has the smallest molar mass, its molecules will have the highest average speed, followed by nitrogen, and then oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. hydrogen\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
