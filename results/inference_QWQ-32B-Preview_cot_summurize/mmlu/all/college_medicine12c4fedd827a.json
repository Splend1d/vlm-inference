                    "text": "So I've got this question about SARMs, which are Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators. The question is asking me to choose the correct description from four options. Let's see:\n\nOption A says: \"steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\"\n\nOption B: \"steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors antagonising the effects of natural steroid hormones.\"\n\nOption C: \"non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\"\n\nOption D: \"non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors inhibiting the effects of natural steroid hormones.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what SARMs are. I remember that SARMs are a type of medication designed to interact with androgen receptors in the body, but they're supposed to have fewer side effects compared to traditional anabolic steroids.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. Whether SARMs are steroids or not.\n\n2. How they interact with androgen receptors.\n\nLet me start with the first point. Are SARMs steroids or non-steroids?\n\nI think SARMs are considered non-steroidal compounds. That means they're not derived from steroidal structures like traditional anabolic steroids are. So, that would suggest that options A and B, which call SARMs \"steroid drugs,\" might be incorrect.\n\nOn the other hand, options C and D describe SARMs as \"non-steroid drugs,\" which aligns with my understanding.\n\nNow, for the second point: how do SARMs interact with androgen receptors?\n\nI recall that SARMs are designed to bind to androgen receptors and mimic the effects of endogenous androgens, like testosterone, but in a more tissue-selective manner. The goal is to promote anabolic effects, such as muscle growth and bone density, without causing some of the unwanted side effects associated with steroids, like hair loss, prostate enlargement, and hormonal imbalances.\n\nSo, in terms of their action on androgen receptors, SARMs should be mimicking or agonizing the effects of natural steroid hormones, not antagonizing or inhibiting them.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: steroid drugs that act as agonists.\n\nOption B: steroid drugs that act as antagonists.\n\nOption C: non-steroid drugs that act as agonists.\n\nOption D: non-steroid drugs that act as inhibitors.\n\nGiven that SARMs are non-steroidal and act as agonists mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones, option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there are any SARMs that act as inhibitors or antagonists.\n\nI think there are some compounds that act as androgen receptor antagonists, like flutamide or spironolactone, but those are not considered SARMs. SARMs are specifically designed to activate the androgen receptor in a tissue-selective manner.\n\nSo, to confirm:\n\n- SARMs are non-steroidal.\n\n- They act as agonists at the androgen receptor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
