                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. So, we've got a few things happening here: the reserve ratio is 10%, the Fed buys $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks, and money demand is perfectly elastic. We need to figure out what happens to the money supply, interest rates, and aggregate demand (AD) based on these events.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for the Fed to buy $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks. When the Fed buys securities, it pays for them by increasing the reserves of the banks that sold those securities. So, in this case, the banks' reserves increase by $1 million.\n\nNow, with a reserve ratio of 10%, banks are required to hold 10% of their deposits as reserves. This means that for every dollar of reserves, banks can potentially create $10 in new deposits through the process of fractional reserve banking. This is because the money multiplier, which tells us how much the money supply can increase based on reserves, is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So, money multiplier = 1 / 0.10 = 10.\n\nSo, if reserves increase by $1 million, the potential increase in the money supply is $1 million times 10, which is $10 million. That seems to align with options A and C.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions that money demand is perfectly elastic. What does that mean? Perfectly elastic money demand implies that people are willing to hold any amount of money at the existing interest rate, but any increase in the money supply won't affect the interest rate because people are willing to hold whatever is supplied without changing the interest rate.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, if money demand is perfectly elastic, an increase in money supply won't lead to a decrease in interest rates because people are willing to hold all the extra money without demanding higher returns.\n\nGiven that, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Money supply increases by $10 million, lowering the interest rate, and increasing AD.\n\nB. Money supply remains constant, the interest rate does not fall, and AD does not increase.\n\nC. Money supply increases by $10 million, the interest rate does not fall, and AD does not increase.\n\nD. Money supply decreases by $10 million, raising the interest rate, and decreasing AD.\n\nOption A suggests that the money supply increases by $10 million and that this leads to a lowering of the interest rate and an increase in AD. But according to our earlier reasoning, if money demand is perfectly elastic, an increase in money supply shouldn't affect the interest rate.\n\nOption B says that the money supply remains constant, but we know that the Fed's purchase should increase reserves and, through the money multiplier, increase the money supply by $10 million.\n\nOption C says that the money supply increases by $10 million, but the interest rate does not fall, and AD does not increase. This seems consistent with perfectly elastic money demand.\n\nOption D suggests that the money supply decreases by $10 million, which contradicts what we know about the Fed's purchase increasing reserves and the money supply.\n\nSo, between options A and C, C seems more accurate because it acknowledges that the money supply increases by $10 million but that the interest rate does not fall due to perfectly elastic money demand.\n\nBut wait, if the interest rate doesn't fall, what happens to aggregate demand (AD)? Normally, a lower interest rate stimulates investment and thus increases AD. But if the interest rate doesn't fall, then there's no such stimulus, so AD shouldn't increase.\n\nOption C reflects this by saying that AD does not increase.\n\nTherefore, the likely answer is C.\n\nHowever, let's double-check. Is there any scenario where AD could increase without a decrease in interest rates? Maybe through other channels, but given the information provided, it seems that AD wouldn't increase if the interest rate doesn't fall.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\n- The Fed buys $1 million in Treasuries, increasing bank reserves by $1 million.\n\n- With a 10% reserve ratio, the money supply can increase by up to $10 million.\n\n- Money demand is perfectly elastic, so the interest rate doesn't change.\n\n- Without a change in interest rates, AD doesn't increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Money supply increases by $10 million, the interest rate does not fall, and AD does not increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
