The amount of materials stored in the plant\n\nB. The hours of operations of the new plant\n\nC. The effect the plant will have on the environment\n\nD. The work environment for the employees at the plant\n\nFirst, I need to think about what community planners typically focus on. Community planners are usually concerned with the overall impact that a new development will have on the community. That includes things like environmental impact, traffic, noise, employment opportunities, and overall quality of life for residents.\n\nOption A is about the amount of materials stored in the plant. While this might be important for the factory's operations, it's not something that directly affects the community outside the plant. So, I don't think this is the primary concern for community planners.\n\nOption B is about the hours of operation. This could be relevant if the plant plans to operate late at night or early in the morning, which might cause noise disturbances or affect local traffic patterns. However, I think there are more significant concerns related to the environment and overall impact on the community.\n\nOption C is about the environmental impact of the plant. Car manufacturing can involve processes that emit pollutants, use a lot of energy, and generate waste. These factors can have long-term effects on the local environment and public health. Community planners would likely be very concerned about ensuring that the plant operates in an environmentally responsible manner.\n\nOption D is about the work environment for the employees. While this is important for the well-being of the workers, it's more of an internal concern for the company and the employees themselves. Community planners might have some interest in ensuring that the company follows labor laws, but compared to the environmental impact, it's probably a lesser concern.\n\nComparing options B and C, I think the environmental impact (option C) is more significant and far-reaching than the hours of operation. Environmental issues can affect the entire community and even future generations, whereas operational hours might cause some inconvenience but are generally manageable.\n\nTherefore, I believe that community planners would be most concerned with the effect the plant will have on the environment before allowing it to be built.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
