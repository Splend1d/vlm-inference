                    "text": "So I've got this question here from a historian named Alfred Crosby, and he's talking about how Western Europe achieved global hegemony, especially between 1450 and 1750 C.E. He mentions that for any society to achieve global dominance, it would need to make a big leap in productivity, and this leap would require exploiting resources and assets from other continents. He credits Western Europe's success to their brutality, guns, and also to some geographical and ecological luck.\n\nThe question is asking which option best supports the author's assertion about the \"quantum jump\" that helped Western Europe achieve global hegemony. The options are:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa\n\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity\n\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the author is saying. He's arguing that to make this significant jump in productivity, a society needs to exploit the resources and assets of other continents. So, it's not just about internal development; it's about expanding outward and taking advantage of what's available in other parts of the world.\n\nLooking at option A, the colonization of the interior of Africa. Now, I know that European colonization of Africa was more extensive in the 19th and 20th centuries, during the Scramble for Africa, which is after the period we're considering here (1450-1750 C.E.). So, perhaps this isn't the best example for the period in question.\n\nOption B is the conquest of the Aztec Empire. This happened in the 16th century, specifically in 1519-1521, which is well within the 1450-1750 period. The conquest of the Aztec Empire was a pivotal moment in Spanish colonization of the Americas. The Spanish exploited the mineral resources, particularly silver, from the Americas, which funded their empire and contributed to the European economy.\n\nOption C is the reformation of Catholic Christianity. This refers to the Protestant Reformation, which started in 1517 with Martin Luther nailing his Ninety-Five Theses to the church door. While this was a significant event in European history and had profound social and political impacts, it's more about internal religious and political changes rather than external exploitation of resources from other continents.\n\nOption D is the isolationism of Tokugawa Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate ruled Japan from 1603 to 1868, implementing a policy of sakoku, or \"closed country,\" which restricted foreign influence and trade. While this is an important aspect of Japanese history, it doesn't directly support the author's assertion about Western Europe's exploitation of other continents' resources.\n\nComparing these options, it seems that option B, the conquest of the Aztec Empire, aligns best with the author's assertion. It was during the specified period, and it involved Western Europe (Spain) conquering and exploiting the resources of another continent (North America, specifically present-day Mexico). The wealth acquired from the Aztec Empire and other conquests in the Americas certainly contributed to Europe's economic and productive leap forward.\n\nOption A might be relevant for a later period, but not so much for 1450-1750. Option C is more about internal European religious changes, and option D is about Japan's isolation, which doesn't support the idea of Western Europe exploiting other continents.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B, the conquest of the Aztec Empire.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
