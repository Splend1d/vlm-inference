                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's an accountant who's compiling financial statements for a nonissuer, which means it's a company that doesn't have its stocks traded publicly. During this process, the accountant finds out that management has valued land at appraised value instead of following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). If they had followed GAAP, both the land account and stockholders' equity would have been decreased by $1 million, which is a material amount.\n\nNow, the accountant wants to modify the standard compilation report because management refuses to revise the financial statements. The question is asking what the accountant should do in this situation, and there are four options provided.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a compilation report is. In a compilation engagement, the accountant is basically helping management present their financial statements without providing any assurance on them. It's the lowest level of assurance. So, in a standard compilation report, the accountant doesn't express an opinion or provide any assurance; they just present the financial statements as prepared by management.\n\nBut in this case, there's a departure from GAAP that's material, and management won't fix it. So, the accountant needs to adjust the report to reflect this issue.\n\nOption A suggests issuing either an adverse opinion or a qualified opinion based on materiality. However, in a compilation engagement, the accountant doesn't provide an opinion at all. Opinions are provided in audit or review engagements, not in compilations. So, this option doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption B proposes adding a separate paragraph to the report that restricts the distribution of the financial statements to \"internal use only.\" This might be a way to limit who sees the financial statements, but it doesn't address the fact that there's a departure from GAAP. It seems like a partial solution at best.\n\nOption C suggests adding a separate paragraph to the report that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements. This seems like a more appropriate approach because it directly addresses the issue by informing users of the financial statements about the non-GAAP presentation and how it affects the numbers.\n\nOption D proposes adding a paragraph that explains the underlying purpose of recording assets at historical cost. While this might be educational, it doesn't directly address the specific departure from GAAP in this situation. It's more of a general explanation rather than a disclosure of the actual issue at hand.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C appears to be the most suitable choice. The accountant should add a separate paragraph to the compilation report that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements. This way, users of the financial statements are aware of the inconsistency with GAAP and can take that into account when reviewing the statements.\n\nTo confirm, let's look at the standards. According to the AICPA's Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS), in a compilation engagement, if there's a material departure from GAAP and management refuses to adjust the financial statements, the accountant should consider adding an Other-Matter paragraph to the report to disclose this departure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
