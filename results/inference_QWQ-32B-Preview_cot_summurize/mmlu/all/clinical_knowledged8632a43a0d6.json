                    "text": "So I have this problem here. A person weighs 62 kilograms, and their drug dose is 15 milligrams per kilogram. I need to find out how many grams their dose is. The options are A. 930, B. 93, C. 9.3, and D. 0.93. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total dose in milligrams and then convert that to grams. So, the dose is 15 milligrams per kilogram, and the person weighs 62 kilograms. That means I should multiply 15 mg by 62 kg to get the total dose in milligrams.\n\nLet me do that: 15 mg/kg \u00d7 62 kg = 930 mg.\n\nNow, I need to convert milligrams to grams. I know that 1 gram is equal to 1000 milligrams. So, to convert milligrams to grams, I need to divide by 1000.\n\nSo, 930 mg \u00f7 1000 = 0.93 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 0.93 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst calculation: 15 mg/kg \u00d7 62 kg = 930 mg. That seems correct.\n\nSecond calculation: 930 mg \u00f7 1000 = 0.93 g. That also seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of units. Starting with mg/kg \u00d7 kg = mg. Then, mg \u00f7 1000 = g. So, the units work out correctly.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the conversion factor directly in the calculation. Since 1 mg = 0.001 g, I can multiply the dose in mg by 0.001 to get grams.\n\nSo, 930 mg \u00d7 0.001 g/mg = 0.93 g. Same result.\n\nI can also estimate to see if this makes sense. 15 mg/kg for 60 kg would be about 900 mg, which is 0.9 grams. 62 kg is a bit more, but not significantly, so 0.93 grams seems reasonable.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 930, which is in milligrams, but we need grams. B is 93 grams, which would be way too high. C is 9.3 grams, which is still higher than my calculation. D is 0.93 grams, which matches my calculation.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D. 0.93 grams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
