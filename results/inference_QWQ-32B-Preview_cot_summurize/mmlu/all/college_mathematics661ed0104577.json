                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. Two players are taking turns tossing a fair coin, and the first one to toss a head wins. I need to find the probability that the player who goes first wins the game. The options are 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the situation. There are two players, let's call them Player A and Player B, and Player A goes first. They're using a fair coin, so the probability of getting heads (H) or tails (T) on each toss is 1/2.\n\nI need to find the probability that Player A wins. That means Player A tosses a head on one of their turns before Player B does.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Player A tosses the coin. There's a 1/2 chance that they get heads and win immediately. If they get tails, which is also a 1/2 chance, then it's Player B's turn.\n\nNow, Player B tosses the coin. There's a 1/2 chance that Player B gets heads and wins, and a 1/2 chance that they get tails and the turn goes back to Player A.\n\nIf Player B gets tails, then Player A tosses again, and the cycle continues until someone gets heads.\n\nSo, the probability that Player A wins can be thought of as the sum of the probabilities of all the scenarios where Player A gets heads before Player B does.\n\nLet's try to express this mathematically.\n\nThe probability that Player A wins on their first toss is 1/2.\n\nThe probability that Player A wins on their second toss would be the probability that both Player A and Player B get tails on their first tosses, and then Player A gets heads on their second toss. That would be (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that Player A wins on their third toss would be both players getting tails twice, and then Player A getting heads. That's (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2) = (1/2)^5 = 1/32.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's rethink that.\n\nActually, the pattern is that Player A wins on their nth toss if both players have gotten tails in all previous n-1 rounds, and then Player A gets heads on the nth round.\n\nSo, the probability for Player A to win on the nth toss is (1/2)^{2(n-1)} * (1/2) = (1/2)^{2n-1}.\n\nBecause for each complete round where both get tails, that's (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, and there are n-1 such rounds, and then Player A gets heads on the nth toss.\n\nSo, the total probability that Player A wins is the sum from n=1 to infinity of (1/2)^{2n-1}.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(A wins) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} (1/2)^{2n-1}\n\nThis is a geometric series. Let's see how to sum it up.\n\nFirst, note that (1/2)^{2n-1} = (1/2)^{2n} * (1/2)^{-1} = (1/4)^n * 2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to factor out (1/2).\n\nP(A wins) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} (1/2)^{2n-1} = (1/2) * sum_{n=1}^{infty} (1/4)^{n-1}\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nNow, sum_{n=1}^{infty} (1/4)^{n-1} is a geometric series with first term 1 (when n=1) and common ratio 1/4.\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nSo, sum_{n=1}^{infty} (1/4)^{n-1} = 1 / (1 - 1/4) = 1 / (3/4) = 4/3.\n\nTherefore, P(A wins) = (1/2) * (4/3) = 2/3.\n\nSo, the probability that Player A wins is 2/3.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to think about it.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the probability that Player A wins as P.\n\nPlayer A wins if they get heads on their first toss, which is 1/2, or if they get tails on their first toss (1/2), Player B gets tails on their first toss (1/2), and then Player A has the same probability P of winning from there on.\n\nSo, P = probability that A wins on first toss + probability that both A and B get tails and then A wins from there.\n\nIn formula terms:\n\nP = (1/2) + (1/2)*(1/2)*P\n\nSimplify:\n\nP = 1/2 + (1/4)P\n\nNow, solve for P:\n\nP - (1/4)P = 1/2\n\n(3/4)P = 1/2\n\nP = (1/2) / (3/4) = (1/2)*(4/3) = 2/3\n\nAgain, I get P = 2/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the complement.\n\nThe probability that Player A wins is 1 minus the probability that Player B wins.\n\nBut, actually, that might not be straightforward because there's also the possibility of the game continuing indefinitely, but with a fair coin, that's not possible since eventually, someone will get heads.\n\nWait, but with a fair coin, the probability of getting heads is always 1/2, so the game is guaranteed to end eventually.\n\nBut, to think about it differently, perhaps I can consider the probabilities for each player.\n\nLet P_A be the probability that Player A wins, and P_B be the probability that Player B wins.\n\nWe know that P_A + P_B = 1, since one of them must win.\n\nFrom earlier, P_A = 2/3, so P_B = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nIs that makes sense?\n\nWell, Player B only gets a chance to toss if Player A gets tails on their first toss, which is 1/2 probability.\n\nThen, Player B has a 1/2 chance of getting heads and winning, or 1/2 chance of getting tails and the game continues.\n\nWait, but according to this, P_B = (1/2) * (1/2) + (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2) + ...\n\nWait, similar to what I did for P_A.\n\nP_B = sum_{n=1}^{infty} (1/2)^{2n-1} * (1/2) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} (1/2)^{2n}\n\nBecause Player B wins on their first toss with probability (1/2)^2 = 1/4, on their second toss with probability (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^2 = (1/2)^6, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should just accept that P_A = 2/3 and P_B = 1/3, since they add up to 1 and match the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry or a simpler way to see this.\n\nImagine that Player A tosses first. They have a 1/2 chance of winning immediately.\n\nIf not, the role reverses, and Player B is now in the position that Player A was in initially.\n\nBut Player B is now the one who gets to toss first in this new sub-game.\n\nSo, the probability that Player B wins from here is what Player A had initially, which is P_A.\n\nBut in this new sub-game, Player B is now the first tosser, so their probability of winning from here is P_A.\n\nWait, perhaps that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nThe probability that Player A wins is the probability that they win on their first toss plus the probability that both toss tails and then Player A wins from there.\n\nWhich is what I had earlier: P_A = 1/2 + (1/2)*(1/2)*P_A\n\nAnd solving that gives P_A = 2/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of expected value or something, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the probability that Player A wins on their first toss, or their second toss, or their third, and so on, forming an infinite series.\n\nAs I did earlier, P_A = 1/2 + (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^5 + ...\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term a = 1/2 and common ratio r = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nThe sum S = a / (1 - r) = (1/2) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/2) / (3/4) = 2/3.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, I think it's confirmed that the probability that the first player wins is 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 2/3.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A, 1/4: This is too low. Player A has a better chance than that.\n\nOption B, 1/3: That's actually Player B's probability of winning, based on my earlier calculation.\n\nOption C, 1/2: That would be the case if it were a single toss deciding the winner, but since there are multiple turns, the first player has an advantage.\n\nOption D, 2/3: Correct, as per my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry between the players, but because Player A goes first, they have a higher probability of winning.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
