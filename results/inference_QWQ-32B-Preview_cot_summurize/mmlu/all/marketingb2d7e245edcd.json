                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the store bought five sofas with an invoice total of $7,000, and the terms are 2/10, n/30. That means they get a 2% discount if they pay within 10 days, otherwise, the full amount is due within 30 days. The invoice was paid on August 13.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if they paid within the discount period. The invoice date is August 4, and it was paid on August 13. Let's see how many days that is.\n\nAssuming August has 31 days:\n\n- August 4 to August 13 is 9 days (since August 4 is the start date, we don't count it fully, so 13 - 4 = 9 days).\n\nSo, 9 days is within the 10-day discount period.\n\nTherefore, they qualify for the 2% discount.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the discount amount and then the amount paid.\n\nThe discount is 2% of $7,000.\n\nFirst, find 2% of $7,000:\n\n\\( 2\\% \\times 7000 = 0.02 \\times 7000 = 140 \\)\n\nSo, the discount is $140.\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the invoice total to find the amount paid:\n\n\\( 7000 - 140 = 6860 \\)\n\nTherefore, the store paid $6,860.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $7,140\n\nB. $7,000\n\nC. $6,860\n\nD. $6,300\n\nThe correct answer is C. $6,860.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the date calculation to make sure.\n\nAugust 4 to August 13:\n\n- August 4 (day 1)\n\n- August 5 (day 2)\n\n- August 6 (day 3)\n\n- August 7 (day 4)\n\n- August 8 (day 5)\n\n- August 9 (day 6)\n\n- August 10 (day 7)\n\n- August 11 (day 8)\n\n- August 12 (day 9)\n\n- August 13 (day 10)\n\nWait, actually, from August 4 to August 13 inclusive is 10 days.\n\nBut in invoice terms, typically, the discount period starts the day after the invoice date. So, if the invoice is dated August 4, the discount period would be August 5 to August 14.\n\nTherefore, payment on August 13 would be within the 10-day discount period.\n\nSo, yes, they get the 2% discount.\n\nThus, the amount paid is $7,000 minus $140 discount, which is $6,860.\n\nI think C is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nSometimes, terms can be interpreted differently, but in standard business practices, 2/10, n/30 means 2% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise net due in 30 days.\n\nGiven that, and the payment was made within 10 days, the discount applies.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. $6,860.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
