                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about discrimination in selection tests, and I need to figure out under which condition it would be safe to assume that a test doesn't discriminate against a particular racial group. The options are:\n\nA. No one from the group has applied for a position with the organization using the test.\n\nB. The test manual demonstrates that the test is valid for a wide variety of jobs.\n\nC. The test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion.\n\nD. It is not feasible to conduct separate validity studies on male and female employees.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. I need to think about what constitutes non-discrimination in testing.\n\nOption A says that if no one from the group has applied, then it's safe to assume no discrimination. But that doesn't make sense because if no one applied, how would we know if the test discriminates or not? Maybe the test is discouraging people from applying, or perhaps there are other reasons why they're not applying. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nOption B mentions that the test is valid for a wide variety of jobs. Validity is important, but does that directly relate to discrimination? Validity refers to whether the test measures what it's supposed to measure. While a valid test is desirable, it doesn't necessarily ensure that the test isn't discriminatory towards a particular group. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption C says that if the test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion, then it's non-discriminatory. This seems promising. If the rejection rates are similar across different groups, it might suggest that the test is applied equally to all, regardless of race. But I need to be careful because sometimes, even if rejection rates are similar, there might still be underlying biases in the test that affect performance differently across groups.\n\nOption D talks about the feasibility of conducting separate validity studies on male and female employees. Wait, but the question is about racial groups, not gender. So, this seems off-track. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"Under which of the following conditions would it be safe to assume that a selection test does not discriminate against a particular racial group?\"\n\nOkay, so it's specifically about racial groups and discrimination in selection tests.\n\nOption A: No applications from the group. That doesn't ensure non-discrimination; it might even hide discrimination.\n\nOption B: Test validity for various jobs. Validity is important, but it's not directly about discrimination.\n\nOption C: Same rejection proportions across racial groups. This seems like a plausible indicator of non-discrimination.\n\nOption D: Infeasibility of separate validity studies on male and female employees. This seems unrelated to racial discrimination.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps option D was mis-copied or there's a typo. It mentions male and female employees, which is about gender, not race. Maybe it should be about different racial groups.\n\nAssuming that option D is indeed about racial groups, but since it's specified about male and female, perhaps it's not relevant here.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to be the most appropriate answer. If a test rejects applicants from different racial groups at the same rate, it suggests that the test is applied equally, without bias towards any particular group.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's more to it. Sometimes, tests can be biased in ways that aren't immediately apparent from simple rejection rates. For example, if the test requirements disproportionately impact one group's ability to prepare or perform, even if rejection rates are similar, there might still be discrimination.\n\nBut based on the options provided, and considering practical assumptions in test validation, option C seems to be the best choice.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. The test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
