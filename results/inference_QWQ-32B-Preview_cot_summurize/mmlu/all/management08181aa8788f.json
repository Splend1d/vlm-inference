This approach suggests that employees are motivated by external factors, particularly financial compensation, and that their behavior is driven by the desire to maximize their own self-interest.\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u662fD. Economic reward.\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u7b80\u8981\u56de\u987e\u4e00\u4e0b\u5176\u4ed6\u9009\u9879\uff1a\n\nA. Peer recognition: While peer recognition can be a motivating factor for some employees, it is not the primary motivator according to the instrumental approach.\n\nB. Promotion: Promotion can be seen as a means to achieve higher economic rewards, but again, it is the economic aspect that is considered the primary motivator in this approach.\n\nC. Greater freedom: Although greater freedom or autonomy in the workplace can be motivating, the instrumental approach places more emphasis on economic incentives.\n\nIt's important to note that different theories of motivation may prioritize different factors. For example, Maslow's hierarchy of needs suggests that higher-level needs like esteem and self-actualization can be strong motivators once basic needs are met. Similarly, Herzberg's two-factor theory differentiates between hygiene factors (like salary) and motivators (like recognition and responsibility). However, the instrumental approach specifically highlights economic reward as the primary motivator.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that managers adopting an instrumental approach might focus on designing compensation packages and incentive systems that directly link performance to financial rewards. They may believe that by offering higher salaries, bonuses, or other monetary benefits, they can effectively motivate their employees to perform better.\n\nIt's also worth considering the limitations of this approach. While economic rewards are important, they may not be sufficient to fully motivate employees in all situations. Other factors such as job satisfaction, work environment, and personal growth can also play significant roles in employee motivation. Therefore, a more holistic approach to motivation may be necessary to effectively manage and engage employees.\n\nIn summary, according to the instrumental approach, the primary motivator for workers is economic reward, making option D the correct answer. However, it's essential to recognize that motivation is a complex topic with multiple dimensions, and different approaches may emphasize various factors."
