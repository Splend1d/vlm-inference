                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question: \"Which of these animals lays eggs?\" and the options are A. cow, B. gerbil, C. frog, and D. elephant. I need to pick the one that lays eggs.\n\nFirst, I know that cows are mammals, and mammals usually give birth to live young, not eggs. So, probably cows don't lay eggs. Similarly, gerbils are also mammals, like mice or rats, and they also give birth to live babies. Elephants are big mammals too, and I'm sure they don't lay eggs; they have live births.\n\nThat leaves the frog. I think frogs are different. I remember from science class that frogs go through metamorphosis, where they start as tadpoles in water and then transform into adult frogs. I think frogs lay eggs in water, and those eggs hatch into tadpoles.\n\nSo, comparing all these, it seems like the frog is the only one that lays eggs among these options.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check about elephants. I'm pretty sure they don't lay eggs, but just to be sure. Elephants are mammals, and mammals typically give birth to live young. Only birds, some reptiles, and a few other animals lay eggs.\n\nGerbils are small rodents, and rodents are mammals that give birth to live young. Cows are also mammals, specifically ungulates, and they definitely don't lay eggs.\n\nFrogs, on the other hand, are amphibians, and amphibians usually lay eggs in water, which is consistent with what I remember about tadpoles.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is C. frog.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
