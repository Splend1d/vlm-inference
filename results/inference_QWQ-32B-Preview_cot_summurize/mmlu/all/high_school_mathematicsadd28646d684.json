                    "text": "So I have this problem here. It says that the graph of a function y = f(x) has the property that if it's shifted 20 units to the right, it looks exactly the same as the original graph. So, f(x - 20) = f(x). That means the function is periodic with a period of 20, right?\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest positive number a such that if I shift the graph of y = f(x/5) a units to the right, it matches the original graph of y = f(x/5). So, I need to find the smallest a where f((x - a)/5) = f(x/5).\n\nLet me try to relate this to the original function's periodicity. Since f(x - 20) = f(x), the function repeats every 20 units. But now the function is f(x/5), which means it's a horizontal stretch by a factor of 5, right? So, if the original function repeats every 20 units, stretching it by 5 means it should repeat every 100 units.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's think about it. If f(x) has a period of 20, then f(x/5) would have a period that's 5 times longer, because the input x is divided by 5. So, the period should be 20 * 5 = 100. So, the function y = f(x/5) should repeat every 100 units.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive a for which shifting y = f(x/5) by a units to the right results in the same graph should be 100.\n\nBut let's double-check this. If I shift y = f(x/5) by a units to the right, I get y = f((x - a)/5). I want this to be equal to y = f(x/5). So, f((x - a)/5) = f(x/5).\n\nSince f is periodic with period 20, f(t - 20) = f(t) for any t. So, if I set t = x/5, then f(t - 20) = f(t).\n\nBut in this case, t - 20 = (x - a)/5, and t = x/5. So, (x - a)/5 = x/5 - 20.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me try to equate f((x - a)/5) to f(x/5 - 20), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, since f is periodic with period 20, f(u) = f(u - 20k) for any integer k.\n\nSo, for f((x - a)/5) to be equal to f(x/5), we need (x - a)/5 to be equal to x/5 - 20k for some integer k.\n\nLet's set (x - a)/5 = x/5 - 20k.\n\nSimplify: (x - a)/5 - x/5 = -20k\n\nThis gives (-a)/5 = -20k\n\nSo, -a = -100k\n\nTherefore, a = 100k\n\nThe smallest positive a is when k = 1, so a = 100.\n\nThat matches my earlier thought that the period is stretched by a factor of 5, so the new period is 100.\n\nBut let's see if there's a smaller a that could work. Suppose a is less than 100. Then k would have to be a fraction, but k has to be an integer because it's the number of periods.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive a is indeed 100.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
