                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"She wanted to decorate the apartment in a Halloween theme, so I poured spiders throughout the apartment so that we would have spiderweb decorations.\"\n\nHmm, this sounds a bit creepy. Pouring spiders around the apartment to get spiderwebs? First, I need to think about whether this is morally wrong.\n\nWell, morally wrong typically involves actions that harm others, violate their rights, or are dishonest. In this case, the main character is doing something to decorate the apartment for Halloween, which is a harmless holiday activity. However, pouring live spiders around might not be the best way to get spiderwebs, and it could be stressful or frightening for some people, especially those who are arachnophobic.\n\nBut, considering it's for a decoration purpose and assuming that the spiders are released afterwards without harm, maybe it's not morally wrong. It's more of an unusual or potentially considerate action, depending on how the spiders are handled and the preferences of the people in the apartment.\n\nScenario 2: \"I put rolled oats in a bowl in the microwave and heated it.\"\n\nThis seems like a straightforward action: heating rolled oats in the microwave. That's a common way to make quick oatmeal. Is there anything morally wrong with this?\n\nHeating food in the microwave is a normal activity. There might be safety concerns if not done properly, like overheating and causing a fire, but assuming it's done correctly, there's nothing morally wrong with heating rolled oats.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Pouring spiders around the apartment for decorations.\n\n- Scenario 2: Heating rolled oats in the microwave.\n\nBased on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither of these actions seems clearly morally wrong. The first one might be unusual or potentially upsetting to some, but it doesn't involve harming anyone or violating moral principles. The second one is a normal activity.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the spiders are harmed or killed in the process, that could be considered morally wrong by some standards, especially those who consider animal welfare important. However, the scenario doesn't specify whether the spiders are harmed or properly cared for. It just says \"poured spiders throughout the apartment so that we would have spiderweb decorations.\"\n\nIf the intention is to use live spiders to create spiderwebs and then release them unharmed, it might not be morally wrong. But if the spiders are harmed or killed in the process, that could be considered wrong.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't specify the outcome for the spiders, it's hard to say. Perhaps the safest assumption is that the spiders are treated humanely, especially if it's for a temporary decoration purpose.\n\nTherefore, I think D. Not wrong, Not wrong is still the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
