A splitting field of a polynomial is the smallest field extension that contains all the roots of that polynomial. Here, R probably refers to the field of real numbers, and Q is the field of rational numbers.\n\nSo, is there a polynomial over Q whose splitting field is the real numbers? Hmm, the real numbers are an infinite extension of Q, whereas splitting fields are finite extensions. Wait, splitting fields are always finite extensions because they are generated by a finite number of roots.\n\nBut the real numbers contain infinitely many roots, right? For example, consider the polynomial x^2 + 1, which has roots i and -i, which are not in R, but in C, the complex numbers. So, R isn't even algebraically closed, since there are polynomials with coefficients in R that don't split in R.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Maybe there's a specific polynomial whose splitting field is R over Q. But again, R is uncountable, while Q is countable, and finite extensions of Q are still countable. So, R can't be a finite extension of Q, which suggests that R isn't a splitting field of any polynomial over Q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is considering R as a splitting field in a different context, but based on standard definitions, this seems false.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"There is a field with 60 elements.\"\n\nI know that finite fields, also called Galois fields, exist and are unique for each prime power order. That is, for each prime p and positive integer n, there is a field with p^n elements.\n\nSo, to have a field with 60 elements, 60 would need to be a prime power. But 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5, which is not a prime power since it has multiple prime factors.\n\nTherefore, there is no field with 60 elements, as 60 is not a prime power.\n\nSo, both statements seem to be false.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nIt seems that option B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
