Yes, because an offer for a bilateral contract can be revoked before its acceptance.\nB.

                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this situation between a homeowner and a roofer. The homeowner offered to pay $2,000 for roof repairs, and said that they\u2019d have a deal when the roofer starts the work. The roofer didn\u2019t directly say yes, but he went out and bought the supplies needed for the job. Then, when he showed up with the supplies, he found a message that the homeowner had revoked the offer. Now, the question is, can the homeowner revoke the offer under these circumstances?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because an offer for a bilateral contract can be revoked before its acceptance.\n\nB. No, because the act of purchasing supplies specifically for the homeowner's job was an effective acceptance and a contract was formed prior to the homeowner's attempted revocation.\n\nC. No, because the offer had to remain open for a reasonable period of time before it could be revoked.\n\nD. Yes, because an oral offer to enter a bilateral contract is never enforceable.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what a bilateral contract is. A bilateral contract is where both parties promise to do something for each other. So, here, the homeowner promises to pay $2,000, and the roofer promises to do the roof repairs.\n\nNow, option A says that yes, the homeowner can revoke the offer because offers for bilateral contracts can be revoked before acceptance. That seems plausible, but I need to consider if the roofer has done something that constitutes acceptance.\n\nThe roofer didn\u2019t directly say yes, but he bought supplies specifically for the job. Is that considered acceptance? In contract law, acceptance usually requires a clear indication of agreement to the terms offered. Simply buying supplies might not be enough to constitute acceptance, especially since he hasn\u2019t started the work yet.\n\nOption B says no, because purchasing supplies is effective acceptance. But, as I just thought, that might not be sufficient for acceptance. Maybe if he had started the work, that would be different, but just buying supplies seems like preparation rather than actual performance.\n\nOption C says no, because the offer had to remain open for a reasonable time. Hmm, sometimes offers can be irrevocable for a certain period, like if there\u2019s consideration for keeping the offer open, which is called option contract. But in this case, there\u2019s no mention of any consideration for keeping the offer open, so I don\u2019t think this applies.\n\nOption D says yes, because an oral offer for a bilateral contract is never enforceable. Wait, is that true? In general, oral contracts can be enforceable, although some types of contracts require written forms, like those involving real estate or payments over a certain amount. But in many jurisdictions, oral contracts for services are enforceable, especially if partial performance has occurred.\n\nNow, considering the roofer bought supplies but didn\u2019t start the work, has there been any performance? Buying supplies might be considered part of preparation, but not actual performance of the contract. So, perhaps no contract has been formed yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the roofer\u2019s actions amount to reliance on the offer, and he can argue for promissory estoppel or detrimental reliance. If he relied on the homeowner\u2019s offer and suffered a loss because of it, he might have a claim, but that\u2019s different from saying a contract was formed.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the homeowner can revoke the offer before acceptance, which hasn\u2019t occurred yet beyond preparation.\n\nSo, option A seems most correct: yes, the homeowner can revoke the offer because it\u2019s an offer for a bilateral contract that hasn\u2019t been accepted yet.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that the roofer\u2019s actions could be considered acceptance?\n\nIn some cases, part performance or reliance can be treated as acceptance, but I think that\u2019s more common in unilateral contracts, where an offer is made and acceptance comes through performance. Here, it\u2019s a bilateral contract, where acceptance typically requires a meeting of the minds, usually through some form of communication.\n\nSince the roofer didn\u2019t communicate acceptance and only bought supplies, which is a step towards performance but not actual performance, I think the offer can still be revoked.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A: Yes, because an offer for a bilateral contract can be revoked before its acceptance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
