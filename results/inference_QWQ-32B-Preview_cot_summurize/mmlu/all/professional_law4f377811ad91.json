                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about partnership law involving Pete Smith and Bill Jones in their plumbing business. So, Pete is the active partner, which means he's the one managing the day-to-day operations, while Bill is the silent partner, meaning he's more of an investor who doesn't get involved in the management. They've been running \"Pete Smith Plumbing\" for six years, and recently, Bill went ahead and bought 100 toilets for the business without Pete's approval. Now, Pete is upset because he thinks it's too many toilets and it might take years to sell them all. He's seeking advice on what to do about this situation.\n\nThe question presents four options, and we need to choose the best advice for Pete. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"Bill can bind the partnership by his act.\" This means that if Bill makes a decision or enters into a contract on behalf of the partnership, it can be legally binding on the partnership as a whole. In partnership law, generally, only partners who are actively involved in the management can bind the partnership by their actions. Since Bill is a silent partner, he might not have the authority to bind the partnership in this way. So, this option might not be the best advice for Pete.\n\nOption B states, \"silent partners are investors only and cannot bind the partnership.\" This seems consistent with what I just mentioned. Silent partners typically don't have the authority to act on behalf of the partnership in management decisions or contracts. So, this could be a plausible advice for Pete.\n\nOption C says, \"unless his name is in the partnership name, third persons are 'on notice' that he is unauthorized to contract for the partnership.\" This introduces the concept of \"notice\" in partnership law. Generally, third parties dealing with a partnership are entitled to assume that any partner has authority to bind the partnership, especially if their name is in the partnership name. However, if a partner's name isn't in the partnership name, third parties might be on notice that this partner has limited authority. In this case, the partnership is named \"Pete Smith Plumbing,\" which includes Pete's name but not Bill's. So, third parties dealing with Bill might be on notice that he's not the managing partner, and therefore, his actions might not bind the partnership. This could also be relevant advice for Pete.\n\nOption D states, \"Bill, as a silent partner, is not authorized to purchase and, therefore, the sale may be set aside.\" This seems similar to option B, emphasizing that Bill lacks the authority to make such purchases on behalf of the partnership. If he acts without authority, the partnership might not be bound by his actions, and the sale could potentially be set aside.\n\nNow, considering all these options, I need to determine which one provides the best advice for Pete. Pete is upset because Bill, without his approval, purchased 100 toilets, which he thinks will be difficult to sell off. Pete wants to know what his options are regarding this purchase.\n\nFirst, he needs to understand whether Bill had the authority to make this purchase on behalf of the partnership. Since Bill is a silent partner, it's likely that he doesn't have the authority to make such management decisions. Therefore, options B and D seem relevant here.\n\nOption B says that silent partners are investors only and cannot bind the partnership. This suggests that Bill's purchase might not be binding on the partnership, meaning the partnership isn't obligated to honor the purchase.\n\nOption D goes a step further, saying that since Bill isn't authorized to make the purchase, the sale may be set aside. This means that the partnership can choose not to accept the toilets or pay for them.\n\nOption C introduces the concept of third-party notice. If Bill entered into the contract with a third-party supplier, and the supplier knew or should have known that Bill was a silent partner, then the supplier might not be able to hold the partnership liable for the purchase. However, if the supplier was unaware of Bill's status and reasonably believed he had authority to bind the partnership, the partnership might still be liable.\n\nGiven that the partnership is named \"Pete Smith Plumbing\" and doesn't include Bill's name, a third-party supplier might be on notice that Bill isn't the managing partner. Therefore, they should have verified his authority before entering into the contract.\n\nConsidering all this, the best advice for Pete would probably be option D: \"Bill, as a silent partner, is not authorized to purchase and, therefore, the sale may be set aside.\" This directly addresses Pete's concern about the unauthorized purchase and suggests a course of action to reverse or cancel the sale.\n\nHowever, Pete should also consider the potential implications of setting aside the sale. There might be costs or penalties associated with canceling the purchase, and it could damage the partnership's relationship with suppliers. Additionally, if the supplier was unaware of Bill's limited authority and relied on his representation, the partnership might still be liable for the purchase.\n\nTherefore, before taking any action, Pete should review the partnership agreement to see what it says about the authority of silent partners. If the agreement explicitly states that only active partners like Pete have the authority to make purchases, then the partnership may not be bound by Bill's action.\n\nAlternatively, if the partnership agreement is silent on this point, partnership law in their jurisdiction would govern the authority of partners. In many jurisdictions, only those partners who are actively involved in management have the authority to bind the partnership.\n\nPete should also consider consulting with a lawyer specializing in partnership law to get a more precise legal opinion based on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction.\n\nIn summary, while option D seems like the best advice, Pete needs to carefully assess the partnership agreement and seek legal counsel before deciding how to proceed with Bill's unauthorized purchase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
