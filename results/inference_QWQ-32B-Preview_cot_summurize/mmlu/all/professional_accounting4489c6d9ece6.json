                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about defenses in a negligence suit against a CPA (Certified Public Accountant). So, the question is asking which defense is likely to be successful in a lawsuit that alleges negligence by a CPA. The options are:\n\nA. Due care.\n\nB. Ignorance of the law.\n\nC. Lack of intent.\n\nD. Lack of mental capacity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what negligence means in this context. Negligence is a legal concept where someone fails to act with the care that a ordinarily prudent person would under similar circumstances, and that failure causes harm to another party.\n\nIn the case of a CPA, negligence could involve making mistakes in financial statements, giving incorrect tax advice, or failing to follow professional standards, which then causes financial loss to a client or other parties relying on their work.\n\nNow, let's look at each option to see which one could be a successful defense.\n\nOption A: Due care.\n\nDue care refers to the level of attention and caution that a reasonable person should take in a particular situation. In professional settings like accounting, CPAs are expected to exercise due care in their work. If a CPA can prove that they did exercise due care, meaning they acted with the requisite skill and attention, then they might be able to defend against a negligence claim.\n\nSo, due care seems like a plausible defense because it directly addresses whether the CPA met the standard of care expected in their profession.\n\nOption B: Ignorance of the law.\n\nIgnorance of the law is generally not a defense in legal proceedings. The principle that \"ignorance of the law is no excuse\" means that people are presumed to know the law, and failing to do so doesn't protect them from legal consequences.\n\nIn the context of a CPA, they are expected to know and adhere to relevant laws and regulations. So, claiming ignorance of the law wouldn't likely be a successful defense in a negligence suit.\n\nOption C: Lack of intent.\n\nNegligence is different from intentional misconduct. Negligence occurs when someone fails to exercise proper care without necessarily intending to cause harm. In negligence cases, intent isn't a required element; it's about the standard of care exercised.\n\nTherefore, claiming a lack of intent might not be a effective defense because the focus is on the standard of care rather than the CPA's intentions.\n\nOption D: Lack of mental capacity.\n\nLack of mental capacity could potentially be a defense in some legal contexts, but it's not typically relevant in negligence suits unless the CPA was legally incapacitated at the time of the alleged negligence.\n\nIn most professional settings, mental capacity is assumed unless there's evidence to the contrary. So, this seems like a less likely defense in a negligence suit against a CPA.\n\nComparing all the options, due care (Option A) seems to be the most directly applicable and likely successful defense in a negligence suit against a CPA. By demonstrating that they exercised due care in their professional duties, the CPA can argue that they met the required standard of care and therefore shouldn't be held liable for negligence.\n\nTo further solidify this, I might consider what professional standards and regulations apply to CPAs. CPAs are bound by professional standards, such as those set by the AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants), which include requirements for due care, competence, and adherence to generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nIf a CPA can show that they complied with these standards and exercised due care, it would strongly support their defense against a negligence allegation.\n\nIn contrast, ignorance of the law (Option B) is unlikely to be accepted as a defense because CPAs are expected to know and apply relevant laws and regulations in their work.\n\nLack of intent (Option C) doesn't address the key issue in negligence, which is the standard of care rather than the CPA's intentions.\n\nLack of mental capacity (Option D) is perhaps the least relevant unless there are specific circumstances indicating the CPA was not mentally capable of performing their duties, which is not typically the case in professional practice.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, due care appears to be the most appropriate and likely successful defense in a negligence suit against a CPA.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
