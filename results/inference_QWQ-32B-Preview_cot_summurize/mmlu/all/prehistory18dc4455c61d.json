                    "text": "So I've got this question here about analyzing carbon-13 levels in bones to figure out what people ate. The options are:\n\nA. mostly grains or mostly nuts and fruits.\n\nB. mostly meat or mostly vegetables.\n\nC. no dairy or lots of dairy.\n\nD. a certain type of honey produced only in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nI need to pick which one researchers can determine based on carbon-13 levels in bones. I'm not super familiar with isotopes and bone analysis, but I'll try to reason through this.\n\nFirst, I know that carbon-13 is an isotope of carbon that has one more neutron than the more common carbon-12. Isotopes can be used in something called isotope analysis, which helps scientists understand things like diet and geographic origin based on the ratios of different isotopes in biological tissues.\n\nSo, in the context of diet, different foods can have different ratios of carbon-13 to carbon-12. These ratios can get incorporated into the bones of the person eating those foods, and by analyzing those ratios, researchers can make inferences about their diet.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Mostly grains or mostly nuts and fruits.\n\nGrains, nuts, and fruits come from plants, but different plants have different photosynthetic pathways, which can affect their carbon isotope ratios. For example, C3 plants (like trees that produce nuts and fruits) and C4 plants (like grains such as corn and sugar cane) have different carbon isotope signatures. C4 plants tend to have higher levels of carbon-13 compared to C3 plants. So, if someone's diet was heavy in C4 plants like grains, their bone collagen might have higher levels of carbon-13 compared to someone who ate more C3 plants like nuts and fruits.\n\nB. Mostly meat or mostly vegetables.\n\nHere, we're comparing meat (which comes from animals) to vegetables (which are plants). The carbon isotope ratio in animal tissue reflects the diet of the animal. If the animal ate C3 plants, their tissue would have a certain ratio, and if they ate C4 plants, it would be different. So, the carbon isotope ratio in meat would indirectly reflect the plants the animal consumed. Vegetables, being plants, would have their own isotope ratios depending on whether they are C3 or C4 plants. This seems a bit more complex because it depends on the type of vegetables and the diet of the animals.\n\nC. No dairy or lots of dairy.\n\nDairy comes from animals, and as such, its carbon isotope ratio would depend on the diet of the animals. If the animals grazed on C3 plants, their milk would have a certain ratio, and if they ate C4 plants, it would be different. So, incorporating dairy into the diet would add another layer to the carbon isotope signature in bones.\n\nD. A certain type of honey produced only in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHoney is a product from bees, and its carbon isotope ratio can vary depending on the nectar sources. If the nectar comes from C3 plants, the honey would have a different ratio compared to if it came from C4 plants. If this specific type of honey is only produced in sub-Saharan Africa, it might have a unique isotope signature that could be detected in bone collagen.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to pick the option that researchers can most accurately establish based on carbon-13 levels in bones.\n\nOption A seems promising because it directly compares C3 and C4 plants, which have distinct carbon isotope signatures. So, if someone ate mostly grains (likely C4 plants like corn) versus mostly nuts and fruits (likely C3 plants), their bone collagen should reflect these differences in carbon-13 levels.\n\nOption B is about meat versus vegetables, but as mentioned, meat's isotope ratio depends on the diet of the animals, which can be variable. So, it might be less straightforward to distinguish between mostly meat or mostly vegetables based solely on carbon-13 levels.\n\nOption C, no dairy versus lots of dairy, also depends on the diet of the animals producing the dairy, which could vary. So, again, it might not be as straightforward as comparing C3 and C4 plant consumption.\n\nOption D is very specific, about a certain type of honey from sub-Saharan Africa. While it's possible that this honey has a unique isotope signature, it seems quite narrow compared to the broader dietary categories in options A, B, and C.\n\nGiven this, I think option A is the most straightforward and accurate choice for what researchers can establish based on carbon-13 levels in bones: whether an individual ate mostly grains (likely C4 plants) or mostly nuts and fruits (likely C3 plants).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
