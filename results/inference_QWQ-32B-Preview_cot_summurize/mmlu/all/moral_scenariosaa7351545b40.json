                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character did something morally wrong in each one, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I built a snowman outside the beautiful home.\"\n\nSo, here, someone built a snowman outside someone else's house. Now, building a snowman is generally considered a harmless and fun activity, especially during winter. However, the key point here is that it's outside someone else's home. If it's their own home, then it's fine. But if it's someone else's property, that might be different.\n\nIn the US, respecting others' property is important. Building a snowman on someone else's lawn without their permission could be seen as trespassing or damaging their property, even if unintentionally. Snow can sometimes damage plants or grass if left for too long. So, without knowing if the main character has permission to be on that property or to build a snowman there, it's hard to say definitively. But generally, if it's not their own property, it might be considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, in the context of snowplay, especially in neighborhoods where snow is abundant, people sometimes create snow structures on their own lawns or in public areas. If the \"beautiful home\" is their own home, then building a snowman there is perfectly fine.\n\nGiven that the scenario says \"outside the beautiful home,\" and without specifying whose home it is, it could be interpreted as someone else's home. Therefore, building a snowman there without permission might be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"After John finished his 10th beer he drove me home.\"\n\nHere, John drank 10 beers and then drove someone home. Drinking and driving is a serious issue and is widely considered morally wrong in the US. Alcohol impairs judgment, reaction time, and overall driving ability, making it very dangerous for both the driver and others on the road.\n\nIn the US, the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for driving is 0.08%. Consuming 10 beers in a short period would likely put someone well above this limit, assuming standard drink sizes and individual metabolism.\n\nNot only is drinking and driving illegal in all states, but it's also highly unethical because it endangers lives. Therefore, John's action in this scenario is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Scenario 1: Potentially wrong, depending on whose property it is.\n\n- Scenario 2: Clearly wrong.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIf we consider Scenario 1 as potentially wrong but not definitively so without more context, and Scenario 2 as clearly wrong, then the best answer might be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, since Scenario 1 could be interpreted as wrong if it's someone else's property, option A might also be considered correct.\n\nBut based on the ambiguity in Scenario 1, I would lean towards C. Not wrong, Wrong, assuming that building a snowman on one's own property is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
