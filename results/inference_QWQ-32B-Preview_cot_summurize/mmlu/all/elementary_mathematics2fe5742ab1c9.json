Hmm, let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to isolate the variable v. The equation is v - 26 = 68. To get v by itself, I should add 26 to both sides of the equation. That way, the -26 and +26 cancel out on the left side, leaving just v.\n\nSo, v - 26 + 26 = 68 + 26.\n\nThat simplifies to v = 94.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 94. So, is that the answer?\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's a different way to solve it, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider what number minus 26 gives 68. So, if I have a number v, and I subtract 26 from it, I get 68. To find v, I should add 26 to 68.\n\nSo, 68 plus 26 is 94. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could plug in the options to see which one works.\n\nLet's try option A, -42.\n\n-42 - 26 = -68, which is not equal to 68. So, that's not right.\n\nOption B, 42.\n\n42 - 26 = 16, which is not 68.\n\nOption C, 94.\n\n94 - 26 = 68. That matches the equation.\n\nOption D, 88.\n\n88 - 26 = 62, which is not 68.\n\nSo, only option C satisfies the equation.\n\nI think I'm confident with that. The answer is 94.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{94} \\]"
