                    "text": "Let's think about this problem step by step. We have two non-zero vectors, and when we add them together, the resultant vector is zero. We need to figure out what must be true about these two vectors based on that information.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means to add two vectors. When you add two vectors, you place the tail of the second vector at the head of the first one, and the resultant vector goes from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second one. Alternatively, you can add their components together.\n\nNow, if the resultant vector is zero, that means the end point of the second vector is right back at the starting point of the first vector. In other words, the vectors form a closed loop, specifically a straight line because we're dealing with two vectors.\n\nSo, for two vectors to add up to zero, they must cancel each other out completely. That can only happen if they are pointing in exactly opposite directions and their magnitudes are equal.\n\nLet's consider option A: They have equal magnitude and are pointed in the same direction. If two vectors have the same magnitude and direction, their sum would be a vector with twice the magnitude in the same direction, not zero. So, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B says: They have equal magnitude and are pointed in opposite directions. This seems plausible because if they are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they should cancel each other out, resulting in a zero vector.\n\nOption C is: They have different magnitudes and are pointed in opposite directions. If the magnitudes are different, even though they are pointing in opposite directions, their sum would be a vector in the direction of the larger magnitude vector, with a magnitude equal to the difference between their magnitudes. So, unless their magnitudes are exactly the same, their sum won't be zero.\n\nOption D states: It is not possible for the sum of two non-zero vectors to be zero. But we know from option B that it is possible if they have equal magnitudes and are pointed in opposite directions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be option B: They have equal magnitude and are pointed in opposite directions.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider an example. Suppose we have vector A with magnitude 5 units pointing east, and vector B with magnitude 5 units pointing west. When we add them, A + B = 5 east + 5 west = 0. Similarly, if A = (3,4) with magnitude 5, then B = (-3,-4) with magnitude 5, and A + B = (0,0), which is the zero vector.\n\nSo, yes, option B is indeed correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
