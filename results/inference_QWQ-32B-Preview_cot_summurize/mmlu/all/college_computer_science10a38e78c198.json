                    "text": "So I've got this question here about interpolating polynomials. It says that p(x) is the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial for a real-valued function f(x) at n + 1 distinct real numbers x0 through xn. And it's asking for the maximum possible degree of p(x). The options are n, n + 1, n + 2, or 2n.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what an interpolating polynomial is. From what I remember, an interpolating polynomial is a polynomial that passes through a given set of points. In this case, it's supposed to pass through the points (x0, f(x0)), (x1, f(x1)), up to (xn, f(xn)).\n\nNow, the key here is that it's asking for the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial. That means we're looking for the polynomial of the lowest possible degree that still passes through all these n + 1 points.\n\nI think that the general rule is that for n + 1 distinct points, there exists a unique polynomial of degree at most n that passes through all of them. Is that right? Let me think about that.\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. So, if I have n + 1 points, the polynomial that passes through all of them will have a degree less than or equal to n. In other words, the maximum possible degree is n.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the points happen to lie on a polynomial of a lower degree? For example, if I have 3 points that lie on a straight line, then the interpolating polynomial would be of degree 1, not 2. So, the minimal-degree polynomial would be of degree 1 in that case, even though n + 1 is 3, which would suggest a maximum degree of 2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the maximum possible degree of p(x), given that it's the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial for n + 1 distinct points.\n\nSo, in the general case, where the points don't lie on a polynomial of lower degree, the minimal-degree polynomial would be of degree n.\n\nBut to find the maximum possible degree, I need to consider the scenario where the points are such that the interpolating polynomial is of the highest possible degree, which is n.\n\nWait, but is there a scenario where the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial could be higher than n? Let's see.\n\nWell, no, because with n + 1 points, the unique polynomial that passes through all of them is at most degree n. You can't have a polynomial of degree higher than n that passes through exactly these n + 1 points, unless it's not the minimal-degree polynomial.\n\nBut the question specifies that p(x) is the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial. So, it's the polynomial of the smallest possible degree that passes through all the points.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible degree for p(x) would be n, when the points don't lie on a polynomial of lower degree.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. n.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any circumstance where the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial for n + 1 points could be of degree higher than n?\n\nI don't think so. In fact, in numerical analysis, we learn that the interpolating polynomial for n + 1 points is uniquely determined and has degree at most n.\n\nMoreover, if the points lie on a polynomial of lower degree, say degree m < n, then the minimal-degree polynomial would be of degree m.\n\nBut in the worst-case scenario, where the points don't lie on any lower-degree polynomial, the degree would be n.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible degree of p(x) is n.\n\nSo, the answer is A. n.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
