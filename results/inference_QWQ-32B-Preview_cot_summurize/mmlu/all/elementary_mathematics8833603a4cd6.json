There's also a 10-minute break between each set.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total time for the sets. There are 3 sets of 20 minutes each and 1 set of 40 minutes.\n\nSo, the time for the 20-minute sets is 3 times 20 minutes, which is 60 minutes.\n\nAdding the 40-minute set, the total set time is 60 + 40 = 100 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to account for the breaks. Since there are 4 sets in total (3 of 20 minutes and 1 of 40 minutes), there will be 3 breaks between them, each lasting 10 minutes.\n\nSo, the total break time is 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.\n\nNow, to find the total length of the music showcase, we add the total set time and the total break time: 100 minutes + 30 minutes = 130 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 73 minutes\n\nB. 110 minutes\n\nC. 130 minutes\n\nD. 210 minutes\n\nThe correct answer is C. 130 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, the problem mentions that the total length is 3(20 + 10) + 40 minutes. Let's see what that equals.\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses: 20 + 10 = 30 minutes.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.\n\nFinally, add the 40-minute set: 90 + 40 = 130 minutes.\n\nAgain, we get 130 minutes, which confirms that option C is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 130 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
