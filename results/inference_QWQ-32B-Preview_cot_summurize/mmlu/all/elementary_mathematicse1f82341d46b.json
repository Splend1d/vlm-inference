First, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses: (8 \u2212 5) = 3. Now the expression is 6 \u2022 24 \u00f7 3.\n\nNext, multiplication and division from left to right. First, 6 \u2022 24 = 144. Now it's 144 \u00f7 3.\n\nFinally, 144 \u00f7 3 = 48.\n\nSo, the answer should be 48, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
