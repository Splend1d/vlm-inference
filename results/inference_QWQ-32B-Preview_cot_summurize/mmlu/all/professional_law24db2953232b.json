                    "text": "This question is about whether a $100 tax on the sale of handguns to private individuals, excluding those for law enforcement or military use, would withstand a constitutional challenge. The options provide different scenarios under which the tax might or might not survive such a challenge. To answer this, we need to consider the constitutional principles related to taxation and regulation, particularly in the context of the Second Amendment and other relevant provisions.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the nature of the tax. The tax is imposed on the sale of handguns to private individuals not affiliated with law enforcement or military duties. This suggests that the tax is targeted at civilian ownership of handguns.\n\nOption A states: \"Yes, if Congress could have banned possession of handguns outright.\" This option seems to suggest that if Congress has the power to completely ban handgun possession, then imposing a tax on their sale should be permissible. This touches on the principle that if the government has the authority to prohibit an activity entirely, it should also have the authority to regulate it through lesser means, such as taxation.\n\nHowever, the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to keep and bear arms, which complicates this analysis. The Supreme Court has held that this right is individual and applies to state and federal governments. Therefore, any regulation or tax affecting this right must pass constitutional scrutiny.\n\nOption B says: \"Yes, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue.\" This option relates to the concept that taxes are generally constitutional if they are levied for revenue purposes, even if they have regulatory effects. The Supreme Court has upheld taxes that have both revenue and regulatory purposes, as long as the primary purpose is revenue generation.\n\nOption C states: \"No, if the tax does not result in a significant collection of revenue.\" This suggests that for a tax to be constitutional, it must actually generate a substantial amount of revenue. However, the constitutionality of a tax is not solely dependent on its revenue yield. If the tax is primarily for regulatory purposes and does not generate significant revenue, it may still be challenged under the taxing power.\n\nOption D says: \"No, because the tax is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership.\" This option implies that if the primary purpose of the tax is to penalize or discourage handgun ownership rather than to raise revenue, it may be unconstitutional. This relates to the principle that taxes must have a legitimate revenue purpose and not be used as a veiled form of regulation or punishment.\n\nGiven these options, the key factors to consider are:\n\n1. The constitutionality of regulating or taxing activities protected by the Second Amendment.\n\n2. The intent behind the tax\u2014whether it is primarily for revenue generation or for regulatory purposes.\n\n3. The extent to which the tax affects the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nIn evaluating these factors, it's important to look at relevant case law. For instance, in United States v. Lopez (1995), the Supreme Court limited Congress's power under the Commerce Clause to regulate purely local activities, which could be relevant if the tax is seen as exceeding Congress's regulatory authority.\n\nAdditionally, in McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), the Court incorporated the Second Amendment to the states, reinforcing the individual right to bear arms. This could be pertinent in assessing whether federal taxation on handgun sales infringes upon this right.\n\nFurthermore, the levels of scrutiny applied by courts in Second Amendment cases are important. The Supreme Court has applied strict scrutiny to laws that burden the core right to keep and bear arms in the home for self-defense, as seen in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008). If the tax is seen as substantially burdening this right, it may face strict scrutiny.\n\nConsidering Option A, if Congress could ban handgun possession outright, then imposing a tax on their sale might be seen as a lesser restriction that should be permissible. However, given the Second Amendment protections, Congress's power to ban handguns entirely is limited, especially for law-abiding citizens for self-defense purposes. Therefore, this option may not provide a solid basis for the tax's constitutionality.\n\nOption B suggests that if the dominant intent is to produce revenue, the tax would survive constitutional challenge. This aligns with established tax law principles, where taxes with both revenue and regulatory purposes are generally permissible as long as revenue generation is the primary intent. Therefore, if Congress can demonstrate that the primary purpose of the tax is to generate revenue, it may withstand scrutiny.\n\nOption C proposes that the tax must result in significant revenue collection to be constitutional. However, the constitutionality of a tax is not solely determined by its revenue yield. Even if the tax generates minimal revenue, it could still be constitutional if it serves a legitimate revenue purpose. Therefore, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption D states that the tax would not survive if it is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership. This aligns with the principle that taxes must have a revenue purpose and not be used as penalties or regulatory measures in disguise. If the tax is seen primarily as a penalty, it may be struck down.\n\nIn conclusion, the most plausible answer is Option B: Yes, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue. This is because taxes with a primary revenue purpose are generally constitutional, even if they have regulatory effects. As long as Congress can demonstrate that the tax is intended to generate revenue, it is more likely to survive a constitutional challenge, considering the complexities involved with regulating activities protected by the Second Amendment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
