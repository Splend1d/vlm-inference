The question is about determining the best way for the psychologist to meet their ethical responsibilities regarding consent and assent.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the difference between consent and assent. Consent is a legal agreement, usually required from a parent or guardian for minors, to participate in therapy. Assent, on the other hand, is the child's agreement to participate, given their age and understanding.\n\nOption A suggests that only the child provides verbal assent to participate in therapy. However, since the child is 10 years old and likely not considered legally competent to give consent on their own, this option is insufficient because it lacks parental consent.\n\nOption B proposes that both the parent(s) and the child provide written consent to therapy for the child. This seems comprehensive, but it's important to note that while parents give consent, children give assent. Consent is typically required from the legally authorized representative (parents or guardians), whereas assent is the child's agreement to participate, considering their developmental level.\n\nOption C suggests that the parent(s) provide(s) written consent and the child assents verbally to participate in therapy. This seems like a balanced approach, as it includes the necessary legal consent from the parents and the child's agreement through assent.\n\nOption D states that the parent(s) provide(s) written and verbal consent to therapy for the child. This covers the parental consent aspect thoroughly but does not mention the child's assent, which is also important for ethical practice, especially in therapeutic settings involving minors.\n\nConsidering these points, the best way for the psychologist to meet their ethical responsibilities would be to obtain written consent from the parent(s) and verbal assent from the child. This approach respects both the legal requirements for parental consent and the ethical consideration of the child's willingness to participate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The parent(s) provide(s) written consent and the child assents verbally to participate in therapy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
