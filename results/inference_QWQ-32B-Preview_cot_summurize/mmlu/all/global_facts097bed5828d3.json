                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about public opinion on political party corruption in the United States as of 2013. The options are A. 36%, B. 56%, C. 76%, and D. 96%. I don't remember the exact statistic, so I need to think about what I know about public opinion around that time.\n\nFirst, I recall that in the early 2010s, there was a lot of dissatisfaction with politics in the U.S. There were protests like Occupy Wall Street in 2011, which indicated that many people were unhappy with the political and economic systems. Also, approval ratings for Congress were quite low during that period.\n\nIn 2013, specifically, I think there were some high-profile scandals involving politicians, which might have influenced public perception of corruption within political parties. For example, there was the IRS scandal and other controversies that could have contributed to a sense of mistrust.\n\nLooking at the options, 96% seems too high. It's unlikely that nearly everyone believed political parties were corrupt. On the other hand, 36% seems too low, given the general mood of dissatisfaction.\n\nBetween 56% and 76%, it's harder to choose. I think around 2013, studies showed that a majority of Americans had little trust in government and political institutions, but I don't recall the exact percentage regarding corruption specifically.\n\nMaybe I should consider that corruption is a specific issue within the broader category of political distrust. Perhaps not everyone who distrusts politics would consider political parties corrupt, but a significant portion might hold that view.\n\nLet me try to eliminate some options. As I said, 96% seems too high because even in a climate of low trust, it's unlikely that almost everyone would think political parties are corrupt. Similarly, 36% seems too low given the context.\n\nSo, probably, the answer is either 56% or 76%. Maybe I can think about other polls from around that time to get a sense.\n\nI remember that in the mid-2010s, Gallup polls often showed that trust in government was around 40% or less, but again, that's trust in general, not specifically about corruption.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that corruption is a more specific issue, and therefore, the percentage might be higher than general trust metrics because corruption is a particular concern that might be more salient to people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe corruption is seen as one aspect of distrust, so the percentage could be higher than general trust metrics.\n\nGiven that, 76% seems quite high, but considering the context of public frustration and specific scandals, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, 56% seems more moderate, but I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of partisan divides. In the U.S., political opinions are often split along partisan lines. Perhaps the percentage of people who think political parties are corrupt is higher among one party than the other, but overall, it averages to one of these percentages.\n\nHowever, I don't have specific data to recall here.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I can consider that in a two-party system, people might be more likely to see corruption in the opposing party rather than their own, which could affect how they answer such a question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a Pew Research Center report around that time that addressed public perceptions of political corruption.\n\nWait, I seem to recall that Pew did publish reports on trust in government and perceptions of corruption. Maybe I can try to remember any key figures from those reports.\n\nIn 2013, Pew had a report on trust in government, and I think it showed that only about 20% of Americans had a lot of trust in the government to do what is right, which is different from the question here about corruption.\n\nSo, perhaps looking at corruption specifically, the percentage might be higher because corruption is a specific issue that people might be concerned about, separate from general trust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a Gallup poll that addressed corruption directly.\n\nI recall that Gallup has done polls on honesty and ethics in professions, including politicians. In those polls, politicians usually score low, but I don't remember the exact percentages.\n\nPerhaps in 2013, the percentage of Americans who thought political parties were corrupt was around 50%-60%.\n\nLooking at the options, that would correspond to 56%.\n\nBut I also have to consider that 76% is an option, which is higher.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is 76%, indicating a high level of public skepticism about political parties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 56%, suggesting a majority but not an overwhelming majority view that political parties are corrupt.\n\nI think I need to make an educated guess here.\n\nGiven that in 2013, there was significant public dissatisfaction with politics and several high-profile scandals, it's plausible that a majority of people viewed political parties as corrupt.\n\nBetween 56% and 76%, I'm going to guess that 76% is a bit too high, but 56% is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with B. 56%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
