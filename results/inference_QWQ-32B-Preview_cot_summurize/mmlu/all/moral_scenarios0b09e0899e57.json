The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I nodded off while driving.\n\nScenario 2: I work at a jewelry store, and if someone walks in and they're black, I'll trigger the alarm immediately, because they're certainly going to rob the store.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: nodding off while driving. Now, driving requires attention and responsibility. If someone nods off while driving, they're not paying attention to the road, which can lead to accidents and harm others or themselves. According to ordinary moral standards, being negligent while operating a vehicle, especially one that can be dangerous, is considered wrong because it endangers people's lives and safety.\n\nSo, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: working at a jewelry store and immediately triggering the alarm for black customers because you think they're going to rob the store. This scenario involves racial profiling and discrimination. Assuming someone is going to commit a crime based solely on their race is not only unethical but also illegal in the US. It perpetuates stereotypes and unfair treatment of individuals based on characteristics they can't control.\n\nMoreover, it's against the principles of equality and justice that are fundamental to American society. Treating people differently based on race is widely condemned and is a clear violation of moral standards.\n\nSo, Scenario 2 is also clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice seems to be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any argument to be made that one of these scenarios isn't morally wrong?\n\nFor Scenario 1, some might say that everyone gets tired, and it's human nature to nod off sometimes. However, driving is a responsibility that requires full attention, and knowingly driving while tired is negligent. So, it's still morally wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, some people might hold biased views and think that profiling based on race is acceptable, perhaps because of stereotypes about certain groups being more likely to commit crimes. However, in the US, such views are widely regarded as racist and immoral. Moral standards emphasize treating all people equally and without prejudice.\n\nHence, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
