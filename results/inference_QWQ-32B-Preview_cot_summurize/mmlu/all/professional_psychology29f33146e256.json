The question is: \"According to Hersey and Blanchard's situational leadership model, 'employee maturity' is a function of the employee\u2019s:\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. stage of career development.\n\nB. personality.\n\nC. skills and willingness to assume responsibility.\n\nD. beliefs about the meaning and value of work.\n\nI need to remember what Hersey and Blanchard's model says about employee maturity. I think it's related to the employee's ability and willingness to take on tasks and responsibilities.\n\nLet me recall: Hersey and Blanchard's model suggests that leadership style should adapt based on the maturity level of the followers. Maturity, in this context, refers to the ability and willingness of employees to take responsibility for their work.\n\nSo, option C says \"skills and willingness to assume responsibility,\" which sounds a lot like that.\n\nOption A, \"stage of career development,\" might be related, but I don't think it's the exact definition of employee maturity in this model.\n\nOption B, \"personality,\" seems too broad and not specifically tied to the model's definition.\n\nOption D, \"beliefs about the meaning and value of work,\" sounds more like intrinsic motivation or work values, not directly related to maturity in the situational leadership model.\n\nI think C is the best answer here.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check. Hersey and Blanchard defined maturity as the extent to which an individual has the ability and willingness to take responsibility for their own performance. So, it's about their ability (skills) and their willingness (to take responsibility).\n\nYes, that matches option C.\n\nSo, I'm fairly confident that C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
