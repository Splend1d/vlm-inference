Although a number of lawyers applied for the position, one of the applicants submitted a particularly impressive resume. The dean of faculty for the law school immediately wrote to the applicant to offer him the position. In the letter, the dean offered to employ the applicant for the upcoming academic year, which started on August 15, at a salary of $75,000. The letter also listed the employment terms and conditions, one of which stated that professors are entitled to five paid sick days during the year. The dean included a detailed employment contract containing all these terms, for the applicant's signature. After the applicant received this letter, he replied by mail, requesting a salary of $85,000 and sick leave of 10 days. Upon receipt of the applicant's letter, the dean telephoned the applicant and told him that the law school followed the American Bar Association guidelines with respect to salary and sick leave for its professors. The applicant acquiesced on the salary question, but insisted that his sick leave be extended to 10 days. The dean replied, \"Let's not permit a minor issue to stand in the way of your coming to teach at our law school. In the event you require more than 5 sick days, I promise that the matter will be taken care of to your benefit. \" The applicant informed the dean that he would sign the contract and forward it to the dean, which he promptly did. The applicant began teaching at the law school on August 15. Three months later, the applicant was out sick for five days with laryngitis. The applicant did not miss another school day until Monday, March 8, when he fell ill with food poisoning. This illness kept him home for five additional sick days. The applicant returned to work on March 15. When the applicant received his salary check at the end of the week, his check did not include payment for the previous week (from March 8 to March 12). Accompanying the check was a statement that read:\"Salary payment for period from Monday, March 1 through Friday, March 19 with pro rata deduction to reflect five teaching days missed during said period. \"When the applicant received his check, he immediately confronted the dean and requested full payment for the week of March 8 through 12. The dean responded, \"I'm sorry, but there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. \"The applicant asserted a claim against the law school for breach of contract. The applicant offers to introduce evidence that during his telephone conversation with dean of faculty, the dean promised, if necessary, to provide him with additional sick days. The most accurate statement concerning the dean's oral promise would be that\n\nA. parol evidence is admissible to show that the parties assented to their written contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract.\nB. parol evidence is admissible to prove a subsequent oral agreement that varies or contradicts the terms of a prior written contract.\nC. parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract is not enforceable, because of undue influence or fraud.\nD. parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out the correct answer to this question about contract law, specifically regarding the admissibility of parol evidence. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. A law school offered a teaching position to an applicant with a specific salary and sick leave benefits. The applicant initially requested a higher salary and more sick days, but eventually agreed to the law school's terms, signing the contract. Later, when the applicant used more sick days than allotted, the law school deducted pay for those days, leading to a dispute.\n\nThe key point is whether the dean's oral promise to \"take care of\" the sick leave issue beyond the contract terms is admissible as evidence in court. The question presents four options regarding parol evidence, and I need to determine which one is the most accurate.\n\nOption A says that parol evidence is admissible to show that the parties assented to their written contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract. This seems relevant because it suggests that the written contract might not be the final or complete agreement between the parties. If the dean's oral promise is considered an additional term not included in the written contract, then this option might apply.\n\nOption B states that parol evidence is admissible to prove a subsequent oral agreement that varies or contradicts the terms of a prior written contract. In this case, the oral promise came after the written contract was signed, so it could be seen as a subsequent agreement. However, I need to consider the timing and whether the oral promise was indeed subsequent to the written contract.\n\nOption C mentions that parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract is not enforceable due to undue influence or fraud. There's no indication in the scenario of undue influence or fraud, so this option seems less likely.\n\nOption D says that parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract. This is a general rule in contract law that when parties have reduced their agreement to writing, oral statements that contradict the written terms are not admissible.\n\nNow, considering the sequence of events:\n\n1. The law school offered a position with specific terms in writing.\n\n2. The applicant countered with higher salary and more sick days.\n\n3. The dean suggested following ABA guidelines and offered to \"take care of\" any sick day issues beyond the contract.\n\n4. The applicant signed the contract despite the dean's promise.\n\nThe critical question is whether the dean's oral promise is a separate agreement or an attempt to modify the written contract.\n\nIn contract law, when parties have a written contract that is intended to be a final and complete expression of their agreement (an integrated contract), oral evidence that contradicts or varies the terms of that contract is generally inadmissible. This is known as the parol evidence rule.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, if the written contract is not a complete and final integration of the agreement, or if there is evidence of fraud, duress, or mutual mistake, parol evidence may be admissible.\n\nIn this scenario, the written contract specifies five paid sick days. The dean's oral promise to \"take care of\" any sick day issues beyond that could be seen as an additional promise outside the written contract.\n\nGiven that, option A seems plausible because it suggests that the written contract is only a partial integration, meaning that there are additional terms agreed upon orally that are not included in the written document.\n\nOption B could also be considered because the oral promise was made after the written contract was signed, potentially constituting a subsequent agreement.\n\nHowever, the timing is a bit unclear. Did the dean make the oral promise before or after the applicant signed the contract? The scenario says that the applicant signed the contract after the telephone conversation, so the oral promise was likely made before signing.\n\nIf the oral promise was made before signing, it might be considered part of the negotiations leading up to the written contract. In that case, if the written contract is a complete integration, prior oral statements that contradict it would typically be inadmissible.\n\nBut if the oral promise was made contemporaneously with the signing or afterward, it could be considered a separate agreement.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I think option D is the most accurate statement: parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.\n\nThis aligns with the parol evidence rule, which generally prevents oral statements from contradicting the terms of a written contract, especially if the written contract is intended to be complete and final.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely D.\n\nHowever, to ensure I'm not missing something, let's consider the context further.\n\nThe applicant is asserting a claim for breach of contract, and wants to introduce evidence of the dean's oral promise to provide additional sick days beyond the contract terms.\n\nIf the written contract is a complete and integrated agreement, then the oral promise would not be admissible to contradict the written terms regarding sick days.\n\nBut if the parties intended the written contract to be only a partial integration, leaving room for additional terms agreed upon orally, then parol evidence might be admissible.\n\nIn this case, since the written contract specifies five paid sick days, and the dean orally promised to handle any additional sick days, there is a direct contradiction.\n\nUnless there is evidence that the written contract was not intended to be the final agreement, or that there were additional terms agreed upon orally, parol evidence would typically be inadmissible to contradict the written terms.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most accurate statement regarding the admissibility of the dean's oral promise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract."
