                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about the term \"vajra.\" It says \"vajra\" means diamond and which of the following? Then it lists emerald, brilliance, thunderbolt, and lightning as options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"vajra\" actually means. I think it's a term from Buddhism or Hinduism, maybe both. I remember seeing it in some religious contexts, often associated with a specific ritual object.\n\nLet me think about diamond. Diamond is known for its hardness and purity. In spiritual terms, it might symbolize clarity, purity, or indestructibility.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Emerald - that's another type of gemstone, but I don't recall any direct connection between vajra and emerald.\n\nB. Brilliance - diamond is indeed brilliant, reflecting light in spectacular ways. Maybe \"brilliance\" is related to the luminous quality of a diamond.\n\nC. Thunderbolt - I think this is significant. In Buddhism, the vajra is often referred to as a thunderbolt, especially in the context of Vajrayana Buddhism. It's a ritual object that represents both the diamond's hardness and the thunderbolt's power.\n\nD. Lightning - similar to thunderbolt, but I think thunderbolt is more accurate in this context.\n\nLet me check some sources to confirm.\n\nLooking up \"vajra,\" it's a Sanskrit word that indeed means diamond, but it also symbolizes lightning or thunderbolt, particularly in Buddhist and Hindu traditions.\n\nIn Buddhism, especially in Vajrayana Buddhism, the vajra is a ritual object that represents the union of compassion and wisdom, often depicted as a dorje. It's used in rituals and meditation practices.\n\nSo, considering that, both diamond and thunderbolt seem to be directly associated with the term vajra.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Emerald - not directly related.\n\nB. Brilliance - while diamond is brilliant, I think \"brilliance\" might be too general here.\n\nC. Thunderbolt - this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nD. Lightning - similar to thunderbolt, but thunderbolt might be more precise.\n\nI think the best answer is C. Thunderbolt, because in the context of the vajra's symbolic meaning in Buddhism and Hinduism, it's often referred to as a thunderbolt, representing power and indestructibility.\n\nSo, to summarize, \"vajra\" means diamond and thunderbolt.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
