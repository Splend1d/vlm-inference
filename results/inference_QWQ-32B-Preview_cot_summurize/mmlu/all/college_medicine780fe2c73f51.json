                    "text": "Let's see. So, we have this scenario about a guy whose dad is a bricklayer, and he goes to college, becomes a teacher at a medical school, gets promoted to a tenured professor, and then moves across the country for another tenured professor position at a different school. We need to figure out what kinds of mobility he experienced, and in what sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the terms:\n\n- Intergenerational mobility is about comparing the social status or occupation between parents and their children.\n\n- Intragenerational mobility is about changes within a person's own career over time.\n\n- Upward mobility is moving to a higher social status or better job.\n\n- Horizontal mobility is moving to a similar position or status, maybe in a different location or field.\n\nSo, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Intergenerational mobility with respect to the father:**\n\n   - His father is a bricklayer, which is a skilled trade but generally considered lower in social status compared to being a professor at a medical school.\n\n   - The son becomes a teacher at a medical school, which is a higher status job.\n\n   - So, compared to his father, he has moved up socially and professionally. That's intergenerational upward mobility.\n\n2. **Becomes a teacher at a medical school:**\n\n   - Starting his career as a teacher at a medical school.\n\n   - Then he gets promoted to a tenured professor.\n\n   - Promotion from teacher to tenured professor is an advancement within his career, so that's intragenerational mobility.\n\n   - Since he's moving to a higher position, it's upward mobility.\n\n3. **Gets promoted to tenured professor:**\n\n   - Already established that this is upward mobility within his career.\n\n4. **Moves across the country for a new tenured professor position at a different school:**\n\n   - He's maintaining his position as a tenured professor but moving to a different institution.\n\n   - Assuming the new position is comparable in terms of status and salary, this would be horizontal mobility because he's not moving up or down, just changing institutions.\n\nSo, sequentially:\n\n- Intergenerational upward mobility compared to his father.\n\n- Intragenerational upward mobility through promotion.\n\n- Then intragenerational horizontal mobility by moving to a different school at the same level.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, horizontal mobility, horizontal mobility\n\n- This isn't correct because the first mobility is intergenerational upward, and the second is intragenerational upward, not horizontal.\n\nB. intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, upward mobility, upward mobility\n\n- This is confusing because intragenerational mobility is about changes within the son's own career, which includes both upward and horizontal moves.\n\nC. intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, upward mobility, horizontal mobility\n\n- This seems closest to what we've determined.\n\nD. intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, horizontal mobility, upward mobility\n\n- This puts intragenerational first, but intergenerational is about comparing to the father, which is a different type of mobility.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct sequence:\n\n- Intergenerational mobility with respect to the father (upward).\n\n- Then intragenerational upward mobility (promotion to tenured professor).\n\n- Then intragenerational horizontal mobility (moving to a different school at the same level).\n\nWait a second, option C says \"upward mobility\" and \"horizontal mobility\" but doesn't specify intragenerational for the last two. Maybe I need to read it again.\n\nOption C: intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, upward mobility, horizontal mobility\n\n- The first part is intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, which is upward.\n\n- The second part is upward mobility, which is intragenerational.\n\n- The third part is horizontal mobility, which is also intragenerational.\n\nSo, this seems to match our analysis.\n\nOption A has intergenerational mobility first, then two horizontal mobilities, which isn't accurate because the promotion was upward.\n\nOption B has intragenerational mobility first, which could be confusing because intergenerational is a different type.\n\nOption D has intragenerational mobility first, then horizontal, then upward, which mixes the order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
