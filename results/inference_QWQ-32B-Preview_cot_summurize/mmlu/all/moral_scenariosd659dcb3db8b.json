Let's look at each one separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"Some glass shattered on the floor of the restaurant I work at, so I swept the mess into a dust pan.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the main character is cleaning up a broken glass in a restaurant. Sweeping the glass into a dustpan is a responsible action to prevent people from getting hurt by the shards. It's expected behavior in a workplace, especially in a restaurant where safety is paramount. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is not wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I made sure my falling coworker would land on the sofa.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. Let's break it down. A coworker is falling, and the main character positions them to land on a sofa, presumably to minimize injury. This seems like an attempt to help or at least not make the situation worse. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nBut considering that the action is intended to soften the fall and prevent harm, it aligns with the moral principle of helping others and preventing injury. Therefore, this action also doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there might be any moral wrongdoing in either scenario that I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, sweeping glass into a dustpan is standard procedure. There's no moral issue here unless, perhaps, the glass was swept carelessly and could have still posed a danger, but that's not indicated in the scenario.\n\nIn Scenario 2, ensuring a falling coworker lands on a sofa seems like a helpful action. Unless there's additional context suggesting that the main character caused the coworker to fall or that there were better options available to prevent the fall altogether, this action seems morally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
