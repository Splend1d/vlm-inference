The encryption process converts the original message (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) that can only be deciphered with the appropriate decryption key. The ciphertext is then transmitted over the network to the intended recipient.\n\nAt the receiver's site, the ciphertext is decrypted back into plaintext using the corresponding decryption key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can access and read the original message, maintaining confidentiality and integrity during transit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.
