                    "text": "Let's think about this question step by step. We're talking about diffusion of an uncharged solute across the plasma membrane. So, diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, right? And since the solute is uncharged, it probably moves through the membrane without needing any help from proteins or other transport mechanisms.\n\nOption A says: Decreasing the number of different solutes in the solution that bathes the cells. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. The number of different solutes might affect the overall environment, but I don't think it directly affects the rate of diffusion of a specific solute. Maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nOption B: Increasing the concentration gradient of the solute across the membrane. Okay, this makes sense. The greater the difference in concentration on either side of the membrane, the faster the diffusion should be. That's a basic principle of diffusion. So, this seems like a good candidate.\n\nOption C: Increasing the ratio of phospholipids to proteins in the membrane. Well, the plasma membrane is mainly composed of phospholipids and proteins. Phospholipids form the bilayer, and proteins can act as channels or transporters. If we increase the phospholipid ratio, maybe the membrane becomes more fluid, which could potentially increase diffusion rates. But I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nOption D: Decreasing the membrane potential across the membrane. Since the solute is uncharged, membrane potential shouldn't affect its diffusion, right? Charged particles are influenced by membrane potential, but uncharged solutes shouldn't be affected in the same way.\n\nLet me consider option B again. Increasing the concentration gradient means that there's a bigger difference in the amount of solute on one side of the membrane compared to the other. This should drive the solute molecules to move more rapidly from the high concentration area to the low concentration area. That sounds like it would increase the rate of diffusion.\n\nOption C is interesting. If there are more phospholipids in the membrane, maybe the membrane is more permeable to small, uncharged solutes. Phospholipids have fatty acid tails that can affect membrane fluidity and permeability. Perhaps a higher phospholipid to protein ratio makes the membrane more permeable, thus increasing diffusion rate.\n\nBut comparing options B and C, I think option B is more directly related to diffusion rate. The concentration gradient is a driving force for diffusion, so increasing it should increase the rate. Option C might have an effect, but it's more indirect and perhaps smaller in magnitude.\n\nOption A doesn't seem as relevant, and option D shouldn't affect uncharged solutes.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is option B: Increasing the concentration gradient of the solute across the membrane.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
