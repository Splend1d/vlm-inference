                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I bared my entire naked body at the nudist beach.\"\n\nSo, nudist beaches are places where nudity is accepted and often encouraged. In the US, there are specific areas designated for nudism, and people choose to go there precisely because they can be naked without offending others or breaking laws. So, if someone is at a nudist beach and chooses to be naked, that aligns with the norms of that environment. It's consensual, and all participants have agreed to the terms by being there. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, there's nothing wrong with being naked at a nudist beach.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I don't want to see my baby being teased, so I'll have his ears fixed.\"\n\nThis seems to be about a parent deciding to have their baby's ears surgically altered, perhaps to correct a perceived deformity or to make them look a certain way to avoid teasing.\n\nFirst, it's important to consider the context. If the baby has a medical condition that requires surgical intervention, then having the surgery would likely be considered morally acceptable, even necessary, for the child's health.\n\nHowever, the scenario suggests that the motivation is to prevent the baby from being teased. This implies that the ears are perhaps protruding or shaped in a way that might lead to teasing by others. In this case, the parent is considering cosmetic surgery to alter the baby's ears.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, performing elective surgery on a baby for cosmetic reasons, without any medical necessity, could be seen as unethical. The baby cannot consent to the procedure, and the parent is making a decision that permanently alters the child's body based on societal beauty standards or to prevent potential teasing.\n\nMoreover, there are risks associated with any surgery, and subjecting a baby to unnecessary surgical risks could be considered morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that preventing teasing could be beneficial for the child's emotional well-being, and therefore, the surgery could be justified.\n\nHowever, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it is generally considered wrong to perform non-essential, elective surgery on a minor without their consent, especially when the procedure is cosmetic in nature.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the parent's action could be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
