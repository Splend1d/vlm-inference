                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about treaties and how they affect third States\u2014those that aren't directly party to the treaty. The question is: Do treaties bind third States, that is, non-State parties?\n\nWe have four options here:\n\nA. Treaties may create only rights for third States.\n\nB. Treaties create both obligations and rights for third States.\n\nC. Treaties do not create obligations or rights for third States without their consent.\n\nD. Treaties do not create any obligations or rights for third States, even when the latter consent.\n\nFirst off, it's important to understand that treaties are agreements between States, and generally, they are intended to bind the parties that have consented to them. This principle is often referred to as the principle of \"pacta sunt servanda,\" which means \"agreements must be kept,\" and it's a fundamental principle in international law.\n\nNow, regarding third States, the general rule is that a treaty does not create either obligations or rights for a State not party to it without that State's consent. This is in line with the principle of sovereignty, where States are free to decide which obligations they undertake internationally.\n\nLet's look at each option more closely:\n\nOption A says that treaties may create only rights for third States. This suggests that treaties could impose only benefits or privileges on non-party States. However, this isn't entirely accurate because, in some cases, treaties can have effects on third States that aren't purely beneficial.\n\nOption B claims that treaties create both obligations and rights for third States. This seems broad and might not align with the general principles of treaty law, especially considering that third States haven't consented to the treaty.\n\nOption C states that treaties do not create obligations or rights for third States without their consent. This sounds in line with the principle of sovereignty and the general rules of treaty law.\n\nOption D says that treaties do not create any obligations or rights for third States, even when the latter consent. This seems too absolute because there are mechanisms in international law that allow third States to be bound by treaties through their consent.\n\nSo, based on this initial analysis, option C appears to be the most accurate.\n\nHowever, it's worth delving deeper to ensure that there aren't exceptions or specific scenarios where treaties can create obligations or rights for third States without their consent.\n\nIn international law, there are indeed some exceptions to the general rule. For example:\n\n1. **Third State consent:** If a third State expresses its consent to be bound by the treaty or its provisions, either explicitly or through conduct, then the treaty can create obligations or rights for that State.\n\n2. **Customary international law:** Sometimes, treaty rules can evolve into customary international law, which would then bind all States, whether or not they are party to the treaty, provided that there is a widespread practice accepted as law.\n\n3. **Succession of States:** In cases where a new State is created or there is a transfer of territory, the obligations under treaties may be inherited by the new State, depending on the circumstances.\n\n4. **Treaties intended to be multilateral from the outset:** In some cases, treaties are designed to be open to all States, and provisions may have effects on non-party States.\n\nBut in general, without the consent of the third State, a treaty does not create legal obligations or rights for that State.\n\nGiven this, option C seems to be the correct answer: Treaties do not create obligations or rights for third States without their consent.\n\nOption D, which says that treaties do not create any obligations or rights for third States, even when the latter consent, contradicts the possibility of third States consenting to be bound by treaties. So, option D is too broad and incorrect.\n\nOption A is too narrow because it only considers the creation of rights for third States, ignoring the potential for obligations.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that treaties automatically create both obligations and rights for third States, which isn't in line with the general principles of treaty law.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C: Treaties do not create obligations or rights for third States without their consent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
