                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out in which scenario there might be no perceived Doppler shift when there's a source of sound and a detector. The options are:\n\nA. The source is moving towards a stationary detector.\n\nB. The detector is moving towards a stationary source.\n\nC. Both the source and detector are moving in the same direction.\n\nD. Both the source and detector are moving in opposite directions, moving away from each other.\n\nI know that the Doppler effect is about how the frequency of waves changes for an observer moving relative to the wave source. Usually, if something is moving towards you, the frequency increases, and if it's moving away, it decreases. But here, it's asking for a situation where there's no perceived Doppler shift. That seems tricky.\n\nLet me think about option A: the source is moving towards a stationary detector. In this case, the source is moving towards the detector, so the waves are bunched up in front of the source, and the detector should perceive a higher frequency. So, there should be a Doppler shift here.\n\nOption B: the detector is moving towards a stationary source. Similarly, if the detector is moving towards the source, it should encounter the waves more frequently, perceiving a higher frequency again. So, Doppler shift should be present here too.\n\nOption C: both the source and detector are moving in the same direction. This seems more interesting. If they're both moving in the same direction, whether there's a Doppler shift depends on their relative speeds. If they're moving at the same speed, maybe the relative velocity between them is zero, which could mean no Doppler shift. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nOption D: both are moving in opposite directions, moving away from each other. In this case, the source and detector are moving apart, so the frequency should decrease for the detector, meaning there is a Doppler shift.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the situation where there is NO perceived Doppler shift. So, based on my initial thoughts, it might be option C if they're moving at the same speed.\n\nLet me try to recall the formula for Doppler shift. I think it's something like f' = f * (v \u00b1 v_d) / (v \u00b1 v_s), where f' is the observed frequency, f is the source frequency, v is the speed of sound, v_d is the detector's velocity, and v_s is the source's velocity. The signs depend on the direction of motion.\n\nIf both the source and detector are moving in the same direction with the same speed, then v_s = v_d, and maybe the velocities cancel out in the formula, leading to no shift.\n\nLet me plug in some values to see. Suppose v = 343 m/s (speed of sound in air), v_s = 10 m/s, v_d = 10 m/s, both moving in the same direction.\n\nSo, f' = f * (343 + (-10)) / (343 - 10) = f * (333) / (333) = f.\n\nAh, so if they're both moving in the same direction with the same speed, the observed frequency is the same as the source frequency. That makes sense. So, in this case, there is no Doppler shift.\n\nBut what if they're moving in the same direction but at different speeds? Let's say v_s = 10 m/s, v_d = 15 m/s.\n\nThen, f' = f * (343 + (-15)) / (343 - 10) = f * (328) / (333) \u2248 f * 0.985, which is slightly lower than f. So, there would be a Doppler shift in that case.\n\nTherefore, only when they're moving in the same direction at the same speed, there's no Doppler shift.\n\nNow, let's check option D: both moving in opposite directions, moving away from each other. So, the source is moving away from the detector, and the detector is moving away from the source.\n\nIn this case, v_s and v_d are in opposite directions. Using the formula, f' = f * (v + v_d) / (v + v_s), since both are moving away.\n\nIf v_s and v_d are both positive in the same direction, but in this case, they're moving in opposite directions, so one velocity should be negative.\n\nLet me assume that the source is moving away from the detector with velocity v_s, and the detector is moving away from the source with velocity v_d. So, both velocities are in the direction away from each other.\n\nThen, f' = f * (v - v_d) / (v + v_s). Both v_d and v_s are positive because they're moving away.\n\nThis would mean f' = f * (343 - v_d) / (343 + v_s), which is less than f, indicating a Doppler shift.\n\nTherefore, in option D, there is a Doppler shift.\n\nSo, the only scenario where there is no perceived Doppler shift is when both the source and detector are moving in the same direction at the same speed.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, option C says \"both the source and detector travel in the same direction.\" It doesn't specify that they're moving at the same speed. In general, they could be moving at different speeds, in which case there would be a Doppler shift.\n\nLooking back, in option C, it's possible that there is no Doppler shift if they're moving at the same speed in the same direction.\n\nBut the question is about which situation it is possible that there is no perceived Doppler shift.\n\nGiven that in option C, if they're moving at the same speed in the same direction, there is no Doppler shift, whereas in other options, there is always a Doppler shift.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
