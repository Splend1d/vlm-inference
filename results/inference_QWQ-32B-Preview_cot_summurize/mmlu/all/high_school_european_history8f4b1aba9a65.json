His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nA nineteenth-century Russian historian evaluating this passage would probably be most interested in\n\nA. the Russian interest in French culture\nB. the spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners\nC. the sense of continual class struggle\nD. the need for noblesse oblige\n"

                    "text": "I've got this passage from \u00c9mile Zola's \"Germinal,\" and it's a bit dense, but I need to figure out what a nineteenth-century Russian historian would find most interesting about it. The options are:\n\nA. the Russian interest in French culture\n\nB. the spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners\n\nC. the sense of continual class struggle\n\nD. the need for noblesse oblige\n\nFirst, I need to understand the passage. It seems like there's a character named Souvarine who's Russian, and he's disappointed with the political situation in his country. His former comrades have turned to politicians, and he's disillusioned because they're focusing on national liberation instead of his idea of creating a new society based on communal labor.\n\nSouvarine has given up his rank and fortune to live among workers, hoping to build this new society, but he's found that the fusion between him and the workers hasn't happened. He's now critiquing French workmen, specifically some hatworkers who won a lottery and invested the money instead of sharing it or using it for collective benefit. Souvarine accuses them of wanting to live without working and being envious of the bourgeoisie, desiring to be wealthy themselves rather than overthrowing the class system.\n\nOkay, so this passage seems to be about political ideologies, class struggles, and the differences between Russian and French approaches to social change. Now, considering a nineteenth-century Russian historian reading this, what would likely capture their interest the most?\n\nOption A is about Russian interest in French culture. While there might be some truth to that, especially since French culture was influential in Russia at the time, I don't know if that's the primary focus here. The passage is more about political ideas and class struggles rather than cultural exchanges.\n\nOption B mentions the spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners. While that might be present in the novel, it's not the main point of this particular passage. Souvarine is actually expressing disappointment that the fusion between him and the workers hasn't occurred as he'd hoped.\n\nOption C is about the sense of continual class struggle. This seems very relevant because the entire passage is about different classes and their attitudes towards wealth and labor. Souvarine is critiquing both the Russian nobility he's abandoned and the French workmen for not truly embracing communal labor and equality.\n\nOption D talks about the need for noblesse oblige, which is the idea that with wealth and status comes responsibility to help those less fortunate. Souvarine has renounced his rank and fortune to live among workers, which could be seen as an expression of noblesse oblige, but his critique is more about the failure of both Russian and French approaches to achieve true social equality.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the Russian historian would be most interested in the sense of continual class struggle, which is option C. This is because the passage delves into the persistent divisions between classes and the difficulties in achieving a united front for social change, which would be a significant topic for a historian studying nineteenth-century social and political developments.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Souvarine is a Russian character discussing these issues, and the comparison with French workmen, suggests that Zola is exploring universal themes of class conflict across different cultures. A Russian historian would likely find this comparative perspective on class struggle particularly intriguing, as it relates to the ongoing debates and movements in Russia at the time.\n\nAdditionally, given that Zola wrote \"Germinal\" in 1885, during a period of significant social and political upheaval in both France and Russia, the theme of class struggle was highly relevant. Russian historians of the time were probably interested in understanding the dynamics of class conflict and its implications for social and political reform.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that a nineteenth-century Russian historian evaluating this passage would be most interested in the sense of continual class struggle, making option C the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
