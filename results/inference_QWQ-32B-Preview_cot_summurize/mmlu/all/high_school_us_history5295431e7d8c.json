                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about desegregation of schools and trying to figure out which historical initiative it's connecting to. The quote is from the Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954, where the Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. So, desegregation of schools was a direct result of that decision.\n\nNow, the question is asking about \"unfulfilled promises\" from one of these initiatives: The Great Society, The Square Deal, The New Deal, or Reconstruction. I need to think about which of these had promises related to racial equality and education that hadn't been fully realized by the time of the Brown v. Board decision.\n\nLet's start with Reconstruction. Reconstruction was the period after the Civil War, from 1865 to 1877, when the nation was trying to rebuild and integrate the Southern states back into the Union. During this time, there were efforts to grant former slaves their rights, including the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, which abolished slavery, granted citizenship and equal protection under the law, and gave African American men the right to vote, respectively.\n\nOne of the key aspects of Reconstruction was the establishment of public schools for African Americans in the South, as many didn't have access to education before. So, there were promises and efforts to provide education to formerly enslaved people during this time. However, by the early 20th century, segregation was enforced through Jim Crow laws, which included segregated schools that were often poorly funded and inferior to white schools.\n\nSo, when the Brown v. Board case came around in 1954, it was, in part, a response to the fact that the promises of equal education made during Reconstruction had not been fulfilled. Segregated schools were still the norm, and the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 had led to unequal facilities and opportunities for African American students.\n\nNow, let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nThe Square Deal was a set of domestic policies proposed by President Theodore Roosevelt around 1901-1909. It focused on consumer protection, control of large corporations, and conservation of natural resources. It didn't really address issues of racial equality or education in the same way as Reconstruction did.\n\nThe New Deal was a series of programs and reforms implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s in response to the Great Depression. While some New Deal programs benefited African Americans, others were discriminatory, and overall, the New Deal didn't specifically address racial inequality in education.\n\nThe Great Society was a set of domestic programs pushed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s, aimed at eliminating poverty and racial injustice. This included the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but again, these came after the Brown v. Board decision in 1954.\n\nSo, considering the timeline and the focus on education and racial equality, it seems that Reconstruction is the most appropriate answer. The promises made during Reconstruction regarding equal rights and education for African Americans hadn't been fully realized by the mid-20th century, leading to the need for the Brown v. Board decision to mandate desegregation of schools.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
