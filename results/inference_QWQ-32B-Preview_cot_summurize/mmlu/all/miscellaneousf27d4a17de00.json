He is traditionally depicted as living in Sherwood Forest, which is located in Nottinghamshire, England. The forest was a royal hunting ground during the medieval period, providing a suitable setting for Robin Hood's adventures.\n\nOption A, the Black Forest, is located in Germany and is not associated with Robin Hood.\n\nOption B, the Petrified Forest, is located in Arizona, USA, and is known for its ancient fossilized trees. It has no connection to Robin Hood.\n\nOption C, Nottingham Forest, is a football club based in Nottingham, England. While it is geographically close to Sherwood Forest, it is not the forest where Robin Hood lived.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Sherwood Forest."
