                    "text": "I think the answer is B: \"what do you mean? and how do you know?\" But let me think this through.\n\nPhilosophy is about identifying beliefs and evaluating arguments that support those beliefs. So, first, it's about understanding what people mean by their beliefs\u2014clarifying concepts and ideas. That seems like \"what do you mean?\" And then, evaluating the arguments that support those beliefs would involve asking \"how do you know?\"\u2014questioning the evidence or reasoning behind those beliefs.\n\nOption A: \"why should we bother? and what are the consequences of our believing one thing over another?\"\u2014this sounds more like considering the practical implications of beliefs, which is important in philosophy, especially in areas like ethics or the philosophy of action. But the core activities of identifying beliefs and evaluating arguments might be more directly related to understanding and justifying those beliefs, which aligns more with option B.\n\nOption C: \"who really believes X? and how can we explain differences in people's beliefs?\"\u2014this seems more like a sociological or psychological approach to beliefs, rather than a philosophical one. Philosophy is more concerned with the nature of beliefs and the rational justification for them, not so much who holds them or why there are differences, at least not primarily.\n\nOption D: \"how do philosophers argue? and are their differences important?\"\u2014this seems meta-philosophical, focusing on the methods and practices of philosophy itself. While important, it doesn't directly capture the primary activities of identifying beliefs and evaluating arguments that support them.\n\nSo, coming back to option B: \"what do you mean? and how do you know?\" These questions seem to directly address the tasks of clarifying beliefs and assessing the arguments behind them. \"What do you mean?\" helps in understanding the precise nature of the belief, and \"how do you know?\" challenges the believer to provide justification or evidence for that belief.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the best answer. But to be thorough, let's consider if any other option could also fit.\n\nOption A is attractive because it touches on the importance of beliefs and their consequences, which is relevant in applied philosophy. However, the core activities of philosophy, as stated in the question, are identifying beliefs and evaluating arguments. These are more aligned with understanding and justifying beliefs, which option B captures.\n\nOption C shifts the focus to who believes what and the explanations for differences, which seems more like social science than philosophy.\n\nOption D is about the practice of philosophy itself, which is a step removed from the primary activities of identifying and evaluating beliefs.\n\nHence, option B seems the most directly relevant to the core activities of philosophy as described in the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
