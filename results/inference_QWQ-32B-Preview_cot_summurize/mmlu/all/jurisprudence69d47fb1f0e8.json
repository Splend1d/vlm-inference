The options are Holland, Salmond, Austin, and Kelsen. I need to recall who among these scholars made this distinction.\n\nFirst, let's remember what \"general\" and \"particular\" jurisprudence mean. General jurisprudence is usually about the fundamental principles and theories of law that apply universally, whereas particular jurisprudence deals with the specific legal systems and their unique features.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Holland - I think Holland is associated with analytical jurisprudence, but I'm not sure if he specifically distinguished between general and particular jurisprudence.\n\nB. Salmond - He wrote \"Jurisprudence,\" which is a well-known textbook. I believe he discussed different branches of jurisprudence, so maybe he made this distinction.\n\nC. Austin - He is known for his command theory of law. I think he focused more on the concept of law as commands from the sovereign, but I'm not sure if he specifically differentiated between general and particular jurisprudence.\n\nD. Kelsen - He is associated with the pure theory of law and the hierarchy of norms. His work is more focused on a general theory of law, but I don't recall if he made this particular distinction.\n\nLet me think again. I recall that Salmond, in his book \"Jurisprudence,\" discusses various aspects of law, including general and particular jurisprudence. He might have defined and differentiated between these two.\n\nOn the other hand, Holland also wrote about jurisprudence, but I don't remember if he specifically made this distinction.\n\nAustin's \"Province of Jurisprudence Determined\" is more about defining the scope of jurisprudence as the general principles of law, but I don't think he\u533a\u5206\u4e86general\u548cparticular jurisprudence.\n\nKelsen's work is more about a general theory of law, and I don't recall him making this specific distinction.\n\nSo, based on my memory, I think the answer is B. Salmond.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I should look it up or think more deeply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Holland did make this distinction. Maybe I need to recall more about Holland's contributions to jurisprudence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Austin did mention this in his work, but I might have forgotten.\n\nWait, maybe it was Kelsen who discussed general and particular jurisprudence.\n\nHmm, I'm starting to doubt my initial answer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the context in which these scholars worked and their main contributions.\n\nSalmond's \"Jurisprudence\" is a comprehensive work that covers both general theories and specific legal systems. So, it makes sense that he would distinguish between general and particular jurisprudence.\n\nSimilarly, Holland's works might also include such a distinction, but I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was Austin who first made this distinction.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a specific scholar who explicitly drew this distinction.\n\nGiven that, I think Salmond is the most likely candidate.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with B. Salmond.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
