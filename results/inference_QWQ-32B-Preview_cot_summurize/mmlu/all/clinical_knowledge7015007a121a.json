                    "text": "I'm trying to remember the correct ratio for CPR compressions and ventilations. I know it's important to get this right to perform CPR effectively. Let me think... I recall that there are different ratios for adults and children, but I think the standard ratio for adults is 30 compressions to 2 ventilations. Wait, but let's check the options provided.\n\nOption A is 2:25. That seems off because it suggests 2 compressions for every 25 ventilations, which doesn't make sense. In CPR, there are supposed to be more compressions than ventilations to maintain blood flow.\n\nOption B is 15:2. I think that used to be the ratio in the past, but I believe it has been updated. I think the current guideline is 30 compressions to 2 ventilations.\n\nOption C is 1:5. That would mean one compression for every five ventilations, which again seems like too many ventilations relative to compressions.\n\nOption D is 30:2:00. This seems to confirm what I was thinking. 30 compressions followed by 2 ventilations. The \":00\" at the end might just be a typo or an error in formatting.\n\nLet me double-check this. The American Heart Association (AHA) updated their guidelines a few years ago, and they recommend a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2 for adult CPR. This means you perform 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths, and you repeat this cycle until help arrives or the person starts breathing on their own.\n\nI think it's important to note that for infants and children, the ratio might be different. For instance, for children, it's often 15:2, and for infants, it might be 30:2 or different depending on the number of rescuers. But since the question doesn't specify, I'm assuming it's referring to adult CPR.\n\nAlso, in hands-only CPR, which is CPR performed without rescue breaths, you would just do continuous compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute. But since the question is about the ratio of compressions to ventilations, I think the answer should be the traditional 30:2 ratio.\n\nI remember that the reason for the 30:2 ratio is to balance the need for oxygen delivery with the need to maintain blood flow. Too many ventilations can actually cause problems like gastric inflation, which can lead to aspiration. So, the 30:2 ratio is designed to optimize both circulation and oxygenation.\n\nMoreover, the depth and rate of compressions are also crucial. For adult CPR, compressions should be at least 2 inches deep and at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute. The compressions need to allow the chest to fully recoil after each compression to ensure proper blood flow.\n\nRescue breaths should be delivered over one second each, making sure the person's head is tilted back and the chin is lifted to open the airway. You should see the chest rise with each breath.\n\nIt's also important to minimize interruptions in compressions. Any pauses should be as brief as possible to maintain blood flow.\n\nIn real-life scenarios, performing CPR can be challenging, especially if you're not trained or if you're dealing with an emergency situation. That's why it's crucial for everyone to take CPR training courses, where they can learn the proper techniques and practice them under the guidance of instructors.\n\nIn summary, based on current AHA guidelines, the correct ratio for CPR compressions and ventilations in adults is 30:2. So, the answer should be D. 30:2:00, assuming that the \":00\" is extraneous.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
