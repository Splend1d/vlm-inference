                    "text": "Let's see. The psychologist is talking about misbehavior in children and how parents should use appropriate consequences. They also mention that misbehavior can have different goals, like confirming an assumed disability, getting attention, power, or revenge. I need to figure out which theoretical orientation this relates to among the options: Rogerian, Transactional analysis, Adlerian, or Psychodynamic.\n\nFirst, I should recall what each of these orientations is about.\n\nRogerian psychology, named after Carl Rogers, is part of humanistic psychology. It focuses on the individual's self-concept, self-esteem, and the idea that people have an innate drive toward self-actualization. It's more about the person's potential and personal growth rather than misbehavior, so I'm not sure if that's the right fit here.\n\nTransactional analysis is a theory developed by Eric Berne. It looks at how people interact with each other and categorizes behaviors into parent, adult, and child states, known as ego states. It's used in understanding communication and personality. While it does deal with interactions, the specific focus on misbehavior and its goals seems a bit off for transactional analysis.\n\nAdlerian psychology, developed by Alfred Adler, emphasizes the social context and the individual's search for belonging and significance. Adler introduced the concept of misbehavior and saw it as a way children attempt to deal with their feelings of inferiority or to gain attention, power, revenge, or to avoid failure. This sounds very similar to what the psychologist is describing.\n\nPsychodynamic psychology, associated with Sigmund Freud and his followers, focuses on the unconscious processes that influence behavior. It involves concepts like repression, defense mechanisms, and the dynamics between the id, ego, and superego. While it does look at behavior, the specific categorization of misbehavior goals mentioned doesn't seem central to psychodynamic theory.\n\nGiven this, the Adlerian orientation seems to be the most aligned with the psychologist's statements. Adlerian psychology directly addresses misbehavior and categorizes it into goals such as attention, power, revenge, and avoidance, which matches what's described in the question.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Adlerian.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
