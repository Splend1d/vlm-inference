Its official title is Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 2. It is one of Beethoven's most famous works and is particularly known for its first movement, which has a dreamy, melancholic quality that gives it the nickname \"Moonlight.\" The sonata was dedicated to Beethoven's pupil and friend, Countess Giulietta Guicciardi.\n\nThe term \"Moonlight Sonata\" was actually coined by music critic Ludwig Rellstab, who compared the sonata's mood to moonlight shining on Lake Lucerne, several years after Beethoven's death. The sonata is a significant work in the history of piano music, showcasing Beethoven's innovative approach to form and expression.\n\nTo provide some context, let's briefly look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Mozart: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a prolific composer of the Classical period, known for his symphonies, concertos, sonatas, and operas. While he composed many piano sonatas, the \"Moonlight Sonata\" is not among them.\n\nB. Handel: George Frideric Handel was a Baroque composer known for his operas, oratorios, and instrumental works. His most famous work is likely the \"Messiah\" or \"Water Music.\" He did not compose the \"Moonlight Sonata.\"\n\nC. Bach: Johann Sebastian Bach was another Baroque composer, renowned for his complex and intricate compositions, including works like the \"Brandenburg Concertos,\" \"Mass in B Minor,\" and numerous keyboard works. However, the \"Moonlight Sonata\" is not by Bach.\n\nBeethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" is a prime example of his early Romantic style, bridging the Classical and Romantic periods in music history. Its enduring popularity is a testament to Beethoven's genius and the universal appeal of his music."
