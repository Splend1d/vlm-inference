Let's see if there's a repeating pattern here.\n\nLet's list more terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nF11 = 89 \u2192 89 mod 4 = 1\nF12 = 144 \u2192 144 mod 4 = 0\nF13 = 233 \u2192 233 mod 4 = 1\nF14 = 377 \u2192 377 mod 4 = 1\nF15 = 610 \u2192 610 mod 4 = 2\nF16 = 987 \u2192 987 mod 4 = 3\nF17 = 1597 \u2192 1597 mod 4 = 1\nF18 = 2584 \u2192 2584 mod 4 = 0\nF19 = 4181 \u2192 4181 mod 4 = 1\nF20 = 6765 \u2192 6765 mod 4 = 1\n...\n\nHmm, looking at the remainders:\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, ...\n\nIt seems like the sequence of remainders repeats every 6 terms:\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, then repeats.\n\nWait, let's check that:\n\nFrom F1 to F6:\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0\n\nF7 to F12:\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0\n\nF13 to F18:\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0\n\nF19 to F24:\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0\n\nYes, the remainders repeat every 6 terms.\n\nSo, the sequence of remainders has a cycle length of 6.\n\nTherefore, to find the remainder of the 100th term when divided by 4, we can find the position of 100 within these cycles.\n\nFirst, divide 100 by 6 to find how many full cycles there are and the position within the cycle.\n\n100 \u00f7 6 = 16 cycles with a remainder of 4.\n\nSo, 100 = 16 * 6 + 4\n\nThat means the 100th term has the same remainder as the 4th term in the cycle.\n\nLooking back at the remainders:\n\nPosition 1: 1\nPosition 2: 1\nPosition 3: 2\nPosition 4: 3\nPosition 5: 1\nPosition 6: 0\n\nSo, the 4th position has a remainder of 3.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
