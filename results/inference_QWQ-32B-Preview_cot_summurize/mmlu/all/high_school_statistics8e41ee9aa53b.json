                    "text": "To determine the range of t-values that would give a p-value of 0.075 for a one-sided test with a sample size of 14, we need to use the t-distribution table or a statistical software. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the degrees of freedom (df):**\n   The degrees of freedom for a t-test with a sample size \\( n \\) is \\( df = n - 1 \\). So, for \\( n = 14 \\), \\( df = 13 \\).\n\n2. **Understand the p-value:**\n   A p-value of 0.075 for a one-sided test means that the probability of observing a t-value as extreme as the one calculated from the sample, assuming the null hypothesis is true, is 0.075.\n\n3. **Find the t-values corresponding to p = 0.075:**\n   Since it's a one-sided test, we look for the t-value that corresponds to an upper tail probability of 0.075 with 13 degrees of freedom.\n\n4. **Using t-tables or software:**\n   - In a t-table, find the row for 13 degrees of freedom.\n   - Look for the column closest to an upper tail probability of 0.075.\n\nHowever, standard t-tables may not have exact p-values, so we might need to interpolate between values.\n\nAlternatively, using statistical software or an online calculator, we can find the exact t-value for p = 0.075 and df = 13.\n\nLet's assume we're using a t-table:\n\n- For df = 13, find the t-values corresponding to upper tail probabilities just above and just below 0.075.\n\nSuppose the t-table shows:\n\n- For p = 0.10, t \u2248 1.350\n\n- For p = 0.05, t \u2248 1.771\n\nSince 0.075 is between 0.10 and 0.05, the corresponding t-value should be between 1.350 and 1.771.\n\nBut to get a more precise range, we might need to look at more detailed tables or use interpolation.\n\nAlternatively, using a more detailed table or software, we might find:\n\n- t-value for p = 0.075, df = 13 is approximately 1.525\n\nBut since we don't have exact values, we need to select the range that includes this approximate value.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1.345 < t < 1.761\n\nB. 1.356 < t < 1.782\n\nC. 1.771 < t < 2.160\n\nD. 1.350 < t < 1.771\n\nGiven that the t-value for p = 0.075 should be between the t-values for p = 0.10 and p = 0.05, which are approximately 1.350 and 1.771 for df = 13, the correct range should be within these two values.\n\nTherefore, option D (1.350 < t < 1.771) seems to be the most appropriate.\n\nHowever, to confirm, let's consider that the p-value is 0.075, which is closer to 0.10 than to 0.05, so the t-value should be closer to 1.350 than to 1.771.\n\nBut option D includes both bounds, so it's a reasonable choice.\n\nOption A has lower bounds, but df = 13 should correspond to t-values as per option D.\n\nOption C has higher t-values, which correspond to smaller p-values (more significant), so they are not relevant for p = 0.075.\n\nOption B has similar bounds to option D but slightly higher.\n\nGiven that, option D is the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
