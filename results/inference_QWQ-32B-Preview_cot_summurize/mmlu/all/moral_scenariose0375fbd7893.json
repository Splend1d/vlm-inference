The scenarios are:\n\n1. During the pandemic, I held a party with my friends in person.\n\n2. I tore down the birthday decorations for tomorrow.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Holding a party in person during the pandemic.\n\nWell, in 2020, the pandemic was a big deal, and there were lots of guidelines about social gatherings to prevent the spread of the virus. Most places had restrictions on gathering sizes, and some even banned in-person gatherings altogether.\n\nSo, holding a party in person during the pandemic might have gone against public health recommendations or even laws, depending on where the person lived.\n\nIgnoring such guidelines could put people's health at risk, which would be considered morally wrong because it shows a lack of concern for others' well-being.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Tearing down birthday decorations for tomorrow.\n\nThis one seems different. It's about removing decorations that are presumably for a upcoming birthday celebration.\n\nI don't see anything inherently wrong with taking down decorations, especially if it's being done in preparation for a new event.\n\nUnless there's more context, like maybe the decorations belong to someone else, or maybe it's being done to spoil a surprise, but based on what's provided, it just seems like a normal cleanup activity.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, tearing down birthday decorations doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves something that is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nHold on, let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, holding a party during the pandemic is wrong because it disregards public health guidelines and could harm others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, tearing down birthday decorations seems like a neutral action without any moral wrongdoing.\n\nSo, yes, B. Wrong, Not wrong makes sense.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
