                    "text": "I'm trying to remember the statistics on adult overweight rates around 2016. I think it was somewhere around 40%, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see what I can recall.\n\nFirst, I know that being overweight is defined by having a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher. Normal weight is considered to be a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9, and obesity starts at BMI 30 and above.\n\nI recall that in the United States, overweight and obesity rates have been rising over the past few decades. In the 1960s, overweight rates were lower, maybe around 30%, but by the early 2000s, it had increased significantly.\n\nI think around 2016, the percentage of adults who were overweight was quite high. Let me consider the options:\n\nA. 10% - That seems too low. Even in countries with lower obesity rates, it's unlikely to be only 10%.\n\nB. 20% - That also seems low. In many developed countries, overweight rates are higher than that.\n\nC. 40% - This seems plausible. I think in the US, around 2016, about 40% of adults were considered overweight, not including those who were obese.\n\nD. 80% - That seems too high. I don't think any country had such a high percentage of overweight adults in 2016.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that the question is asking for overweight adults, which includes both overweight and obese categories. Or is it just overweight, excluding obesity?\n\nLooking back at the question: \"about what percentage of adults aged 18 years or older were overweight?\"\n\nIt specifies \"overweight,\" which, as I mentioned earlier, is BMI 25 or higher, excluding obesity, which starts at BMI 30.\n\nBut sometimes, in general discourse, \"overweight\" can include obesity. Maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nActually, in medical and nutritional terms, \"overweight\" is BMI 25 to 29.9, and \"obesity\" is BMI 30 and above. So, the question might be referring specifically to overweight, not including obesity.\n\nIf that's the case, then the percentage would be different from the combined overweight and obesity percentage.\n\nI recall that in the US, around 2016, the combined percentage of overweight and obesity was about 70% or higher.\n\nIf overweight is about 30-40%, and obesity is about 30-40%, their sum would be around 70-80%.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. If overweight is 30-40% and obesity is 30-40%, the total would be 60-80%.\n\nBut I think the actual statistics are that around 2016, about 30-35% were overweight, and about 35-40% were obese, making the total close to 70-75%.\n\nBut the question is only asking about overweight, not including obesity.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is C. 40%.\n\nBut if overweight is 30-35%, and obesity is 35-40%, then C. 40% would include both categories.\n\nWait, no. If overweight is BMI 25-29.9, and obesity is BMI 30 and above, then overweight is separate from obesity.\n\nSo, the percentage of overweight adults would be distinct from the percentage of obese adults.\n\nTherefore, if the total percentage of adults with BMI 25 and above is around 70-75%, and obesity is about 35-40%, then overweight would be the difference, which is about 30-35%.\n\nBut looking back at the options, C is 40%, which seems a bit high if overweight is around 30-35%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some countries, the overweight rate is higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a global statistic, not just the United States.\n\nIf it's a global percentage, then the rate would be different.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), worldwide, in 2016, around 39% of adults were overweight, and 13% were obese.\n\nSo, globally, about 39% were overweight, excluding obesity.\n\nBut in high-income countries, the percentage might be higher.\n\nIn the US, as I recall, around 2016, about 35-40% were overweight, and about 35-40% were obese.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent because the total would exceed 100%.\n\nNo, overweight is BMI 25-29.9, and obesity is BMI 30 and above, so they are separate categories.\n\nSo, if 35% are overweight and 35% are obese, the total percentage of adults with BMI 25 and above would be 70%.\n\nBut according to WHO, globally, 39% are overweight and 13% are obese, totaling about 52%.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify the region, so it might be referring to a global statistic.\n\nIf that's the case, then about 39% were overweight, which is closest to C. 40%.\n\nAlternatively, if it's referring specifically to the United States, then the percentage might be higher.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify, I'll go with the global statistic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
