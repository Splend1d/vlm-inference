                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about affirmative action and trying to understand what it involves. The question has a sentence with blanks that need to be filled with the appropriate words from the given choices.\n\nThe sentence is: \"Affirmative action involves ________ attempts to target ______ who are _________ within an organisation's workforce, for instance by trying to ______ the proportion of women, disabled or racial minorities in senior management positions.\"\n\nAnd there are four options:\n\nA. Proactive, Groups, Under-represented, Increase\n\nB. Passive, Groups, Under-represented, Retain\n\nC. Proactive, Individuals, Represented, Increase\n\nD. Passive, Individuals, Represented, Retain\n\nFirst, I need to understand what affirmative action is. Affirmative action is a policy or a set of practices designed to improve opportunities for historically excluded or under-represented groups in society. This can include actions aimed at increasing access and equity in education, employment, and other areas.\n\nSo, looking at the first blank: \"________ attempts.\" Given that affirmative action is proactive in nature, meaning it takes active steps to correct imbalances, I think \"proactive\" fits better than \"passive.\" Passive approaches might involve waiting for changes to happen without taking specific actions, which isn't typically what affirmative action entails.\n\nNext, \"to target ________.\" The question is whether affirmative action targets \"groups\" or \"individuals.\" Affirmative action is generally directed at groups that have been historically disadvantaged, so \"groups\" seems more appropriate than \"individuals.\" Individual approaches might be part of broader strategies, but the core of affirmative action is addressing group inequalities.\n\nThen, \"who are _________ within an organisation's workforce.\" The blank needs to be filled with a term that describes the status of these groups in the workforce. Given that affirmative action aims to help those who are under-represented or have fewer opportunities, \"under-represented\" makes more sense than \"represented.\" If a group is already represented, there may not be a need for affirmative action unless it's to ensure their continued inclusion.\n\nFinally, \"trying to ______ the proportion of women, disabled or racial minorities in senior management positions.\" Here, the goal is typically to increase the proportion of these under-represented groups in positions where they have been historically underrepresented, such as senior management.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Proactive, Groups, Under-represented, Increase\n\nThis seems to align well with my understanding.\n\nB. Passive, Groups, Under-represented, Retain\n\nPassive doesn't seem right, as affirmative action is proactive. Also, \"retain\" might not capture the full scope; while retaining members of under-represented groups is important, the primary goal is often to increase their numbers and provide equal opportunities.\n\nC. Proactive, Individuals, Represented, Increase\n\nTargeting individuals rather than groups goes against the typical approach of affirmative action, which focuses on groups. Additionally, \"represented\" doesn't make sense because the aim is to increase the proportion of under-represented groups.\n\nD. Passive, Individuals, Represented, Retain\n\nAgain, passive and individuals don't align with the proactive group-focused nature of affirmative action.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
