                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about reactions that include energy as one of their reactants. The options are exergonic reaction, hydrolysis reaction, endergonic reaction, and redox reaction. I think I remember something about energy in reactions, but I need to recall the specifics.\n\nFirst, let's think about what it means for energy to be a reactant. That probably means that the reaction needs energy to proceed, right? It's not producing energy, but rather consuming it.\n\nI recall that exergonic reactions release energy, so those would have energy as a product, not a reactant. That might mean exergonic reactions are when energy is released, so they probably don't fit here.\n\nHydrolysis reactions involve breaking bonds using water, and I don't think energy is necessarily a reactant in those. Although, maybe in some cases, but I'm not sure.\n\nEndergonic reactions\u2014now, that sounds familiar. I think endergonic reactions are those that require energy to proceed, meaning energy is a reactant. Yes, that seems to fit.\n\nRedox reactions are about electron transfer, and while they can involve energy changes, I don't think energy is explicitly a reactant in them.\n\nLet me double-check. If energy is a reactant, that means the reaction needs energy input to occur. Endergonic reactions are characterized by needing more energy than they release, so they require energy input.\n\nOn the other hand, exergonic reactions release energy, so energy is a product.\n\nHydrolysis can be either endergonic or exergonic, depending on the specific reaction.\n\nRedox reactions are classified based on electron transfer, not directly on energy consumption or release.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the answer should be C. endergonic reaction.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up the definitions quickly.\n\nLooking it up: Endergonic reactions are those in which the standard free energy change is positive, meaning they require energy input to proceed.\n\nExergonic reactions have a negative standard free energy change, meaning they release energy.\n\nHydrolysis is a specific type of reaction involving water, and redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons.\n\nSo, indeed, endergonic reactions are those that require energy as a reactant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. endergonic reaction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
