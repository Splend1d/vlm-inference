                    "text": "So I have this problem here: find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q. The options are 0, 4, 2, and 6. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what a field extension is and how to find its degree.\n\nI know that a field extension is when you take a base field, in this case, Q (the rational numbers), and you add some elements to it to create a larger field. Here, we're adding sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) to Q. The degree of the extension is the dimension of the larger field as a vector space over the base field.\n\nSo, to find the degree, I need to find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) over Q and then see its degree. The degree of the minimal polynomial will be the same as the degree of the extension.\n\nAlright, let's set alpha = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3). I need to find the minimal polynomial of alpha over Q. The minimal polynomial is the monic polynomial of least degree that has alpha as a root.\n\nFirst, I'll try to express alpha in terms of sqrt(2) and sqrt(3). So, alpha = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3). Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots, maybe?\n\nalpha^2 = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))^2 = 2 + 2*sqrt(6) + 3 = 5 + 2*sqrt(6)\n\nHmm, still have a square root here. Maybe I should isolate the sqrt(6) term.\n\nalpha^2 - 5 = 2*sqrt(6)\n\nNow, square both sides again:\n\n(alpha^2 - 5)^2 = (2*sqrt(6))^2\n\nalpha^4 - 10*alpha^2 + 25 = 4*6\n\nalpha^4 - 10*alpha^2 + 25 = 24\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nalpha^4 - 10*alpha^2 + 1 = 0\n\nSo, the polynomial p(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 has alpha as a root. Is this the minimal polynomial?\n\nWell, I need to check if this polynomial is irreducible over Q. If it is, then it's the minimal polynomial since it's monic and has alpha as a root.\n\nLet me see if p(x) can be factored into quadratic polynomials over Q.\n\nSuppose p(x) = (x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d), where a, b, c, d are in Q.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\nx^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (b + d + a c)x^2 + (a d + b c)x + b d\n\nSet equal to p(x):\n\nx^4 + 0x^3 - 10x^2 + 0x + 1\n\nSo, we have the system:\n\na + c = 0\n\nb + d + a c = -10\n\na d + b c = 0\n\nb d = 1\n\nFrom a + c = 0, we get c = -a.\n\nFrom b d = 1, since b and d are rationals, possible pairs are (1,1) and (-1,-1).\n\nLet's try b = 1, d = 1.\n\nThen, c = -a.\n\nNow, b + d + a c = 1 + 1 + a*(-a) = 2 - a^2 = -10\n\nSo, 2 - a^2 = -10 => a^2 = 12 => a = sqrt(12) or -sqrt(12), but a is rational. So no solution here.\n\nNow, try b = -1, d = -1.\n\nThen, c = -a.\n\nb + d + a c = -1 -1 + a*(-a) = -2 - a^2 = -10 => a^2 = 8 => a = sqrt(8) or -sqrt(8), but again, not rational.\n\nSo, no rational coefficients satisfy the factorization into quadratics.\n\nTherefore, p(x) is irreducible over Q, hence it is the minimal polynomial of alpha over Q.\n\nSince the degree of p(x) is 4, the degree of the extension Q(alpha)/Q is 4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if p(x) is indeed the minimal polynomial. Maybe there's a polynomial of lower degree that has alpha as a root.\n\nLet me check if alpha satisfies a quadratic equation over Q.\n\nSuppose alpha satisfies a quadratic equation: a alpha^2 + b alpha + c = 0, with a, b, c in Q.\n\nFrom earlier, alpha^2 = 5 + 2 sqrt(6).\n\nSo, a (5 + 2 sqrt(6)) + b (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) + c = 0\n\nThis gives: 5a + c + 2a sqrt(6) + b sqrt(2) + b sqrt(3) = 0\n\nFor this to hold, the coefficients of the linearly independent terms must be zero.\n\nAssuming that 1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6) are linearly independent over Q, then:\n\n5a + c = 0\n\n2a = 0\n\nb = 0\n\nb = 0\n\nFrom 2a = 0, a = 0.\n\nThen, from 5a + c = 0, c = 0.\n\nAnd b = 0.\n\nSo, the only solution is a = b = c = 0, meaning there's no non-trivial quadratic equation that alpha satisfies over Q.\n\nTherefore, the minimal polynomial is indeed the degree 4 polynomial I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))/Q is 4.\n\nBut let me think another way. Maybe I can consider the tower of extensions.\n\nLet me set beta = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3).\n\nI know that Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is a extension of Q with degree 4, since sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both algebraic over Q, and their degrees multiply because Q(sqrt(2)) has degree 2 over Q, and Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has degree 2 over Q(sqrt(2)), since sqrt(3) is not in Q(sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] * [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] = 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nNow, is Q(beta) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))?\n\nIf yes, then [Q(beta) : Q] = 4.\n\nLet me check if Q(beta) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nClearly, beta is in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), so Q(beta) is contained in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nIs the reverse true? Does Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) contain Q(beta)?\n\nWell, if I can express sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) in terms of beta, then yes.\n\nLet me try to express sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) in terms of beta = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3).\n\nLet me denote beta = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3).\n\nThen, beta - sqrt(2) = sqrt(3).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(beta - sqrt(2))^2 = 3\n\nbeta^2 - 2 beta sqrt(2) + 2 = 3\n\nbeta^2 + 2 - 3 = 2 beta sqrt(2)\n\nSo, 2 beta sqrt(2) = beta^2 - 1\n\nThen, sqrt(2) = (beta^2 - 1)/(2 beta)\n\nSince beta is in Q(beta), and Q(beta) is a field, it contains all rational expressions in beta, so sqrt(2) is in Q(beta).\n\nSimilarly, since sqrt(3) = beta - sqrt(2), and both beta and sqrt(2) are in Q(beta), then sqrt(3) is also in Q(beta).\n\nTherefore, Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is contained in Q(beta), and since we already have Q(beta) contained in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), they are equal.\n\nTherefore, Q(beta) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), and [Q(beta) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = 4.\n\nSo, the degree of the extension is 4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the minimal polynomial being degree 4, and now I've confirmed that Q(beta) has degree 4 over Q.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any chance that the degree could be less than 4.\n\nSuppose that sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) satisfies a polynomial of degree less than 4. But I already checked that there's no quadratic polynomial that alpha satisfies, so the minimal polynomial must be of degree at least 3.\n\nBut I found a degree 4 polynomial, and confirmed that there's no quadratic polynomial, and also that the extension degree is 4.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the minimal polynomial could be cubic.\n\nLet me try to see if alpha satisfies a cubic equation.\n\nSuppose a alpha^3 + b alpha^2 + c alpha + d = 0, with a, b, c, d in Q.\n\nFrom earlier, alpha^2 = 5 + 2 sqrt(6)\n\nAlpha^3 = alpha * alpha^2 = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))(5 + 2 sqrt(6)) = sqrt(2)*5 + sqrt(2)*2 sqrt(6) + sqrt(3)*5 + sqrt(3)*2 sqrt(6)\n\n= 5 sqrt(2) + 2 sqrt(12) + 5 sqrt(3) + 2 sqrt(18)\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) = 2 sqrt(3), sqrt(18) = 3 sqrt(2)\n\nSo, alpha^3 = 5 sqrt(2) + 4 sqrt(3) + 5 sqrt(3) + 6 sqrt(2) = (5 sqrt(2) + 6 sqrt(2)) + (4 sqrt(3) + 5 sqrt(3)) = 11 sqrt(2) + 9 sqrt(3)\n\nNow, plug into the cubic equation:\n\na (11 sqrt(2) + 9 sqrt(3)) + b (5 + 2 sqrt(6)) + c (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) + d = 0\n\nThis gives:\n\n11a sqrt(2) + 9a sqrt(3) + 5b + 2b sqrt(6) + c sqrt(2) + c sqrt(3) + d = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(11a + c) sqrt(2) + (9a + c) sqrt(3) + 2b sqrt(6) + (5b + d) = 0\n\nAgain, assuming 1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6) are linearly independent over Q, their coefficients must be zero:\n\n11a + c = 0\n\n9a + c = 0\n\n2b = 0\n\n5b + d = 0\n\nFrom 2b = 0, b = 0.\n\nFrom 5b + d = 0, d = 0.\n\nFrom 11a + c = 0 and 9a + c = 0, subtract the equations:\n\n(11a + c) - (9a + c) = 0 => 2a = 0 => a = 0.\n\nThen, from 11a + c = 0, c = 0.\n\nSo, a = b = c = d = 0.\n\nThus, the only solution is the trivial one, meaning there's no non-zero cubic polynomial over Q that alpha satisfies.\n\nTherefore, the minimal polynomial is indeed of degree 4, and the extension degree is 4.\n\nBut let me consider another approach. Maybe using the tower law.\n\nWe have Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q(sqrt(2)), and Q(sqrt(2)) over Q.\n\nWe know [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] = 2, since minimal polynomial is x^2 - 2.\n\nSimilarly, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] = 2, since sqrt(3) is not in Q(sqrt(2)), and its minimal polynomial is x^2 - 3 over Q(sqrt(2)).\n\nTherefore, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = 4.\n\nSince Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), as shown earlier, then [Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) : Q] = 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4.\n\nBut the options include 6, which might suggest that someone is thinking about [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] * [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] = 2 * 3 = 6, but that would be if sqrt(3) had degree 3 over Q(sqrt(2)), which it doesn't, since sqrt(3) satisfies x^2 - 3 over Q(sqrt(2)), which is degree 2.\n\nSo, perhaps that's a common mistake, thinking that sqrt(3) has degree 3 over Q(sqrt(2)), but actually it's degree 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct degree is 4.\n\nOption B is 4, so that should be the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
