                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about operant extinction. So, operant extinction is a behavior modification technique where a particular behavior is no longer reinforced, leading to a decrease in that behavior over time. The question is asking in which scenario operant extinction would NOT be the treatment of choice. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"an alternative behavior cannot be identified.\" In behavior modification, it's often important to replace undesirable behaviors with more appropriate ones. If an alternative behavior can't be identified, operant extinction might still be used, but it might not be as effective because there's nothing to replace the extinct behavior with. However, extinction itself can still be applied; it just might lead to a void in behavior that could be filled by other, possibly undesirable, behaviors. So, while it's not ideal, extinction could still be used in this scenario.\n\nOption B: \"the behavior has been reinforced on a continuous schedule.\" Operant extinction is actually more effective when a behavior has been reinforced on a continuous schedule because once reinforcement stops, the behavior should decrease rapidly. This is because the organism has learned that every instance of the behavior leads to reinforcement, so when that stops, the behavior becomes ineffective. Therefore, this doesn't seem like a reason to avoid using operant extinction.\n\nOption C: \"a temporary increase in the behavior cannot be tolerated.\" This is an important point. When extinction is applied, there is often a phenomenon called the \"extinction burst,\" where the behavior temporarily increases before it decreases. This can be challenging, especially in situations where the behavior is harmful or disruptive. In such cases, a temporary increase might not be tolerable, and therefore, operant extinction might not be the best approach. Instead, other strategies like differential reinforcement of other behaviors (DRO) or punishment might be considered, depending on the situation.\n\nOption D: \"the baseline levels of the behavior cannot be established.\" Establishing baseline levels is crucial in behavior modification to measure the effectiveness of any intervention, including extinction. Without a baseline, it's hard to know if the behavior is actually decreasing or not. However, even without a precise baseline, operant extinction can still be applied by simply removing reinforcement for the behavior. It might just be harder to evaluate its success. So, while having a baseline is ideal, extinction can still be attempted without one.\n\nConsidering all these points, option C seems to be the most compelling reason why operant extinction would not be the treatment of choice. The temporary increase in behavior during an extinction burst could be too problematic to tolerate in certain situations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
