(1982) are credited with developing this concept. So, I need to recall what exactly they identified as the components of hardiness.\n\nOption A says confidence, competence, and control. That sounds familiar, but I think control is definitely one of them. Confidence and competence seem related, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what Kobasa outlined.\n\nOption B says commitment, challenge, and control. Hmm, commitment and challenge ring a bell. I think this might be the correct one.\n\nOption C has common sense, commitment, and capability. Common sense doesn't sound like it fits with hardiness. Maybe capability is similar to competence, but I don't recall common sense being part of hardiness.\n\nOption D is capability, challenge, and commitment. This is similar to option B, but with capability instead of challenge. I think challenge is one of the components.\n\nLet me think back to what I've learned about hardiness. Kobasa's research suggested that hardy individuals have three main attributes: commitment, control, and challenge. Commitment refers to being involved and interested in what's happening around them. Control is about believing that they can influence events and outcomes. Challenge is about seeing change as an opportunity for growth rather than a threat.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, option B matches this description: commitment, challenge, and control.\n\nI think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
