Lombroso believed that these biological anomalies could be identified through measurements of the skull, jaw, eye size, and other physical features. His work was influential in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but has since been largely discredited due to its reliance on pseudoscientific methods and its deterministic view of human behavior."
