Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Discount retailers: These are stores that sell products at lower prices than other retailers. They often achieve this by buying in large quantities directly from manufacturers, reducing overhead costs, and sometimes offering a more limited selection of products. So, they focus on low prices and cost efficiency.\n\nB. Convenience stores: These are small stores that offer a variety of items, often located in areas where people can easily access them, like near homes or workplaces. They usually have higher prices because they provide convenience, not necessarily low prices.\n\nC. Category killer stores: These are large stores that focus on a specific product category, like electronics or sporting goods, and offer a wide assortment within that category. They might have competitive pricing, but their main selling point is the depth of their product selection, not necessarily the lowest prices.\n\nD. Limited line retailers: These stores carry a narrow line of products, focusing on specific items or brands. Their pricing can vary, but they don't necessarily emphasize low prices as their main selling point.\n\nConsidering the question is about retailers that use low prices as a major selling point combined with reduced costs of doing business, option A, discount retailers, seems to fit best. They specifically aim for low prices and achieve that by controlling costs through efficient operations and bulk purchasing.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Discount retailers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
