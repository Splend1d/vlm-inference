                    "text": "So I have this problem here: a number \\( x \\) equals \\( 2^{15} \\times 3^6 \\). I need to find out which number, when cubed, equals \\( x \\). The options are 288, 27, 125, and 121.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it's asking. So, if there's a number, let's call it \\( y \\), such that \\( y^3 = x \\), then I need to find \\( y \\). Given that \\( x = 2^{15} \\times 3^6 \\), I can set up the equation \\( y^3 = 2^{15} \\times 3^6 \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( y \\), I can take the cube root of both sides. So, \\( y = \\sqrt[3]{2^{15} \\times 3^6} \\).\n\nI remember that the cube root of a product is the product of the cube roots, so \\( y = \\sqrt[3]{2^{15}} \\times \\sqrt[3]{3^6} \\).\n\nNow, I can simplify each cube root separately. For \\( \\sqrt[3]{2^{15}} \\), I know that \\( \\sqrt[3]{a^b} = a^{b/3} \\). So, \\( \\sqrt[3]{2^{15}} = 2^{15/3} = 2^5 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\sqrt[3]{3^6} = 3^{6/3} = 3^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( y = 2^5 \\times 3^2 \\).\n\nNow, I just need to calculate \\( 2^5 \\) and \\( 3^2 \\). \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 3^2 = 9 \\).\n\nSo, \\( y = 32 \\times 9 \\).\n\nLet me compute that: 32 times 9 is 288.\n\nSo, \\( y = 288 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options, 288 is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could have expressed \\( y \\) as \\( 2^a \\times 3^b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are exponents such that \\( 3a = 15 \\) and \\( 3b = 6 \\), because when you cube \\( y \\), you get \\( 2^{3a} \\times 3^{3b} \\), which should equal \\( 2^{15} \\times 3^6 \\).\n\nSo, solving \\( 3a = 15 \\) gives \\( a = 5 \\), and \\( 3b = 6 \\) gives \\( b = 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( y = 2^5 \\times 3^2 = 32 \\times 9 = 288 \\), which confirms my earlier result.\n\nIs there any other way to verify this?\n\nWell, I could cube 288 and see if it equals \\( 2^{15} \\times 3^6 \\).\n\nFirst, \\( 288 = 2^5 \\times 3^2 \\), as I calculated.\n\nThen, \\( 288^3 = (2^5 \\times 3^2)^3 = 2^{15} \\times 3^6 \\), which matches \\( x \\).\n\nSo, that checks out.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider the other options and see why they're not correct.\n\nOption B is 27. Let's cube 27 and see what we get.\n\n\\( 27^3 = 19683 \\).\n\nBut \\( x = 2^{15} \\times 3^6 \\). Let's calculate that.\n\n\\( 2^{15} = 32768 \\) and \\( 3^6 = 729 \\), so \\( x = 32768 \\times 729 \\), which is way larger than 19683. So, 27 is too small.\n\nOption C is 125. Cubing that: \\( 125^3 = 1,953,125 \\).\n\nNow, \\( x = 32768 \\times 729 \\). Let's see, 32768 times 700 is 22,937,600, and 32768 times 29 is 950,272, so total is around 23,887,872. That's much larger than 1,953,125. So, 125 is also too small.\n\nOption D is 121. Cubing that: \\( 121^3 = 1,771,561 \\).\n\nAgain, compared to \\( x \\) which is around 23,887,872, 1,771,561 is still much smaller.\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is A, which is 288.\n\nAlternatively, if I look back at how I calculated \\( y = 2^5 \\times 3^2 = 32 \\times 9 = 288 \\), and confirmed that \\( y^3 = x \\), I can be confident that A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{288} \\]"
