                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which property can help me determine the sign of charge carriers in a doped semiconductor. The options are magnetic susceptibility, Hall coefficient, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity. I think the Hall effect might be relevant here, but let me think it through.\n\nFirst, what is doping in semiconductors? Doping is when impurities are added to a semiconductor to increase its conductivity. Depending on the type of impurity, you can get either n-type or p-type semiconductors. N-type has excess electrons as charge carriers, and p-type has excess holes.\n\nSo, the sign of the charge carrier would be negative for n-type and positive for p-type, since electrons are negative and holes are positive charges.\n\nNow, how can I measure which type it is?\n\nOption A: Magnetic susceptibility. This measures how a material responds to an external magnetic field. Semiconductors are generally diamagnetic, meaning they weakly repel magnetic fields. I don't think this property directly tells me about the charge carriers' sign.\n\nOption B: Hall coefficient. The Hall effect occurs when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to a current flowing through a material, and a voltage difference is measured perpendicular to both the current and the magnetic field. The sign of the Hall voltage can indicate the sign of the charge carriers.\n\nIn a semiconductor, if electrons are the majority carriers, the Hall voltage will have one sign, and if holes are the majority, it will have the opposite sign. So, the Hall coefficient, which is related to the Hall voltage, should be able to tell me the sign of the charge carriers.\n\nOption C: Electrical resistivity. This measures how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current. Both n-type and p-type semiconductors can have similar resistivities depending on the doping level. So, resistivity alone doesn't tell me about the sign of the charge carriers.\n\nOption D: Thermal conductivity. This measures how well a material conducts heat. While it's related to the movement of particles in the material, it doesn't directly indicate the sign of the charge carriers.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, the Hall coefficient seems to be the most direct way to determine the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any scenario where the Hall coefficient wouldn't be able to determine the carrier type? I don't think so, because the sign of the Hall coefficient is directly related to the sign of the majority charge carriers.\n\nAlso, in some materials, like intrinsic semiconductors at room temperature, there are both electrons and holes, but generally, in doped semiconductors, one type dominates.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. Hall coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
