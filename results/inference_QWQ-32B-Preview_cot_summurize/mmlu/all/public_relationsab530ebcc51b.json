So, option D sounds good because it directly measures changes in people's attitudes.\n\nOption A, content analysis of media coverage, might show how the media is talking about the campaign, but it doesn't necessarily tell us how the audience's attitudes have changed.\n\nOption B, studying blog postings, could give some insights into public opinion, but it's not as systematic or direct as measuring opinions before and after the campaign.\n\nOption C, analyzing sales reports, is more about the outcome in terms of sales, but it doesn't directly measure changes in audience attitudes. People might buy more because of the campaign, but they might also buy more due to other factors like price changes or competitors' actions.\n\nSo, I think option D, conducting a pre and post analysis of constituents' opinions, is the most effective way to evaluate the campaign's impact on audience attitudes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
