                    "text": "Let's see what's going on here. So, there's a homeowner who hired a painter to paint his house for $10,000. But right before starting, the painter decides to go on vacation and calls a handyman who has painted for him before. The painter tells the handyman, \"If you paint the house, you can keep the $10,000 from the homeowner.\" The handyman agrees, goes to the house, starts painting, but the homeowner comes back, sees the handyman, gets confused, and tells him to get off the property because he wanted the original painter. The handyman is only 50% done and gets kicked out. Now, if the handyman sues the homeowner, what will likely happen?\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand the relationships and contracts here. There's a contract between the homeowner and the painter for $10,000 to paint the house. Then, the painter delegates his job to the handyman, saying the handyman can keep the $10,000. The handyman agrees to this arrangement.\n\nNow, the homeowner didn't know about this delegation, and when he finds out, he tells the handyman to leave. So, the handyman did some work but wasn't allowed to finish.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Recover for unjust enrichment.\n\nUnjust enrichment is when someone benefits at another's expense without paying for it, and it's unfair. Here, the homeowner got some painting done by the handyman, but he didn't agree to it. The homeowner probably wouldn't consider it a benefit since he wanted the original painter. So, it's unclear if this would apply.\n\nB. Recover under the doctrine of substantial performance.\n\nSubstantial performance is when a party has completed most of their contractual obligations, and only minor details are left. In such cases, they can still recover payment for the work done, minus any damages for the incomplete parts.\n\nBut here, there's no direct contract between the handyman and the homeowner. The handyman had an agreement with the painter, not the homeowner. So, this might not apply.\n\nC. Not recover, because his arrangement with the painter was not in writing.\n\nIs there a requirement for the delegation to be in writing? In general, delegations of contractual duties might need to be in writing if the original contract requires it or if it's for a significant amount. But here, it's not specified. Also, oral contracts are generally enforceable for services, especially if partially performed.\n\nD. Not recover, because there was no contract between the handyman and the homeowner.\n\nThis seems relevant. The handyman's agreement was with the painter, not directly with the homeowner. So, from the homeowner's perspective, he has a contract with the painter, not the handyman.\n\nBut, in contract law, if one party delegates their duties to a third party, and the third party performs, the original contracting party might still have to pay, but it's complicated.\n\nWait, in this case, the painter delegated his duties to the handyman, and the handyman started performing. But the homeowner didn't consent to this delegation. So, that might be a problem.\n\nIn contract law, delegation is allowed unless the contract specifically prohibits it or the performance depends on the personal skills of the contractor.\n\nHere, the homeowner probably wanted the painter specifically, given that he hired him in the first place. So, if the painter delegated to someone else without the homeowner's consent, that might be a breach of contract.\n\nFrom the handyman's perspective, he has an agreement with the painter to perform the painting and keep the $10,000. But since he was only 50% done when he was told to leave, he might argue that he should be paid for the work he's already done.\n\nHowever, since there's no direct contract between the handyman and the homeowner, it's unclear if the handyman can sue the homeowner directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the handyman could sue the painter for breach of contract if the painter isn't going to pay him for the work done.\n\nBut the question is about the handyman suing the homeowner.\n\nLet me think about unjust enrichment again. The homeowner received some benefit (partial painting) from the handyman's labor, even if it wasn't what he intended. In unjust enrichment cases, the court might require the homeowner to pay for the value of the benefit received to prevent unfair enrichment.\n\nBut, the homeowner might argue that he didn't want the handyman's services and that he was only acting to enforce his contract with the painter.\n\nAlso, the handyman knew that he didn't have a direct contract with the homeowner; he had an agreement with the painter.\n\nMoreover, the painter promised to let the handyman keep the $10,000, but that was likely contingent on completing the job. Since the handyman was only 50% done, he might only be entitled to half.\n\nBut again, since there's no direct contract, it's unclear.\n\nOption B mentions substantial performance, but as I thought earlier, that typically applies when there's a direct contract between the parties, and one party has performed substantially, but not entirely, per the contract terms.\n\nHere, the handyman doesn't have a direct contract with the homeowner, so substantial performance might not apply.\n\nOption C suggests not recovering because the arrangement with the painter wasn't in writing. But in many jurisdictions, contracts for personal services don't need to be in writing unless they exceed a certain value or fall under the Statute of Frauds. Since the value is $10,000, which might be above the threshold, perhaps the arrangement needs to be in writing.\n\nHowever, the arrangement was between the painter and the handyman, and it's possible that the painter is bound by it, but the homeowner isn't a party to that agreement.\n\nAlternatively, if the delegation wasn't in writing, it might not be enforceable, but that would be between the painter and the handyman, not directly affecting the homeowner.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that the handyman doesn't have a direct claim against the homeowner because there was no contract between them. The handyman's agreement was with the painter, so any recovery would likely need to come from the painter, not the homeowner.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the handyman cannot recover from the homeowner, making option D the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider unjust enrichment one more time. Even though there's no direct contract, unjust enrichment is an equitable doctrine that might allow recovery in some cases.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the homeowner didn't voluntarily accept the handyman's services; he was only made aware after the fact and immediately objected. So, it's possible that the court wouldn't impose a obligation on the homeowner to pay for the handyman's services.\n\nAdditionally, allowing the handyman to recover from the homeowner could potentially interfere with the homeowner's contract with the original painter.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems most likely that the handyman cannot recover from the homeowner because there was no contract between them, making option D the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
