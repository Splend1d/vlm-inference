The name comes from its position in the constellation Sagittarius. It is approximately 26,000 light-years from Earth and has a mass about 4 million times that of our Sun. The asterisk (*) in its name denotes that it is an active radio source.\n\nThe other options are not correct for the following reasons:\n\nA. Altair A* - Altair is a star in the constellation Aquila and does not have a black hole associated with it named Altair A*.\n\nB. Alsephina A* - Alsephina is a star in the constellation Vela and there is no known black hole associated with it named Alsephina A*.\n\nC. Fomalhaut A* - Fomalhaut is a bright star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus. While it has a prominent debris disk and an exoplanet, there is no known black hole associated with it named Fomalhaut A*.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Sagittarius A*.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
