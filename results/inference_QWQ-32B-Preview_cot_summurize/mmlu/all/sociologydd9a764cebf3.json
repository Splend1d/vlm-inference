It's about how people produce the things they need to live and how they arrange their social relations in the process.\n\nOption A seems a bit too narrow. It talks about \"the way in which products are made in a factory.\" While factories are certainly places of production, especially under capitalism, Marx's concept is broader. It encompasses not just the technical aspects of production but also the social relations involved.\n\nOption B mentions \"the average measure of productivity under capitalism.\" This seems to focus specifically on capitalism and productivity, which might be a component of the mode of production, but again, it feels too narrow. Marx's idea of mode of production applies to different societies and historical epochs, not just capitalism.\n\nOption C says \"the organization of a society's technical and human resources.\" That sounds promising. It touches on both the technical means of production and the social relations between people involved in production. Marx indeed emphasized that the mode of production includes the forces of production (like tools, technology, and labor power) and the relations of production (like ownership and the social organization of labor).\n\nOption D refers to \"an integral part of the superstructure of society.\" Wait, in Marx's theory, the superstructure includes political and legal institutions, as well as cultural and ideological elements, which are built upon the economic base, which includes the mode of production. So, actually, the mode of production is part of the base, not the superstructure. Therefore, this option seems incorrect.\n\nGiven this, option C appears to be the most accurate definition of Marx's concept of mode of production. It captures both the technical and social aspects involved in how a society produces its goods and organizes its labor force.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
