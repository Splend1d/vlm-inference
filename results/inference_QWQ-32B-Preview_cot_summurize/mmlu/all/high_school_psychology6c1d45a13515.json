Michelle watches David Letterman on TV but doesn't recognize him when she sees him in person in Manhattan. We need to figure out which effect on perception this best illustrates among the options given: convergence, context, proximity, and closure.\n\nLet's break down each option to understand them better:\n\nA. Convergence: This term is often used in psychology to refer to the coming together of different elements or processes. In perception, it might relate to how our eyes work together to focus on an object, but that doesn't seem directly related to Michelle's situation.\n\nB. Context: Context refers to the surroundings or conditions that influence how we perceive something. Our perception can change based on the environment or the situation we're in. For example, seeing someone in a different setting might make it harder to recognize them.\n\nC. Proximity: This principle suggests that things that are close to each other are perceived as being related. In perception, proximity affects how we group objects together, but it's not directly about recognizing individuals in different settings.\n\nD. Closure: This is the tendency to see complete objects even when parts are missing. It's about filling in gaps to perceive a whole object. While interesting, it doesn't seem directly relevant to Michelle's inability to recognize David Letterman in person.\n\nNow, considering Michelle's situation: she watches David Letterman on TV but doesn't recognize him in person in Manhattan. This suggests that her perception of him is tied to the context in which she sees him. On TV, he's likely in a studio setting, perhaps with specific lighting, camera angles, and surroundings that make him easily recognizable to her. However, in Manhattan, perhaps on the street, the context is entirely different. The lighting, surroundings, and possibly his attire or demeanor might be different, making it hard for her to recognize him.\n\nThis scenario seems to best illustrate the effect of context on perception. The environment in which she sees David Letterman influences her ability to recognize him. On TV, the context is familiar, but in Manhattan, the context is unfamiliar, leading to a failure in recognition.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. context.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
