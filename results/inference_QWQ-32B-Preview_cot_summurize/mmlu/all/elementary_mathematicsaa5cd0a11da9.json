I should make sure to align the numbers correctly by their place values.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the numbers one below the other:\n\n```\n  365\n+  56\n```\n\nNow, I'll add the digits starting from the rightmost side, which is the ones place.\n\nAdding the ones place: 5 + 6 = 11. That's more than 10, so I need to write down 1 and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n\nNext, the tens place: 6 + 5 = 11, plus the carried over 1 makes it 12. Again, that's more than 10, so I'll write down 2 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: 3 + 0 = 3, plus the carried over 1 makes it 4.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n```\n  365\n+  56\n------\n  421\n```\n\nTherefore, the exact answer is 421.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 300\n\nB. 309\n\nC. 311\n\nD. 421\n\nThe correct choice is D. 421.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
