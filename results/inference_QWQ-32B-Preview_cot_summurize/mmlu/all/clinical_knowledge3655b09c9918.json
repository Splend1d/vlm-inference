                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about ulnar nerve palsy. I need to figure out which statement among the options is true. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The ulnar nerve can be affected by a fracture of the spiral groove of the humerus.\" Hmm, I know that the ulnar nerve runs along the arm, but I'm not sure about its exact path in relation to the humerus. I think the spiral groove is related to the radial nerve, not the ulnar nerve. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nOption B says: \"It gives rise to a positive Phalen's sign.\" Phalen's sign is something I've heard of in relation to carpal tunnel syndrome, which involves the median nerve, not the ulnar nerve. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says: \"It leads to loss of sensation over the medial half of the hand and medial one and a half digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand.\" This sounds plausible because I recall that the ulnar nerve provides sensory innervation to the little finger and half of the ring finger, both on the palm and the back of the hand.\n\nOption D says: \"It supplies the biceps muscles.\" I know that the biceps muscle is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve, not the ulnar nerve. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nLet me focus on option A. I need to confirm whether the ulnar nerve runs through the spiral groove of the humerus. I think the radial nerve is the one that runs through the spiral groove. Maybe the ulnar nerve is more distal, near the elbow.\n\nWait, the ulnar nerve runs along the posterior aspect of the elbow, in the area known as the cubital tunnel. That's why hitting your \"funny bone\" there causes tingling in the little and ring fingers. So, it's unlikely that a fracture of the spiral groove would affect the ulnar nerve.\n\nOption B is probably wrong because Phalen's test is for carpal tunnel syndrome, which involves the median nerve.\n\nOption C seems correct based on my knowledge of the ulnar nerve's sensory distribution. The ulnar nerve provides sensation to the little finger and the medial half of the ring finger, on both the palm and the back of the hand.\n\nOption D is definitely wrong because the biceps muscle is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: \"It leads to loss of sensation over the medial half of the hand and medial one and a half digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
