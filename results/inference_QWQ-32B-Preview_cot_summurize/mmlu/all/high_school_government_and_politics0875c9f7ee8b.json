Let's see what each one means.\n\nOption A says \"The executive and legislative branches working on legislation together.\" Hmm, that sounds more like separation of powers within the federal government, not really about federalism between federal and state governments. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption B is \"The federal government granting power over a policy area to the states.\" That sounds like devolution or decentralization, where the federal government gives more authority to the states. While it's related to federalism, I'm not sure if that's specifically what cooperative federalism is.\n\nOption C says \"Governments working with businesses to address an issue.\" This seems more like public-private partnerships. Again, it's about collaboration, but it's between government and businesses, not between different levels of government.\n\nOption D is \"State and federal governments working on the same issue.\" This sounds promising. Cooperative federalism is often about both levels of government collaborating or working together on shared goals or policies.\n\nLet me think about what cooperative federalism actually is. I remember that it's a system where both the national and state governments work together to solve problems, rather than having strict divisions of power. It's about cooperation and shared efforts.\n\nComparing that to the options, option D seems to fit best because it mentions state and federal governments working on the same issue together.\n\nOption B might be close, but granting power to states is more about giving authority to one level from another, whereas cooperative federalism is about both levels working together.\n\nOption A is about branches within the federal government working together, which is different from the relationship between federal and state governments.\n\nOption C brings in businesses, which isn't directly related to federalism between government levels.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D: State and federal governments working on the same issue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
