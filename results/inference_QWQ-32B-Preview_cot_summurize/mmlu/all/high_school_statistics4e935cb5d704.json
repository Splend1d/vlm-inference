                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about correlation between height and weight. The correlation is 0.65 when height is measured in inches, and I need to find out what the correlation will be if heights are converted to centimeters. The conversion factor is 1 inch equals 2.54 centimeters.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what correlation is. Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It's denoted by \"r\" and it ranges from -1 to 1. A positive value means that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well, and a negative value means that as one increases, the other tends to decrease.\n\nIn this case, the correlation between height in inches and weight in pounds is 0.65, which is positive, indicating that taller people tend to weigh more in this class.\n\nNow, the question is asking what happens to this correlation if we convert heights from inches to centimeters. Since 1 inch is 2.54 centimeters, converting heights will simply involve multiplying each height in inches by 2.54 to get the height in centimeters.\n\nI need to think about how such a transformation affects the correlation. I remember that correlation is unitless, meaning it doesn't depend on the units of measurement for the variables. So, changing the units should not affect the value of the correlation coefficient.\n\nLet me think about why that is. Correlation is calculated using the formula:\n\nr = \u03a3[(xi - x\u0304)(yi - \u0233)] / [\u221a\u03a3(xi - x\u0304)\u00b2 \u221a\u03a3(yi - \u0233)\u00b2]\n\nWhere xi and yi are individual data points, and x\u0304 and \u0233 are the means of x and y, respectively.\n\nIf I convert x from inches to centimeters, each xi becomes 2.54xi. Similarly, x\u0304 becomes 2.54x\u0304. Plugging these into the formula:\n\nr = \u03a3[(2.54xi - 2.54x\u0304)(yi - \u0233)] / [\u221a\u03a3(2.54xi - 2.54x\u0304)\u00b2 \u221a\u03a3(yi - \u0233)\u00b2]\n\nFactor out 2.54:\n\nr = \u03a3[2.54(xi - x\u0304)(yi - \u0233)] / [\u221a\u03a3(2.54)\u00b2(xi - x\u0304)\u00b2 \u221a\u03a3(yi - \u0233)\u00b2]\n\nSimplify:\n\nr = 2.54 \u03a3[(xi - x\u0304)(yi - \u0233)] / [2.54 \u221a\u03a3(xi - x\u0304)\u00b2 \u221a\u03a3(yi - \u0233)\u00b2]\n\nThe 2.54 cancels out:\n\nr = \u03a3[(xi - x\u0304)(yi - \u0233)] / [\u221a\u03a3(xi - x\u0304)\u00b2 \u221a\u03a3(yi - \u0233)\u00b2]\n\nWhich is the original formula. So, the correlation remains the same.\n\nTherefore, converting heights from inches to centimeters should not change the correlation with weight.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -0.65\n\nB. -0.26\n\nC. 0.1\n\nD. 0.65\n\nThe correct answer should be D. 0.65.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where units would affect correlation. I think correlation is invariant to linear transformations of the variables, meaning that adding or subtracting a constant, or multiplying by a positive constant, doesn't change the correlation. However, if you multiply by a negative constant, it would reverse the sign of the correlation.\n\nFor example, if I were to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius, which involves both multiplication and addition, the correlation with another variable should remain the same because the multiplication is by a positive constant.\n\nIn this case, converting inches to centimeters is just multiplication by 2.54, which is positive, so the correlation should stay the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 0.65.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
