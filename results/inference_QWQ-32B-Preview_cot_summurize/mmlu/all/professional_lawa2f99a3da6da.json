                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this problem about a tapestry sale. So, there's a collector who owns a rare tapestry from the 16th century, and he sells it to a tapestry dealer for $100,000. The contract says it's F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, and payment is due one week after delivery.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what F.O.B. means. F.O.B. stands for \"Free On Board,\" and in this context, it probably means that the risk of loss passes to the buyer once the goods are loaded at the dealer's shop. So, the dealer is responsible for any damage that happens during transit.\n\nNow, the dealer receives the tapestry and finds out it's damaged in transit. He tells the collector that he's rejecting the tapestry because it's ripped and unwoven. The collector says he'll get back with re-shipping instructions but never does.\n\nAfter four weeks, the dealer sells the tapestry to another buyer for $120,000. If the collector sues the dealer for damages, what should the collector recover?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. $120,000, for conversion.\n\nB. $108,000, because the dealer is entitled to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% on the resale.\n\nC. $100,000, which is the contract price.\n\nD. $20,000, which covers the difference between the contract price and the sale price.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to think about whether the dealer was justified in rejecting the tapestry. The tapestry was damaged in transit, and since it's F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, the dealer is responsible for the damage during transit. But the dealer is rejecting it because it's damaged, which might mean that it doesn't conform to the contract terms.\n\nWait, but if the dealer is responsible for the damage, maybe he can't reject it. I need to think about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the damage occurred before the risk passed to the dealer. In F.O.B. terms, risk passes when the goods are loaded at the dealer's shop. So, if the damage happened during transit, and the dealer is responsible for that transit, then perhaps he can't reject it because he's responsible for the condition.\n\nBut the problem says the dealer rejected it because it was damaged in transit, and he notified the collector immediately. The collector said he'd get back with re-shipping instructions but didn't.\n\nSo, perhaps the dealer was within his rights to reject the goods, given that they were damaged when he received them.\n\nIf the dealer rejected the goods, then maybe the collector could have re-shipped a new one, but he didn't do anything for four weeks.\n\nThen, the dealer sold it to another buyer for $120,000.\n\nNow, if the collector sues the dealer for damages, what should he recover?\n\nOption A is $120,000 for conversion. Conversion is when someone wrongfully interferes with another's property. But in this case, the dealer might argue that he had the right to sell it because the collector didn't respond to his rejection.\n\nOption B is $108,000, with the dealer entitled to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% on the resale. I'm not sure where this 10% comes from.\n\nOption C is $100,000, the contract price.\n\nOption D is $20,000, the difference between the contract price and the sale price.\n\nI think the key here is to determine who owns the tapestry at the time of the sale to the third party.\n\nGiven that it's F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, and payment is to be made one week after tender, ownership might still be with the collector until payment is made.\n\nBut the dealer received the tapestry and rejected it. If the rejection is valid, then perhaps the ownership remains with the collector, and the dealer shouldn't have sold it without permission.\n\nAlternatively, if the rejection isn't valid, then the dealer owns it and can sell it.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me look up F.O.B. terms again. F.O.B. destination point, which is the dealer's shop here, means that the seller (collector) is responsible for getting the goods to the dealer's shop, and the risk passes to the buyer (dealer) once the goods are delivered there.\n\nSo, if the tapestry was damaged in transit after it was delivered to the dealer's shop, then the dealer would be responsible for that damage.\n\nBut in this case, the dealer says it was damaged in transit, which might mean during shipping to his shop.\n\nWait, but F.O.B. at the dealer's shop means that the collector is responsible for getting it to the dealer's shop, so any damage during shipping would be the collector's responsibility.\n\nWait, no. F.O.B. destination means that the seller (collector) is responsible for getting the goods to the destination (dealer's shop), and the risk passes to the buyer (dealer) once the goods are delivered there.\n\nSo, if the damage occurred during shipping to the dealer's shop, it would be the seller's (collector's) responsibility.\n\nBut the dealer is saying it was damaged in transit, which might mean during shipping.\n\nSo, perhaps the collector should have borne the cost of the damage, and the dealer was right to reject it.\n\nIf the dealer rejected it properly, then the collector should have taken it back and either repaired it or replaced it.\n\nBut the collector didn't respond appropriately, so the dealer sold it.\n\nNow, if the collector sues the dealer, what damages should he recover?\n\nIf the collector is suing for damages, perhaps he's claiming that the dealer shouldn't have sold it without permission.\n\nBut the dealer might argue that since the collector didn't respond to the rejection, he had the right to sell it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the collector is claiming that the dealer breached the contract by not paying the $100,000.\n\nIf the dealer sold it for $120,000, perhaps the collector wants the full $120,000, claiming conversion.\n\nBut option A says $120,000 for conversion.\n\nOption C says $100,000, the contract price.\n\nOption D says $20,000, the difference.\n\nOption B says $108,000, with the dealer entitled to 10% commission.\n\nI think option B is perhaps based on the idea that if the dealer sold it, he's entitled to a commission, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the collector can only recover the contract price, which is $100,000.\n\nBut if the dealer sold it for $120,000, and the collector sues for conversion, he might be able to get the full $120,000.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the collector can only recover the contract price, and the dealer can keep the difference as damages or something.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf the dealer rejected the tapestry because it was damaged, and the collector didn't respond appropriately, then perhaps the dealer had the right to resell it.\n\nIn that case, maybe the collector can only recover the contract price, $100,000, and the dealer keeps the extra $20,000 as compensation for the damage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the collector should recover the full $120,000, and the dealer can claim damages separately.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dealer committed conversion by selling the tapestry without the collector's permission, and thus the collector can recover the full $120,000.\n\nBut in that case, the dealer might have a defense that he was entitled to sell it due to the collector's breach.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for me.\n\nMaybe the answer is simply the contract price, $100,000.\n\nSo, option C.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nI think I need to look up some law regarding F.O.B. terms and rejection of goods.\n\nOkay, according to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs sales of goods, specifically Section 2-607, deals with the buyer's duties when rejecting goods.\n\nIt states that when a buyer rightfully rejects goods, he must notify the seller and is entitled to a return of any money paid and to recovery of the goods.\n\nAdditionally, if the seller doesn't respond appropriately, the buyer may resell the goods and is entitled to reimbursement from the seller for necessary expenses and a reasonable compensation for services and the labor involved in selling.\n\nIn this case, the dealer rejected the tapestry, notified the collector, and when the collector didn't respond, the dealer sold it.\n\nSo, the dealer might be entitled to keep the difference as compensation for his services and expenses.\n\nTherefore, the collector should recover the contract price, $100,000, and the dealer keeps the extra $20,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the collector can recover the full $120,000, and the dealer can claim his expenses and services separately.\n\nBut I think option C, $100,000, is the most plausible answer.\n\nSo, the answer is C. $100,000, which is the contract price.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
