                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. It's a bit complex, but if I break it down, I can figure out what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's a racetrack built by the state for thoroughbred horseracing, and they issued bonds to finance it. The bond agreement has some specific provisions about how the admission charges would be used to repay the bond debt. Specifically, for the first five years, at least $2 from each admission charge would go toward repaying the bonds. If that wasn't enough, for the next five years, at least $1 from each admission charge would be used to make up the difference.\n\nSo, after two years of operation, the state legislature passes a bill that requires the racetrack to admit all senior citizens over the age of 65 for a discounted admission fee of 50 cents. Now, we need to determine if this law is probably constitutional or unconstitutional, and why.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Constitutional, because it's a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.\n\nB. Unconstitutional, because it denies citizens under the age of 65 the equal protection of the law.\n\nC. Unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\n\nD. Unconstitutional, because it is an ex post facto law.\n\nOkay, starting with option A: Is this a justifiable exercise of the state's police power?\n\nThe police power allows states to pass laws for the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of their citizens. Offering discounted admission to senior citizens could be seen as a way to promote their welfare or to encourage them to participate in activities that might benefit their health and social life. So, it might be considered a justifiable exercise of police power.\n\nBut, we also need to consider whether this law interferes with other legal obligations, like the bond agreement.\n\nOption B suggests it's unconstitutional because it denies equal protection to citizens under 65.\n\nThe equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment says that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. So, if this law discriminates against a particular group without a legitimate state interest, it could be unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, senior citizens are often considered a vulnerable group, and many states provide them with benefits and discounts. So, this might be seen as a permissible classification.\n\nOption C says it's unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\n\nThis gets into the realm of contract clause violations. The Constitution protects contract obligations, and states can't pass laws that retroactively impair contract rights without a compelling state interest.\n\nIn this case, the bond agreement had specific provisions about how admission charges would be used to repay the bonds. If the legislature now requires that senior citizens pay only 50 cents for admission, that could reduce the total admission proceeds, potentially making it harder to meet the bond repayment terms.\n\nSo, this could be seen as impairing the obligation of the bondholders' contract because it might make it more difficult to fulfill the repayment terms outlined in the bond agreement.\n\nOption D mentions that it's an ex post facto law.\n\nEx post facto laws are laws that retroactively change the legal consequences of actions that were committed before the enactment of the law. These are typically related to criminal laws, and since this is a civil matter regarding admission fees, it's unlikely to be considered an ex post facto law.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, I think option C is the most plausible answer.\n\nThe law probably impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract because it could reduce the admission proceeds needed to repay the bonds, as specified in the bond agreement.\n\nWhile option A might seem plausible because it's an exercise of police power, the potential impairment of the bond contract might override that consideration.\n\nOption B regarding equal protection might not hold because age-based classifications, especially for senior citizens, are often subject to rational basis review, and the state likely has a rational basis for providing discounts to seniors.\n\nOption D is probably not applicable here, as this isn't a criminal law.\n\nTherefore, the answer is most likely C: unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
