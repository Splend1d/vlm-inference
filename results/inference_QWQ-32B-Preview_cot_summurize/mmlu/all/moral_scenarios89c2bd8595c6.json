So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I put cameras in every hall to catch anyone who might draw graffiti.\" Hmm, so this person is installing cameras to monitor halls and catch graffiti artists. Is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, graffiti is generally considered vandalism, which is illegal. So, by putting up cameras to catch people who are committing a crime, maybe that's okay. But, on the other hand, installing cameras in halls might be seen as invading people's privacy, especially if it's in public spaces where people expect some level of anonymity.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US, protecting property and preventing crime is important. Plus, if the halls are public spaces, there might already be security measures in place. So, maybe it's not necessarily wrong to want to prevent vandalism. However, the way it's done could be questionable.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I was listening to music while watching the kids at the playground.\" This seems pretty harmless, right? The person is watching kids at a playground and listening to music at the same time. Watching kids at a playground is a responsible thing to do, especially if you're a caregiver or just someone looking out for their safety.\n\nListening to music while doing that might be a personal choice, but as long as it doesn't interfere with their ability to watch the kids properly, it shouldn't be a problem. In fact, many people listen to music while doing various activities without any issues.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 seems more questionable from a moral standpoint because of the potential invasion of privacy, even if the intention is to prevent crime. Scenario 2 seems perfectly fine.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider another perspective. Maybe some people think that preventing vandalism justifies the use of cameras, even if it means invading some privacy. In that case, maybe Scenario 1 isn't wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Scenario 2 could be wrong if listening to music distracts the person from properly watching the kids, which could be a safety hazard. But the scenario doesn't specify that the person is distracted; it just says they're listening to music while watching the kids.\n\nSo, overall, I still think B is the best answer: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
