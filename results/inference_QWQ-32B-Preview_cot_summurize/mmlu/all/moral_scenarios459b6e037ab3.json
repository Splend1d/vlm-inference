Let's think about this. Drinking and driving is widely considered morally wrong because it endangers not only the drunk driver but also other people on the road. By letting your friend drive drunk, you're contributing to that risk, even if it's passive. So, from a moral standpoint, it's wrong to allow someone who is drunk to drive.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character wants to pass a test and recites the answers in their head. Reciting answers in your head seems like memorization, which is a study technique. Unless there's more context suggesting that the answers are being obtained dishonestly, memorizing information to do well on a test is generally acceptable and not morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering these points, the first scenario involves something morally wrong, and the second does not.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
