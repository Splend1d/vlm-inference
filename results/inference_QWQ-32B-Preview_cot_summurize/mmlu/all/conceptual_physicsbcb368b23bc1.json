                    "text": "So I have this physics problem here. It says that in the absence of air resistance, a ball of mass m is tossed upward to reach a height of 20 meters. And I need to find the net force on the ball at the 10-meter position, which is halfway up. The options are 2mg, mg, mg/2, or mg/4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ball is being thrown upward, and it reaches a maximum height of 20 meters. Since there's no air resistance, the only force acting on the ball after it's been thrown is gravity. Gravity is always pulling downward, and its magnitude is mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nSo, at any point during the ball's flight, the net force on it is just the force of gravity, which is -mg, assuming upward is positive. Wait, but in physics, often downward is taken as positive, but I think it's more common to take upward as positive, especially in projectile motion problems.\n\nLet me confirm: if upward is positive, then gravity is negative, so the net force is -mg. But the question is asking for the net force at the 10-meter position, which is halfway up. Does the position affect the net force? In other words, is the force different at different heights?\n\nWell, in the case of gravity near the Earth's surface, the force is constant and doesn't depend on the height, as long as the height is not too large. So, at 10 meters, 20 meters, or any height within this range, the net force should still be -mg.\n\nBut let's think again. Maybe there's something I'm missing. The problem says \"at the 10-m position half way up.\" Does that mean something specific?\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion about the direction. The question says \"the net force on the ball is\" and gives options like 2mg, mg, mg/2, mg/4. All these options are positive, except maybe 2mg might be interpreted as -2mg, but that's not specified.\n\nI think the problem is expecting the magnitude of the net force, not the vector. So, it's asking for the size of the net force, regardless of direction.\n\nIn that case, since the only force is gravity, which is mg downward, the net force's magnitude is mg.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other force acting on the ball. At the highest point, velocity is zero, but at other points, it has velocity, but that doesn't affect the net force, because force is independent of velocity in this context.\n\nWait, maybe when the ball is moving upward, there is still an upward component due to its motion, but no, once it's thrown, the only force is gravity.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the problem is trying to trick me by saying \"at the 10-m position half way up,\" suggesting that at half the height, the force might be different. But no, in uniform gravity, the force doesn't change with height.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering energy considerations, like potential energy or kinetic energy, but the question is specifically about force, not energy.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the problem is considering the initial upward throw and trying to find the initial force applied, but no, it says \"in the absence of air resistance,\" so after the ball is thrown, the only force is gravity.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion about the motion. When the ball is thrown upward, it decelerates at a rate of g until it stops at the highest point, then accelerates downward at g. So, the acceleration is always -g, regardless of direction of motion.\n\nTherefore, the net force is always mass times acceleration, which is m*(-g) = -mg, or mg downward.\n\nBut again, the question seems to be asking for the magnitude, so it should be mg.\n\nLooking back at the options: A. 2mg, B. mg, C. mg/2, D. mg/4.\n\nSo, B. mg seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the problem is considering the initial throw and thinking about the initial force applied to the ball, but no, it specifies \"at the 10-m position half way up,\" which is during the flight, after the initial throw.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the work done or something, but again, the net force is just gravity.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The net force on the ball at any point during its flight, in the absence of air resistance, is simply the force of gravity, which is mg downward.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude is mg.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. mg.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the ball is moving upward, its velocity is decreasing at a rate of g per second. Similarly, when it's moving downward, its velocity increases at a rate of g per second. In both cases, the acceleration is -g, assuming upward is positive.\n\nThus, net force = mass * acceleration = m*(-g) = -mg.\n\nMagnitude is mg.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. mg.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
