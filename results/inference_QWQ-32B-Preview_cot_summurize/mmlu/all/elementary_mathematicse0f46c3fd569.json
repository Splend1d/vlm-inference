                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: In December, a toy store sold 934 puzzles. Each puzzle cost $6, including tax. I need to find out the total cost of the puzzles sold, including tax. The options are A. $5,434, B. $5,484, C. $5,604, and D. $5,684.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The store sold 934 puzzles, and each one costs $6, including tax. So, to find the total cost, I should just multiply the number of puzzles by the cost per puzzle, right? That seems straightforward.\n\nSo, 934 puzzles times $6 per puzzle. Let me do that multiplication.\n\nFirst, I can break it down: 900 times 6 is 5,400. Then 30 times 6 is 180, and 4 times 6 is 24. Now, adding those up: 5,400 plus 180 is 5,580, and then plus 24 is 5,604.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. 900 times 6 is indeed 5,400. 30 times 6 is 180. 4 times 6 is 24. Adding 5,400 and 180 gives 5,580, and adding 24 to that gives 5,604.\n\nLet me verify this another way. Maybe I'll use the standard multiplication method.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n934\n\ntimes 6\n\n---\n\nFirst, 4 times 6 is 24. Write down 4 and carry the 2.\n\nThen, 3 times 6 is 18, plus the carried 2 is 20. Write down 0 and carry the 2.\n\nFinally, 9 times 6 is 54, plus the carried 2 is 56. So, it's 5,604.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the total cost should be $5,604.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check because the options are close. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the distributive property. 934 times 6 is the same as (900 + 30 + 4) times 6, which is (900 times 6) + (30 times 6) + (4 times 6). We already did that and got 5,400 + 180 + 24 = 5,604.\n\nAlternatively, I could divide 934 by something, but multiplication seems straightforward here.\n\nIs there any chance that tax is already included in the $6 per puzzle? The problem says \"each puzzle cost $6, including tax,\" so yes, tax is already included in that price. So, I don't need to add any additional tax on top of that.\n\nTherefore, total cost is just the number of puzzles times the cost per puzzle, which is 934 times $6, which equals $5,604.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. $5,604 is one of them. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any possibility that the tax is not included, or that there are additional costs? The problem clearly states that each puzzle costs $6, including tax, so I think it's straightforward.\n\nAlso, ensuring that I multiplied correctly: 934 times 6.\n\nLet me do the multiplication again:\n\n934\n\ntimes 6\n\n---\n\n4 times 6 is 24. Write down 4, carry 2.\n\n3 times 6 is 18, plus carry 2 is 20. Write down 0, carry 2.\n\n9 times 6 is 54, plus carry 2 is 56. So, 5,604.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the puzzles sold, including tax, is $5,604.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5604} \\]"
