Let's consider each option:\n\nA. A new democratic internationalism led by the United States\n\nThis seems plausible. After the Cold War, there was a sense that the world could move towards a more unified international system, potentially led by the U.S., which was the remaining superpower. The idea was that democracy and market economies would spread, leading to a more stable and peaceful world.\n\nB. A new balance of power between the US and China\n\nWhile the rise of China is a significant aspect of the current international landscape, the term \"New World Order\" was more prominently used in the early 1990s, before China had emerged as a major global power. So, this might not be the primary meaning.\n\nC. A new global economic framework\n\nThe end of the Cold War did see efforts to create new economic institutions and frameworks, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, this seems more specific than the broad term \"New World Order,\" which generally refers to the political and security dimensions of the international system.\n\nD. A new era of globalization\n\nGlobalization has indeed accelerated since the end of the Cold War, but again, this is more of an economic phenomenon. The \"New World Order\" concept seems to encompass political and security aspects as well.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems to be the most accurate description of what was meant by the \"New World Order.\" It refers to a vision of a post-Cold War international system characterized by democratic governance and led by the United States, aiming for a more unified and peaceful world.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
