                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about apoptosis. I need to identify which statement is NOT correct. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Apoptosis, a special type of cell division, requires multiple cell signaling.\" Hmm, apoptosis is actually not a type of cell division; it's a form of programmed cell death. Cell division is when a cell replicates and divides into daughter cells, whereas apoptosis is when a cell dies in a controlled way. So, this statement seems incorrect because it misdefines apoptosis as a type of cell division.\n\nOption B: \"The fact that apoptosis is widespread across several kingdoms is evidence that it evolved early in the evolution of eukaryotes.\" Apoptosis is indeed found across many eukaryotic organisms, from plants to animals, which suggests that it's an ancient process that evolved early on. This seems like a correct statement.\n\nOption C: \"Apoptosis plays a crucial role in the development of fingers in embryonic development.\" Yes, during embryogenesis, apoptosis helps shape structures like fingers by causing cells between the developing digits to die, allowing the separate fingers to form. This is a well-known example of apoptosis in development.\n\nOption D: \"Apoptosis prevents an aging and dying cell from damaging neighboring cells.\" Apoptosis is a controlled way for cells to die without releasing harmful substances that could damage surrounding cells. It's like a cellular suicide that keeps the tissue healthy. So, this statement seems accurate.\n\nGiven that, it looks like option A is the one that's not correct because apoptosis is not a type of cell division; it's a process of cell death.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
