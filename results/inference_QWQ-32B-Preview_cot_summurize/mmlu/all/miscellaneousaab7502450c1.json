                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of the following great apes (the Hominidae) is NOT native to Africa?\" and the options are A. Gorilla, B. Human, C. Chimpanzee, and D. Orangutan. I need to figure out which one doesn't naturally live in Africa.\n\nFirst, I know that gorillas are native to Africa. I've seen documentaries about them living in the African rainforests, so A is probably native to Africa.\n\nNext, humans. Well, humans originated in Africa, right? Like, the cradle of humanity is in Africa, so B. Human is also native to Africa.\n\nChimpanzees, option C, I believe they're also from Africa. I think they live in parts of central and western Africa.\n\nNow, orangutans, option D. Hmm, I think orangutans are from Asia, specifically from Indonesia and Malaysia. I don't think they're from Africa at all.\n\nSo, comparing all these, it seems like orangutans are the only ones not native to Africa. But just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nGorillas: Africa.\n\nHumans: Originated in Africa.\n\nChimpanzees: Africa.\n\nOrangutans: Asia.\n\nYeah, that seems clear. So, the answer should be D. Orangutan.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the Hominidae family. I should confirm if orangutans are indeed considered great apes within the Hominidae family.\n\nI recall that the Hominidae family includes humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Sometimes, it's divided into subfamilies, but overall, they are all great apes.\n\nSo, orangutans are part of the Hominidae family, and they're not native to Africa, which makes them the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any chance that orangutans have been in Africa naturally. I don't think so; their native habitat is in Southeast Asia, specifically in Sumatra and Borneo.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is D. Orangutan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
