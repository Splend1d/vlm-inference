                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this law problem. So, there's a buyer who bought a gallon of nonfat milk from a market. The milk was processed and packaged by a dairy. One evening, the buyer pours himself a glass and starts drinking it, but then feels something furry in his mouth. It turns out to be a dead mouse, which is pretty disturbing. The buyer doesn't get physically hurt or sick, but he does suffer severe emotional distress.\n\nNow, the question is: If the buyer sues the dairy for negligent manufacturing, what's likely to happen?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. He'll recover because he suffered severe emotional distress.\n\nB. He'll recover, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\n\nC. He won't recover, because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.\n\nD. He won't recover, because his proper cause of action is for intentional infliction of mental distress.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what negligent manufacturing means. Negligent manufacturing typically involves a product that's defective due to some error or omission during the manufacturing process. So, in this case, the dairy is responsible for processing and packaging the milk, and apparently, a dead mouse found its way into the milk, which shouldn't happen.\n\nNow, the buyer is claiming negligence on the part of the dairy. Negligence generally requires that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, breached that duty, and that the breach caused harm to the plaintiff.\n\nIn product liability cases, manufacturers have a duty to produce safe products. If they fail to do so, and someone gets hurt, they can be held liable.\n\nBut here, the buyer didn't suffer any physical injury; it's only emotional distress. So, that's an important point.\n\nLet's look at option A: He'll recover because he suffered severe emotional distress.\n\nWell, emotional distress is certainly a type of harm that can be compensated in some cases. But in product liability cases, particularly negligence cases, there's often a requirement of physical injury or property damage for emotional distress claims to be compensable.\n\nI think that's still the case in many jurisdictions, although there might be exceptions.\n\nSo, maybe option A isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B: He'll recover under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to establish negligence on the part of the defendant without directly proving how the defendant was negligent.\n\nIt's applicable when the accident is the kind that wouldn't occur without someone's negligence, and the defendant had control over the instrumentality that caused the harm.\n\nIn this case, finding a dead mouse in a milk container is certainly something that shouldn't happen in a properly manufactured and packaged product. So, res ipsa loquitur might apply here, suggesting that the dairy was negligent.\n\nBut the question is whether the buyer can recover based on negligent manufacturing, given that there's only emotional distress.\n\nSo, even if res ipsa loquitur applies and negligence is established, there's still the issue of whether emotional distress alone is sufficient to support recovery.\n\nOption C: He won't recover, because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.\n\nThis seems plausible because, in many jurisdictions, emotional distress without physical injury isn't sufficient to recover in negligence cases, especially in product liability.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure if that's still the universal rule.\n\nOption D: He won't recover, because his proper cause of action is for intentional infliction of mental distress.\n\nBut in this case, there's no suggestion that the dairy intentionally put a dead mouse in the milk or intended to cause emotional distress. It's a negligence claim, not an intentional tort claim.\n\nSo, option D doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me think about this differently.\n\nFirst, was there a breach of duty? Yes, probably, since a dead mouse in milk indicates a failure in the manufacturing process.\n\nSecond, was there causation? The dairy's negligence led to the mouse being in the milk, which caused the buyer's emotional distress.\n\nBut is emotional distress alone enough to recover in a negligence claim for product liability?\n\nI recall that in some states, there's a requirement of physical injury or property damage for emotional distress to be compensable in negligence cases.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions, like the \"zone of danger\" rule, where a plaintiff can recover for emotional distress if they were in danger of being physically harmed.\n\nBut in this case, the buyer wasn't in danger; he just experienced emotional distress from discovering the mouse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the emotional distress is so severe that it should be compensable on its own.\n\nBut legally, many courts require some physical manifestation of the emotional distress to recover in negligence.\n\nGiven that, option C might be correct: He won't recover because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe res ipsa loquitur would allow the buyer to establish negligence, and since emotional distress is a recognized harm, he could recover.\n\nBut I think the issue is more about whether emotional distress alone is sufficient in this context.\n\nLet me consider the answer choices again.\n\nA. Recover because of severe emotional distress.\n\nThis could be possible, but I suspect that without physical injury, it might not be sufficient.\n\nB. Recover under res ipsa loquitur.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur helps establish negligence, but it doesn't address whether emotional distress alone is enough for recovery.\n\nC. Not recover because only mental disturbance was caused.\n\nThis seems plausible, given that many jurisdictions require physical injury for negligence claims based on emotional distress.\n\nD. Not recover, because the cause of action should be for intentional infliction.\n\nBut this is a negligence claim, not an intentional tort, so this option doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, between A and C, I think C is more likely correct.\n\nThe buyer probably cannot recover because the dairy's negligence only caused emotional distress without any physical injury.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
