                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find out which of these circles has the greatest number of points where it crosses or touches a parabola given by \\(x^2 = y + 4\\). The circles are all centered at the origin, with different radii: 1, \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), 3, and 4. I need to figure out which one intersects the parabola at the most points.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what it means for a circle and a parabola to intersect. They intersect at points where both equations are satisfied simultaneously. So, for each circle, I need to solve the system of equations consisting of the circle's equation and the parabola's equation.\n\nThe general approach would be to substitute the expression for \\(y\\) from the parabola's equation into the circle's equation and then see how many real solutions I get. The parabola is given by \\(x^2 = y + 4\\), which I can rearrange to \\(y = x^2 - 4\\). Then, plugging this into the circle's equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\\), I get:\n\n\\[x^2 + (x^2 - 4)^2 = r^2\\]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n\\[x^2 + (x^4 - 8x^2 + 16) = r^2\\]\\[x^4 - 7x^2 + 16 = r^2\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that expansion:\n\n\\[(x^2 - 4)^2 = x^4 - 8x^2 + 16\\]\n\nThen adding \\(x^2\\):\n\n\\[x^4 - 8x^2 + 16 + x^2 = x^4 - 7x^2 + 16 = r^2\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[x^4 - 7x^2 + (16 - r^2) = 0\\]\n\nThis is a quartic equation in terms of \\(x\\), but it's biquadratic because it only contains even powers of \\(x\\). That means I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me set \\(z = x^2\\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[z^2 - 7z + (16 - r^2) = 0\\]\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in \\(z\\), which I can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 4(16 - r^2)}}{2}\\]\\[z = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 64 + 4r^2}}{2}\\]\\[z = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 - 15}}{2}\\]\n\nFor \\(z\\) to be real, the discriminant must be non-negative:\n\n\\[4r^2 - 15 \\geq 0\\]\\[r^2 \\geq \\frac{15}{4}\\]\\[r \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\]\n\nSo, for \\(r < \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\), there are no real solutions for \\(z\\), meaning no intersection points. For \\(r = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\), there's exactly one real solution for \\(z\\), and for \\(r > \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\), there are two real solutions for \\(z\\).\n\nBut wait, \\(z = x^2\\), so for each positive real \\(z\\), there are two real \\(x\\) values: \\(x = \\sqrt{z}\\) and \\(x = -\\sqrt{z}\\). However, if \\(z\\) is zero, there's only one \\(x\\) value, which is zero.\n\nSo, let's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. If \\(r < \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\), no real intersections.\n\n2. If \\(r = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\), one real solution for \\(z\\), which is \\(z = \\frac{7}{2}\\), and since \\(z = x^2\\), this gives two \\(x\\) values: \\(x = \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{2}}\\) and \\(x = -\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{2}}\\). So, two intersection points.\n\n3. If \\(r > \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\), two real solutions for \\(z\\). For each positive \\(z\\), there are two \\(x\\) values, so potentially four intersection points. However, I need to ensure that both solutions for \\(z\\) are positive because \\(z = x^2 \\geq 0\\).\n\nLet me check the expression for \\(z\\):\n\n\\[z = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 - 15}}{2}\\]\n\nSince \\(r > \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\), the discriminant is positive. Both solutions for \\(z\\) will be positive as long as the smaller one is positive. The smaller \\(z\\) is:\n\n\\[z_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{4r^2 - 15}}{2}\\]\n\nI need to ensure that \\(z_{\\text{min}} > 0\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{7 - \\sqrt{4r^2 - 15}}{2} > 0\\]\\[7 - \\sqrt{4r^2 - 15} > 0\\]\\[\\sqrt{4r^2 - 15} < 7\\]\\[4r^2 - 15 < 49\\]\\[4r^2 < 64\\]\\[r^2 < 16\\]\\[r < 4\\]\n\nSo, for \\(r < 4\\), both solutions for \\(z\\) are positive, giving four real \\(x\\) values and thus four intersection points. For \\(r = 4\\), I need to check if \\(z_{\\text{min}} = 0\\):\n\n\\[z_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{4(16) - 15}}{2} = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{64 - 15}}{2} = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{49}}{2} = \\frac{7 - 7}{2} = 0\\]\n\nSo, one \\(z\\) is zero and the other is:\n\n\\[z_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{7 + 7}{2} = 7\\]\n\nThus, \\(z = 0\\) gives one \\(x\\) value (\\(x = 0\\)), and \\(z = 7\\) gives two \\(x\\) values (\\(x = \\sqrt{7}\\) and \\(x = -\\sqrt{7}\\)), so in total, three intersection points.\n\nFor \\(r > 4\\), \\(z_{\\text{min}}\\) becomes negative:\n\n\\[z_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{4r^2 - 15}}{2}\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{4r^2 - 15} > 7\\) when \\(r > 4\\), \\(z_{\\text{min}}\\) is negative, which means only one positive \\(z\\) ( \\(z_{\\text{max}}\\) ), giving two intersection points.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- \\(r < \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\): 0 intersections\n\n- \\(r = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\): 2 intersections\n\n- \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} < r < 4\\): 4 intersections\n\n- \\(r = 4\\): 3 intersections\n\n- \\(r > 4\\): 2 intersections\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\): \\(r = 1\\)\n\nB. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\): \\(r = \\sqrt{2}\\)\n\nC. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 9\\): \\(r = 3\\)\n\nD. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 16\\): \\(r = 4\\)\n\nLet's see:\n\nA. \\(r = 1\\): Since \\(1 < \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\) (because \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\approx 1.936\\)), there are 0 intersections.\n\nB. \\(r = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\): Still less than \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\approx 1.936\\), so 0 intersections.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for \\(r < \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\), there are 0 intersections, but for \\(r \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\), there are intersections. But according to my earlier analysis, for \\(r < \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\), no real solutions, for \\(r = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\), two intersections, and for \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} < r < 4\\), four intersections.\n\nBut in options A and B, \\(r = 1\\) and \\(r = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\), both less than \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\approx 1.936\\), so no intersections.\n\nOption C: \\(r = 3\\), which is between \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\) and 4, so four intersections.\n\nOption D: \\(r = 4\\), which should have three intersections.\n\nSo, the circle with \\(r = 3\\) has the greatest number of intersections, which is four.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure.\n\nFirst, the discriminant condition:\n\n\\[4r^2 - 15 \\geq 0\\]\\[r^2 \\geq \\frac{15}{4}\\]\\[r \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\approx 1.936\\]\n\nSo, for \\(r < 1.936\\), no intersections.\n\nFor \\(r = 1.936\\), two intersections.\n\nFor \\(1.936 < r < 4\\), four intersections.\n\nFor \\(r = 4\\), three intersections.\n\nFor \\(r > 4\\), two intersections.\n\nGiven that, option C with \\(r = 3\\) should have four intersections.\n\nBut let me verify this by plugging in \\(r = 3\\):\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[x^4 - 7x^2 + (16 - 9) = 0\\]\\[x^4 - 7x^2 + 7 = 0\\]\n\nLet \\(z = x^2\\):\n\n\\[z^2 - 7z + 7 = 0\\]\\[z = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 28}}{2} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}{2}\\]\n\nBoth solutions are positive since \\(\\sqrt{21} < 7\\), so \\(z = \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{21}}{2}\\) and \\(z = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{21}}{2}\\), both positive. Therefore, four real \\(x\\) values, hence four intersections.\n\nFor \\(r = 4\\):\n\n\\[x^4 - 7x^2 + (16 - 16) = 0\\]\\[x^4 - 7x^2 = 0\\]\\[x^2(x^2 - 7) = 0\\]\n\nSo, \\(x^2 = 0\\) or \\(x^2 = 7\\), which gives \\(x = 0, x = \\sqrt{7}, x = -\\sqrt{7}\\), so three distinct \\(x\\) values, hence three intersections.\n\nFor \\(r > 4\\), say \\(r = 5\\):\n\n\\[x^4 - 7x^2 + (16 - 25) = 0\\]\\[x^4 - 7x^2 - 9 = 0\\]\n\nLet \\(z = x^2\\):\n\n\\[z^2 - 7z - 9 = 0\\]\\[z = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 36}}{2} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{85}}{2}\\]\n\nOne solution is positive, the other is negative. So, only one positive \\(z\\), giving two \\(x\\) values.\n\nThus, the analysis holds.\n\nTherefore, the circle with the greatest number of intersections is the one with \\(r = 3\\), which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{C}\\]"
