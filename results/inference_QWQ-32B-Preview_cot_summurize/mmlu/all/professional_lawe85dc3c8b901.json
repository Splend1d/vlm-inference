                    "text": "This is a tricky legal question involving property rights, zoning laws, and possibly nuisance claims. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the owner of a solar-heated residence is suing to prevent her neighbor from building a house that would block her sunlight. The neighbor's plans comply with all local building ordinances and land use regulations. The owner has lived in the house for 10 years, and the neighbor recently purchased the adjoining lot. The owner demonstrates that an alternative placement of the house would avoid interfering with her sunlight.\n\nThe trial judge ruled in favor of the defendant, stating that as long as the neighbor follows building and zoning laws, he has the right to build his house anywhere on his property. The owner is appealing this decision.\n\nWe need to determine whether the appellate court is likely to reverse the trial court's decision. The options are:\n\nA. Yes, because blocking a neighbor's sunlight is a constitutional deprivation of substantive due process.\n\nB. Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.\n\nC. No, because the trial court was correct in ruling that there had to be some violation of building regulations before the construction could be enjoined.\n\nD. No, because a comparative evaluation of the benefits and detriments of each position favor the neighbor's position.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\nOption A suggests that blocking sunlight is a constitutional deprivation under substantive due process. Substantive due process generally protects individuals from government actions that infringe on fundamental rights, but in this case, the interference is from a private party, not the government. Therefore, it's unlikely that this argument would hold up. So, option A seems weak.\n\nOption B proposes that the neighbor's construction constitutes a private nuisance. A private nuisance is a civil wrong involving the unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's property. In this scenario, the neighbor's house would block the owner's sunlight, which is crucial for her solar heating system. This could be seen as unreasonable interference, especially since there's an alternative placement that wouldn't cause this issue.\n\nOption C asserts that the trial court was correct because there's no violation of building regulations. While the neighbor is complying with zoning laws, that doesn't necessarily preclude other legal claims, such as nuisance. Zoning regulations often don't address every possible impact on neighboring properties. So, even if the construction is legally permissible under zoning, there might still be grounds to injunction it on other grounds.\n\nOption D suggests that a balancing of benefits and detriments favors the neighbor. This could be a possible consideration, but it's somewhat vague. Appellate courts generally look at legal principles rather than solely balancing benefits.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems the most compelling. The neighbor's construction could be considered a private nuisance if it unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property, particularly given that there's an alternative placement that avoids this interference.\n\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions recognize the right to sunlight as an easement or have specific laws protecting solar access. However, since the question doesn't mention any such specific laws, we'll focus on the general principle of nuisance.\n\nTherefore, the appellate court is likely to reverse the trial court's decision on the grounds that the neighbor's proposed construction constitutes a private nuisance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
