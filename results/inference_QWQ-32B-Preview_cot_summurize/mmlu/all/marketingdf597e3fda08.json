One of them is when the receiver starts to understand the message that's been sent. The question is asking about that part where the receiver is unpacking the message, making sense of it, and giving it meaning.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Encoding.\n\nB. Decoding.\n\nC. Transfer.\n\nD. Noise.\n\nI need to figure out which one of these corresponds to the receiver making sense of the message.\n\nFirst, I remember that encoding is when the sender transforms their thoughts or ideas into a message that can be transmitted. So, that's the beginning of the process, right? The sender is putting together the message.\n\nThen, there's decoding, which I think is when the receiver takes the message and tries to interpret it, to understand what the sender meant. That sounds a lot like unpacking the message and giving it meaning.\n\nTransfer must be the part where the message is being sent from the sender to the receiver. Like, the actual transmission of the message.\n\nAnd noise is anything that interferes with the message being understood correctly. Maybe like distractions or distortions during the communication.\n\nSo, if decoding is when the receiver is interpreting the message, that should be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Encoding is sending the message, transfer is sending it over, decoding is receiving and understanding it, and noise is anything that disrupts that process.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer should be B. Decoding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
