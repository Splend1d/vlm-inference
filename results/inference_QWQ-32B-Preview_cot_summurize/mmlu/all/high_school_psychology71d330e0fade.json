                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about why the same pool water might feel cool to one person and warm to another. The temperatures are the same, but people's perceptions differ based on what they were doing before getting into the pool. One person was sunbathing, and the other was inside in the air conditioning. I need to choose the best explanation from these options: sensory restriction, perceptual constancy, relative clarity, or sensory adaptation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each term to see which one fits best.\n\nSensory restriction probably refers to limitations in our sensory abilities, like not being able to sense certain temperatures or not having full sensitivity. But in this case, both people can sense the temperature; they just perceive it differently.\n\nPerceptual constancy is the ability to recognize things as constant despite changes in sensation. For example, recognizing a table as a table whether it's near or far, even though the image on your retina changes size. This doesn't seem directly related to the temperature perception in this scenario.\n\nRelative clarity might not be a standard psychological term, but it could refer to how clear or distinct a sensation is compared to others. Maybe the pool water feels more distinctively warm or cool compared to what they were previously experiencing.\n\nSensory adaptation is when our sensory receptors adjust to a constant stimulus, reducing their response over time. For example, you might not notice a smell in a room after being in it for a while because you've adapted to it.\n\nNow, thinking about the scenario: the person who was sunbathing has been in a hotter environment, so their body temperature might be higher, and their skin is used to higher temperatures. When they enter the pool at 82 degrees, which is cooler than their body temperature or the sunbathing area, it feels cool to them.\n\nOn the other hand, the person who was inside in the air conditioning has been in a cooler environment. Their body might be adjusted to a lower temperature, so the pool water at 82 degrees feels warm to them compared to the air-conditioned room.\n\nThis seems to be related to how their bodies have adapted to the previous temperatures they were exposed to. So, sensory adaptation might be the key here.\n\nLet me consider sensory restriction again. If sensory restriction were the issue, it would suggest that one person can't feel the temperature as accurately as the other, but that's not the case. Both are feeling the temperature, just interpreting it differently based on their previous environments.\n\nPerceptual constancy doesn't seem to fit because it's more about recognizing objects consistently, not about temperature sensations.\n\nRelative clarity might be a factor, but it's not a standard term in psychology, and it doesn't capture the adaptive process that's likely happening here.\n\nSensory adaptation, however, explains how our senses adjust to the environment. The sunbather has adapted to higher temperatures, so the pool water feels cooler in comparison. The person from the air-conditioned room has adapted to lower temperatures, so the pool water feels warmer.\n\nTherefore, sensory adaptation seems to be the most accurate explanation for why the same pool water feels different to different people based on their preceding environments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
