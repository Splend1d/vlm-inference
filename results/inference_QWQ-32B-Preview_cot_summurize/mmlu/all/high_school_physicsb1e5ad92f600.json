                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a string with fixed length, and we're generating standing waves using a 100-Hz generator. Then, we increase the tension in the string and observe a new set of standing waves. The question is asking whether the wavelength of these new standing waves will be greater than or less than the original wavelength.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength. The fundamental equation for waves is:\n\n\\[ v = f \\lambda \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( v \\) is the wave speed,\n\n- \\( f \\) is the frequency,\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength.\n\nIn this scenario, the frequency \\( f \\) is constant at 100 Hz because it's determined by the generator. So, if the wave speed \\( v \\) changes due to the change in tension, the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) must adjust accordingly to keep the equation valid.\n\nNext, I need to understand how tension affects the wave speed in a string. The wave speed \\( v \\) in a stretched string is given by:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( T \\) is the tension in the string,\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the linear mass density of the string.\n\nFrom this equation, it's clear that wave speed \\( v \\) is directly proportional to the square root of the tension \\( T \\). So, if tension increases, wave speed increases.\n\nNow, going back to the first equation \\( v = f \\lambda \\), since frequency \\( f \\) is constant, if wave speed \\( v \\) increases, then wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) must also increase to keep the equation balanced.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says that the tension is increased until a new set of standing waves is produced, and it's a string of fixed length. So, I need to consider the boundary conditions for standing waves on a string with fixed ends.\n\nFor standing waves on a string fixed at both ends, the possible wavelengths are determined by the length of the string \\( L \\) and the harmonic number \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ \\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is an integer (1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThis equation suggests that for a given length \\( L \\), the wavelength is inversely proportional to the harmonic number \\( n \\). So, if \\( n \\) increases, \\( \\lambda \\) decreases, and vice versa.\n\nBut in this problem, we're changing the tension, which affects the wave speed, and consequently, the possible wavelengths. However, the length of the string remains fixed, so the possible wavelengths are still constrained by the boundary conditions.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If we increase the tension, the wave speed increases, which would suggest that for the same frequency, the wavelength should increase, as per \\( v = f \\lambda \\). But, in the context of standing waves on a string with fixed ends, the possible wavelengths are discrete and determined by the length of the string and the harmonic number.\n\nSo, perhaps when we increase the tension, the string becomes tighter, and the standing waves adjust to a different harmonic. Maybe it goes from one harmonic to another, and that's why there's a new set of standing waves.\n\nLet me consider that the original standing waves correspond to a certain harmonic number \\( n \\), and when tension is increased, the new standing waves correspond to a different harmonic number \\( n' \\).\n\nBut the question is about the wavelength compared to the original one, not necessarily about the harmonic number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standing waves are maintained in the same harmonic, but the wavelength changes due to the change in wave speed.\n\nWait, but in standing waves on a string with fixed ends, the wavelength is determined by the length of the string and the harmonic number, as per \\( \\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n} \\). So, for a given \\( n \\), \\( \\lambda \\) is fixed regardless of the wave speed.\n\nHowever, the frequency is related to the wave speed and the wavelength by \\( f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} \\). So, if \\( v \\) increases and \\( \\lambda \\) remains the same, \\( f \\) would increase. But in this problem, \\( f \\) is fixed at 100 Hz by the generator.\n\nThis suggests that changing the tension (and thus \\( v \\)) while keeping \\( f \\) constant would require \\( \\lambda \\) to change to maintain the relationship \\( v = f \\lambda \\).\n\nBut earlier, I thought that in standing waves on a string with fixed ends, \\( \\lambda \\) is determined by the boundary conditions and can only take certain discrete values.\n\nThis seems like a conflict: on one hand, \\( \\lambda \\) must adjust to keep \\( v = f \\lambda \\) valid, but on the other hand, \\( \\lambda \\) is constrained by the boundary conditions.\n\nMaybe increasing the tension allows for different harmonic patterns that weren't possible before, or perhaps the string can support higher harmonics at higher tensions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standing waves are no longer standing waves in the same sense, but I think that's not the case because standing waves require specific conditions that are met by fixed ends.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently. Suppose the original standing waves correspond to the fundamental frequency, where \\( n = 1 \\), and \\( \\lambda_1 = 2L \\). If we increase the tension, the wave speed increases, which would suggest that for the same frequency, the wavelength should increase, but according to the boundary conditions, \\( \\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n} \\), so increasing \\( \\lambda \\) would require decreasing \\( n \\), but \\( n \\) is already 1, the lowest possible.\n\nThis seems confusing. Maybe the standing waves correspond to higher harmonics, and increasing the tension allows for even higher harmonics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standing waves are no longer possible at the same frequency with the increased tension, unless the harmonic number changes.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between frequency, wave speed, and wavelength again. With fixed frequency \\( f \\), if \\( v \\) increases, then \\( \\lambda \\) must increase to keep \\( v = f \\lambda \\).\n\nBut in the context of standing waves on a string with fixed ends, the possible wavelengths are discrete, so the only way to have a different wavelength is to have a different harmonic number.\n\nTherefore, when tension is increased, causing \\( v \\) to increase, to maintain the same frequency \\( f \\), the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) must increase, which corresponds to a lower harmonic number \\( n \\), because \\( \\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n} \\).\n\nWait, but \\( n \\) must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. So, if we start with \\( n = 1 \\), increasing \\( \\lambda \\) further would require \\( n \\) to decrease, but \\( n \\) can't be less than 1.\n\nThis suggests that if we're already at the fundamental harmonic (\\( n = 1 \\)), increasing the tension would make it impossible to have a standing wave at the same frequency, because the required wavelength would be longer than \\( 2L \\), which isn't allowed by the boundary conditions.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the new standing waves correspond to a higher harmonic number \\( n \\), with a shorter wavelength.\n\nBut this seems contradictory to the earlier conclusion that \\( \\lambda \\) should increase when \\( v \\) increases, given fixed \\( f \\).\n\nLet me try to reconcile these thoughts. Maybe the key is understanding that the standing waves correspond to specific resonant frequencies determined by the length of the string and the wave speed.\n\nThe resonant frequencies for a string fixed at both ends are given by:\n\n\\[ f_n = \\frac{n v}{2L} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\)\n\nIn this problem, the frequency is fixed by the generator at 100 Hz, so:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{n v}{2L} \\]\n\nIf we increase the tension, \\( v \\) increases, so to maintain the same \\( f \\), \\( n \\) must decrease, but \\( n \\) must be an integer.\n\nIf we start with \\( n = 1 \\), decreasing \\( n \\) is not possible, so perhaps the only way to have a standing wave at the same frequency with increased tension is to have a higher harmonic, which would require \\( n \\) to increase, but that would imply a higher frequency, which contradicts the fixed frequency.\n\nThis suggests that it might not be possible to have standing waves at the same frequency when tension is increased, unless the harmonic number changes in such a way that \\( f_n \\) remains constant.\n\nWait, let's set up the equation again:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{n v}{2L} \\]\n\nIf \\( f \\) is constant, and \\( v \\) increases due to increased tension, then \\( n \\) must decrease proportionally to keep \\( f \\) constant.\n\nBut \\( n \\) must be an integer, so unless \\( v \\) increases in such a way that \\( n \\) can step down to a lower integer, which isn't possible if we start at \\( n = 1 \\), this suggests that maintaining standing waves at the same frequency isn't possible when tension is increased.\n\nHowever, the problem states that a new set of standing waves is produced when tension is increased. So, perhaps the standing waves correspond to a different harmonic.\n\nLet me consider that the original standing waves correspond to harmonic \\( n \\), and the new standing waves correspond to harmonic \\( n' \\).\n\nGiven that \\( f = \\frac{n v}{2L} \\), and \\( v \\) increases due to increased tension, to keep \\( f \\) constant, \\( n' \\) must be less than \\( n \\). But \\( n' \\) must be an integer, and if \\( n = 1 \\), there's no lower integer, so perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frequency isn't being kept constant in the sense that the generator's frequency remains 100 Hz, but the string now supports a different harmonic at that frequency due to the changed wave speed.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose the original standing waves correspond to harmonic \\( n \\), with:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{n v_{\\text{original}}}{2L} = 100 \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nAfter increasing the tension, the new wave speed is \\( v_{\\text{new}} > v_{\\text{original}} \\). To have standing waves at the same generator frequency of 100 Hz, the new harmonic number \\( n' \\) must satisfy:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{n' v_{\\text{new}}}{2L} = 100 \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nSince \\( v_{\\text{new}} > v_{\\text{original}} \\), to keep \\( f \\) constant, \\( n' \\) must be less than \\( n \\). But \\( n' \\) must be an integer, so if \\( n = 1 \\), it can't decrease further.\n\nThis suggests that if the original standing waves were at the fundamental frequency (\\( n = 1 \\)), increasing the tension would make it impossible to have standing waves at the same frequency, because the required \\( n' \\) would be less than 1, which isn't allowed.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the original standing waves correspond to a higher harmonic, say \\( n = 2 \\), and when tension is increased, the new standing waves correspond to \\( n' = 1 \\).\n\nIn this case, the original wavelength would be \\( \\lambda_{\\text{original}} = \\frac{2L}{2} = L \\), and the new wavelength would be \\( \\lambda_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{2L}{1} = 2L \\), which is greater than the original wavelength.\n\nThis aligns with the idea that increasing tension (and thus wave speed) would require a longer wavelength to maintain the same frequency, according to \\( v = f \\lambda \\).\n\nAlternatively, if the original standing waves were at \\( n = 3 \\), and after increasing tension, they switch to \\( n' = 2 \\), then \\( \\lambda_{\\text{original}} = \\frac{2L}{3} \\), and \\( \\lambda_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{2L}{2} = L \\), which is again greater than the original wavelength.\n\nThis pattern suggests that increasing tension leads to a longer wavelength in the new standing waves compared to the original ones.\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of the new standing waves will be greater than the wavelength of the original standing waves.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nB. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nC. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\n\nD. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\n\nFrom our analysis, the correct answer should be that the wavelength increases when tension increases, provided that the frequency remains constant.\n\nHowever, there's a confusion in the options regarding the relationship between wave speed and wavelength.\n\nFrom the equation \\( v = f \\lambda \\), with \\( f \\) constant, \\( v \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) are directly proportional. So, if \\( v \\) increases, \\( \\lambda \\) increases.\n\nBut some options state that wave speed varies inversely with wavelength, which is only true if frequency is changing, which it's not in this problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct option should be:\n\nC. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, this seems contradictory to the standard relationship \\( v = f \\lambda \\), where \\( v \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) are directly proportional when \\( f \\) is constant.\n\nBut in the context of standing waves on a string with fixed ends and a fixed frequency, the relationship is more nuanced due to the discrete nature of possible wavelengths.\n\nGiven the earlier conclusion that increasing tension allows for a longer wavelength by shifting to a lower harmonic, option C seems to align with our reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
