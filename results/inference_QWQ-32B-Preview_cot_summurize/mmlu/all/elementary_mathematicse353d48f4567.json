                    "text": "So Sam bought 18 stamps for $8.28. And we need to find out how much it would cost him to buy 12 stamps at the same rate. Let's see how to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find out the cost per stamp. If 18 stamps cost $8.28, then one stamp would cost $8.28 divided by 18. Let me calculate that.\n\n$8.28 \u00f7 18 = $0.46 per stamp.\n\nNow, to find out the cost for 12 stamps, I can multiply the cost per stamp by 12.\n\n$0.46 \u00d7 12 = $5.52.\n\nSo, according to this, it would cost Sam $5.52 to buy 12 stamps.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 18 stamps cost $8.28, then 12 stamps would cost x dollars. So, we can set up a proportion:\n\n18 stamps / $8.28 = 12 stamps / x dollars.\n\nWait, actually, it should be:\n\n18 stamps is to $8.28 as 12 stamps is to x dollars.\n\nSo, 18 / 8.28 = 12 / x.\n\nWait, no. Actually, it's better to set it up as:\n\nStamps / cost = stamps / cost, so:\n\n18 / 8.28 = 12 / x.\n\nNow, cross-multiplying:\n\n18 * x = 12 * 8.28.\n\nSo, 18x = 99.36.\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 99.36 / 18.\n\nx = $5.52.\n\nOkay, so I get the same answer using proportions. That's good.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using unit rates or something like that.\n\nI already used the unit rate method by finding the cost per stamp and then multiplying by 12. And it gave me $5.52 again.\n\nLet me see if there's a way to do it without finding the per stamp cost.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the ratio of stamps. 12 stamps is what fraction of 18 stamps?\n\n12 / 18 = 2/3.\n\nSo, 12 stamps is 2/3 of 18 stamps.\n\nTherefore, the cost for 12 stamps should be 2/3 of the cost for 18 stamps.\n\nSo, 2/3 of $8.28.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n2/3 \u00d7 8.28.\n\nFirst, 1/3 of 8.28 is 8.28 \u00f7 3 = $2.76.\n\nThen, 2/3 is $2.76 \u00d7 2 = $5.52.\n\nAgain, I get $5.52.\n\nOkay, so no matter which method I use, I keep getting $5.52.\n\nAnd looking back at the options, option D is $5.52.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. $5.52.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me quickly check if any of the other options make sense.\n\nOption A is $2.19, which is less than the cost for 18 stamps, but 12 stamps should cost less than 18 stamps, but not that much less.\n\nOption B is $2.28, still too low.\n\nOption C is $3.72, which is also less than the cost for 18 stamps, but again, 12 stamps should cost less, but not this much less.\n\nOption D is $5.52, which matches what I calculated.\n\nSo, I can confidently say that the answer is D. $5.52.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
