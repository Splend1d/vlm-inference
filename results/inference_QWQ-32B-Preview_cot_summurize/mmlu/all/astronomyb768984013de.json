The names Phobos and Deimos come from Greek mythology; they are the sons of Ares (the Greek counterpart of Mars) and Aphrodite. Phobos is the larger of the two and is closer to Mars, orbiting the planet in just 7 hours. Deimos is smaller and orbits Mars at a greater distance, taking about 30 hours to complete one orbit."
