Marketable securities\n\nC. Machinery and equipment used in a business\n\nD. Inventory\n\nI need to figure out which one typically qualifies as a capital asset. Let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that capital assets generally include property held for investment or personal use, but not property held for sale in the ordinary course of business. That seems key here.\n\nOption A is accounts receivable. These are amounts that customers owe the business for goods or services provided on credit. I don't think accounts receivable are considered capital assets because they're more like current assets, something the business expects to turn into cash within a year. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B is marketable securities. These are investments like stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments that can be easily bought and sold. I think these would typically be considered capital assets because they're held for investment purposes. When you sell them, you'd likely have to pay capital gains tax on any profit. So, B seems plausible.\n\nOption C is machinery and equipment used in a business. Now, this is interesting. In accounting, these are usually fixed assets or property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). For tax purposes, these are often depreciable assets, meaning their cost is spread out over their useful life through depreciation expenses. I'm not sure if they qualify as capital assets. Maybe they do, but I need to look into that.\n\nOption D is inventory. Inventory consists of goods held for sale in the ordinary course of business. According to the definition I recalled earlier, property held for sale in the ordinary course of business is not a capital asset. So, inventory probably isn't a capital asset.\n\nBetween B and C, I think marketable securities are more clearly capital assets. Machinery and equipment might be considered capital assets in some contexts, but I have a feeling that for tax purposes, they're treated differently, maybe as depreciable assets rather than capital assets.\n\nLet me try to find some confirmation. According to the IRS, capital assets generally include assets such as stocks, bonds, and collectibles, but also business assets like machinery and equipment, except when they're used in a trade or business. Wait, that seems contradictory to what I thought earlier.\n\nUpon further reading, it seems that for individual business owners, machinery and equipment used in the business are not considered capital assets because they're used in the active conduct of the business. Instead, they're depreciable assets. On the other hand, marketable securities would be capital assets.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Accounts receivable: Not a capital asset (current asset)\n\n- Marketable securities: Capital asset\n\n- Machinery and equipment used in business: Not a capital asset (depreciable asset)\n\n- Inventory: Not a capital asset (held for sale)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Marketable securities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
