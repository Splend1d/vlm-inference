                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the Incan empire. The question is: \"At its height, only about _______ of the Incan empire was composed of ethnic Inca.\" And the options are A. 1 percent, B. 10 percent, C. 30 percent, D. 50 percent.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some information about the Incan empire. I know that the Incan empire was one of the largest empires in pre-Columbian America. It was centered in what is now Peru and extended across a large part of South America, including parts of modern-day Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and Colombia.\n\nI remember that the Inca people were originally from the Cusco area and gradually expanded their territory through conquest and assimilation. They had a very efficient administrative system to manage their vast empire.\n\nNow, regarding the composition of the empire, I think that the ethnic Inca were actually a minority within their own empire. They ruled over many different ethnic groups and incorporated them into their empire through various means, including intermarriage with local elites and allowing some degree of autonomy in cultural and religious practices.\n\nI recall that the Inca elite would often marry into the families of conquered peoples to solidify their control, but overall, the number of ethnic Inca was relatively small compared to the total population of the empire.\n\nLooking at the options, 1 percent seems too low, but I'm not sure. Maybe 10 percent is more plausible. Let me think about it.\n\nI know that the Inca empire was very large, covering a vast territory with many different peoples. So, it makes sense that the ethnic Inca would be a small percentage of the total population.\n\nI think that 10 percent might be the correct answer. But to be honest, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look it up or recall more specific information.\n\nI remember that the Inca empire was known for its mit'a system, which was a labor tax where able-bodied people were required to work for the state. This system helped in public works, agriculture, and military campaigns.\n\nBut I don't recall specific numbers regarding the ethnic composition of the empire.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the administrative structure. The Inca divided their empire into four large regions, or suyus, and had a complex bureaucracy to manage them.\n\nThey also had a policy of relocating large groups of people to areas that needed settlement or to break up resistance in newly conquered areas. This practice, known as mitma, would have further diluted the proportion of ethnic Inca within the empire.\n\nGiven that, it seems likely that ethnic Inca were a minority, perhaps around 10 percent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was higher at 30 percent. But that still seems low for an empire that expanded so much.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should think about it differently. If the Inca started as a small group in Cusco and expanded outwards, conquering neighboring peoples, it's logical that the core area around Cusco had a higher concentration of ethnic Inca, while the peripheries had mostly local populations.\n\nSo, across the entire empire, the percentage of ethnic Inca would be lower than in the heartland.\n\nI think that's a good point. Therefore, 10 percent seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was higher, but I tend to think that in large empires built through conquest, the ruling group is usually a minority.\n\nFor example, in the Roman Empire, Romans were a minority in their own empire.\n\nSimilarly, in the British Empire, British people were a small percentage of the total population.\n\nSo, applying that logic, I would guess that ethnic Inca were a minority in their empire.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1 percent seems too low, but I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider the population sizes.\n\nI recall that the Incan empire had a population of several millions at its height. Let's say around 10 million people.\n\nIf ethnic Inca were 10 percent, that would be 1 million people.\n\nWas the ethnic Inca population around 1 million?\n\nI don't know. Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total population was smaller.\n\nI need to be careful here because I don't have exact figures memorized.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I can think about the number of ethnic Inca in the army.\n\nI don't know if that would help directly, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the Inca empire was known for its centralization and bureaucratic efficiency, it's possible that a larger proportion of the population was ethnically Inca, but I doubt it.\n\nI think the opposite is more likely: a small elite group ruling over a larger diverse population.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with 10 percent as the answer.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 10 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
