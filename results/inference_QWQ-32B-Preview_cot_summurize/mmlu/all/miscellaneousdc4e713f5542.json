I think she's been with him since way back when they were on WMCA in New York. I remember hearing about them together on the radio all the time. Plus, I've seen her in some interviews and stuff. So, I'm going to go with D. Robin Quivers.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about the other options. Allison Norris, I think she was on his show too, but I'm not sure if she was his main sidekick. Maybe she was a co-host or something. Jackie Reeses, I'm not familiar with that name in relation to Howard Stern. Maybe she's from another show or something. And Jackie Martling, I think she was on his show for a while, but again, I'm not sure if she was his main sidekick.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that Robin Quivers has been with Howard Stern for over three decades. She's been his long-time co-host and sidekick. She's been through all the radio station changes with him, from WMCA to WXRK and then to Sirius XM. She's also been involved in various segments and has a distinctive voice and personality that complements Howard's.\n\nI think the other options are probably distractors, maybe people who have worked with him in some capacity but aren't his main sidekick. So, I'm confident that the answer is D. Robin Quivers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
