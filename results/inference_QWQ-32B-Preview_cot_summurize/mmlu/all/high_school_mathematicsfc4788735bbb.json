                    "text": "So Owen has blue jeans with a 32-inch waist, and his waist circumference increases by 15%. I need to find out what his new jean waist size will be, rounded to the nearest whole inch. The options are 35, 36, 37, or 38 inches.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 15% increase in his waist circumference means. If his original waist is 32 inches, a 15% increase would be 32 inches plus 15% of 32 inches.\n\nTo calculate 15% of 32, I can multiply 32 by 0.15.\n\nSo, 32 * 0.15 = 4.8 inches.\n\nNow, I add that increase to his original waist size: 32 + 4.8 = 36.8 inches.\n\nSince jean sizes are typically in whole inches, I need to round 36.8 to the nearest whole number. 36.8 is closer to 37 than to 36, so the new waist size would be 37 inches.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at percentage increases.\n\nI recall that to increase a number by a certain percentage, you can also multiply the original number by (1 + the percentage increase in decimal form). So, for a 15% increase, it would be 32 * (1 + 0.15) = 32 * 1.15.\n\nLet me calculate that: 32 * 1.15 = 36.8 inches, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nRounding 36.8 to the nearest whole inch is indeed 37 inches.\n\nLooking back at the options, 37 inches is option C.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider how jean sizes are actually measured. I know that sometimes clothing sizes don't increase in every half-inch or inch, but in specific sizes. Maybe the options are the only possible sizes Owen can choose from.\n\nGiven that, and the options are 35, 36, 37, and 38 inches, and since 36.8 is closer to 37, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the jeans only come in even sizes, but 37 is an option here, I think C. 37 inches is the right answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the percentage increase directly. 15% of 32 is 4.8, and adding that to 32 gives 36.8, which rounds to 37.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this calculation, so I'm confident that 37 inches is the correct new waist size for Owen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
