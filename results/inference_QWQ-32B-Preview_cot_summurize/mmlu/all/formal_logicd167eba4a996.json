A \u2228 B\n\n3. ~C\n\nAnd I need to find which of the options is an immediate consequence from these premises. The options are:\n\nA. ~A \u2228 ~B\n\nB. ~~C\n\nC. C \u2228 D\n\nD. (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what an \"immediate consequence\" means in this context. I think it means that there's a direct inference or a single step logical derivation from the given premises.\n\nSo, starting with the premises:\n\n1. (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D)\n\n2. A \u2228 B\n\n3. ~C\n\nI know that in logic, if I have a conditional statement P \u2283 Q and I know P is true, then I can infer Q. This is called modus ponens.\n\nLooking at premises 1 and 2:\n\nPremise 1: (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D)\n\nPremise 2: A \u2228 B\n\nSo, by modus ponens, from these two, I can infer C \u2228 D.\n\nWait, but option C is C \u2228 D. So maybe C is an immediate consequence.\n\nBut hold on, there's another premise: ~C.\n\nSo, if I have C \u2228 D and ~C, can I get something else?\n\nWell, if I have C \u2228 D and ~C, then by disjunctive syllogism, I can infer D.\n\nBut D isn't one of the options.\n\nLet me check option D: (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D\n\nIs that an immediate consequence?\n\nHmm, not sure yet.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: ~A \u2228 ~B\n\nIs this an immediate consequence of the premises?\n\nWell, ~A \u2228 ~B is equivalent to ~(A \u2227 B) by De Morgan's law.\n\nBut looking at the premises, I have (A \u2228 B), which doesn't directly give me anything about ~(A \u2227 B).\n\nSo, I don't think option A follows immediately from the premises.\n\nOption B: ~~C\n\nWell, ~~C is equivalent to C, which is opposite to premise 3: ~C.\n\nSo, if premise 3 is ~C, then ~~C would be inconsistent with premise 3.\n\nTherefore, option B cannot be an immediate consequence.\n\nOption C: C \u2228 D\n\nAs I thought earlier, from premises 1 and 2, by modus ponens, I can infer C \u2228 D.\n\nSo, option C seems like a direct consequence.\n\nBut is there a more immediate step that leads to one of the other options?\n\nOption D: (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D\n\nIs this an immediate consequence?\n\nWell, from premises 1 and 3, can I get (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D?\n\nLet's see.\n\nPremise 1 is (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D)\n\nPremise 3 is ~C\n\nI need to see if (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D follows from these.\n\nLet's think about it.\n\nIf (A \u2228 B) is true, then (C \u2228 D) is true (from premise 1).\n\nBut I also have ~C, meaning C is false.\n\nSo, if (C \u2228 D) is true and C is false, then D must be true.\n\nTherefore, if (A \u2228 B) is true, then D is true.\n\nThat is, (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D.\n\nSo, option D seems to be a valid immediate consequence as well.\n\nWait, but the question asks for \"an immediate consequence,\" not \"the immediate consequence.\"\n\nSo, maybe there are multiple immediate consequences, but I need to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only one of them is directly derivable in a single step.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nFrom premises 1 and 2, I can directly get C \u2228 D by modus ponens.\n\nThen, combining C \u2228 D with ~C, I can get D by disjunctive syllogism.\n\nBut that's two steps.\n\nOption D is (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D.\n\nIs there a way to get this in one step?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using conditional proof or some other inference rule.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D) and ~C, I can get (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D.\n\nLet me try to see.\n\nAssume (A \u2228 B).\n\nThen, from premise 1, (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D), so C \u2228 D.\n\nBut I have ~C, so from C \u2228 D and ~C, D.\n\nTherefore, (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D.\n\nThis seems like it's derivable in one step using conditional proof.\n\nSo, option D is an immediate consequence.\n\nComparing options C and D, option D seems more directly related to the conditional structure of premise 1.\n\nMoreover, option C is C \u2228 D, which is derivable from premises 1 and 2, but option D is (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D, which is derivable from premises 1 and 3.\n\nGiven that the question asks for \"an immediate consequence in PL of the given premises,\" and considering that option D directly relates to the conditional structure and incorporates premise 3 (~C), I think option D is the most appropriate answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
