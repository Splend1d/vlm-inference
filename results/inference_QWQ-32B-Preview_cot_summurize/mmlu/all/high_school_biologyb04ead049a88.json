                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these options isn't a characteristic of bacteria. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says \"Circular double-stranded DNA.\" I know that bacteria have DNA, and it's usually in the form of a single circular chromosome. So that sounds right for bacteria.\n\nOption B is \"Membrane-bound cellular organelles.\" Now, I recall that eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria and nuclei, but bacteria are prokaryotes. Prokaryotes don't have those membrane-bound organelles. So this might be the answer.\n\nOption C mentions \"Plasma membrane consisting of lipids and proteins.\" Bacteria do have a plasma membrane, and it is made up of lipids and proteins. That's a basic component of cell structure.\n\nOption D is \"Ribosomes that synthesize polypeptides.\" Bacteria do have ribosomes, and their ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, just like in other cells.\n\nSo, considering that, option B seems to be the one that's not a characteristic of bacteria, because they don't have membrane-bound organelles. But just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nBacteria are prokaryotes, which means their genetic material is not enclosed within a nuclear membrane. They also lack other membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum. So, yes, membrane-bound cellular organelles are not a feature of bacterial cells.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Membrane-bound cellular organelles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
