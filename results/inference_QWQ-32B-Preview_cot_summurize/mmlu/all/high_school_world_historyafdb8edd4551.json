                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Japan's response to Lord Ii's concerns in 1847. So, first, I need to understand what Lord Ii was worried about. From the quote, it seems like he's concerned about the changing world, specifically that other countries have advanced in technology and military power, and he's afraid that Japan might face some great calamity if it doesn't do something about it.\n\nSo, the question is asking how Japan responded to these concerns. There are four options:\n\nA. The government dismantled the Chinese-style civil service system.\n\nB. The government undertook a program of conquest in the Pacific.\n\nC. The country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry.\n\nD. The country turned inward and closed its ports to all foreigners.\n\nLet me think about each one.\n\nOption A: Dismantling the Chinese-style civil service system. I know that Japan had been influenced by China in many ways, including its administrative systems. But I'm not sure if dismantling this system was a direct response to Lord Ii's concerns about foreign threats.\n\nOption B: Undertook a program of conquest in the Pacific. That sounds more like Japan becoming aggressive itself, which doesn't seem like a direct response to feeling threatened by others. Maybe it's a reaction, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption C: Sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry. This seems plausible because if Japan felt threatened by the technological and military advances of the West, it might have decided to learn from them and adopt some of their practices.\n\nOption D: Turned inward and closed its ports to all foreigners. I know that Japan had a period of isolation called Sakoku, where it limited contact with the outside world. But from what I remember, this period was coming to an end around the time of Lord Ii's letter.\n\nGiven that it's 1847, I think Japan was starting to feel the pressure from foreign powers to open up its ports. The United States, in particular, was pushing for trade relations. So, turning inward and closing ports might not be a realistic response at that time.\n\nLet me consider the historical context. In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry of the United States Navy arrived in Japan with steamships, demonstrating the kind of technology Lord Ii was concerned about. This event is often seen as the forcing open of Japan to the West.\n\nSo, before that, in 1847, Lord Ii was already expressing concerns about the changing world and the potential threats to Japan. I think Japan's response was to try to understand and adapt to these changes rather than ignore them.\n\nOption C seems the most logical: sending emissaries to study the West. This would align with the idea of learning from the powers that are perceived as threats, in order to strengthen Japan itself.\n\nOption A, dismantling the Chinese-style civil service system, might be part of broader reforms, but it doesn't directly address the military and technological superiority of foreign states.\n\nOption B, undertaking conquest in the Pacific, seems more like a later development, perhaps during the Meiji period when Japan did expand its empire, but that's after the initial response to the perceived threats.\n\nOption D, turning inward and closing ports, contradicts what was happening historically, as Japan was eventually forced to open its ports.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: The country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think again. Was there a specific period or reform in Japanese history around this time that involved studying the West?\n\nYes, the Meiji Restoration, which started in 1868, was a period of rapid modernization and westernization in Japan. Prior to that, there were movements among certain factions in Japan to open up to the West and learn from them to strengthen the country.\n\nIn the 1850s, after Commodore Perry's arrival, Japan did start to send people abroad to study Western technologies and practices. For example, there was the first Japanese delegation to the United States in 1860, known as the Japanese delegation to the United States, which included officials and students who went to study various aspects of American society and technology.\n\nSo, even though Lord Ii's letter was in 1847, and the Meiji Restoration was in 1868, there was a growing awareness and movement within Japan to engage with the West and learn from it in order to avoid being overtaken or colonized.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option C is the correct answer: The country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
