                    "text": "Cobalt-60 is indeed used in radiation therapy for cancer treatment, and it's interesting to know how it's produced. So, the question is about producing Cobalt-60 by bombarding Cobalt-59 with something. The options are neutrons, alpha particles, beta particles, or X-rays. I need to figure out which one of these can convert Cobalt-59 into Cobalt-60.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Cobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope of cobalt, and it has a different number of neutrons compared to Cobalt-59. Specifically, Cobalt-59 has 33 neutrons, and Cobalt-60 has 34 neutrons. So, the difference is in the number of neutrons.\n\nNow, if I think about nuclear reactions, adding a neutron to Cobalt-59 should give me Cobalt-60. So, option A, neutrons, seems plausible. But let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is alpha particles. Alpha particles are helium nuclei, which consist of two protons and two neutrons. If I bombard Cobalt-59 with alpha particles, that would involve a nuclear reaction where the alpha particle interacts with the Cobalt-59 nucleus. This could potentially lead to the formation of a different element, not just an isotope of cobalt. In nuclear reactions involving alpha particles, the atomic number increases by two and the mass number increases by four. So, Cobalt has atomic number 27; adding two protons would result in an element with atomic number 29, which is copper, not cobalt. Therefore, alpha particles don't seem to be the right choice for producing Cobalt-60 from Cobalt-59.\n\nOption C is beta particles. Beta particles can be either electrons or positrons. In nuclear reactions, beta particles are often involved in beta decay, where a neutron is converted into a proton and an electron (beta minus decay), or a proton is converted into a neutron and a positron (beta plus decay). However, in this case, we're talking about bombarding Cobalt-59 with beta particles to produce Cobalt-60. But beta particles are typically the product of a nuclear decay, not something used to induce a specific nuclear transformation like changing the number of neutrons in a stable isotope. So, this doesn't seem likely.\n\nOption D is X-rays. X-rays are high-energy photons. While X-rays can cause electronic transitions in atoms, they generally don't affect the nucleus in the same way that particles can. Nuclear photoelectric effect is possible, but it's not a common way to produce isotopes, especially not in this context. So, X-rays don't seem to be the appropriate choice for producing Cobalt-60 from Cobalt-59.\n\nGoing back to option A, neutrons, this seems to be the most straightforward choice. When a neutron is captured by a Cobalt-59 nucleus, it can form Cobalt-60. This process is known as neutron capture or neutron activation. Cobalt-59 has a high neutron capture cross-section, meaning it's quite likely to absorb a neutron when exposed to a neutron source.\n\nTo confirm this, I can think about the nuclear reaction equation:\n\nCobalt-59 + neutron \u2192 Cobalt-60 + gamma ray\n\nThis is a typical neutron capture reaction, where the absorbed neutron increases the mass number by one, resulting in Cobalt-60. The excess energy is often released in the form of a gamma ray.\n\nI recall that Cobalt-60 is indeed produced through neutron activation of Cobalt-59 in nuclear reactors. This is a common method for producing radioactive isotopes used in various applications, including medical treatments like radiation therapy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Neutrons.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other ways to produce Cobalt-60 from Cobalt-59. For example, could beta particles or alpha particles somehow be involved in a multi-step process? While it's possible to have a series of nuclear reactions, in this context, where we're talking about bombarding Cobalt-59 with a specific particle to directly produce Cobalt-60, it's most straightforward and efficient to use neutrons.\n\nIn summary, the production of Cobalt-60 from Cobalt-59 is typically achieved through neutron capture, making option A the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
