                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which theory gives the buyer the best chance of success in this scenario. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the buyer bought the eastern two-thirds of the seller's land and built a house there. Then, a year later, she cleared a path across the seller's remaining land to get to a road on the western boundary. The seller watched but didn't object, and the buyer used the path daily for several months before the seller put up a barrier.\n\nNow, the buyer is suing to have the barrier removed. We need to see which legal theory supports her claim best.\n\nOption A is easement by necessity. This usually applies when there's no other access to the property except through another's land. But in this case, it's not clear if the path is necessary\u2014maybe there's another way, just less convenient. So, this might not be the strongest argument.\n\nOption B is easement by implication. This happens when there's a prior use that's apparent and continuous, and it's necessary for the enjoyment of the property. Here, the path was created after the sale, not before, so it might not qualify for an implied easement.\n\nOption C is easement by prescription. This is similar to adverse possession but for easements. It requires continuous and open use for a certain period, typically without permission. In this case, the buyer used the path openly and continuously for several months, but since the seller was present and didn't object, it might be considered permissive, not adverse.\n\nOption D is an express easement. This would require a clear agreement or grant from the seller to the buyer allowing use of the path. There's no mention of any such agreement, so this seems unlikely.\n\nLet me think again. The seller watched the buyer clear the path and didn't object. The buyer used it daily for several months. The path is apparent to anyone.\n\nIn terms of prescription, usually, you need to use the path without the owner's permission for a certain number of years, which varies by jurisdiction, often 10 or 20 years. Here, it's only several months, which is probably not enough.\n\nBut perhaps since the seller was present and didn't object, it could be considered as giving implied permission, making it not adverse.\n\nWait, but the seller later put up a barrier, so maybe they're now trying to revoke that permission.\n\nI think the best theory for the buyer would be an easement by prescription, but the main issue is the time period. Several months might not be sufficient for most jurisdictions' requirements for prescriptive easements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buyer could argue that the seller's failure to object timely constitutes an implied easement.\n\nBut looking back, option B mentions easement by implication, and it says it depends on whether the convenience is sufficiently strong to amount to \"reasonably necessary.\"\n\nIn this case, the path is very convenient for the buyer's use of her land, and she used it daily. Maybe the court could find that it's reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of her property.\n\nComparing that to option C, where the time period might be insufficient for a prescriptive easement, option B seems stronger.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B, easement by implication, depending on whether the convenience amounts to reasonable necessity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
