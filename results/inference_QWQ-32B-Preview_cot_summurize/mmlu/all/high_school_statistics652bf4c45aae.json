                    "text": "So I've got this question about self-efficacy and job satisfaction among teachers. The correlation between their sense of control and their job satisfaction is 0.30. I need to pick the statement that follows from this correlation. Let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation.\" Hmm, this seems to suggest that increasing control leads to higher job satisfaction. But correlation doesn't imply causation, right? A correlation of 0.30 means there's a positive relationship between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, but it doesn't tell us which one causes the other. So, this might not be the best choice.\n\nOption B says: \"If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs.\" This is similar to option A but in reverse. It suggests that increasing job satisfaction leads to more control. Again, correlation doesn't tell us about causality, so this might not be accurate.\n\nOption C says: \"Teachers in the study who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation.\" Wait, the correlation is 0.30, which is positive. A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. So, higher job satisfaction is associated with higher self-efficacy, not lower. Therefore, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says: \"9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\" Okay, I recall that the coefficient of determination, or R-squared, is the square of the correlation coefficient. So, if the correlation is 0.30, then R-squared would be 0.30 squared, which is 0.09, or 9%. This seems correct. It tells us the proportion of variance in job satisfaction that can be accounted for by self-efficacy.\n\nSo, considering all the options, option D seems to be the one that directly follows from the correlation provided. It doesn't make any causal claims and correctly interprets the relationship in terms of variance explained.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
