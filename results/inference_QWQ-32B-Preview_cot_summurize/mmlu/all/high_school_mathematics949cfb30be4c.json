                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers is 240, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) is 24. One of the integers is 48, and I need to find the other one. The options are 1, 120, 20, and 12. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nI remember that there's a relationship between the LCM and GCD of two numbers. Specifically, for any two integers a and b, the product of their LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. In other words:\n\nLCM(a, b) \u00d7 GCD(a, b) = a \u00d7 b\n\nSo, in this case, LCM is 240 and GCD is 24, and one of the numbers is 48. Let's denote the unknown number as x. Plugging into the formula:\n\n240 \u00d7 24 = 48 \u00d7 x\n\nNow, I can solve for x:\n\nx = (240 \u00d7 24) / 48\n\nFirst, let's compute 240 \u00d7 24. 240 times 20 is 4800, and 240 times 4 is 960, so total is 4800 + 960 = 5760.\n\nNow, divide that by 48. 48 times 120 is 5760, so x = 120.\n\nWait a minute, but 120 is one of the options. But the problem says \"the other integer\" is among the options: A. 1, B. 120, C. 20, D. 12. So, 120 is an option, but I need to make sure that this is indeed correct.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation. 240 times 24 is 5760, and 5760 divided by 48 is indeed 120. So, according to this, the other integer should be 120.\n\nBut, I also recall that the LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both, and the GCD is the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder. Given that, let's verify if LCM of 48 and 120 is indeed 240, and their GCD is 24.\n\nFirst, find the GCD of 48 and 120. Let's list the factors:\n\n48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48\n\n120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120\n\nThe greatest common divisor is 24, which matches.\n\nNow, let's find the LCM of 48 and 120. One way to find LCM is to list the multiples of each number until we find the smallest common multiple.\n\nMultiples of 48: 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, 288, ...\n\nMultiples of 120: 120, 240, 360, ...\n\nThe smallest common multiple is 240, which matches the given LCM.\n\nSo, everything checks out. The other integer is 120.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's see if any of the other options could possibly work. Let's check option C, 20.\n\nIf x = 20, then LCM(48, 20) and GCD(48, 20) should be 240 and 24, respectively.\n\nFirst, GCD of 48 and 20:\n\n48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48\n\n20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20\n\nGCD is 4, which is not 24. So, 20 cannot be the other integer.\n\nOption D, 12:\n\nGCD(48, 12): 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\n48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48\n\nGCD is 12, not 24.\n\nOption A, 1:\n\nGCD(48, 1): 1\n\nLCM(48, 1): 48\n\nNeither matches the given LCM and GCD.\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is B, 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
