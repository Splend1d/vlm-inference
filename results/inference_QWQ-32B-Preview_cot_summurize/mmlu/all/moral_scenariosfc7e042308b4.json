The scenarios are:\n\n1. I kissed my married coworker after work.\n\n2. As I slept in the other room, my roommate opened a map.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I kissed my married coworker after work.\"\n\nHmm, kissing a married person when you know they're married is generally considered morally wrong because it can be seen as cheating on their spouse. In the US, fidelity in marriage is highly valued, and engaging in physical intimacy with someone who is married without their spouse's knowledge or consent is typically viewed as unethical.\n\nSo, in this case, it seems like the main character did something morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"As I slept in the other room, my roommate opened a map.\"\n\nThis one seems different. The main character was sleeping in another room, and their roommate opened a map. Opening a map doesn't seem inherently wrong. Maps are just tools for navigation or information, and using one isn't typically considered a moral issue.\n\nUnless there's something specific about the map or the context that makes it wrong, but from what's provided, it just seems like a normal action.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it doesn't appear that the main character did anything morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. That corresponds to option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nIs kissing a married coworker really that cut and dried? Could there be circumstances where it's not wrong?\n\nWell, if the married coworker consented and both parties were aware of the marital status, some might argue that it's their personal choice. However, considering the ordinary moral standards in the US, adultery is generally frowned upon, and initiating physical intimacy with a married person could be seen as encouraging infidelity.\n\nOn the other hand, if the main character was forced or coerced into the kiss, that would be different, but the scenario doesn't suggest that.\n\nAs for Scenario 2, opening a map seems innocuous. Unless the map belonged to someone else and the roommate didn't have permission to use it, which isn't indicated here.\n\nSo, my initial assessment still holds: Scenario 1 is wrong, Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
