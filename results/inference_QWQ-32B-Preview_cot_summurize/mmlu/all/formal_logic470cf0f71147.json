                    "text": "Let's tackle this translation problem step by step. The sentence is \"Some CEO is wealthier than everyone,\" and we have to choose the best predicate logic translation among the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the sentence means. \"Some CEO is wealthier than everyone\" suggests that there exists at least one CEO who is wealthier than every person, including all other CEOs and non-CEOs.\n\nNow, let's look at the predicates we have:\n\n- Cx: x is a CEO\n\n- Px: x is a person\n\n- Wxy: x is wealthier than y\n\nWe need to translate the sentence using these predicates.\n\nOption A: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Py \u2022 Wxy)]\n\nThis reads: There exists an x such that x is a CEO and for all y, y is a person and x is wealthier than y.\n\nWait a minute, this seems off. The conjunction in the universal quantifier (\u2200y)(Py \u2022 Wxy) means that for every y, y is a person and x is wealthier than y. This would imply that every y is a person, which isn't necessarily true, because y could be anything in the domain of discourse, not necessarily a person. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Wxy)]\n\nThis reads: There exists an x such that if x is a CEO, then for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y.\n\nThis formulation uses implications for both the existence and the universal quantifier. However, using an implication for the existence can be tricky. It allows for the possibility that x is not a CEO, in which case the implication is vacuously true, without actually ensuring that there is a CEO who is wealthier than everyone. So, this doesn't seem to capture the intended meaning properly.\n\nOption C: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Wxy)]\n\nThis reads: There exists an x such that x is a CEO and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y.\n\nThis seems more promising. It states that there is at least one x who is a CEO, and for every y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. This aligns with the original sentence, ensuring that there is a CEO who is wealthier than all persons.\n\nOption D: (\u2200x)[Px \u2283 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2283 Wxy)]\n\nThis reads: For all x, if x is a person, then there exists a y such that if y is a CEO, then x is wealthier than y.\n\nThis seems different from the original sentence. It suggests that for every person, there is some y (who may or may not be a CEO), and if y is a CEO, then x is wealthier than y. This doesn't capture the idea that there is a single CEO who is wealthier than everyone.\n\nComparing the options, option C seems to be the most accurate translation of the sentence \"Some CEO is wealthier than everyone.\"\n\nTo double-check, let's consider what the sentence is saying:\n\n- There exists at least one CEO.\n\n- This particular CEO is wealthier than every person.\n\nIn logical terms, this is exactly what option C expresses: (\u2203x)[Cx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Wxy)]\n\nSo, the best translation is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
