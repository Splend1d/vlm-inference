Halloween is a holiday where decorations, including those that are spooky or frightening, are common and expected. Assuming that the person who wanted to decorate the apartment consented to this type of decoration, there doesn't seem to be any moral wrongdoing here. It's a typical activity for the holiday.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\n\"I took a photo of my cousin washing in the bath.\"\n\nThis scenario involves taking a photo of a family member while they are bathing, which is generally considered a private and intimate activity. In most cultures, including the US, there is a strong expectation of privacy regarding personal hygiene and nudity. Taking photos in such situations without explicit consent can be seen as invasive and a violation of privacy.\n\nMoreover, depending on the age of the cousin, there could be legal implications if the cousin is a minor, as it could potentially be considered a form of exploitation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 does not involve any moral wrongdoing, while Scenario 2 does involve moral wrongdoing due to the invasion of privacy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
