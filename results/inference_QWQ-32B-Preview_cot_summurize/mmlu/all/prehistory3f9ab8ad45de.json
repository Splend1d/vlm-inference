I remember that Homo erectus was an important human ancestor, but I need to recall their key features.\n\nOption A says: \"a sophisticated stone-tool technology, cooperative hunting, and the controlled use of fire.\" That sounds promising. I think Homo erectus was known for making more advanced stone tools compared to earlier hominins. They probably hunted in groups, and there's evidence that they used fire, although maybe not everywhere they lived.\n\nOption B mentions \"a primitive stone-tool technology,\" but I thought their tools were more advanced. Also, it talks about the sophisticated use of wood for shelters and the earliest known gardening. I don't recall Homo erectus being associated with building shelters or gardening. That seems more advanced for their time.\n\nOption C includes \"elaborate burials with many grave goods.\" That sounds more like behaviors seen in later human species, maybe Neanderthals or early Homo sapiens, not Homo erectus. They were probably the first to bury their dead, but I don't think there's evidence of elaborate burials with lots of grave goods.\n\nOption D says \"a primitive stone-tool technology, the first evidence for fishing, and the construction of stone buildings.\" Again, I thought their stone tools were more advanced, and I don't remember them building stone buildings. Fishing might be possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, Option A seems the most accurate. Homo erectus did have more sophisticated stone tools than their predecessors, likely engaged in cooperative hunting, and there is evidence of fire use at many of their sites.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check about the fire use. I think some sources suggest that while they could control fire, it wasn't universal across all Homo erectus sites. But compared to earlier hominins, they had a much broader use of fire.\n\nAlso, about the stone tools, they made handaxes and other Acheulean tools, which were a significant step up from the Oldowan tools used by earlier hominins like Homo habilis.\n\nCooperative hunting also makes sense because Homo erectus had a larger brain and was likely more socially complex, which would facilitate group hunting.\n\nOption B seems incorrect because Homo erectus's tools were not primitive; they were actually quite an advancement. And building shelters and gardening are behaviors that come later in human evolution.\n\nOption C's elaborate burials with grave goods don't align with what we know about Homo erectus. While they may have buried their dead, there's no evidence of elaborate rituals or grave goods.\n\nOption D's primitive tools don't match, and constructing stone buildings is too advanced for Homo erectus.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
