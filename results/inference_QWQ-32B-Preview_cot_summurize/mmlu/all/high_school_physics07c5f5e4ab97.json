In experiments like the oil drop experiment conducted by Robert Millikan, the charge on oil drops is found to be integer multiples of this fundamental charge because the oil drops acquire charges by gaining or losing electrons.\n\nGiven this, let's examine each option to see if it is an integer multiple of \\(1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\) C.\n\nOption A: \\(6.4 \\times 10^{-19}\\) C\n\nTo find out how many fundamental charges this is, we divide the given charge by the fundamental charge:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6.4 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{C}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{C}} = 4\n\\]\n\nThis is exactly 4 times the fundamental charge, so it is likely correct.\n\nOption B: \\(8.0 \\times 10^{-19}\\) C\n\nSimilarly, divide by the fundamental charge:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{C}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{C}} = 5\n\\]\n\nThis is exactly 5 times the fundamental charge, so it is also likely correct.\n\nOption C: \\(4.8 \\times 10^{-19}\\) C\n\nDivide by the fundamental charge:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4.8 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{C}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{C}} = 3\n\\]\n\nThis is exactly 3 times the fundamental charge, so it is likely correct.\n\nOption D: \\(2.4 \\times 10^{-19}\\) C\n\nDivide by the fundamental charge:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{C}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{C}} = 1.5\n\\]\n\nThis is 1.5 times the fundamental charge, which is not an integer multiple. Since charges on oil drops should be integer multiples of the fundamental charge, this measurement is highly unlikely to be correct.\n\nTherefore, the measurement that should be rejected as highly unlikely to be correct is option D: \\(2.4 \\times 10^{-19}\\) C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
