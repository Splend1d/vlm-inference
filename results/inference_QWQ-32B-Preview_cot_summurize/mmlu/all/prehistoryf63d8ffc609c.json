                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out in which epoch our earliest non-human primate relatives first appeared. The options are Miocene, Pliocene, Triassic, and Cambrian. I think I should recall some basic timeline of Earth's history to get this right.\n\nFirst, I know that the Cambrian period is very old, like over 500 million years ago. That's when a lot of complex life started appearing, but primates definitely didn't exist that early. So, I can probably rule out Cambrian.\n\nNext, the Triassic period. I think that's around 250 to 200 million years ago, when dinosaurs were beginning to appear. Primates evolved much later than that, so I don't think it's the Triassic.\n\nNow, between Miocene and Pliocene, I need to remember where primates fit in. I think the Miocene is older than the Pliocene. I believe the Miocene is about 23 to 5 million years ago, and the Pliocene is about 5 to 2.6 million years ago.\n\nI recall that early primates appeared quite some time before humans, so it makes sense that it would be in an earlier epoch like the Miocene rather than the Pliocene.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about some famous fossil discoveries. For example, Lucy is a well-known fossil, and she's from the Australopithecus species, which I think is from the Pliocene. But Australopithecus is already quite close to humans, so maybe their earlier ancestors appeared in the Miocene.\n\nAlso, I remember that the Miocene saw a lot of primate evolution, including the radiation of many different primate species. So, it's possible that our earliest non-human primate relatives appeared during the Miocene.\n\nOn the other hand, the Pliocene also had hominids that were more human-like, but I think the really early primates would have been before that.\n\nLet me try to recall the geologic time scale. Going back, we have the Cenozoic era, which includes the Paleogene and Neogene periods. The Paleogene has the Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene epochs, and the Neogene has the Miocene and Pliocene epochs.\n\nPrimates are thought to have originated in the Paleocene or Eocene, but the question is about the earliest non-human primate relatives making their first appearance, which might be referring to a specific group within primates.\n\nMaybe I need to think about when the first anthropoids appeared, since anthropoids are the group that includes monkeys, apes, and humans. If I can pin down when anthropoids first appeared, that might help.\n\nI think the first anthropoids appeared in the Eocene epoch, which is before the Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene. So, if that's the case, then our earliest non-human primate relatives would have appeared even before the Miocene.\n\nWait, but the question specifies \"earliest non-human primate relatives,\" which might be referring to a different group within primates, maybe prosimians like lemurs or tarsiers.\n\nI need to clarify what is meant by \"our earliest non-human primate relatives.\" Are we talking about the earliest primates that are not humans, or are we talking about the earliest relatives to humans that are not humans themselves?\n\nIf it's the former, then perhaps it would be the earliest primates, which date back to the Paleocene or Eocene.\n\nIf it's the latter, meaning the earliest anthropoids or hominids that are not humans, then it might be later, in the Miocene or Pliocene.\n\nI think the key here is to understand what \"our earliest non-human primate relatives\" refers to. I think it's likely referring to the earliest anthropoids, which are our closest non-human relatives among primates.\n\nLooking back, I think the first anthropoids appeared around the Eocene epoch, but again, that's before the Miocene.\n\nHowever, the question lists only Miocene, Pliocene, Triassic, and Cambrian as options, so perhaps I need to choose between Miocene and Pliocene, as the Triassic and Cambrian are too old for primates.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the Miocene is older than the Pliocene, I would guess that the Miocene is when our earliest non-human primate relatives first appeared.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pliocene is when some important human ancestors appeared, but again, I think those would be more closely related to humans, and the question is about non-human primate relatives.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is Miocene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
