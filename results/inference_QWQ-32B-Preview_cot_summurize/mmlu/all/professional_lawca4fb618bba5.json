                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a comedian and a football player on a TV show. The comedian keeps calling the player a \"bench warmer,\" which the player takes offense to and says, \"I am a starter, not a bench warmer.\" Then, the player sues the comedian for slander. At the trial, the player calls a witness who watched the show to describe what they heard. The comedian's lawyer objects, saying it's hearsay. The question is, should the judge sustain the objection or overrule it? And why?\n\nFirst off, let's understand what slander is. Slander is a type of defamation that's spoken, unlike libel, which is written. For slander, the plaintiff (in this case, the football player) has to prove that the defendant (the comedian) made a false statement about them that was harmful to their reputation, and that it was said to someone else besides the plaintiff.\n\nIn this case, the player is alleging that the comedian called him a \"bench warmer\" during the show, which he finds insulting and damaging to his reputation as a professional athlete. So, the key element here is whether the comedian actually made those statements.\n\nNow, the player calls a witness who watched the show to testify about what was said. The comedian's lawyer objects, saying it's hearsay. Hearsay is when someone testifies about something they heard someone else say, outside of the courtroom, and it's offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nIn this case, the witness is testifying about what they heard on the broadcast, which is the comedian's statements. So, it seems like hearsay at first glance because the witness is relaying someone else's words.\n\nBut there's a crucial exception to the hearsay rule that might apply here: the statement is being offered not to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that the player is indeed a bench warmer), but rather to show that the comedian made those statements. In other words, the relevance lies in the fact that the comedian said it, not whether it's true.\n\nIn legal terms, this is known as the statement's declaratory statement or verbal act. Sometimes, what matters is that the statement was made, regardless of its truth, because the act of making the statement itself has legal consequences, like in defamation cases.\n\nSo, in this context, the witness's testimony about what was said on the show is admissible because it's not being offered to prove that the player is a bench warmer, but to establish that the comedian made defamatory statements about the player.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Sustain the objection, because the witness's testimony is not the best evidence.\n\nWell, the best evidence rule typically applies to written documents, requiring the original document to be produced. Here, it's about verbal statements on a broadcast, so this doesn't seem directly applicable.\n\nB. Sustain the objection, because the witness does not have firsthand knowledge whether the comedian was reading from a script.\n\nThe witness saw the show, so they have firsthand knowledge of what was said during the broadcast. Whether the comedian was reading from a script or speaking off-the-cuff might be relevant to intent, but it doesn't affect the admissibility of the witness's testimony about what was said.\n\nC. Overrule the objection, because defamatory statements aren't hearsay.\n\nThis is getting closer. As I mentioned, in defamation cases, the statement is offered to show that it was made, not necessarily to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, it might fall under an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nD. Overrule the objection, because the witness is qualified to render a lay opinion as to what he heard.\n\nLay opinion testimony is allowed when it's rationally based on the witness's perception, helpful to clearly understanding the witness's testimony or determining a fact in issue, and not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of expert testimony.\n\nIn this case, the witness is testifying about what they heard, which is straightforward sensory perception, so they're not really offering an \"opinion\" so much as a factual account of what was said.\n\nConsidering all this, the most appropriate answer seems to be C. Overrule the objection, because defamatory statements aren't hearsay.\n\nWait, but actually, defamatory statements can be hearsay; it's just that in this context, they're being offered to show that the statement was made, not to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, it's an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nPerhaps a better way to frame it is that the statement is being offered for its declaratory value, not for its truth. Therefore, it's not considered hearsay.\n\nSo, the judge should overrule the objection because the witness's testimony is admissible as evidence that the comedian made the statements in question, which is central to the defamation claim.\n\nOption C seems to capture that, even if it's phrased a bit loosely.\n\nAlternatively, option D could be considered, but I think the core reason is more aligned with the exception to hearsay for statements offered for their declaratory value, rather than the witness's ability to offer a lay opinion.\n\nTherefore, I think C is the better choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
