                    "text": "All right, so I've got this question here: \"Which of the following is NOT a group?\" and then it lists a bunch of options. I need to figure out which one doesn't qualify as a group. Okay, first things first, I should remember what a group is in mathematical terms.\n\nA group is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two of its elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions are met: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. Let me break that down.\n\n1. **Closure**: For any two elements a and b in the group, the result of the operation, a * b, is also in the group.\n\n2. **Associativity**: For any three elements a, b, and c in the group, (a * b) * c equals a * (b * c).\n\n3. **Identity**: There's an element e in the group such that for every element a, e * a and a * e both equal a.\n\n4. **Invertibility**: For every element a in the group, there's an element b in the group such that a * b and b * a both equal the identity element.\n\nGot it. Now, let's look at each option and see if they satisfy these four properties.\n\n**Option A: The integers under addition**\n\n- **Closure**: If you add any two integers, you get another integer. So, yes, closure holds.\n\n- **Associativity**: Addition of integers is associative. That is, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for any integers a, b, c.\n\n- **Identity**: The integer 0 serves as the identity element because adding 0 to any integer doesn't change its value.\n\n- **Invertibility**: Every integer a has an inverse, which is -a, since a + (-a) = 0, which is the identity element.\n\nSo, the integers under addition satisfy all four group properties. Therefore, this is a group.\n\n**Option B: The nonzero integers under multiplication**\n\n- **Closure**: Multiplying any two nonzero integers gives another nonzero integer. So, closure holds.\n\n- **Associativity**: Multiplication of integers is associative. That is, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) for any nonzero integers a, b, c.\n\n- **Identity**: The integer 1 serves as the identity element because multiplying any nonzero integer by 1 doesn't change its value.\n\n- **Invertibility**: Here's where it gets tricky. For a nonzero integer a, its multiplicative inverse would be 1/a. But 1/a is not necessarily an integer unless a is 1 or -1. For example, the inverse of 2 would be 1/2, which is not an integer. Therefore, not every element has an inverse in this set.\n\nSince invertibility fails for most nonzero integers, this set does not form a group under multiplication.\n\n**Option C: The nonzero real numbers under multiplication**\n\n- **Closure**: Multiplying any two nonzero real numbers gives another nonzero real number. So, closure holds.\n\n- **Associativity**: Multiplication of real numbers is associative. That is, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) for any nonzero real numbers a, b, c.\n\n- **Identity**: The real number 1 serves as the identity element because multiplying any nonzero real number by 1 doesn't change its value.\n\n- **Invertibility**: For any nonzero real number a, its multiplicative inverse is 1/a, which is also a nonzero real number. Therefore, every element has an inverse in this set.\n\nAll four group properties are satisfied here, so the nonzero real numbers under multiplication form a group.\n\n**Option D: The complex numbers under addition**\n\n- **Closure**: Adding any two complex numbers gives another complex number. So, closure holds.\n\n- **Associativity**: Addition of complex numbers is associative. That is, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for any complex numbers a, b, c.\n\n- **Identity**: The complex number 0 + 0i serves as the identity element because adding it to any complex number doesn't change its value.\n\n- **Invertibility**: For any complex number a + bi, its additive inverse is -a - bi, which is also a complex number. Therefore, every element has an inverse in this set.\n\nAgain, all four group properties are satisfied, so the complex numbers under addition form a group.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, option B is the one that does not form a group under the specified operation because not every nonzero integer has a multiplicative inverse that is also a nonzero integer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
