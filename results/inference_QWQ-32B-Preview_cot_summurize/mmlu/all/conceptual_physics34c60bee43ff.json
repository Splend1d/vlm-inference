                    "text": "So I've got this question here about decibels and sound intensity. It says: \"Compared with a sound of 60 decibels, a sound of 80 decibels has an intensity\n\nA. 10 times greater\n\nB. 100 times greater\n\nC. 1000 times greater\n\nD. more than 1000 times greater\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what decibels are and how they relate to sound intensity. I remember that decibels (dB) are a logarithmic unit used to measure the intensity of sounds, among other things. The formula that connects sound intensity (I) with decibels (\u03b2) is:\n\n\u03b2 (dB) = 10 * log\u2081\u2080 (I / I\u2080)\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03b2 is the sound level in decibels\n\n- I is the intensity of the sound in watts per square meter (W/m\u00b2)\n\n- I\u2080 is the reference intensity, which is usually taken as the threshold of human hearing, about 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 W/m\u00b2.\n\nSo, if I have two sound levels, say \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082, corresponding to intensities I\u2081 and I\u2082, I can set up equations for both:\n\n\u03b2\u2081 = 10 * log\u2081\u2080 (I\u2081 / I\u2080)\n\n\u03b2\u2082 = 10 * log\u2081\u2080 (I\u2082 / I\u2080)\n\nNow, I need to find out how much greater the intensity I\u2082 is compared to I\u2081 when \u03b2\u2082 is 80 dB and \u03b2\u2081 is 60 dB.\n\nLet me calculate the difference in decibels:\n\n\u0394\u03b2 = \u03b2\u2082 - \u03b2\u2081 = 80 dB - 60 dB = 20 dB\n\nI know that a difference of 10 dB corresponds to a tenfold increase in intensity. So, 20 dB should correspond to a hundredfold increase, right? Because 10 dB is 10 times, 20 dB is 10 times 10, which is 100 times.\n\nLet me verify that with the formula.\n\nStarting with the decibel difference:\n\n\u0394\u03b2 = 10 * log\u2081\u2080 (I\u2082 / I\u2081)\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n20 = 10 * log\u2081\u2080 (I\u2082 / I\u2081)\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n2 = log\u2081\u2080 (I\u2082 / I\u2081)\n\nNow, to solve for I\u2082 / I\u2081, I can rewrite this in exponential form:\n\nI\u2082 / I\u2081 = 10\u00b2 = 100\n\nSo, I\u2082 is 100 times greater than I\u2081.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 100 times greater.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a different way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the original formula for both sound levels:\n\n\u03b2\u2081 = 10 * log\u2081\u2080 (I\u2081 / I\u2080) = 60 dB\n\n\u03b2\u2082 = 10 * log\u2081\u2080 (I\u2082 / I\u2080) = 80 dB\n\nI can solve each equation for I\u2081 and I\u2082.\n\nStarting with \u03b2\u2081:\n\n60 = 10 * log\u2081\u2080 (I\u2081 / I\u2080)\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n6 = log\u2081\u2080 (I\u2081 / I\u2080)\n\nConvert to exponential form:\n\nI\u2081 / I\u2080 = 10\u2076\n\nSimilarly, for \u03b2\u2082:\n\n80 = 10 * log\u2081\u2080 (I\u2082 / I\u2080)\n\nDivide by 10:\n\n8 = log\u2081\u2080 (I\u2082 / I\u2080)\n\nExponential form:\n\nI\u2082 / I\u2080 = 10\u2078\n\nNow, to find the ratio I\u2082 / I\u2081:\n\n(I\u2082 / I\u2080) / (I\u2081 / I\u2080) = (10\u2078) / (10\u2076) = 10\u00b2 = 100\n\nSo again, I\u2082 is 100 times greater than I\u2081.\n\nIt seems consistent. I think B is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, the options include \"more than 1000 times greater.\" Is there any chance I'm missing something?\n\nLet me consider if perhaps there's a mistake in assuming the reference intensity I\u2080 is the same for both sounds. But in standard decibel calculations, I\u2080 is a constant, so that should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different formula for decibels that I'm not recalling. But no, for sound intensity, this is the appropriate formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps decibels don't work exactly linearly in terms of addition. But from what I've calculated, adding 10 dB multiplies the intensity by 10, and adding 20 dB multiplies by 100, and so on.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose I consider the general relationship between sound level in decibels and intensity:\n\n\u03b2 = 10 * log\u2081\u2080 (I / I\u2080)\n\nThen, if I have two intensities, I\u2081 and I\u2082, with sound levels \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082, the ratio of their intensities is:\n\nI\u2082 / I\u2081 = 10^{(\u03b2\u2082 - \u03b2\u2081)/10}\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nI\u2082 / I\u2081 = 10^{(80 - 60)/10} = 10^{20/10} = 10\u00b2 = 100\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I'm solid here. The answer should be B. 100 times greater.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that the answer could be C. 1000 times greater or D. more than 1000 times greater.\n\nFor that to be the case, the difference in decibels would need to be higher. For example:\n\n- A 30 dB difference would correspond to a 1000 times increase in intensity (since 10^{3} = 1000)\n\n- A 40 dB difference would correspond to a 10,000 times increase (10^{4} = 10,000), and so on.\n\nBut in this problem, the difference is only 20 dB, which is exactly 100 times.\n\nTherefore, options C and D are not correct in this context.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible angles here. The answer should definitely be B. 100 times greater.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
