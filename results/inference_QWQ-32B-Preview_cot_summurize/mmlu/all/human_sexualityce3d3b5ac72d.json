The options are:\n\nA. some monkey species\n\nB. some ape species\n\nC. some breeds of dogs\n\nD. A and B only\n\nFirst, I know that humans are apes, and we have menstrual cycles, so that suggests that some ape species do have menstrual cycles. So, B seems likely.\n\nNow, monkeys are closely related to apes, but I'm not sure if all monkey species have menstrual cycles or not. I think some might, but I'm not certain.\n\nAs for dogs, I know that female dogs have estrus cycles, which are different from menstrual cycles. So, I don't think any breeds of dogs have menstrual cycles.\n\nWait, what's the difference between estrus and menstrual cycles again? In estrus, animals are only receptive to mating during that period, right? Like when dogs are in heat. Whereas menstrual cycles involve shedding of the uterine lining monthly, regardless of mating.\n\nSo, if dogs have estrus cycles, that means they don't have menstrual cycles. So, C is probably not correct.\n\nLooking back, if A and B are correct, then D would be \"A and B only,\" which seems to align with my thoughts so far.\n\nBut I need to confirm about monkeys. Do some monkey species have menstrual cycles?\n\nI recall that primates, which include monkeys and apes, have different reproductive systems. Some primates have menstrual cycles, while others have estrus cycles.\n\nActually, in primates, menstrual cycles are more common, whereas in other mammals, estrus cycles are more typical.\n\nSo, it's likely that some monkey species do have menstrual cycles.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about all monkey species. Maybe only some of them have menstrual cycles.\n\nSimilarly, among ape species, I believe all of them have menstrual cycles, since humans do, and we're apes.\n\nBut I need to be careful here.\n\nMaybe I should look up the definitions again.\n\nMenstrual cycles are characterized by regular shedding of the uterine lining, even when the female is not pregnant.\n\nEstrus cycles, on the other hand, coordinate the period of fertility with ovulation, and there might not be bleeding if not pregnant.\n\nIn primates, particularly in higher primates like monkeys and apes, menstrual cycles are more common.\n\nSo, it's likely that both some monkey species and some ape species have menstrual cycles.\n\nBut option D says \"A and B only,\" which implies that only A and B are correct, and C is not.\n\nSince I believe C is not correct, because dogs have estrus cycles, not menstrual cycles, then D seems to be the right answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if all ape species have menstrual cycles.\n\nAs far as I know, yes, great apes like chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and humans all have menstrual cycles.\n\nAs for monkeys, some species might have estrus cycles, while others have menstrual cycles.\n\nSo, \"some monkey species\" having menstrual cycles seems accurate.\n\nTherefore, D, \"A and B only,\" seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
