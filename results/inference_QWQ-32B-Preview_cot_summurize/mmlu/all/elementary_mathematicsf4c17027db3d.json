                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"Which ratios are equal to 4 : 32?\" and there are some options provided. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for two ratios to be equal. I think it means that they represent the same relationship between numbers, like they are proportional or something. Maybe I should simplify the ratio 4 : 32 to see what it reduces to.\n\nSo, 4 : 32. Both numbers can be divided by 4, right? 4 divided by 4 is 1, and 32 divided by 4 is 8. So, 4 : 32 simplifies to 1 : 8. That means any ratio that simplifies to 1 : 8 is equal to 4 : 32.\n\nOkay, now let's look at the options:\n\nOption A: 2 : 96; 2 : 16\n\nFirst, 2 : 96. Let's simplify this. Both 2 and 96 can be divided by 2. 2 divided by 2 is 1, and 96 divided by 2 is 48. So, 2 : 96 simplifies to 1 : 48, which is not equal to 1 : 8.\n\nNext, 2 : 16. Both 2 and 16 can be divided by 2. 2 divided by 2 is 1, and 16 divided by 2 is 8. So, 2 : 16 simplifies to 1 : 8, which is equal to 4 : 32.\n\nSo, in option A, one ratio is equal and the other isn't. Maybe option B is better.\n\nOption B: 12 : 96; 2 : 16\n\nFirst, 12 : 96. Both 12 and 96 can be divided by 12. 12 divided by 12 is 1, and 96 divided by 12 is 8. So, 12 : 96 simplifies to 1 : 8, which is equal to 4 : 32.\n\nNext, 2 : 16. We already did this one. It simplifies to 1 : 8, which is equal to 4 : 32.\n\nSo, both ratios in option B are equal to 4 : 32.\n\nOption C: 12 : 96; 12 : 16\n\nFirst, 12 : 96. We already saw that it simplifies to 1 : 8, which is equal to 4 : 32.\n\nNext, 12 : 16. Both 12 and 16 can be divided by 4. 12 divided by 4 is 3, and 16 divided by 4 is 4. So, 12 : 16 simplifies to 3 : 4, which is not equal to 1 : 8.\n\nSo, in option C, one ratio is equal and the other isn't.\n\nOption D: 2 : 96; 12 : 16\n\nFirst, 2 : 96. We did this earlier; it simplifies to 1 : 48, which is not equal to 1 : 8.\n\nNext, 12 : 16. Again, that's 3 : 4, which is not equal to 1 : 8.\n\nSo, in option D, neither ratio is equal to 4 : 32.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. In option A, only one ratio is equal; in option B, both are equal; in option C, one is equal and one isn't; in option D, neither is equal.\n\nSo, the question is asking which ratios are equal to 4 : 32, and the answer should be the option where both ratios are equal to 4 : 32.\n\nThat would be option B.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nOption B: 12 : 96 and 2 : 16 both simplify to 1 : 8, which is the same as 4 : 32.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe I can check by cross-multiplying or something.\n\nFor ratios a : b and c : d, if a/b = c/d, then the ratios are equal.\n\nSo, for 4 : 32 and 12 : 96, is 4/32 equal to 12/96?\n\n4 divided by 32 is 0.125, and 12 divided by 96 is also 0.125. So, yes, they are equal.\n\nSimilarly, 4 : 32 and 2 : 16: 4/32 = 0.125 and 2/16 = 0.125. So, equal.\n\nFor option A, 2 : 96 is 2/96 = 0.0208, which is not equal to 4/32 = 0.125. But 2 : 16 is equal, as we saw.\n\nOption C, 12 : 96 is equal, but 12 : 16 is not.\n\nOption D, neither is equal.\n\nSo, indeed, option B is the correct choice.\n\nI think that makes sense. I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
