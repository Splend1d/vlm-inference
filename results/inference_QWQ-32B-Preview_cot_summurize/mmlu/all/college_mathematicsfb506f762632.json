I need to find out if there are distinct points P and Q where f has certain types of extrema or saddle points. The options are:\n\nA. local maximum at P and at Q\n\nB. saddle point at P and at Q\n\nC. local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q\n\nD. local minimum at P and a saddle point at Q\n\nFirst, I need to find the critical points of f. To do that, I have to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y and set them equal to zero.\n\nSo, let's compute f_x and f_y:\n\nf_x = \u2202f/\u2202x = 3x\u00b2 + 3y\n\nf_y = \u2202f/\u2202y = 3y\u00b2 + 3x\n\nNow, set both equal to zero:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 3y = 0 => x\u00b2 + y = 0 => y = -x\u00b2\n\n3y\u00b2 + 3x = 0 => y\u00b2 + x = 0 => x = -y\u00b2\n\nNow, substitute y = -x\u00b2 into x = -y\u00b2:\n\nx = -(-x\u00b2)\u00b2 = -x\u2074\n\nSo, x + x\u2074 = 0 => x(1 + x\u00b3) = 0\n\nThis gives x = 0 or 1 + x\u00b3 = 0 => x\u00b3 = -1 => x = -1\n\nNow, for x = 0:\n\ny = -x\u00b2 = 0\n\nSo, one critical point is (0, 0)\n\nFor x = -1:\n\ny = -(-1)\u00b2 = -1\n\nSo, another critical point is (-1, -1)\n\nAlright, so we have two critical points: (0, 0) and (-1, -1)\n\nNext, I need to determine the nature of these critical points. To do that, I'll use the second derivative test. I need to compute the second partial derivatives and the discriminant D.\n\nCompute the second partial derivatives:\n\nf_xx = \u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u00b2 = 6x\n\nf_yy = \u2202\u00b2f/\u2202y\u00b2 = 6y\n\nf_xy = \u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u2202y = 3\n\nNow, the discriminant D is given by:\n\nD = f_xx * f_yy - (f_xy)\u00b2\n\nSo, for each critical point, I'll compute D and use the following criteria:\n\n- If D > 0 and f_xx > 0, then it's a local minimum.\n\n- If D > 0 and f_xx < 0, then it's a local maximum.\n\n- If D < 0, then it's a saddle point.\n\n- If D = 0, the test is inconclusive.\n\nLet's apply this to each critical point.\n\nFirst, at (0, 0):\n\nf_xx(0, 0) = 6*0 = 0\n\nf_yy(0, 0) = 6*0 = 0\n\nf_xy(0, 0) = 3\n\nSo, D = (0)(0) - (3)\u00b2 = 0 - 9 = -9 < 0\n\nTherefore, (0, 0) is a saddle point.\n\nNext, at (-1, -1):\n\nf_xx(-1, -1) = 6*(-1) = -6\n\nf_yy(-1, -1) = 6*(-1) = -6\n\nf_xy(-1, -1) = 3\n\nSo, D = (-6)(-6) - (3)\u00b2 = 36 - 9 = 27 > 0\n\nAnd f_xx(-1, -1) = -6 < 0\n\nTherefore, (-1, -1) is a local maximum.\n\nSo, we have one saddle point at (0, 0) and one local maximum at (-1, -1).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. local maximum at P and at Q\n\nB. saddle point at P and at Q\n\nC. local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q\n\nD. local minimum at P and a saddle point at Q\n\nThe correct choice seems to be C. local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure there are no other critical points or any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nIs there any possibility of more critical points?\n\nFrom earlier, we had:\n\ny = -x\u00b2\n\nx = -y\u00b2\n\nSubstituting y = -x\u00b2 into x = -y\u00b2 gave us x + x\u2074 = 0, which has solutions x = 0 and x = -1.\n\nAre there any other solutions?\n\nx + x\u2074 = 0 => x(1 + x\u00b3) = 0\n\nThis factors further: x(1 + x)(1 - x + x\u00b2) = 0\n\nSo, x = 0, x = -1, and 1 - x + x\u00b2 = 0\n\nThe quadratic 1 - x + x\u00b2 = 0 has discriminant (-1)\u00b2 - 4(1)(1) = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0, so no real solutions.\n\nTherefore, only two critical points: (0, 0) and (-1, -1)\n\nAnd our earlier analysis holds.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
