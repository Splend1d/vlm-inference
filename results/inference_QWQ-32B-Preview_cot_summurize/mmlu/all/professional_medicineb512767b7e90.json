                    "text": "So this is a case about a 26-year-old police officer who's coming in for his annual check-up. He seems generally healthy, but he's been having more asthma symptoms lately. Let's see what's going on.\n\nFirst, he's physically active and feels well overall, which is good. But he mentions that his asthma has been more active in the past month. He's been using his albuterol inhaler one to two times a day for wheezing and chest tightness. No mention of reflux, cough with mucus, or fever, which is helpful because those could indicate other issues.\n\nLooking at his medical history, he has atopic allergies, especially to pollen and cats, which makes sense given his asthma triggers might be related to allergens. He's had cold- and exercise-induced asthma for 14 years, so this isn't a new problem for him.\n\nHe doesn't take any other medications, which is good to know for potential drug interactions or side effects.\n\nHis vitals are normal: temperature 37.0\u00b0C, pulse 70/min, respirations 12/min, blood pressure 120/76 mm Hg. Physical exam shows no abnormalities except for scattered rhonchi and wheezes with forced expiration. His peak expiratory flow rate is 240 L/min, but without knowing his personal best, it's hard to interpret that.\n\nNow, we need to decide on the most appropriate management. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Chest x-ray\n\nB. Fexofenadine therapy\n\nC. Increased use of the albuterol inhaler\n\nD. Initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler\n\nLet's consider each one:\n\nA. Chest x-ray: Generally, for asthma that's being managed, unless there's a suspicion of another condition or complications, like pneumonia or pneumothorax, a chest x-ray isn't routinely needed. Since his symptoms are consistent with asthma and there are no red flags, an x-ray might not be necessary at this point.\n\nB. Fexofenadine therapy: Fexofenadine is an antihistamine, which can be useful for allergic symptoms. Given that he has allergies to pollen and cats, which could be triggering his asthma, adding an antihistamine might help reduce those allergic reactions and, in turn, improve his asthma symptoms. It's worth considering.\n\nC. Increased use of the albuterol inhaler: Albuterol is a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) used for quick relief of asthma symptoms. While it's okay to use it as needed, relying on it more than usual might indicate that his asthma isn't well-controlled. Increasing its use could provide temporary relief, but it doesn't address the underlying inflammation causing the asthma.\n\nD. Initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler: Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of asthma control because they reduce airway inflammation. If his asthma has been more active recently, despite using his albuterol inhaler, starting a daily inhaled corticosteroid might be the best way to get his asthma under better control.\n\nConsidering all this, option D seems like the most appropriate management. Addressing the underlying inflammation with a daily corticosteroid inhaler should help reduce his symptoms and decrease his reliance on albuterol.\n\nBut let's think a bit more. Maybe combining options could be better. For example, adding both fexofenadine and a corticosteroid inhaler could be beneficial since he has allergic triggers.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the most appropriate single management step. Given that, starting a daily corticosteroid inhaler seems like the priority, as it directly targets the inflammatory process in asthma.\n\nAlso, considering his peak flow rate is 240 L/min, but without knowing his personal best, it's hard to interpret. If his usual peak flow is higher, say 300 L/min, then 240 would indicate partially obstructed airways, supporting the need for better control.\n\nIn summary, while all options have their merits, initiating a daily corticosteroid inhaler seems to be the most appropriate step for managing his active asthma.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
