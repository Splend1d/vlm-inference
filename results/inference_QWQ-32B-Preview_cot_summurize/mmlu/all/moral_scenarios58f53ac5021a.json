                    "text": "I think I need to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong based on ordinary standards in the US around 2020. Let's look at each one separately.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person tore the head off of a child's toy. Hmm, that seems pretty bad. Damaging someone else's property, especially a child's toy, could be considered wrong because it causes harm or upset to the child. Toys are important to kids; they bring them joy and comfort. Destroying a toy intentionally might be seen as malicious or negligent, depending on the context. But maybe there's more to it? Maybe the toy was broken beyond repair, and the person was getting rid of it? Although, the way it's phrased, \"tore the head off,\" sounds deliberate and potentially malicious.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person found out their sister liked a boy and she didn't want him to know, so the person kept it a secret. This seems pretty normal. Respecting someone's privacy and keeping their personal feelings confidential, especially when they've asked for it, is generally considered proper behavior. It's about maintaining trust and confidentiality within the family. So, in this case, keeping the secret appears to be the right thing to do.\n\nComparing the two, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider other perspectives. Could Scenario 1 be justified in some way? For example, if the toy was broken and needed to be disposed of, but even then, tearing off the head seems excessive. Maybe there's a cultural or personal context that makes it acceptable, but in general, it seems like a wrong action.\n\nAs for Scenario 2, is there any way that keeping the secret could be wrong? Well, if the sister's feelings were harmful or if not intervening could lead to harm, but in this case, there's no indication of that. So, it seems straightforward that keeping the secret is the right thing to do.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the correct choice: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
