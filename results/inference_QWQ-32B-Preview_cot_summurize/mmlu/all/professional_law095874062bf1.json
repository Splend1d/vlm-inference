So, we have James making a written offer to Fred to sell land for $100,000, and the offer states that it won't be revocable for ten days. The offer is signed on April 1, mailed on April 3, and received on April 5.\n\nFirst, I need to understand when the offer becomes effective. In contract law, an offer is effective when it's received by the offeree, which in this case is Fred. So, the offer becomes effective on April 5 when Fred receives it.\n\nNow, the offer is irrevocable for ten days, meaning James can't take back the offer for that period after Fred receives it. So, the offer expires ten days after April 5, which would be April 15.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 10 will not create a contract.\n\nWell, April 10 is within the ten-day period. Since the offer is still open, accepting it should create a contract. So, this seems false.\n\nB. Fred's acceptance on April 5 will not create a contract if James dies on April 4.\n\nHmm, James dies on April 4, before the offer is received by Fred on April 5. In contract law, the death of the offeror generally revokes the offer. So, even if Fred accepts on April 5, the offer is already revoked by James's death. Therefore, no contract is formed. This seems true.\n\nC. Fred stating on April 5, \"I accept your offer, but will pay only $90,000\" creates a contract.\n\nThis is a conditional acceptance or a counteroffer. When Fred tries to accept but changes the terms (reducing the price), it's not a valid acceptance; it's a counteroffer. So, no contract is formed based on this statement. Therefore, this is false.\n\nD. Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 15 will not create a contract.\n\nApril 15 is the last day of the ten-day period. Since the offer expires on April 15, an acceptance on that day should still be valid, assuming it's before any revocation. But, in this case, the offer is irrevocable for ten days, so James can't revoke it before April 15. Therefore, acceptance on April 15 should create a contract, making this statement false.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Fred's acceptance on April 5 will not create a contract if James dies on April 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
