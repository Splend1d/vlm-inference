                    "text": "So I've got this question here about persuasion and communicators. It says that studies on persuasion have shown that when a communicator is credible, the degree to which the receiver's initial position will change is... and then there are four options. Let's see.\n\nOption A says it's unrelated to the sex of the communicator. Hmm, that seems plausible. I don't think the gender should affect how much someone's opinion changes, especially if the communicator is credible. But I'm not sure if that's what the studies show.\n\nOption B says it's unrelated to the amount of discrepancy between the communicator\u2019s position and the receiver's initial position. Discrepancy means how different the communicator's view is from the receiver's. So, this option is saying that whether the communicator's view is slightly different or way off, it doesn't affect how much the receiver's position changes, as long as the communicator is credible.\n\nOption C says that the change is greater when there is a smaller discrepancy between the communicator's position and the receiver's initial position. So, if the communicator's view is pretty close to what the receiver already thinks, then the receiver is more likely to change their position more.\n\nOption D says the opposite: that the change is greater when there is a larger discrepancy between the communicator\u2019s position and the receiver's initial position. So, if the communicator says something very different from what the receiver thinks, then the receiver's position changes more.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the persuasion theory, like the elaboration likelihood model or maybe the heuristic-systematic model. But I'm not sure which one applies here.\n\nWait, there's also the discrepancy theory or something like that. I think it has to do with how much difference there is between the message and the receiver's attitude.\n\nLet me think. If a communicator is credible, and they present a message that's slightly different from what the receiver already believes, maybe that encourages the receiver to consider the new information and adjust their position more.\n\nOn the other hand, if the message is too different, maybe the receiver just rejects it altogether.\n\nBut then again, maybe a large discrepancy would catch the receiver's attention more and lead to greater change.\n\nI'm a bit confused.\n\nMaybe I should look back at some of the key concepts in persuasion.\n\nSo, credibility is important because it affects how much people trust the communicator, and thus how much they are willing to be persuaded by them.\n\nNow, regarding discrepancy, I think there's a concept called the \"threshold of rejection.\" If the message is too far off from what someone believes, they might reject it entirely.\n\nSo, perhaps there's an optimal level of discrepancy that leads to the greatest attitude change.\n\nI think there's a term for this\u2014maybe the \"asymmetry principle\" or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the \"attitude strength hypothesis.\" I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to recall. I think when there's a small discrepancy, people might be more open to changing their position because it doesn't challenge their beliefs too much.\n\nBut if the discrepancy is large, they might feel threatened and resist the persuasion.\n\nHowever, sometimes a large discrepancy can grab attention and lead to more change, but only if the message is compelling and the source is highly credible.\n\nThis seems a bit conflicting.\n\nMaybe I should consider the direction of change. Does a smaller discrepancy lead to greater change, or is it the other way around?\n\nOption C says that the change is greater with a smaller discrepancy, while Option D says it's greater with a larger discrepancy.\n\nI need to decide which one makes more sense.\n\nLet's think about it this way: if the communicator's position is very close to mine, and they're credible, I might be more likely to adjust my position to align more closely with theirs because I trust them.\n\nIf their position is very different, I might be more skeptical and not change as much.\n\nSo, in that case, smaller discrepancy leads to greater change.\n\nBut then again, a larger discrepancy might make me think harder about the issue, considering more aspects, and ultimately changing my position more.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider an example.\n\nSuppose I believe that tax rates should be 25%, and a credible communicator says they should be 26%. That's a small discrepancy. Maybe I'll adjust my position to 25.5%.\n\nOn the other hand, if the communicator says tax rates should be 35%, that's a larger discrepancy. Maybe I'll think about it and adjust my position to 28%.\n\nIn this case, the larger discrepancy led to a bigger change in my position.\n\nWait, but in the first case, I changed by 0.5%, and in the second, by 3%. So, the larger discrepancy led to a larger change.\n\nBut according to Option C, it's greater when there's a smaller discrepancy, which doesn't match my example.\n\nOption D says it's greater when there's a larger discrepancy, which aligns with my example.\n\nBut is this always the case?\n\nMaybe not. Perhaps it depends on other factors, like how credible the communicator is.\n\nBut the question specifies that the communicator is credible.\n\nAnother thought: maybe there's an optimal point where the discrepancy is neither too small nor too large.\n\nIf the discrepancy is too small, there might not be much change because it's too negligible.\n\nIf it's too large, people might reject it altogether.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a sweet spot in the middle where the greatest change occurs.\n\nBut that's not what the options are saying. The options are presenting a general trend: smaller discrepancy leads to greater change, or larger discrepancy leads to greater change.\n\nI think I need to consider the theory behind this.\n\nI recall that when people are presented with messages that are consistent with their existing attitudes, they are more likely to be persuaded to move in that direction, especially if the source is credible.\n\nThis seems to support Option C: greater change with smaller discrepancy.\n\nBut my earlier example suggested the opposite.\n\nMaybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nPerhaps when the discrepancy is small, people are more likely to be open to the message and consider the arguments more carefully, leading to greater attitude change.\n\nWhen the discrepancy is large, people might feel that the message is too far off from their beliefs and either reject it or not process it deeply.\n\nOn the other hand, a large discrepancy might trigger more cognitive activity as people try to reconcile the difference, which could lead to greater change.\n\nThis seems contradictory.\n\nMaybe it's different for different people or in different situations.\n\nBut the question is asking about a general finding from studies on persuasion.\n\nI need to think about what research has actually shown.\n\nI seem to remember that when the discrepancy is small, people are more likely to be persuaded because it doesn't require a big shift in their beliefs.\n\nWhen the discrepancy is large, people might experience cognitive dissonance and either reject the message or change their attitude in a smaller way.\n\nSo, perhaps Option C is correct: greater change with smaller discrepancy.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider the concept of the \"foot-in-the-door\" technique, where you get people to agree to a small request first, and then they're more likely to agree to a larger one later.\n\nBut that's a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"door-in-the-face\" technique, where you make a large request first, and then a smaller one, which people are more likely to accept.\n\nBut again, that's not directly related to discrepancy in attitudes.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the change is proportional to the discrepancy, meaning the larger the discrepancy, the larger the change, up to a point.\n\nBut that would suggest Option D is correct.\n\nHowever, if the discrepancy is too large, people might reject the message entirely, leading to no change or even a backlash.\n\nSo, perhaps there's an inverted U-shaped relationship: initially, as discrepancy increases, so does the change, up to a certain point, after which the change decreases.\n\nIf that's the case, then neither Option C nor D fully captures it, but between the two, Option D is closer because it suggests that larger discrepancies lead to greater change, without considering the possibility of too much discrepancy leading to rejection.\n\nBut since the options don't include any mention of a threshold or curve, perhaps the general trend is that larger discrepancies lead to greater change, given the communicator's credibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the research shows that smaller discrepancies lead to greater change, because people are more likely to accept messages that are similar to their existing beliefs.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look at it from the perspective of credibility.\n\nIf the communicator is highly credible, people trust them more, and therefore are more likely to accept messages even if there's a larger discrepancy.\n\nBut still, perhaps there's an optimal level of discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe credibility amplifies the effect of discrepancy, meaning that with a highly credible source, even a small discrepancy can lead to significant change.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps I need to recall some specific studies on this.\n\nI think there was research by Hovland and Janis in the 1950s on attitude change and communicator credibility.\n\nThey found that credible sources are more persuasive, but I don't recall specifics about discrepancy.\n\nMaybe I should think about the elaboration likelihood model (ELM).\n\nIn ELM, there are two routes to persuasion: the central route and the peripheral route.\n\nIn the central route, people think carefully about the arguments, and in the peripheral route, they rely on cues like the communicator's credibility.\n\nIf the communicator is credible, people might be more likely to take the central route and consider the arguments carefully, leading to greater attitude change, especially if the discrepancy is large.\n\nBut again, this is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that when there's a small discrepancy, the message is more acceptable, and people process it more positively, leading to greater change.\n\nWhereas, with a large discrepancy, people might process the message more negatively or critically, leading to less change.\n\nThis would support Option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a large discrepancy triggers more thought, which can lead to greater change if the message is strong and the source is credible.\n\nThis might support Option D.\n\nI'm going back and forth here.\n\nMaybe I should consider the nature of attitude change.\n\nAttitude change is often gradual and depends on various factors, including the persuader's credibility and the nature of the message.\n\nPerhaps when the discrepancy is small, it's easier for people to accept the new information and adjust their attitudes accordingly.\n\nWhen the discrepancy is large, it might be too big of a leap for most people, even if the source is credible.\n\nTherefore, smaller discrepancies might lead to greater changes.\n\nThis aligns with Option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a larger discrepancy creates more dissonance, which motivates people to change their attitudes more to reduce the dissonance.\n\nThis would support Option D.\n\nBut again, if the discrepancy is too large, people might just reject the message altogether.\n\nSo, perhaps there's an optimal level of discrepancy for maximum attitude change.\n\nBut since the options don't reflect that, I need to choose between C and D.\n\nGiven that the communicator is credible, maybe the larger the discrepancy, the greater the change, up to a point.\n\nTherefore, Option D might be correct.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider that credibility enhances the persuasiveness of the message, allowing for greater attitude change even with larger discrepancies.\n\nIn that case, Option D makes sense.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is D: greater when there is a larger discrepancy between the communicator\u2019s position and the receiver's initial position.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because I can see arguments for both C and D.\n\nMaybe I need to look up some research or recall specific studies on discrepancy and credibility in persuasion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A or B, saying that the sex of the communicator or the amount of discrepancy doesn't affect the degree of change.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right.\n\nI think the amount of discrepancy does matter.\n\nSo, between C and D, I'm leaning towards D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D."
