This system divides people into different layers or strata, with each layer having distinct access to resources and opportunities. The concept is central to understanding social inequality and the distribution of advantages and disadvantages in a society.\n\nOption A, urbanization, refers to the process by which cities grow and expand, often involving the movement of people from rural to urban areas. While urbanization can influence social structures, it is not specifically about hierarchical social levels.\n\nOption B, a social system, is a broad term that encompasses the institutions and patterns of behavior that make up a society. It is too general to describe the hierarchical placement of individuals.\n\nOption D, a necropolis, is an area designated for burials and contains tombs and graves. It is not related to social integration or hierarchical social structures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. social stratification."
