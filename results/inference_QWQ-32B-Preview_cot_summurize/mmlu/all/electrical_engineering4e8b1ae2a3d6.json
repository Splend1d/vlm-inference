                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There's a metal surface with a radius of 1 meter and a surface charge density of 20 coulombs per square meter, and it's enclosed in a cube that has sides of 10 meters. I need to find the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube. The options are 40\u03c0 coulombs, 80\u03c0 coulombs, 10\u03c0 coulombs, or none of these.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what electric displacement is. I think it's related to Gauss's law in electromagnetism. Electric displacement, often denoted by D, is related to the electric field E by the equation D = \u03b5E, where \u03b5 is the permittivity of the medium. But in this problem, since it's not specified, I might assume it's in free space, so \u03b5 = \u03b5\u2080, the permittivity of free space.\n\nBut actually, the problem is asking for the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube. That sounds like the flux of the electric displacement field through the cube's surface.\n\nGauss's law states that the flux of D through a closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by that surface. Mathematically, that's \u222bD\u22c5dA = Q_enclosed.\n\nSo, if I can find the total charge enclosed by the cube, that should give me the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube.\n\nThe metal surface has a radius of 1 meter and a surface charge density of 20 C/m\u00b2. Assuming it's a flat disk or a sphere, but the problem says \"metal surface,\" so maybe it's a flat disk.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total charge on this metal surface.\n\nIf it's a flat disk, the area A would be \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.\n\nSo, A = \u03c0*(1 m)\u00b2 = \u03c0 m\u00b2.\n\nThen, the total charge Q = surface charge density * area = 20 C/m\u00b2 * \u03c0 m\u00b2 = 20\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nNow, since the cube is much larger (10 m sides), enclosing this small disk, the total charge enclosed by the cube is just this 20\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube.\" Is there something I'm missing here?\n\nWait, maybe the metal surface is not a small disk but something larger. The problem says \"a metal surface with 1 meter radius.\" Could it be a sphere?\n\nIf it's a sphere with radius 1 meter, then the surface area A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = 4\u03c0(1)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 m\u00b2.\n\nThen, total charge Q = \u03c3*A = 20 C/m\u00b2 * 4\u03c0 m\u00b2 = 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nBut earlier I assumed it was a disk, which would give Q = 20\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nWhich one is it? The problem says \"metal surface,\" but doesn't specify the shape. However, in electromagnetism, when a problem mentions a \"metal surface,\" it's often a conductor, and charges on conductors distribute on the surface.\n\nBut in this case, since it's a conductor, and it has a uniform surface charge density, it's likely to be a sphere, because for a conductor, the electric field inside is zero, and charges distribute uniformly on the surface only if it's a sphere.\n\nWait, actually, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside is zero, and the surface is an equipotential surface. The charge distribution depends on the shape of the conductor.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the shape, only the radius and the surface charge density.\n\nMaybe I should assume it's a sphere unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, if it's a sphere with radius 1 meter, then A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 m\u00b2, and Q = \u03c3A = 20 * 4\u03c0 = 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nNow, the cube has sides of 10 meters, so it's much larger than the sphere, and it encloses the sphere completely.\n\nAccording to Gauss's law, the flux of D through the cube's surface is equal to the total charge enclosed, which is Q = 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nTherefore, the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube is 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nBut wait, let's check the options:\n\nA. 40\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nB. 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nC. 10\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nD. none of these.\n\nSo, 80\u03c0 is option B.\n\nBut earlier, I considered it might be a disk, which would give Q = 20\u03c0 coulombs, but that seems less likely for a conductor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a flat plate, but in that case, the electric field would be different, and the flux through the cube would depend on the orientation of the plate.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the shape doesn't matter because Gauss's law applies to any closed surface, and the total flux depends only on the enclosed charge.\n\nSo, regardless of the shape of the metal surface, as long as it's enclosed by the cube, the total outward electric displacement should be equal to the total charge enclosed.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the total charge on the metal surface.\n\nGiven that it's a metal surface with radius 1 meter and surface charge density 20 C/m\u00b2.\n\nIf it's a sphere, Q = 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nIf it's a disk, Q = 20\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nBut perhaps it's something else.\n\nWait, maybe it's a cylinder? Let's consider that.\n\nFor a cylinder, the surface area consists of the lateral surface and the top and bottom circles.\n\nBut if it's a solid metal cylinder, the charges would distribute on the outer surface.\n\nBut the problem says \"metal surface with 1 meter radius.\"\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe I should think differently.\n\nPerhaps the \"metal surface\" refers to a flat sheet with a circular shape, like a disk, with radius 1 meter and uniform surface charge density 20 C/m\u00b2.\n\nIn that case, the total charge Q = \u03c3*A = 20 * \u03c0*(1)\u00b2 = 20\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nThen, according to Gauss's law, the flux of D through the cube's surface would be equal to Q = 20\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nBut that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps there's more to it.\n\nMaybe the metal surface is not isolated, and there are induced charges on the cube.\n\nBut the cube is just an enclosure; it's not conducting or anything mentioned.\n\nWait, the problem says \"a metal surface enclosed in a 10 m side cube.\"\n\nIt doesn't say anything about the cube being conductive or having any charge.\n\nSo, I think the cube is just a geometric boundary for applying Gauss's law.\n\nTherefore, the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube should be equal to the total charge enclosed, which is the charge on the metal surface.\n\nSo, if Q = 20\u03c0 coulombs, then the flux is 20\u03c0 coulombs, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if Q = 80\u03c0 coulombs, that's option B.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the permittivity.\n\nWait, electric displacement D is related to the electric field E by D = \u03b5\u2080E.\n\nBut the flux of D is \u222bD\u22c5dA = Q_enclosed.\n\nSo, in free space, \u222bD\u22c5dA = Q_enclosed.\n\nTherefore, the total outward electric displacement is equal to Q_enclosed.\n\nSo, if Q = 20\u03c0 coulombs, then the flux is 20\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nBut that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if Q = 80\u03c0 coulombs, that's option B.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the metal surface is a conductor, and in a conductor, the charge distributes such that the electric field inside is zero.\n\nBut since the cube is outside the conductor, the total flux through the cube should still be equal to the total charge enclosed.\n\nSo, for a conductor, the total charge is Q = 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nTherefore, the flux is 80\u03c0 coulombs, which is option B.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure about the shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nPerhaps using the relation between electric field and electric displacement.\n\nBut in free space, D = \u03b5\u2080E, and Gauss's law is \u222bD\u22c5dA = Q_enclosed.\n\nSo, the total outward electric displacement is Q_enclosed.\n\nTherefore, it should be 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nBut to confirm, let's consider the electric field due to the charged surface.\n\nIf it's a sphere with radius 1 m and charge 80\u03c0 coulombs, then outside the sphere, the electric field is the same as that of a point charge located at the center.\n\nBut since the cube is much larger, enclosing the sphere, the flux through the cube should still be Q_enclosed.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a disk, the electric field would be different, but again, Gauss's law applies, and the total flux is Q_enclosed.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the shape, as long as the charge is enclosed by the cube, the total outward electric displacement is equal to the total charge enclosed.\n\nSo, Q = \u03c3*A.\n\nWhat is the area A?\n\nIf it's a sphere, A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = 4\u03c0(1)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 m\u00b2.\n\nThen, Q = 20 C/m\u00b2 * 4\u03c0 m\u00b2 = 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nIf it's a disk, A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0(1)\u00b2 = \u03c0 m\u00b2.\n\nThen, Q = 20 C/m\u00b2 * \u03c0 m\u00b2 = 20\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nBut in the first case, Q = 80\u03c0, which is option B.\n\nIn the second case, Q = 20\u03c0, which is not an option.\n\nGiven that it's a metal surface, and metals are typically modeled as conductors where charges distribute on the surface uniformly, and for a conductor, the surface area is usually that of a sphere.\n\nTherefore, it's more likely that the metal surface is a sphere, and thus Q = 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nHence, the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube is 80\u03c0 coulombs, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
