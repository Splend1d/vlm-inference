                    "text": "To determine Aston's share of AB Partnership's ordinary income, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total ordinary income of the partnership:**\n   The ordinary income of the partnership is given as $20,000.\n\n2. **Determine the partnership agreement or default sharing ratio:**\n   Since Aston and Becker are equal partners, they typically share income and losses equally unless specified otherwise. Therefore, each partner's share is 50%.\n\n3. **Calculate Aston's share of the ordinary income:**\n   Aston's share = 50% of $20,000 = 0.50 * $20,000 = $10,000.\n\n4. **Consider the impact of distributions:**\n   Aston received distributions of $5,000 during the year. However, distributions do not affect the calculation of his share of ordinary income. Distributions affect his basis in the partnership and his basis in property received, but not his share of income.\n\n5. **Consider the capital gain:**\n   The partnership has a long-term capital gain of $12,000. However, the question specifically asks for Aston's share of ordinary income, so the capital gain is not relevant to this calculation.\n\n6. **Consider Aston's basis:**\n   Aston's basis in AB was $40,000. While his basis can be affected by his share of income and distributions, it does not directly impact the calculation of his share of ordinary income.\n\nTherefore, Aston's share of AB's ordinary income is $10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
