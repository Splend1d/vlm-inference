                    "text": "Let's think about this question step by step. We need to identify which of the given short-run costs always increases as output increases. The options are:\n\nA. Average total cost\n\nB. Marginal cost\n\nC. Total fixed cost\n\nD. Total variable cost\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these terms means.\n\n1. **Average total cost (ATC)** is the total cost divided by the quantity of output produced. It includes both fixed and variable costs.\n\n2. **Marginal cost (MC)** is the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of output.\n\n3. **Total fixed cost (TFC)** is the cost that does not change with the level of output. It's fixed in the short run.\n\n4. **Total variable cost (TVC)** is the cost that varies directly with the level of output.\n\nNow, let's analyze how each of these costs behaves as output increases.\n\n**Option A: Average total cost**\n\nATC = (Total Fixed Cost + Total Variable Cost) / Quantity\n\nAs output increases, the total fixed cost remains the same, but it gets spread over more units, so the fixed cost per unit decreases. The total variable cost increases with output, but the rate at which it increases can vary. Initially, ATC may decrease due to spreading fixed costs over more units, but eventually, as variable costs increase at a faster rate, ATC starts to increase. So, ATC doesn't always increase with output; it first decreases and then increases, forming a U-shape in the long run.\n\n**Option B: Marginal cost**\n\nMarginal cost can behave in different ways depending on the production process. In the short run, initially, MC may decrease due to increasing marginal returns, but eventually, it starts to increase due to diminishing marginal returns. So, MC doesn't always increase with output; it can decrease initially and then increase.\n\n**Option C: Total fixed cost**\n\nTotal fixed cost is constant and does not change with the level of output. So, as output increases, TFC remains the same. Therefore, it doesn't increase as output increases.\n\n**Option D: Total variable cost**\n\nTotal variable cost increases as output increases because more variables inputs are needed to produce more output. The relationship between TVC and output is directly proportional in the short run, assuming input prices remain constant.\n\nGiven this analysis, the cost that always increases as output increases is total variable cost.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Total variable cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
