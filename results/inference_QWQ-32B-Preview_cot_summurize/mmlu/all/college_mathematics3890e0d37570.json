                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit tricky, but if I break it down, I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the rates at which Kate and John work. Kate takes k days to write a test, so her rate is 1/k tests per day. Similarly, John's rate is 1/j tests per day.\n\nNow, they're working in alternating 2-day shifts. So, if Kate starts, her shift is 2 days, then John's shift is the next 2 days, and so on. It takes them 10 days to complete a test this way. Similarly, if John starts, it takes 10.5 days.\n\nLet's see how much work they do in these shifts.\n\nWhen Kate starts:\n\n- In the first 2 days, Kate works, so she does 2*(1/k) of the test.\n\n- Then John works for the next 2 days, doing 2*(1/j).\n\n- This pattern repeats every 4 days.\n\nSince the total time is 10 days, which is 2 full cycles of 4 days (8 days) plus 2 extra days.\n\nSo, in 8 days:\n\n- Kate works 4 days (2 shifts), so she does 4*(1/k).\n\n- John works 4 days (2 shifts), so he does 4*(1/j).\n\nThen, in the remaining 2 days, it's Kate's turn again, so she does another 2*(1/k).\n\nTotal work done:\n\n4/k + 4/j + 2/k = (6/k) + (4/j) = 1 test.\n\nSimilarly, when John starts:\n\n- First 2 days: John works, doing 2/j.\n\n- Next 2 days: Kate works, doing 2/k.\n\n- This pattern repeats every 4 days.\n\nTotal time is 10.5 days, which is 2 full cycles of 4 days (8 days) plus 2.5 days.\n\nIn 8 days:\n\n- John works 4 days, doing 4/j.\n\n- Kate works 4 days, doing 4/k.\n\nThen, in the remaining 2.5 days:\n\n- Since John started, the next shift would be John's, so he works for 2 days, doing 2/j.\n\n- Then, on the 10th day, it's Kate's turn, but only for 0.5 days, so she does 0.5/k.\n\nTotal work done:\n\n4/j + 4/k + 2/j + 0.5/k = (6/j) + (4.5/k) = 1 test.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. (6/k) + (4/j) = 1\n\n2. (6/j) + (4.5/k) = 1\n\nWe need to solve for k and j.\n\nLet's denote 1/k = a and 1/j = b to simplify.\n\nSo, the equations become:\n\n1. 6a + 4b = 1\n\n2. 4.5a + 6b = 1\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations.\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 6 and the second by 4 to eliminate b.\n\nFirst equation * 6:\n\n36a + 24b = 6\n\nSecond equation * 4:\n\n18a + 24b = 4\n\nNow, subtract the second from the first:\n\n36a + 24b - (18a + 24b) = 6 - 4\n\n18a = 2\n\nSo, a = 2/18 = 1/9\n\nNow, plug a back into one of the original equations to find b.\n\nUsing 6a + 4b = 1:\n\n6*(1/9) + 4b = 1\n\n2/3 + 4b = 1\n\n4b = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3\n\nb = (1/3)/4 = 1/12\n\nSo, a = 1/k = 1/9 => k = 9 days\n\nb = 1/j = 1/12 => j = 12 days\n\nNow, if Kate and John work simultaneously, their combined rate is 1/k + 1/j = 1/9 + 1/12.\n\nLet's find a common denominator, which is 36.\n\n1/9 = 4/36\n\n1/12 = 3/36\n\nSo, combined rate: 4/36 + 3/36 = 7/36 tests per day.\n\nTherefore, the time to complete one test is 36/7 days.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 36/7 days matches our answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{36}{7}\\text{ days}} \\]"
