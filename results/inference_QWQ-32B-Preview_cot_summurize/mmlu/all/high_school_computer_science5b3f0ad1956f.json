Each of these components can take on a value from 0 to 255.\n\nFirst, let's think about how many bits are needed to represent a single component, say red, which ranges from 0 to 255.\n\nWe know that in binary, the number of bits required to represent a certain range of values is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{number of bits} = \\lceil \\log_2(\\text{number of possible values}) \\rceil \\]\n\nIn this case, the number of possible values for each component is 256 (from 0 to 255 inclusive).\n\nSo, calculating for one component:\n\n\\[ \\text{number of bits} = \\lceil \\log_2(256) \\rceil \\]\n\nWe know that \\( 2^8 = 256 \\), so:\n\n\\[ \\log_2(256) = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, each component (red, green, blue) requires 8 bits to represent its 256 possible values.\n\nNow, since the RGB color model combines these three components, the total number of bits needed to represent a complete color would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{total bits} = 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nSo, 24 bits are needed to represent a color in the RGB model.\n\nTo further confirm this, consider that each bit can be in one of two states: 0 or 1. Therefore, the total number of possible combinations with 24 bits is:\n\n\\[ 2^{24} = 16,777,216 \\]\n\nThis matches the total number of possible colors in the RGB model, as each of the three components has 256 possibilities:\n\n\\[ 256 \\times 256 \\times 256 = 16,777,216 \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is 24 bits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]\n\n**Additional Insight**\n\nIt's worth noting that while 24 bits are sufficient for most applications, some systems use 32 bits per pixel to include an additional alpha channel for transparency, but in the standard RGB model, 24 bits are used."
