Liberal egalitarianism generally emphasizes equality of opportunity, freedom, and the ability of individuals to pursue their own projects. However, there is diversity within the liberal egalitarian tradition regarding how much weight to give to reducing actual inequalities.\n\nOption A, the ability of people to pursue their own projects, aligns with the liberal emphasis on individual autonomy and self-realization. Option B, equal opportunity, is a central tenet of liberal egalitarianism, aiming to ensure that social arrangements do not disadvantage individuals based on arbitrary characteristics. Option C, freedom of speech, is a fundamental liberal value protecting individual expression and democratic discourse.\n\nOption D, keeping actual inequalities as small as possible, is more associated with egalitarianism that seeks not only equality of opportunity but also equality of outcome. While some liberal egalitarians support such a view, others focus more on process and opportunity rather than the distribution of outcomes. Therefore, it is not a universal concern for all liberal egalitarians.\n\nFor further reading, you might want to look into Joseph Carens' works, such as \"Equality, Moral Incentives, and Market Socialism\" and his contributions to debates on immigration and social justice. His writings often explore the nuances within liberal egalitarian thought and its applications to various policy areas."
