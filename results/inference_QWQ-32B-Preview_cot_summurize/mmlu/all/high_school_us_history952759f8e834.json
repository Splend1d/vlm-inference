                    "text": "Let's see. This quote is from John L. O'Sullivan in 1839, and it's talking about the future of America being great, with a nation of many nations manifesting the excellence of divine principles. It mentions establishing a sacred temple on earth, with a hemisphere as its floor and star-studded heavens as its roof. It talks about a union of many republics with hundreds of happy millions, governed by God's natural and moral law of equality and brotherhood, with peace and good will among men.\n\nSo, I need to pick which option best states the principle described above. Let's look at each one:\n\nA. Colonists were destined to leave the British Empire because of the distance between the New World and England.\n\nWell, the quote is from 1839, which is after the American Revolution, so the colonists have already left the British Empire. This seems unrelated to the content of the quote, which is focusing on America's future greatness and expansion, not on the reasons for leaving Britain.\n\nB. Women are biologically predestined to lives of child rearing and domestic labor.\n\nHmm, the quote doesn't mention anything about women or gender roles. It's talking about nationhood, principles, and expansion. This doesn't seem to align with the principle described.\n\nC. America's expansion to the West Coast was inevitable and divinely sanctioned.\n\nOkay, this seems more relevant. The quote talks about a \"magnificent domain of space and time,\" a hemisphere floor, and star-studded heavens, which could be interpreted as referring to a vast geographical area, possibly from one coast to another. Also, it mentions divine principles and a sacred temple, suggesting that this expansion is divinely sanctioned. The idea of Manifest Destiny was prevalent during this time, which was the belief that the United States was destined to expand across the continent. So, this option seems promising.\n\nD. The abolition of slavery in the United States was certain to come about because slavery was immoral.\n\nThe quote does mention \"governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood\u2014of 'peace and good will amongst men.'\" It talks about equality and brotherhood, which could be interpreted as opposing slavery, given that slavery is inherently unequal. However, the quote doesn't explicitly mention slavery or its abolition. It's possible that this is an underlying implication, but it's not as directly addressed as the idea of expansion in option C.\n\nComparing C and D, option C seems more directly aligned with the content of the quote. The mention of a hemisphere and star-studded heavens suggests a vast geographical area, which aligns with the idea of expanding to the West Coast. Additionally, the language about divine principles and a sacred temple could be interpreted as divine sanction for this expansion.\n\nOption D, while possibly implied, isn't as explicitly supported by the text as option C is. Therefore, I think the best answer is C: America's expansion to the West Coast was inevitable and divinely sanctioned.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
