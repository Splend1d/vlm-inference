                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a radioactive sample that has a half-life of 1 hour. We start with 1.000 gram at noon, and we need to figure out how much remains at 3:00 pm. The options are A) 0.50 g, B) 0.25 g, C) 0.125 g, and D) 0.0625 g.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a half-life is. Half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive material to decay. In this case, it's 1 hour. So, every hour, the amount of the sample is halved.\n\nWe start at noon with 1.000 gram. By 1:00 pm, which is one half-life later, half of it should have decayed, leaving us with 0.500 grams.\n\nThen, from 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm, another half-life passes, so half of the remaining 0.500 grams decays, leaving us with 0.250 grams.\n\nFinally, from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm, another half-life passes, and half of the remaining 0.250 grams decays, leaving us with 0.125 grams.\n\nSo, at 3:00 pm, we should have 0.125 grams left. That corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a formula I can use to confirm this.\n\nI recall that the amount remaining after a certain time can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRemaining amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, initial amount is 1.000 gram, time elapsed is from noon to 3:00 pm, which is 3 hours, and the half-life is 1 hour.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nRemaining amount = 1.000 * (1/2)^(3/1) = 1.000 * (1/2)^3 = 1.000 * (1/8) = 0.125 grams\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the answer should be C) 0.125 g.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that the half-life is meant to be something else? The problem says \"half-life of 1 hour,\" so I think I'm correct.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the time elapsed is correctly calculated. From noon to 3:00 pm is indeed 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're expecting something different, like considering continuous decay or using the exponential decay formula. But since the half-life is given in hours and the time elapsed is in hours, the formula I used should be sufficient.\n\nJust to be thorough, the exponential decay formula is:\n\nRemaining amount = Initial amount * e^(-lambda * time)\n\nWhere lambda is the decay constant, which is ln(2)/half-life.\n\nIn this case, lambda = ln(2)/1 hour = 0.6931/hour\n\nSo, remaining amount = 1.000 * e^(-0.6931 * 3) = 1.000 * e^(-2.0793) \u2248 1.000 * 0.125 = 0.125 grams\n\nAgain, the same result. So, I'm confident that C) 0.125 g is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
