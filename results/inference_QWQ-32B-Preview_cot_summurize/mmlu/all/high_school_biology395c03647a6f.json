                    "text": "Let's think about this scenario. There's a forest with fir, birch, and white spruce trees, and it's been devastated by fire. I need to figure out what's most likely to happen next from these options.\n\nOption A says that only animal life would continue to inhabit the region. Hmm, that seems unlikely because even if the trees are destroyed, there might still be some plants and maybe some resilient species that can survive the fire. So, probably not just animals.\n\nOption B mentions that secondary succession would begin to occur. I recall that succession is the process of one community replacing another over time. Primary succession is when organisms colonize an entirely new area with no previous life, like lava flows. Secondary succession happens after a disturbance in an area that already had an ecosystem, like after a fire. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C says only tough grasses would appear. While it's true that some grasses can withstand fire and might be among the first to recover, it's probably not accurate to say only grasses would appear. Other plants might also start to grow back.\n\nOption D talks about the number of species stabilizing as the ecosystem matures. That sounds more like the end stage of succession, not necessarily what happens immediately after a fire.\n\nConsidering this, option B seems the most likely. After a fire, secondary succession would begin, with pioneer species like grasses and shrubs colonizing the area, followed by larger plants and eventually, possibly, the return of the forest.\n\nBut let me double-check. Fires can be severe, and if the fire was intense, it might have destroyed much of the seed bank and organic matter in the soil. In that case, maybe primary succession would be more appropriate. But the question says it's a forest that was devastated, which implies that there was an existing ecosystem, so secondary succession is still the best fit.\n\nAlso, option A is unlikely because some animals can survive fires, especially those that can flee the area or have adaptations to withstand fire.\n\nOption C is too narrow, as other plants beyond just grasses would likely appear in the process of recovery.\n\nOption D might happen eventually, but it's not the immediate response to the fire.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B: Secondary succession would begin to occur.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
