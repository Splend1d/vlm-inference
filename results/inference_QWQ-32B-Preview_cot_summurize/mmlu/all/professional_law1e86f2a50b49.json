                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, we have a trial going on, and it's the plaintiff's case-in-chief. That means it's the plaintiff's turn to present their case and call witnesses to testify. The plaintiff calls the managing agent of the defendant corporation to the stand, and this person is sworn in and starts testifying.\n\nNow, during the plaintiff's questioning of this witness, which is called direct examination, the defense counsel starts objecting to some of the plaintiff's questions. The objections are either that the questions are leading or that they're impeaching the witness.\n\nSo, the question is asking what the trial court should do in ruling on these objections. There are four options provided, and we need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, let's understand what leading questions and impeachment are in this context.\n\nA leading question is one that suggests the answer or guides the witness towards a particular response. For example, \"Isn't it true that you were at the store at 5 p.m.?\" That's a leading question because it's suggesting that the witness was at the store at that time.\n\nImpeachment, on the other hand, is when you attack the credibility of a witness. This can be done by showing that the witness is lying, has a bias, or has made inconsistent statements.\n\nNow, in general, during direct examination, which is when a party is examining their own witness, leading questions are not allowed. This is because you're supposed to be bringing out the witness's story in their own words, not guiding them to say what you want them to say.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule. One important exception is when the witness is adverse or hostile. An adverse witness is one who has a interest opposite to the party calling them, like here, where the plaintiff is calling a defendant's managing agent.\n\nSo, if the court determines that the witness is adverse or hostile, then the plaintiff can ask leading questions during direct examination.\n\nAs for impeachment, generally, a party cannot impeinate their own witness during direct examination. Impeination is usually done during cross-examination, which is when the opposing party gets to question the witness.\n\nBut again, with an adverse witness, the rules can be different.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Sustain all objections and require the plaintiff to pursue this type of interrogation only during the plaintiff's cross-examination of this witness during the defendant's case-in-chief.\n\nThis option suggests that the court should prevent the plaintiff from asking leading or impeachment questions now and wait until cross-examination later in the trial.\n\nBut the issue is that if the witness is adverse, the plaintiff might need to ask leading questions during direct examination to get the testimony they need. Also, impeachment is typically done during cross-examination, but again, with an adverse witness, things might be different.\n\nB. Sustain the leading question objections but overrule the other objections because a party is not permitted to ask leading questions of his own witness at trial.\n\nThis option acknowledges that generally, a party can't ask leading questions of their own witness, but it seems to suggest that impeachment questions are allowed during direct examination.\n\nHowever, impeachment is usually not allowed during direct examination, especially by the party that called the witness.\n\nC. Sustain the impeachment questions but overrule the other objections because a party is not permitted to impeach his own witness at trial.\n\nThis option is a bit confusing. It says to sustain the impeachment questions, which probably means to allow them, but the wording is unclear. It also says that a party isn't permitted to impeach their own witness at trial, which is generally true.\n\nBut if the witness is adverse, maybe the rules are different.\n\nD. Overrule all the objections because the witness is adverse to the plaintiff and therefore may be interrogated by leading questions and subjected to impeachment.\n\nThis option suggests that since the witness is adverse, the plaintiff can ask leading questions and impeach the witness during direct examination.\n\nThis seems plausible because, with an adverse witness, the rules relax regarding leading questions, and perhaps also regarding impeachment.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nI think the key here is recognizing that the witness is the managing agent of the defendant corporation, and therefore likely adverse to the plaintiff.\n\nIn such cases, the plaintiff may be allowed to ask leading questions during direct examination.\n\nAs for impeachment, it's less clear. Typically, impeachment is done during cross-examination, but if the witness is adverse, perhaps the plaintiff can impeinate during direct examination.\n\nOption D seems to cover both points: overruling all objections because the witness is adverse.\n\nOption A suggests waiting until cross-examination, which might not be practical if the witness is adverse and the plaintiff needs to ask leading questions now.\n\nOption B sustains leading question objections, which might not be appropriate if the witness is adverse.\n\nOption C is a bit confusing, but it seems to suggest allowing leading questions but not impeachment during direct examination.\n\nGiven that, I think option D is the most comprehensive and correct approach, recognizing that with an adverse witness, both leading questions and impeachment can be allowed during direct examination.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the rules of evidence and trial procedure.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, particularly in civil cases, parties can call adverse witnesses and ask leading questions. This is often referred to as \"adverse witness\" or \"hostile witness\" rules.\n\nFor example, in the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 611(c) allows leading questions to be asked of an adverse party or an adverse witness.\n\nSimilarly, impeachment can sometimes be done during direct examination if the witness is adverse, as the party calling the witness may need to undermine the witness's credibility immediately.\n\nTherefore, overruling all objections and allowing both leading questions and impeachment during direct examination seems justified when the witness is adverse.\n\nHence, option D appears to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
