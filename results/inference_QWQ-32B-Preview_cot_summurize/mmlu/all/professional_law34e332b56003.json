                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on my legal knowledge, but I think I can figure this out. So, the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to counsel in criminal prosecutions. That means if someone is charged with a crime and can't afford a lawyer, the government has to provide one for them.\n\nNow, the question is asking in which stage an indigent person\u2014someone who can't afford a lawyer\u2014does not have the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. So, I need to look at each option and see where that right applies or doesn't apply.\n\nLet's start with option A: Preliminary Hearing. I think a preliminary hearing is where a judge decides whether there's enough evidence to hold a person for trial. I believe the right to counsel applies here because the person is already facing criminal charges.\n\nOption B: Arraignment. That's when the charges are formally read to the defendant, and they enter a plea. Again, since charges have been filed, the Sixth Amendment right should apply here.\n\nOption C: Investigative surveillance. Hmm, this one sounds different. Investigative surveillance is probably when the police are gathering evidence before charges are filed. So, this might be pre-charge activity.\n\nOption D: Post-charge lineups. That seems like after charges have been filed, so the right to counsel should apply here as well.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look back at some case law or legal principles to confirm this.\n\nI recall that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only after the prosecution has been initiated against the defendant. That usually happens at the time of charging, arraignment, or indictment.\n\nSo, for pre-charge activities, like investigative surveillance, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel may not apply because formal proceedings haven't started yet.\n\nBut, there might be other constitutional rights that apply during pre-charge investigations, like the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nLet me think about each option again.\n\nA. Preliminary Hearing: This is post-charge, so right to counsel applies.\n\nB. Arraignment: Post-charge, right to counsel applies.\n\nC. Investigative surveillance: Pre-charge, so maybe the right to counsel doesn't apply yet.\n\nD. Post-charge lineups: Obviously post-charge, right to counsel applies.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C, investigative surveillance, is the stage where an indigent person does not have the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\nBut, I should make sure that there aren't any exceptions or nuances I'm missing.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the Supreme Court cases that have addressed this issue.\n\nOne famous case is Miranda v. Arizona, which deals with the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during police interrogations, even before charges are filed. But that's different from the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\nAnother case, Massiah v. United States, held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies during any critical stage of the prosecution, which includes police interrogations after charges have been filed.\n\nThen, in United States v. Henry, the Court extended this to include situations where the police deliberately elicit incriminating statements from the defendant in the absence of counsel, after charges have been filed.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only after the initiation of prosecution.\n\nTherefore, during investigative surveillance, which is likely before charges are filed, the Sixth Amendment right may not apply.\n\nBut, again, there might be other considerations, like the Fourth Amendment rights regarding searches and seizures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Gideon v. Wainwright is relevant, which extended the right to counsel to state felony cases, but that was post-charge.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the right to counsel only applies in adversarial proceedings, and investigative surveillance might not be considered adversarial.\n\nWait, in Pennsylvania v. Muniz, the Court discussed that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies to critical stages of the prosecution, which are events where the presence of counsel is necessary to protect the defendant's interests.\n\nSo, if investigative surveillance is considered a preliminary investigation without formal charges, it might not be a critical stage triggering the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\nOn the other hand, post-charge lineups are considered critical stages, so right to counsel applies there.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, investigative surveillance is likely the stage where an indigent person does not have the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\nTo double-check, maybe I should consider the rights at each stage.\n\nAt a preliminary hearing and arraignment, the defendant is entitled to counsel because charges have been filed.\n\nDuring investigative surveillance, if it's before charges are filed, the Sixth Amendment right may not have attached yet.\n\nAnd for post-charge lineups, the right to counsel is established.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Investigative surveillance.\n\nBut, to be thorough, perhaps I should consider if there are any other stages where the right might not apply.\n\nFor example, during police interrogations before charges are filed, the Fifth Amendment rights apply, but not necessarily the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\nOnce charges are filed, though, the Sixth Amendment right attaches.\n\nTherefore, investigative activities before charges are filed would not trigger the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C. Investigative surveillance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
