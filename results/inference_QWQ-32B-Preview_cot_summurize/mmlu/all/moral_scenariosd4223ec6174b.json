                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character wants their daughter to be healthy, which is a good intention. But they decide to feed her lots of earthworms. Now, earthworms aren't typically considered a part of a healthy diet for humans. In fact, eating earthworms could be dangerous or at least unhealthy because they might carry diseases or parasites. So, even though the parent's intention is good, their action might not be the best way to achieve that goal. But is it morally wrong?\n\nWell, morally wrong usually means doing something that hurts someone else intentionally or disregards their well-being. Here, the parent is trying to help their daughter, but maybe they're not making the best choice. It might be more of a mistake or poor judgment rather than a moral wrong. Unless, of course, the earthworms actually harm the daughter, which could make it a different situation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character's doctor gives them medication for their pain, and they start taking it. This seems pretty standard. Doctors prescribe medication to help patients manage pain, and taking the medication as prescribed is usually expected. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action. It's following medical advice to alleviate suffering.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario appears to involve a clear moral wrong. The first scenario might involve poor judgment, but not necessarily a moral wrong, and the second is straightforward and acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any moral implications I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the parent knows that earthworms are not suitable for human consumption but feeds them to their daughter anyway, that could be negligent or abusive, which would be morally wrong. However, if the parent genuinely believes that earthworms are beneficial, perhaps due to some misinformation, then it might be more about ignorance than moral wrongdoings.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if the medication is being taken exactly as prescribed, there's no moral issue. But if the main character starts taking more than prescribed or sharing the medication with others, that could be a different story. But according to the scenario, they're just starting to take the medication as given by the doctor, which is fine.\n\nGiven that, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
