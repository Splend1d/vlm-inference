                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the global prevalence of untreated dental caries. The options are 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%. I don't remember the exact statistic, but I know dental caries are pretty common worldwide. Maybe I can recall some facts to help me estimate.\n\nFirst off, dental caries, or cavities, are caused by bacteria in the mouth that produce acid, which damages the teeth. They're more likely to occur in areas where oral hygiene is poor, access to dental care is limited, or where diets are high in sugar.\n\nI think the World Health Organization (WHO) has some data on this. According to their\u8d44\u6599, oral diseases affect around 3.5 billion people worldwide, with dental caries being one of the most prevalent. But I need to find out how many of those cases are untreated.\n\nLet me think about different regions. In developed countries, there's usually better access to dental care, so a lower percentage of caries might be untreated compared to developing countries.\n\nFor example, in countries with universal healthcare and\u91cd\u89c6 oral health, like some European nations, the prevalence of untreated dental caries might be lower, maybe around 20-30%. But in poorer regions, it could be much higher.\n\nI recall that in some African and Asian countries, a large proportion of the population has untreated dental caries due to lack of access to dental services and education.\n\nSo, if I consider the global average, it's probably somewhere in the middle, but leaning towards a higher percentage because there are many people in the world who don't have access to proper dental care.\n\nLet's consider that half of the world's population has dental caries, and of those, maybe 60-80% don't receive treatment. But that's just a guess.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at some specific studies or reports. I seem to remember a WHO report from a few years ago that stated the global prevalence of untreated dental caries in adults is around 35%, but I might be misremembering.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's higher. If I consider that in some regions, like South-East Asia and Africa, the prevalence could be over 60%, and in other regions it's lower, perhaps the global average is around 40-50%.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, I need to pick one.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say 60% seems plausible. It accounts for the higher prevalence in developing countries and the lower prevalence in developed ones, averaging out to around 60%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider the child population as well. In children, dental caries are also common, and treatment rates might differ.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the global prevalence of untreated dental caries in children is quite high. For example, in some countries, over 70% of schoolchildren have untreated cavities.\n\nSo, if I consider both adults and children, maybe the overall prevalence is higher.\n\nWait, but the question is about the global prevalence of untreated dental caries, without specifying age groups. So, it probably includes all ages.\n\nGiven that, and considering the high prevalence in children and certain adult populations, 60% seems like a reasonable estimate.\n\nAlternatively, 80% might be too high. That would suggest that only 20% of dental caries are treated globally, which might not be accurate.\n\nOn the other hand, 40% seems a bit low, considering the widespread issue of access to dental care.\n\n20% is definitely too low.\n\nSo, between 40% and 60%, I think 60% is more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, my answer is C. 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
