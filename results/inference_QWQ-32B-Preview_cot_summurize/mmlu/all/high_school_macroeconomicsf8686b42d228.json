                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which option would most likely cause the biggest drop in real GDP. Let's see what each choice is saying.\n\nOption A: The government decreases spending and also decreases taxes. Hmm, so less government spending might mean less money going into the economy, but lower taxes could give more money to people and businesses, which might boost spending elsewhere. So it's a bit of a trade-off here.\n\nOption B: The government increases spending without raising taxes. This seems like it would inject more money into the economy, which should boost GDP, right? So this one probably wouldn't cause a decrease in real GDP; in fact, it might increase it.\n\nOption C: The government decreases spending without changing taxes. So, less government spending, but taxes stay the same. That means less money is being spent by the government, which could reduce overall demand in the economy. That might lead to a decrease in real GDP.\n\nOption D: The government keeps spending constant but increases taxes. So, no change in government spending, but people and businesses have less disposable income because of higher taxes. That could reduce private spending and investment, which might also lead to a decrease in real GDP.\n\nNow, between options C and D, which one would cause a bigger decrease in real GDP? Let's think about it.\n\nIn option C, government spending decreases, which directly reduces aggregate demand. The multiplier effect comes into play here, meaning that the initial decrease in government spending can lead to even larger decreases in overall economic activity.\n\nIn option D, taxes increase, which reduces disposable income. People and businesses have less money to spend, which also reduces aggregate demand. Again, the multiplier effect applies, but the impact might be different compared to a direct decrease in government spending.\n\nI recall that the spending multiplier is generally larger than the tax multiplier. That is, a dollar decrease in government spending might have a bigger impact on GDP than a dollar increase in taxes, assuming the marginal propensity to consume is less than one.\n\nWait, actually, in standard Keynesian economics, the spending multiplier is usually larger in absolute value than the tax multiplier. For example, if the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, the spending multiplier is 1/(1-0.8) = 5, and the tax multiplier is -0.8/(1-0.8) = -4. So, a $1 decrease in government spending reduces GDP by $5, while a $1 increase in taxes reduces GDP by $4.\n\nSo, based on that, decreasing government spending (option C) would have a bigger impact on reducing real GDP compared to increasing taxes (option D), assuming the same magnitude of change.\n\nBut wait, option A has both spending and taxes decreasing. How does that work? If spending decreases and taxes decrease, the net effect on GDP depends on which multiplier is stronger. Since the spending multiplier is larger in magnitude than the tax multiplier, a decrease in spending would have a bigger negative impact than the positive impact from the tax cut. So, overall, option A might still lead to a decrease in real GDP, but possibly less than option C, where only spending decreases.\n\nOption B increases spending without increasing taxes, which should increase GDP, so that's not causing a decrease.\n\nTherefore, between options C and D, option C (decreasing spending with no change in taxes) would most likely create the greatest decrease in real GDP, based on the spending multiplier being larger than the tax multiplier.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there are other factors to consider.\n\nFor example, if the government decreases spending, it might affect confidence or have other macroeconomic effects beyond just the multiplier. Similarly, increasing taxes could have negative impacts on investment and growth.\n\nHowever, in terms of direct effects, the spending multiplier suggests that decreasing spending has a larger impact on GDP than increasing taxes.\n\nSo, I think the answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
