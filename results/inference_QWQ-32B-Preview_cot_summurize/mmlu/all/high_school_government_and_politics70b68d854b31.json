                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these options is not a constitutionally mandated presidential power. So, I should probably look at the U.S. Constitution and see what powers it grants to the President.\n\nFirst, I know that the President has the power to negotiate treaties. I think that's explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Article II, Section 2 says something about the President having the power to make treaties, but only with the advice and consent of the Senate. So, negotiating treaties seems like a constitutional power.\n\nNext, vetoing legislation. I believe the President has the power to veto bills that come from Congress. Again, that should be in Article II. Yes, Section 3 mentions that the President can approve or return bills with objections, which is essentially the veto power. So, that seems constitutional.\n\nGranting reprieves and pardons: I think that's also in Article II, Section 2. It says the President shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment. So, that's clearly a constitutional power.\n\nNow, declaring war. Hmm, this one is tricky. I recall that the Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, not the President. Article I, Section 8 states that Congress has the power to declare war. So, it seems like the power to declare war is with Congress, not the President.\n\nWait, but the President is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, which is in Article II, Section 2. So, while the President can command the military, the actual declaration of war is Congress's responsibility.\n\nHowever, in practice, Presidents have sent troops abroad and engaged in military actions without a formal declaration of war. But constitutionally speaking, only Congress can declare war.\n\nSo, based on this, the power to declare war is not a constitutionally mandated presidential power. It's actually a power reserved for Congress.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. declare war.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's go through each option again quickly.\n\nA. Negotiate treaties: Yes, constitutional power.\n\nB. Veto legislation: Yes, constitutional power.\n\nC. Grant reprieves and pardons: Yes, constitutional power.\n\nD. Declare war: No, not a presidential power; it's Congress's power.\n\nYeah, that seems right. So, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
