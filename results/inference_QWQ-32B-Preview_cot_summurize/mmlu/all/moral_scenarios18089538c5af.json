                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios: one where someone doesn't lock the front door of a shared apartment before going on vacation, and another where someone makes leather from the hides of endangered species.\n\nFirst, scenario one: not locking the shared apartment's front door before leaving for vacation. Hmm, this seems like a responsibility issue. In a shared living situation, it's usually expected that residents take care of the place and ensure its security. Not locking the door could potentially lead to theft or other security breaches, which could affect not just the individual but also their roommates. So, from a moral standpoint, not fulfilling your responsibility to secure the shared space could be seen as wrong because it puts others at risk.\n\nNow, scenario two: making leather from the hides of endangered species. This seems pretty clearly wrong. Endangered species are protected by law in the US and many other countries because their populations are at risk, and trading in their parts is illegal. Additionally, there's a strong moral imperative to protect endangered species to preserve biodiversity and prevent extinction. So, engaging in such activity would not only be illegal but also morally reprehensible.\n\nGiven that, it seems both scenarios involve actions that could be considered morally wrong. However, I need to consider ordinary moral standards. Maybe someone could argue that forgetting to lock the door isn't necessarily morally wrong, just careless or forgetful. But in a shared environment, there might be an expectation to be more responsible.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a difference in the severity or the intent behind the actions. In scenario one, maybe the person didn't lock the door intentionally or forgetfully, but in scenario two, the action is deliberate and involves harming endangered species.\n\nMaybe I should look at it this way: scenario one could be seen as a lapse in responsibility, while scenario two is a direct violation of moral and legal standards for conservation.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, making leather from endangered species is clearly wrong. As for not locking the shared apartment's door, it might be considered thoughtless or irresponsible, but not necessarily morally wrong in the same vein.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be B. Wrong, Not wrong, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like both could be seen as wrong, just to different degrees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both are wrong, just in different ways. Not locking the door is wrong because it's neglecting a responsibility to your roommates, while making leather from endangered species is wrong because it harms vulnerable animal populations.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut the question asks for which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. Maybe in ordinary standards, not locking the door isn't seen as morally wrong, just irresponsible, whereas making leather from endangered species is unequivocally morally wrong.\n\nI think I need to consider what ordinary moral standards consider wrong. In the US as of 2020, there's a general consensus against harming endangered species and against engaging in activities that contribute to their decline. On the other hand, not locking a door might be more of a breach of social contract or negligence rather than a moral wrong.\n\nTherefore, perhaps scenario two is clearly morally wrong, while scenario one is not necessarily so.\n\nBut wait, I feel like not locking the door could be seen as morally wrong because it endangers others' property and safety. So, is it a moral issue or more of a legal/responsibility issue?\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should consider that in scenario one, the wrongdoing is more about failing to fulfill an obligation to others, whereas in scenario two, it's about harming the environment and endangered species.\n\nIn any case, according to ordinary moral standards, both could be seen as wrong, but perhaps scenario two is more clearly wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only scenario two is clearly wrong, while scenario one is more of a grey area.\n\nI think the best answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong, but I'm still a bit uncertain.\n\nWait, no. Scenario one is probably wrong, just not as severely as scenario two.\n\nMaybe the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut the options seem to suggest that one is wrong and the other is not, or both are wrong, or both are not wrong.\n\nGiven that, and considering that scenario two is clearly wrong, and scenario one is perhaps wrong but to a lesser degree, maybe the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nPerhaps I need to think about it differently. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, is not locking a shared apartment door before vacation clearly morally wrong? Probably not. It's more of a breach of responsibility or a mistake.\n\nWhereas making leather from endangered species is clearly morally wrong because it involves harming protected animals and contributing to species endangerment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
