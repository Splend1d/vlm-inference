                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a reactor that's starting up, and the number of neutrons doubles every minute. It reaches one billion neutrons in 10 minutes. We need to find out when the number of neutrons reached half a billion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. If the number of neutrons doubles each minute, that means the growth is exponential. So, if I let n be the number of minutes, and N be the number of neutrons, I can express this as:\n\nN = N\u2080 * 2^n\n\nwhere N\u2080 is the initial number of neutrons at minute 0.\n\nWe're told that in 10 minutes, the number of neutrons is one billion. So:\n\n1,000,000,000 = N\u2080 * 2^10\n\nI can solve for N\u2080 here:\n\nN\u2080 = 1,000,000,000 / 2^10\n\nI know that 2^10 is 1024, so:\n\nN\u2080 = 1,000,000,000 / 1024\n\nBut actually, I don't need to calculate N\u2080 explicitly. What I need to find is the time when the number of neutrons was half a billion, which is 500,000,000.\n\nSo, setting N = 500,000,000:\n\n500,000,000 = N\u2080 * 2^n\n\nI already have an expression for N\u2080 from above:\n\nN\u2080 = 1,000,000,000 / 2^10\n\nSubstituting that in:\n\n500,000,000 = (1,000,000,000 / 2^10) * 2^n\n\nNow, I can simplify this equation to solve for n.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 1,000,000,000:\n\n500,000,000 / 1,000,000,000 = (1 / 2^10) * 2^n\n\n0.5 = 2^n / 2^10\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.5 = 2^(n - 10)\n\nNow, 0.5 is equal to 2^-1, so:\n\n2^-1 = 2^(n - 10)\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n-1 = n - 10\n\nNow, solve for n:\n\nn = 10 - 1\n\nn = 9\n\nSo, the number of neutrons reached half a billion at 9 minutes.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIf at n = 9 minutes, N = 500,000,000, and then at n = 10 minutes, it doubles to 1,000,000,000, that makes sense because it's doubling each minute.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of the properties of exponential growth. Since the number doubles each minute, the time it takes to reach half the final amount would be one minute before the final time. So, if it reaches one billion at 10 minutes, it should be half a billion at 9 minutes.\n\nYes, that seems consistent with my calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 9 minutes.\n\nBut let's consider the options again to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\nA. 1 minute.\n\nB. 2 minutes.\n\nC. 5 minutes.\n\nD. 9 minutes.\n\nOption A, 1 minute, would be very early in the process, and with doubling each minute, it wouldn't have reached half a billion yet.\n\nOption B, 2 minutes, is still quite early.\n\nOption C, 5 minutes, is halfway to 10 minutes, but because it's exponential growth, the neutrons wouldn't have reached half a billion at the halfway point in time.\n\nOption D, 9 minutes, makes the most sense based on the doubling pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try plugging in the numbers to see.\n\nLet's assume N\u2080 is the number of neutrons at minute 0.\n\nAt minute 1: N\u2080 * 2\n\nAt minute 2: N\u2080 * 4\n\nAt minute 3: N\u2080 * 8\n\nAt minute 4: N\u2080 * 16\n\nAt minute 5: N\u2080 * 32\n\nAt minute 6: N\u2080 * 64\n\nAt minute 7: N\u2080 * 128\n\nAt minute 8: N\u2080 * 256\n\nAt minute 9: N\u2080 * 512\n\nAt minute 10: N\u2080 * 1024\n\nWait, but 2^10 is 1024, not 1000, so perhaps I need to use more precise values.\n\nBut for simplicity, since we're dealing with powers of 2, perhaps I can consider that at minute n, the number of neutrons is N\u2080 * 2^n.\n\nGiven that at minute 10, N = 1,000,000,000 = N\u2080 * 1024.\n\nSo, N\u2080 = 1,000,000,000 / 1024 \u2248 976,562.5\n\nThen, at minute 9, N = 976,562.5 * 512 \u2248 500,000,000.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, since it doubles each minute, one minute before reaching one billion, it must have been half that amount.\n\nSo, at 9 minutes, 500,000,000 neutrons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 9 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
