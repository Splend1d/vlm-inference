By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\nA. How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\nB. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\nC.

                    "text": "So I've got this passage here about gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China, and it's talking about how in Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, cannons were useful in sieges, so governments paid for them and improved them. But in China, especially after the mid-1300s, they were threatened by mobile steppe nomads, and gunpowder weapons weren't very useful against them, so China focused on improving horse archer units instead.\n\nNow, the question is asking which large-scale question about global history this argument most closely relates to. The options are:\n\nA. How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n\nB. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n\nC. Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n\nD. How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion\n\nOkay, let's think about this. The passage is comparing how Europe and China developed gunpowder weaponry differently based on their military needs. Europe used it in sieges and found it worthwhile to invest in improving it, while China didn't find it as useful against their main threat, the steppe nomads, and so they focused on other types of units.\n\nSo, this seems to be about military technology and how different societies developed it based on their specific military challenges.\n\nOption A is about how societies shared strategically important technologies with each other. The passage does mention that both Europe and China had gunpowder weaponry, so there might have been some sharing of technology, but the main focus is on how they developed and used it differently, not on the sharing aspect.\n\nOption B is about why European states attained military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era. Well, the passage is talking about military technology development in Europe and China, which could be related to military superiority later on. It seems pretty relevant.\n\nOption C is about why Silk Road commerce dwindled after 1500 C.E. The passage doesn't really touch on commerce or the Silk Road, so that seems unrelated.\n\nOption D is about how the medieval climatic optimum affected cultural diffusion. Again, the passage isn't talking about climate or cultural diffusion; it's about military technology and strategies.\n\nSo, between options A and B, I think B is a better fit because the passage is discussing military technology development in Europe and China, which could explain why Europe later attained military superiority.\n\nOption A is about sharing technologies, but the passage is more about how each region developed and utilized the technology based on their specific needs.\n\nTherefore, the argument in the passage most closely relates to why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
