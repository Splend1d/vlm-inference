                    "text": "So I've got this question here about pumice, which is a type of volcanic rock that floats in water. The question is asking about the density of pumice compared to that of water. The options are:\n\nA. less.\n\nB. equal.\n\nC. greater.\n\nD. none because it sinks.\n\nFirst off, I know that pumice is a volcanic rock, and it's famous for being able to float on water. I've even seen it in pools or bathtubs, and it stays afloat. So, the key point here is that it floats.\n\nNow, I recall from science class that whether an object floats or sinks in a fluid depends on its density compared to the density of the fluid. In this case, the fluid is water.\n\nSo, the basic principle is:\n\n- If the object's density is less than the fluid's density, it floats.\n\n- If the object's density is equal to the fluid's density, it neither floats nor sinks; it\u60ac\u6d6e.\n\n- If the object's density is greater than the fluid's density, it sinks.\n\nGiven that pumice floats in water, that must mean its density is less than that of water.\n\nLet me double-check that. I know that water has a density of about 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm\u00b3) at room temperature.\n\nPumice, being a volcanic rock, is formed during eruptions when rapidly cooled lava solidifies with lots of gas bubbles trapped inside. These bubbles create voids in the rock, making it less dense.\n\nSo, because it's full of these air pockets, its overall density is reduced, making it less dense than water, which allows it to float.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. less.\n\nWait a minute, let me think about option D. \"none because it sinks.\" But the question clearly states that pumice floats in water, so option D doesn't make sense because it suggests that pumice sinks, which contradicts the given information.\n\nSo, option A seems correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B says \"equal.\" If pumice had the same density as water, it would neither float nor sink; it would\u60ac\u6d6e or maybe float just below the surface. But since it floats on the surface, its density must be less than water.\n\nOption C says \"greater.\" That would mean it sinks, which again contradicts the observation that it floats.\n\nTherefore, the only logical choice is A. less.\n\nI think that makes sense. The density of pumice is less than that of water, which is why it floats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
