                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** The training error of 1-nearest neighbor classifier is 0.\n\nSo, the 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) classifier works by looking at the single closest data point in the training set to a new, unseen data point and assigning the same class label. For the training error, we're looking at how well it performs on the data it was trained on.\n\nIn training, each point is its own nearest neighbor. So, for every training example, the 1-NN classifier will always pick itself as the nearest neighbor and assign its own class label. That means it will always get the training examples correct because it's essentially memorizing the training data.\n\nTherefore, the training error should be 0 because it perfectly classifies all training instances.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is True.\n\n**Statement 2:** As the number of data points grows to infinity, the MAP estimate approaches the MLE estimate for all possible priors. In other words, given enough data, the choice of prior is irrelevant.\n\nOkay, let's recall what MAP and MLE are.\n\n- MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) is a method that estimates the parameters of a statistical model by maximizing the likelihood function, assuming that the parameters are fixed but unknown.\n\n- MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) estimation is similar but incorporates a prior distribution over the parameters, and it maximizes the posterior probability.\n\nThe formula for MAP is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta_{\\text{MAP}} = \\arg\\max_\\theta P(\\theta | D) = \\arg\\max_\\theta P(D | \\theta) P(\\theta)\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( P(D | \\theta) \\) is the likelihood and \\( P(\\theta) \\) is the prior.\n\nAs the amount of data \\( n \\) increases, the likelihood term \\( P(D | \\theta) \\) becomes more and more dominant, and the prior \\( P(\\theta) \\) has less influence on the posterior.\n\nIn the limit as \\( n \\) approaches infinity, the effect of the prior diminishes, and the MAP estimate converges to the MLE estimate, regardless of the prior (as long as the prior is proper, i.e., integrates to 1).\n\nThis is a well-known property in Bayesian statistics and is intuitive because with an infinite amount of data, the data itself should overwhelm any prior beliefs.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also True.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
