                    "text": "So I have this equation to solve: 18 + p = 29. I need to find out what p is. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that I need to isolate p on one side of the equation. Right now, it's being added to 18 to equal 29. So, to get p by itself, I should do the opposite of adding 18, which is subtracting 18.\n\nSo, if I subtract 18 from both sides of the equation, it should look like this:\n\n18 + p - 18 = 29 - 18\n\nOn the left side, 18 - 18 cancels out, so I'm left with just p. On the right side, 29 - 18 is 11.\n\nSo, p = 11.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If I plug p = 11 back into the original equation:\n\n18 + 11 = 29\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. \u221247\n\nB. \u221211\n\nC. 11\n\nD. 47\n\nThe correct answer should be C. 11.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure there isn't any trick here. Is there any possibility that p could be negative? Let's see.\n\nIf p were negative, say p = -11, then 18 + (-11) would be 7, which is not equal to 29. So, p can't be -11.\n\nSimilarly, p = -47 would give 18 + (-47) = -29, which is not 29.\n\nAnd p = 47 would give 18 + 47 = 65, which is more than 29.\n\nSo, definitely, p = 11 is the only correct answer among the options.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
