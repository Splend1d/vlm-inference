I have these options:\n\nA. where used items are traded.\n\nB. located in smaller cities.\n\nC. where the government borrows money.\n\nD. where government securities that have already been issued may be bought or sold.\n\nI think option A is about general used goods, not specifically about securities. Option B seems too vague and doesn't really describe what the market is for. Option C sounds more like the primary market where the government initially borrows money by issuing securities. So, maybe option D is the correct one, as it specifically mentions buying and selling already issued securities. But I'm not entirely sure. Can you help me understand this better?\n\n"
