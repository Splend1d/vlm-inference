High protein and low GI\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **High Protein:** Protein helps in building and repairing tissues, and it also increases satiety, which means you feel fuller for longer periods. This can help prevent overeating and snacking between meals, which is beneficial for weight maintenance.\n\n- **Low Glycemic Index (GI):** Foods with a low GI are digested more slowly, leading to a gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream. This helps maintain stable blood sugar levels, preventing spikes and crashes that can lead to hunger and overeating. Low GI foods include whole grains, vegetables, and most fruits.\n\nCombining high protein and low GI foods can create a diet that is both satisfying and effective for maintaining a healthy weight."
