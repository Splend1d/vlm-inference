Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when dealing with operations in an expression, there's an order I need to follow. It's called the order of operations, right? I think it's often remembered with the acronym PEMDAS or something like that. Let me recall: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, looking at the expression: 4 \u00f7 2 \u2022 2 + 8 \u2212 4.\n\nThere are no parentheses or exponents here, so I start with multiplication and division from left to right.\n\nFirst, I see 4 \u00f7 2. That's 2.\n\nSo, 4 \u00f7 2 is 2.\n\nNow, the expression becomes 2 \u2022 2 + 8 \u2212 4.\n\nNext, I have to do the multiplication: 2 \u2022 2 is 4.\n\nSo now, the expression is 4 + 8 \u2212 4.\n\nNow, I just have addition and subtraction left, which I should do from left to right.\n\n4 + 8 is 12.\n\nThen, 12 \u2212 4 is 8.\n\nSo, according to this, the answer should be 8.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again: 4 \u00f7 2 \u2022 2 + 8 \u2212 4.\n\nDivision first: 4 \u00f7 2 is 2.\n\nSo, 2 \u2022 2 is 4.\n\nThen, 4 + 8 is 12.\n\nFinally, 12 \u2212 4 is 8.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nWait a minute, I've heard somewhere that division and multiplication have the same precedence and should be done left to right, same with addition and subtraction. So, I think I did it correctly.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nSometimes people might misread the expression, like thinking it's 4 \u00f7 (2 \u2022 2) + 8 \u2212 4 or something like that, but that would be different.\n\nIn this case, it's just 4 \u00f7 2 \u2022 2 + 8 \u2212 4, so I should handle division and multiplication as they appear from left to right.\n\nSo, again, 4 \u00f7 2 is 2, then 2 \u2022 2 is 4, then 4 + 8 is 12, and 12 \u2212 4 is 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that division should be done before multiplication, but according to PEMDAS, they have the same precedence and should be done left to right.\n\nSame with addition and subtraction.\n\nSo, I think 8 is the correct answer.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -12\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 16\n\nSo, C. 8 should be the correct choice.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let me consider if there's any alternative interpretation.\n\nSuppose someone misreads the expression as 4 \u00f7 (2 \u2022 2) + 8 \u2212 4.\n\nThen, 2 \u2022 2 is 4, so 4 \u00f7 4 is 1, then 1 + 8 is 9, and 9 \u2212 4 is 5, but that's not an option.\n\nOr, if someone does 4 \u00f7 2 \u2022 2 as 4 \u00f7 (2 \u2022 2) = 4 \u00f7 4 = 1, which is wrong because division and multiplication should be done left to right.\n\nSo, it's important to follow the correct order of operations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
