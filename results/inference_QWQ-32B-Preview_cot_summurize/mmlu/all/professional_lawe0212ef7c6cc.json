                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out why the court might side with the owner in this dispute between the pharmacist and the shopping center owner regarding a lease covenant. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a shopping center where the owner leased a store to a pharmacist for 10 years, starting four years ago. The lease includes a covenant that the owner won't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. That seems straightforward\u2014 the owner promised not to bring in a competing drugstore during the pharmacist's lease term.\n\nNow, last year, the owner bought a piece of land right next to the shopping center. This new parcel had a building with a food supermarket and a discount drugstore. The owner bought it, and then reconstructed the common facilities to integrate both centers, making them look like one big development to the public.\n\nThe pharmacist found out that the lease for the discount drugstore on the new parcel is about to expire, and the owner plans to renew it. The pharmacist objected, arguing that this violates the covenant in their lease that prohibits another drugstore in the shopping center.\n\nThe pharmacist sued to stop the owner from renewing the lease with the discount drugstore, claiming it breaches the covenant in their lease. If the court rules in favor of the owner, what would be the likely reason?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as applying only to the original shopping center premises.\n\nB. A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created.\n\nC. A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with the land.\n\nD. The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist first entered into the lease.\n\nOption A suggests that the covenant only applies to the original shopping center. That might make sense because the lease described the shopping center by metes and bounds, identifying specific entrances, parking areas, signs, and common facilities. When the owner bought the adjacent parcel and integrated it, perhaps the covenant doesn't extend to the new property because it was not part of the original shopping center at the time the lease was signed.\n\nOption B states that a covenant can't restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created. This seems similar to option A. If the adjacent parcel was not owned by the owner at the time the covenant was created, then the covenant might not apply to it.\n\nOption C argues that covenants restricting competition are invalid against public policy. This could be a possible reason, but I'm not sure. Covenants that restrict competition might be scrutinized, but in this case, it's more about restricting similar uses within the same property rather than general competition.\n\nOption D mentions that the drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was already in existence when the owner and pharmacist entered into the lease. If that's the case, maybe the covenant was intended to prevent new drugstores but not to disturb existing ones.\n\nHmm. Let's think about integration of the two centers. The owner reconstructed common facilities to make them appear as one larger development. Does this integration mean that the adjacent parcel is now part of the shopping center described in the lease, or does the covenant only apply to the original boundaries?\n\nI think option A is strong because the covenant likely refers to the shopping center as it existed at the time of the lease. Since the adjacent parcel was purchased and integrated later, it might not be covered by the covenant.\n\nOption B also makes sense because the owner didn't own the adjacent parcel when the covenant was created, so the covenant might not have jurisdiction over it.\n\nOption D is interesting because if the drugstore was already there, perhaps the covenant was meant to prevent new competitors, not to remove existing ones.\n\nOption C seems a bit broad. While restrictive covenants can sometimes be challenged on public policy grounds, in this case, it's more about the specifics of the property and the covenant's scope.\n\nI think the likely reason the court would find for the owner is that the covenant in the pharmacist's lease applies only to the original shopping center premises, and since the adjacent parcel was purchased and integrated later, it's not subject to that covenant.\n\nSo, option A seems to be the most plausible reason.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
