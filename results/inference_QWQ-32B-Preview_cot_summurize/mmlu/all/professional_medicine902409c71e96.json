                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 27-year-old man who's brought to the emergency department by his sister. He's confused, can't answer questions, and it's been going on for about 10 hours. His sister mentions that he recently saw a psychiatrist for hearing voices and was prescribed some medication, but she doesn't know what it is. She also says he has a history of heavy drinking and has tried illicit drugs. He looks really sick; his temperature is pretty high at 39.1\u00b0C, his pulse is fast at 124 per minute, and his blood pressure is elevated at 160/102 mm Hg. He's sweating a lot and his muscles are rigid. His neck isn't stiff, which is good, and his belly is soft and not tender. Mentally, he's agitated sometimes and lethargic at others. His white blood cell count is elevated to 15,600/mm\u00b3, and his creatine kinase level is 943 U/L, which is also higher than normal.\n\nSo, I need to figure out what's most likely causing all these symptoms. There are four options: amphetamine intoxication, bacterial meningitis, delirium tremens, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\n\nLet me think about each one.\n\nFirst, amphetamine intoxication. Amphetamines are stimulants, and intoxication can cause things like agitation, confusion, high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and sweating. Muscle rigidity could also be a symptom. But usually, amphetamine intoxication doesn't cause a fever as high as 39.1\u00b0C, and the white blood cell count and creatine kinase levels might be elevated due to agitation and dehydration, but this seems a bit more severe.\n\nNext, bacterial meningitis. That's an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms can include fever, headache, neck stiffness, confusion, and sometimes seizures. But in this case, the neck is supple, which means there's no stiffness, which is unusual for meningitis. Also, meningitis doesn't typically cause muscle rigidity or the specific lab abnormalities like elevated creatine kinase.\n\nThen there's delirium tremens, which is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. It can happen in people who have a history of heavy alcohol use, like this patient. Symptoms include confusion, agitation, hallucinations, fever, fast heart rate, and sweating. Muscle rigidity can occur, and lab tests might show elevated white blood cells and creatine kinase due to agitation and possible rhabdomyolysis. So this seems plausible.\n\nLastly, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). This is a rare but serious side effect of antipsychotic medications. Symptoms include fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability (like fluctuating blood pressure and sweating), and changes in mental status, like confusion and agitation. Lab tests often show elevated creatine kinase due to muscle breakdown, which matches this patient's elevated CK level. Since the patient was recently prescribed a medication by a psychiatrist, and the sister thinks it was for hearing voices, it's possible he was given an antipsychotic, which can cause NMS.\n\nNow, comparing delirium tremens and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, both seem possible given the patient's history and symptoms. But let's look closer.\n\nDelirium tremens typically occurs in people with a history of heavy alcohol use when they stop drinking. The patient here has a history of excessive drinking, so that's a risk factor. However, the sister didn't mention that he had stopped drinking recently, but it's possible he has.\n\nOn the other hand, NMS is associated with the use of antipsychotic medications, which the patient was recently prescribed. The fact that the sister isn't sure what medication he was given suggests that it might have been an antipsychotic, which are commonly used to treat psychosis like hearing voices.\n\nAlso, NMS can present with fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, and mental status changes, all of which this patient has. The elevated creatine kinase supports muscle breakdown, which is common in NMS.\n\nDelirium tremens can also cause similar symptoms, but the presence of a recent prescription of a psychiatric medication makes NMS more likely in this scenario.\n\nAdditionally, the combination of both alcohol use and antipsychotic use could complicate things, but given the timeline\u2014just 10 hours since symptoms started\u2014it's more likely to be related to the medication than to alcohol withdrawal, which usually occurs longer after stopping drinking.\n\nTherefore, I think the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
