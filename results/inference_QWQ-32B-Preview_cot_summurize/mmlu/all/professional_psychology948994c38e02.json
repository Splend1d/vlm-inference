The options are:\n\nA. motive patterns and habit patterns\n\nB. thought, feeling, and action\n\nC. past, present, and future\n\nD. external and internal processes\n\nI need to recall what I know about Gestalt therapy to answer this correctly. I remember that Gestalt therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on the individual's experience in the present moment, and it emphasizes personal responsibility and awareness.\n\nLet me think about option A: motive patterns and habit patterns. I think motive patterns relate to why people do things, their motivations, and habit patterns are the routines or behaviors they repeat. Maybe Gestalt therapy helps people become aware of their motivations and habits so they can make more conscious choices.\n\nOption B: thought, feeling, and action. This seems relevant because Gestalt therapy aims to integrate these aspects of experience. It's about bringing together cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects of a person's life.\n\nOption C: past, present, and future. While Gestalt therapy does address the past and how it influences the present, I think its primary focus is on the here and now. So, maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption D: external and internal processes. This could make sense because Gestalt therapy helps people connect what's happening outside themselves with their internal experiences and feelings.\n\nHmm, I need to decide which one is the most accurate. Let me look up a brief overview of Gestalt therapy to confirm.\n\nOkay, according to my research, Gestalt therapy was developed by Frederick Perls, Laura Perls, and Paul Goodman in the 1940s and 1950s. It's based on the idea that people are best understood in the context of their environment and that they have an innate tendency toward growth and health.\n\nThe therapy focuses on increasing awareness of the present moment and encouraging people to accept and take responsibility for their thoughts, feelings, and actions. It emphasizes the here and now, and the integration of mind, body, and emotions.\n\nGiven that, option B: thought, feeling, and action seems to align well with the goals of Gestalt therapy. It's about integrating these different aspects of experience.\n\nOption A, motive patterns and habit patterns, might be something that comes up in therapy, but it seems more specific than the overall goal.\n\nOption C, past, present, and future, while relevant, isn't the primary focus of Gestalt therapy, which is more about the present moment.\n\nOption D, external and internal processes, is also important, but again, it might not capture the essence of Gestalt therapy as well as option B.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. thought, feeling, and action.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
