                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which option here is the strongest evidence that animals can develop and use a sophisticated language. Let's look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"The discovery of physical structures in animal brains are analogous to the language acquisition device in humans.\" Hmm, that's interesting. So, if animals have similar brain structures to what helps humans learn language, that could suggest they have the capacity for language too. But, just having similar structures doesn't necessarily mean they use them in the same way. Maybe those structures serve different purposes in animals. So, while this is suggestive, I'm not sure it's the strongest evidence.\n\nOption B: \"Primates quickly learn words that result in food rewards.\" Okay, so primates can learn words when there's a reward involved. That shows they can associate sounds with specific meanings, which is a part of language. But does that mean they're using a sophisticated language? Maybe not necessarily. It could just be conditioning\u2014learning to perform certain behaviors for rewards. It's related to language, but maybe not the strongest evidence for sophisticated language use.\n\nOption C: \"Systems of communication have been documented in species from honeybees to dolphins.\" Wow, that's a broad range of species. If many different animals have their own communication systems, that suggests communication is widespread in the animal kingdom. But does that mean their communication is sophisticated like human language? Maybe not. Their systems might be complex, but are they as sophisticated as human language, with grammar, syntax, and the ability to express abstract concepts? I'm not sure. So, again, it's interesting, but maybe not the strongest evidence.\n\nOption D: \"Apes have been able to use the words they know to express novel concepts.\" Okay, this sounds really intriguing. If apes can take the words they've learned and use them to express new ideas or concepts that they haven't been specifically taught, that suggests a level of creativity and abstraction in their communication. That sounds a lot like how humans use language\u2014to talk about new ideas, make up sentences we've never heard before, and so on. So, this seems like it could be strong evidence for sophisticated language use in animals.\n\nLet me think about this some more. In option A, having similar brain structures is interesting, but as I said, it doesn't necessarily mean they use them for language. In option B, learning words for rewards shows some language ability, but maybe not sophistication. Option C shows that many animals communicate, but again, not necessarily with the complexity of human language. Option D, though, shows that apes can generate new meanings from known words, which is a key aspect of human language.\n\nI think option D is the strongest evidence because it demonstrates that apes can use their known vocabulary in creative ways to express new concepts. That suggests a level of linguistic ability that goes beyond simple conditioning or innate communication systems. It shows that they can manipulate language to convey novel ideas, which is a hallmark of sophisticated language use.\n\nSo, I'll go with option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
