                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"If a hexadecimal number needs to convert to binary, for each hexadecimal digit, there will be how many bits? A. 1, B. 2, C. 4, D. 8.\" Hmm, I need to figure out how many binary bits correspond to one hexadecimal digit.\n\nFirst off, I know that hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, and binary is base-2. So, each hexadecimal digit represents a certain number of binary digits. I think the key here is to understand the relationship between these two number systems.\n\nI recall that in computing, hexadecimal is often used to represent binary numbers more compactly. For example, one hexadecimal digit can represent four binary digits, or bits. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's consider what hexadecimal digits look like. They range from 0 to F, where 0 is zero and F represents 15 in decimal. So, the digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F.\n\nNow, if I think about binary, each bit can be 0 or 1. So, for four bits, we can have combinations from 0000 to 1111, which is 0 to 15 in decimal, matching exactly with the hexadecimal digits.\n\nLet me check with an example. Take the hexadecimal digit A. A represents 10 in decimal. In binary, 10 is 1010, which is four bits. Another example: F is 15 in decimal, which is 1111 in binary, again four bits.\n\nWait, what about smaller numbers? Like 1 in hexadecimal is 1 in binary, which is just 1. But actually, to represent it properly in binary, we usually use four bits for each hexadecimal digit to maintain consistency. So, 1 in hexadecimal is 0001 in binary.\n\nSimilarly, 2 is 0010, 3 is 0011, and so on up to F, which is 1111.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that each hexadecimal digit corresponds to four binary bits.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the exponentials or something.\n\nHexadecimal is base-16, and binary is base-2. So, 16 is 2 to the power of 4, because 2^4 = 16. That suggests that each hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 binary digits.\n\nWait, is that a general rule? That if you have a number system with base b and another with base b', and b = (b')^n, then each digit in base b corresponds to n digits in base b'? Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nIn this case, b = 16 and b' = 2, and 16 = 2^4, so n = 4. Therefore, each hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 binary digits.\n\nOkay, that seems solid.\n\nLet me consider the options again:\n\nA. 1 bit per hexadecimal digit. That seems too small, since one bit can only represent two values, but a hexadecimal digit represents 16 values.\n\nB. 2 bits per hexadecimal digit. 2 bits can represent 4 values (00, 01, 10, 11), but hexadecimal has 16 digits, which is more than 4.\n\nC. 4 bits per hexadecimal digit. That matches what I've thought so far, as 4 bits can represent 16 values.\n\nD. 8 bits per hexadecimal digit. 8 bits can represent 256 values, which is way more than the 16 hexadecimal digits.\n\nSo, option D seems too large.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, I know that one byte is 8 bits, and one byte can be represented by two hexadecimal digits (since each hex digit represents 4 bits, and 4 bits times 2 is 8 bits).\n\nFor example, the binary number 10101100 is AC in hexadecimal. So, AC is A (10 in decimal) and C (12 in decimal), and together they represent 8 bits.\n\nSo, if two hexadecimal digits represent 8 bits, then one hexadecimal digit would represent 4 bits.\n\nThat lines up with what I thought earlier.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this? Maybe using logarithms or something?\n\nWell, the number of bits needed to represent n different values is log2(n). So, for 16 hexadecimal digits, log2(16) = 4 bits per digit.\n\nYes, that's another way to confirm it.\n\nSo, it seems definite that the answer is C. 4 bits per hexadecimal digit.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's think about conversion.\n\nSuppose I have a hexadecimal number like 1A3. To convert it to binary, I would convert each digit separately:\n\n1 in hex is 0001 in binary,\n\nA is 1010,\n\n3 is 0011.\n\nSo, altogether, 1A3 in hex is 0001 1010 0011 in binary, which is 12 bits, and since there are 3 hexadecimal digits, 3 digits times 4 bits per digit equals 12 bits.\n\nThat works out.\n\nIf I had a four-digit hexadecimal number, like B0F2, that would be 4 digits times 4 bits per digit, equaling 16 bits.\n\nAgain, converting each digit:\n\nB is 1011,\n\n0 is 0000,\n\nF is 1111,\n\n2 is 0010.\n\nSo, altogether, 1011 0000 1111 0010, which is 16 bits.\n\nPerfect, that confirms it.\n\nI think I'm confident with this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
