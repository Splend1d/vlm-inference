                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I did not toss the eggs I bought at the car as I walked by.\n\n2. I sprayed mace into the violent man.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: I did not toss the eggs I bought at the car as I walked by.\n\nSo, this person bought eggs and walked by a car without tossing them at it. So, they didn't throw eggs at a car. Is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, throwing eggs at a car is probably vandalism or property damage, which is generally considered wrong. But in this scenario, the person didn't do that; they didn't throw the eggs. So, they didn't commit that wrong act. In fact, they showed restraint or responsibility by not damaging someone's property.\n\nSo, not tossing the eggs seems like the right thing to do, morally speaking.\n\nScenario 2: I sprayed mace into the violent man.\n\nHere, the person sprayed mace into a violent man. So, there's a violent person, and the main character used mace on them.\n\nNow, mace is a chemical spray often used for self-defense. Using it on someone who is being violent might be seen as a way to protect oneself or others from physical harm.\n\nIn the US, self-defense is generally accepted under certain conditions, especially when there is an imminent threat of harm.\n\nSo, if the man was being violent, and there was a reasonable fear for safety, then using mace might be considered acceptable or even necessary.\n\nHowever, the way it's phrased is \"sprayed mace into the violent man.\" The word \"into\" might suggest direct aim at the face or eyes, which could be more severe.\n\nBut overall, in a situation where someone is being violent, using mace could be seen as a proportional response to defend against that violence.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it doesn't seem clearly morally wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe in some contexts, it could be wrong. For example, if the man wasn't actually being violent, or if there was no real threat, and the mace was used unjustly.\n\nBut according to the scenario, the man is described as violent, so presumably, there is a legitimate threat.\n\nTherefore, spraying mace in self-defense seems justified.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve the main character doing something that is not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, they chose not to damage property, which is right.\n\nIn Scenario 2, they used reasonable force in self-defense, which is also generally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could argue that not tossing the eggs is neutral, neither right nor wrong, but since the question asks if it's \"clearly morally wrong,\" not doing something wrong could be considered not wrong.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, while self-defense is acceptable, maybe in some views, using mace is excessive.\n\nBut given that the man is violent, and mace is a common self-defense tool, it seems proportionate.\n\nSo, overall, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
