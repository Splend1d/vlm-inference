                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a survey from 2008 that surveyed 500 households and found that 82% of the population uses grocery coupons. The poll has a margin of error of 3%, and I need to pick which option best describes what that margin of error means.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Three percent of those surveyed refused to participate in the poll.\"\n\nHmm, the margin of error isn't about how many people refused to participate. That sounds more like response rate or non-response bias issues. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B: \"It would not be unexpected for 3% of the population to begin using coupons or stop using coupons.\"\n\nThis seems to be talking about changes in behavior over time, but the margin of error is about the accuracy of the estimate at the time of the survey, not about changes in the population's behavior. So, B doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C: \"Between 395 and 425 of the 500 households surveyed responded that they used grocery coupons.\"\n\nWait a minute, 500 households surveyed, 82% use coupons. So, 82% of 500 is 410 households. The margin of error is 3%, which is 3% of 500, that's 15 households. So, 410 plus or minus 15 would be between 395 and 425. That matches option C.\n\nBut, is this what margin of error means? Actually, no. The margin of error in polling typically refers to the confidence interval around the percentage, not around the raw number of respondents. So, it's about the percentage estimate, not the count of respondents.\n\nOption D: \"It is likely that between 79% and 85% of the population use grocery coupons.\"\n\nThis seems to be interpreting the margin of error as creating a range around the reported percentage. So, 82% plus or minus 3% gives you 79% to 85%.\n\nThat sounds right. In polling, the margin of error indicates the range within which the true population parameter is expected to lie, with a certain level of confidence, usually 95%.\n\nSo, comparing options C and D, C is about the number of respondents, and D is about the percentage of the population.\n\nGiven that, I think D is the better description of what the margin of error means in this context.\n\nTo confirm, let's recall that margin of error in surveys is typically expressed as a percentage and refers to the accuracy of the estimate for the entire population. It doesn't say anything about how many people changed their behavior or refused to participate.\n\nSo, option D directly relates to the percentage estimate and its potential variation due to sampling error, which aligns with the concept of margin of error.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
