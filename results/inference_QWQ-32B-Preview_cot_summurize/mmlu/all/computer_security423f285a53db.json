Sender\u2019s Private key\n\nB. Sender\u2019s Public key\n\nC. Receiver\u2019s Private key\n\nD. Receiver\u2019s Public key\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall how digital signatures work. I remember that digital signatures are used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of a message. That means they confirm that the message was indeed sent by the claimed sender and hasn't been tampered with during transmission.\n\nNow, in public key cryptography, each user has a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is, as the name suggests, public, and can be shared with anyone. The private key, on the other hand, is kept secret and only the owner has access to it.\n\nWhen it comes to digital signatures, the process usually involves the sender signing the message with their private key. This signing process creates a digital signature, which is then attached to the message and sent to the receiver.\n\nSo, if the sender is using their private key to create the signature, what does the receiver need to verify that signature?\n\nI think the receiver needs to use the sender's public key to verify the signature. Because in public key cryptography, operations performed with the private key can be verified with the corresponding public key, and vice versa.\n\nLet me double-check that. If the sender signs the message with their private key, the receiver should use the sender's public key to verify that signature. This makes sense because the public key is designed to verify signatures created by the private key.\n\nWait a minute, is there any scenario where the receiver's keys are involved in verifying a digital signature? I don't think so. The receiver's private key is used for decrypting messages encrypted with their public key, not for verifying signatures.\n\nSo, in this case, to verify a digital signature, we should need the sender's public key.\n\nLet me see what option B says: \"Sender\u2019s Public key.\" That aligns with what I just thought.\n\nBut let's make sure none of the other options make sense.\n\nOption A is \"Sender\u2019s Private key.\" That's what the sender uses to create the signature, but the receiver doesn't have access to the sender's private key, and they shouldn't need it to verify the signature. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C is \"Receiver\u2019s Private key.\" I don't see how the receiver's private key would be used in verifying a signature from the sender. The receiver's private key is for their own purposes, like decrypting messages intended for them.\n\nOption D is \"Receiver\u2019s Public key.\" Similarly, the receiver's public key is used by others to encrypt messages to the receiver, not for verifying signatures from the sender.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: Sender\u2019s Public key.\n\nTo sum it up, to verify a digital signature, you need the sender's public key because the signature was created with the sender's private key, and the public key is used to verify signatures made by the corresponding private key.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
