A defendant wanted to receive the proceeds from her insurance policy on her home. After a careful examination of her policy, she decided that the best way for her to collect would be to stage a cooking accident in her own home and have the structure bum down. She decided that bacon would be the best way to do it because all of the extra grease in the pan could easily catch on fire. After cooking the bacon, the defendant left the flame on and left her home. Unbeknownst to the defendant, she left the window open and a breeze blew out the pilot. When the defendant returned home, she found that there was no fire. She was arrested and charged with attempted arson.\nB. A defendant was dancing with his girlfriend at a local club when she collapsed in his arms. The defendant then carried his girlfriend to his car and engaged in sexual intercourse with her. Although the defendant believed that his girlfriend was intoxicated, she had, in fact, died of a heart attack while dancing. The defendant is charged with attempted rape.\nC. After a preliminary examination, a defendant informed a patient that she was two months pregnant. Although the defendant knew that abortions were illegal in this jurisdiction, he agreed to perform an abortion on the patient, anyway. During the operation, it was discovered that the patient was not pregnant. The defendant is charged with attempt to perform an illegal abortion.\nD. A defendant called his friend to obtain some marijuana. The friend told the defendant that he had some for sale. Believing that his friend had some high-quality marijuana, the defendant purchased an ounce of the substance, which he did not know was actually oregano. While the defendant was smoking the oregano on the street corner, a police officer arrested him and charged him with attempted illegal use of a controlled substance.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into these scenarios to figure out which one doesn't constitute an attempted crime under common law. I need to recall that at common law, attempt is typically defined as an intent to commit a crime, plus a step beyond mere preparation towards its commission, but falling short of completing the crime itself.\n\nStarting with option A: The defendant wanted to collect insurance money by staging a fire in her home. She cooked bacon, left the flame on, and left the house, believing the fire would start. But due to an open window and a breeze, the pilot light went out, and no fire occurred. Here, the defendant had the intent to commit arson and took a substantial step towards committing the crime by leaving the flame on unattended. Even though the fire didn't start due to unforeseen circumstances, she intended for it to happen, so this seems like an attempt.\n\nMoving on to option B: The defendant thought his girlfriend was intoxicated and had sex with her after she collapsed. Unbeknownst to him, she had died of a heart attack. He's charged with attempted rape. Now, rape requires the sexual intercourse to be non-consensual. If the victim is dead, consent isn't possible, so the act would be considered rape if the defendant believed she was alive and consenting. However, since she was dead, and he thought she was just unconscious, his intent was to have sex with someone he believed to be consenting (albeit intoxicated). So, is this an attempt? Well, attempted rape requires intent to have non-consensual sex. Here, he thought consent was possible, so maybe this isn't an attempt. I need to think carefully.\n\nOption C: The defendant, a medical professional, performs an abortion believing the patient is pregnant, only to find out she isn't. He's charged with attempting an illegal abortion. First, abortions are illegal in this jurisdiction, so performing one would be a crime. He intended to perform an abortion and took steps to do so, but it turned out the patient wasn't pregnant. So, he didn't complete the crime because the act wasn't possible, but he intended to commit a crime and took substantial steps towards it. This seems like an attempt.\n\nOption D: The defendant buys what he thinks is marijuana from a friend and smokes it, only to find out it's oregano. He's charged with attempted illegal drug use. Here, he intended to use a controlled substance but was mistaken about the substance he was using. Since he thought it was marijuana and tried to use it, but it was actually oregano, did he attempt to use a controlled substance? Under the doctrine of factual impossibility, attempting to commit a crime with the intent but wrong about a factual element, still constitutes an attempt.\n\nNow, comparing all these, option B seems different. In A, C, and D, the defendants intended to commit a crime and took substantial steps, even if the crime wasn't completed due to circumstances beyond their control or factual mistakes. In option B, the defendant intended to have sex with someone he believed to be consenting, albeit intoxicated. The issue is that the victim was dead, but his intent wasn't to have non-consensual sex; he thought consent was possible. So, perhaps, this doesn't meet the intent requirement for attempted rape.\n\nI need to consider if rape requires not only the act but also the lack of consent. If the defendant believed consent was possible, even if the victim was dead, does that mean he didn't intend to commit rape? Or does the law consider sex with a dead person as necessarily non-consensual, thus meeting the intent for rape?\n\nUnder most legal systems, sex with a dead person would be considered rape because the victim cannot consent. However, the defendant's belief that the victim was alive and possibly consenting might affect his intent. If he didn't know she was dead, his intent might not align with the elements required for attempted rape.\n\nPerhaps, in this case, the defendant couldn't be guilty of attempted rape because he lacked the specific intent to have sex without consent. He thought consent was possible, so his intent doesn't match the crime of rape, which requires the intent to have sex without consent.\n\nIn contrast, in options A, C, and D, the defendants had the intent to commit the crimes and took substantial steps, even if the crimes weren't completed due to unforeseen circumstances or factual mistakes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely option B: the defendant would not be guilty of attempted rape because he believed consent was possible, not intending to have non-consensual sex.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
