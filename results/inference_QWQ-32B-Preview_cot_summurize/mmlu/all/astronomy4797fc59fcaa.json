It's mentioned in various ancient texts and folklore across different cultures, which speaks to its prominence in the night sky.\n\nNow, regarding the number of bright stars it contains, that's a bit tricky because the visibility can vary based on factors like light pollution and individual eyesight. Traditionally, the Pleiades is said to have seven bright stars, which is why option B is listed here. These seven stars are the ones most easily visible to the naked eye under good conditions.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the Pleiades actually consists of several hundred stars, but most of them are too dim to see without optical aid. So, while seven is the number often cited, experienced observers or those with exceptionally good vision might be able to spot more, perhaps up to nine or even twelve under ideal conditions. But for the general public and in popular culture, seven is the number that sticks.\n\nSo, if I had to choose from the options provided\u20145, 7, 9, or 12\u2014I would go with B. 7, as that aligns with the traditional count of bright stars in the Pleiades.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
