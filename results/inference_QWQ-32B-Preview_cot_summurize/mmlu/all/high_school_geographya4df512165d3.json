                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the statement that correctly describes immigrants living in Europe. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Most find citizenship easy to get in host countries.\" Hmm, I don't think that's accurate. From what I've read, getting citizenship in European countries can be quite challenging for immigrants. There are often requirements like living in the country for a certain number of years, mastering the language, and passing integration tests. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B: \"Muslim immigrants from North Africa are well integrated in France.\" Well, integration is a complex issue, and it varies from person to person. But generally, there have been issues with the integration of Muslim immigrants in France. There are problems like discrimination, unemployment, and social exclusion in some areas. So, I don't think this statement is correct.\n\nOption C: \"Immigrants to European cities rarely bring their families.\" I don't think that's true either. Many immigrants do bring their families once they've established themselves or send for them later. Family reunification is a common practice among immigrants. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"They are usually restricted to certain neighborhoods.\" This might be more accurate. In many European cities, immigrants tend to live in specific areas, often due to socioeconomic reasons, housing availability, and community support. These areas can become enclaves where people from similar backgrounds live together. So, this seems like a plausible statement.\n\nLet me double-check. Option A is probably wrong because citizenship isn't easy to get. Option B might not be accurate due to known integration challenges. Option C contradicts what I know about family reunification. Option D seems to align with the reality of immigrant concentrations in certain neighborhoods.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. Immigrants to European cities are usually restricted to certain neighborhoods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
