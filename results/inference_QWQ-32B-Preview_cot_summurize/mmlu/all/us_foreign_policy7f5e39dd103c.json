It was a key component of U.S. foreign policy for many years and played a significant role in shaping relations between the United States and Latin American countries.\n\nTo provide more context, let's briefly look at the other options to understand why they are not correct in this scenario:\n\nA. The Powell Doctrine is associated with former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and is known for its emphasis on using military force only as a last resort, with clear objectives and sufficient force to achieve those objectives. It doesn't pertain to European involvement in Latin America.\n\nB. The Roosevelt Doctrine, named after President Theodore Roosevelt, is often associated with the idea of the United States acting as an international police power, particularly in the Western Hemisphere. It's sometimes seen as an extension of the Monroe Doctrine, but it's not the specific doctrine about European non-interference in Latin America.\n\nC. The Bush Doctrine, associated with the administration of George W. Bush, is known for its emphasis on preemptive military action and the promotion of democracy as a key foreign policy goal. Again, this doesn't directly relate to European involvement in Latin America.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, the Monroe Doctrine, as it specifically addresses the principle of European non-interference in Latin American affairs.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- Monroe, James. \"Message to Congress on Foreign Affairs.\" Delivered December 2, 1823.
