                    "text": "I'm going through this ethics question, and I need to figure out what Nagel thinks is closely connected to the problem of moral luck. The options are the existence of God, freedom of the will, psychological egoism, and universals. I'm a bit stuck on this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what moral luck is. From what I remember, moral luck refers to situations where the moral judgment of an individual is influenced by factors beyond their control or intention. So, basically, how lucky or unlucky circumstances are in determining whether someone is seen as morally right or wrong, even if they didn't have control over those circumstances.\n\nNow, Nagel is a philosopher who has written about moral luck, and he seems to link it to another big philosophical problem. Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: the existence of God. Hmm, I don't recall Nagel directly connecting moral luck to the existence of God. The existence of God is more related to questions about moral objectivity or the grounds of morality, but I don't think that's the primary connection he makes with moral luck.\n\nOption B: freedom of the will. This seems more plausible. Freedom of the will, or free will, is about whether people have control over their actions and decisions. Moral luck questions whether moral responsibility should be assigned based on factors beyond a person's control. So, there's a clear connection here between moral luck and the degree to which people have control over the circumstances that affect their moral assessment.\n\nOption C: psychological egoism. This is the idea that all human actions are motivated by self-interest. While that's an interesting theory in moral psychology, I don't see a direct link to moral luck. Moral luck is more about the role of uncontrollable circumstances in moral judgment, not about the motives behind actions.\n\nOption D: universals. Universals are abstract entities that represent properties or relations, like \"redness\" or \"beauty.\" I don't see a direct connection between moral luck and philosophical debates about universals. That seems like a stretch.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, it seems that freedom of the will is the most closely connected problem to moral luck, as both deal with issues of control and determination in moral assessment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
