                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is lighting up a cigarette while standing by a gas pump. This action raises safety concerns because smoking near gasoline can be hazardous due to the risk of fire or explosion. Gasoline is highly flammable, and a lit cigarette could potentially ignite vapors, leading to a dangerous situation. Therefore, from a moral standpoint, this action is considered wrong because it endangers not only the individual but also others who might be nearby, such as other customers or attendants.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is running away from their family because their life is horrible. This scenario is more complex and depends on the context. If the individual is experiencing abuse, neglect, or other severe issues at home, running away might be seen as a desperate attempt to escape a harmful environment. In such cases, while running away is not an ideal solution and is often illegal (since it can involve leaving without permission, which is considered abandonment), it might be understood sympathetically. However, according to ordinary moral standards, abandoning one's family without addressing the underlying issues is generally considered wrong because it avoids responsibilities and can cause further harm to all parties involved.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, I would say that both actions are morally wrong, but for different reasons. Scenario 1 is wrong due to safety concerns and potential harm to others, while Scenario 2 is wrong because it involves avoiding responsibilities and potentially causing more problems for the family.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
