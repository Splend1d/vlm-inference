                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. The price of labor is $2, and the price of capital is $1. The marginal product of labor is 200, and the marginal product of capital is 50. I need to figure out what the firm should do based on these options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about how the firm should adjust its inputs, labor and capital, to optimize its production. The key concepts here are marginal product and input prices.\n\nMarginal product is the additional output from one more unit of input, holding other inputs constant. So, marginal product of labor (MPL) is how much output increases with one more unit of labor, and marginal product of capital (MPK) is how much output increases with one more unit of capital.\n\nNow, the firm wants to maximize output for a given cost or minimize cost for a given output. In either case, the firm should allocate its resources such that the last dollar spent on each input yields the same marginal product.\n\nIn other words, the firm should satisfy the condition that the marginal product per dollar spent is equal for all inputs. Mathematically, this is:\n\nMPL / PL = MPK / PK\n\nWhere:\n\n- MPL is the marginal product of labor\n\n- PL is the price of labor\n\n- MPK is the marginal product of capital\n\n- PK is the price of capital\n\nGiven:\n\nPL = $2\n\nPK = $1\n\nMPL = 200\n\nMPK = 50\n\nLet's plug these values into the condition:\n\n200 / 2 = 50 / 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n100 = 50\n\nThis is not equal. So the firm is not currently optimizing its input combination.\n\nSince 100 > 50, the firm is getting more marginal product per dollar from labor than from capital. Therefore, it should shift resources from capital to labor. In other words, decrease capital and increase labor.\n\nBut, there's more to consider. When the firm changes the amount of labor and capital, the marginal products will change due to the law of diminishing returns. As more labor is added (with capital held constant), MPL will decrease. Similarly, as capital is decreased, MPK will increase.\n\nSo, as the firm decreases capital and increases labor, MPL will decrease and MPK will increase. The firm should continue adjusting until MPL / PL = MPK / PK.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Increase capital and decrease labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.\n\nB. Increase capital and decrease labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls.\n\nC. Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls.\n\nD. Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.\n\nBased on my earlier analysis, the firm should decrease capital and increase labor. Additionally, as capital is decreased, MPK should rise, and as labor is increased, MPL should fall.\n\nSo, option C seems to match: Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls.\n\nWait a minute, but in option C, it says \"the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls.\" Is that correct?\n\nYes, because decreasing capital will likely increase MPK (since there's less capital, each unit becomes more valuable), and increasing labor will decrease MPL (due to diminishing returns).\n\nTherefore, option C appears to be the correct choice.\n\nLet me double-check. If the firm decreases capital, MPK should rise, and if it increases labor, MPL should fall. That aligns with the law of diminishing returns.\n\nSo, the firm should decrease capital and increase labor, and as it does so, MPK rises and MPL falls, moving towards the optimal point where MPL / PL = MPK / PK.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
