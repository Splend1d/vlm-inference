                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Carruthers' view on the moral standing of nonhuman animals from a contractualist perspective. The options are direct, indirect, quasi-, or none of the above. I need to recall what contractualism is and how it applies to animals.\n\nContractualism, as I understand it, is an ethical theory that defines moral requirements as those standards that no one could reasonably reject in a hypothetical contract. It's about what principles people would agree to under fair conditions. So, in this context, Carruthers is likely arguing about whether nonhuman animals should be considered in these hypothetical contracts and, if so, to what extent.\n\nI think Peter Carruthers is the philosopher being referred to here. He's known for his views on animal cognition and ethics. From what I remember, Carruthers argues that nonhuman animals do not have the capacity for rationality or moral agency that humans do, which affects their moral standing.\n\nGiven that contractualism emphasizes the agreement of rational agents, it seems like Carruthers might argue that nonhuman animals, lacking full rationality, don't have direct moral standing in contractualist terms. Maybe their moral standing is indirect, meaning that we have duties towards them not because they are direct parties to the contract, but because of how our treatment of them affects humans or other moral agents.\n\nAlternatively, the term \"quasi-\" might suggest a kind of moral standing that's similar but not exactly the same as that of humans. Maybe nonhuman animals have some moral consideration, but it's not on par with humans.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Direct: This would mean that nonhuman animals are direct parties to the moral contract and have inherent moral worth. But if Carruthers thinks they lack certain cognitive abilities, he might not grant them direct moral standing.\n\nB. Indirect: This suggests that our duties towards animals are indirect, perhaps because of how our treatment of them affects other moral agents or because of the character it cultivates in us.\n\nC. Quasi-: This could mean a sort of moral standing that's akin to but distinct from that of humans. It might acknowledge some moral consideration without full moral agency.\n\nD. None of the above: This would mean that nonhuman animals have no moral standing from a contractualist perspective, which seems extreme but possible depending on Carruthers' view.\n\nI need to recall specific points from Carruthers' arguments. I believe he contends that only beings capable of valuing moral constraints and participating in a hypothetical contract have moral standing. Since nonhuman animals can't do that, they wouldn't have direct moral standing.\n\nHowever, he might still argue that we have indirect duties towards them, perhaps because causing unnecessary suffering is bad for our moral character or because it could lead to worse treatment of humans. So, maybe indirect moral standing is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, \"quasi-\" could indicate that animals deserve some moral consideration based on their ability to suffer or experience well-being, even if they can't engage in moral contracts.\n\nWait, suffering and well-being seem more related to utilitarian considerations rather than contractualism. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me look up a key quote or passage from Carruthers to get a better grasp.\n\nAfter a quick search, I recall that Carruthers argues that only rational, autonomous agents have moral status in the strictest sense. Since nonhuman animals don't possess these qualities, they don't have direct moral standing.\n\nHowever, he might still acknowledge that we have moral reasons to consider animals' welfare, perhaps because of our duties to other humans or because of the intrinsic value of reducing suffering.\n\nGiven that, indirect moral standing seems plausible.\n\nBut I should check if there's a specific term Carruthers uses. Maybe \"quasi-moral standing\" is a term he employs.\n\nUpon reflection, I think \"quasi-moral standing\" might refer to a status where animals are considered for moral reasons, but not as direct participants in the moral contract.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if Carruthers completely excludes nonhuman animals from moral consideration, then D would be the answer.\n\nBut I recall that he does think we have some moral obligations towards animals, just not to the same extent as towards humans.\n\nTherefore, \"indirect\" or \"quasi-\" seem more appropriate.\n\nComparing B and C, I think \"quasi-\" better captures the idea that animals deserve some moral consideration based on their own interests, but not full moral standing.\n\nSo, option C might be the best choice.\n\nAlternatively, if Carruthers believes that animals have no moral standing at all, then D would be correct.\n\nBut I need to remember his actual position.\n\nUpon further thought, Carruthers is known for being skeptical about animal cognition and their ability to have beliefs, desires, and consciousness in the way humans do.\n\nIf he thinks animals don't have consciousness or the capacity to suffer in a way that matters morally, then he might argue that they have no moral standing at all.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nMaybe I should consider that Carruthers might argue that animals don't have any moral standing because they can't understand or participate in moral contracts.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be D, none of the above.\n\nAlternatively, if he acknowledges some form of moral consideration, even if not full moral standing, then C, quasi-, might be appropriate.\n\nGiven the options, I think D is the most accurate reflection of Carruthers' contractualist position, assuming he excludes nonhuman animals entirely from the moral community.\n\nBut I should confirm this.\n\nUpon reviewing, I find that Carruthers does argue that only beings capable of valuing moral constraints have moral status, which excludes nonhuman animals.\n\nTherefore, he would likely hold that nonhuman animals have no moral standing from a contractualist perspective.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. none of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
