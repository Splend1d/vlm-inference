This is determined by the Gibbs phase rule, which relates the number of phases, components, and degrees of freedom in a system.\n\nThe Gibbs phase rule is expressed as:\n\nF = C - P + 2\n\nwhere:\n\n- F is the number of degrees of freedom (such as temperature, pressure, and compositions)\n\n- C is the number of components in the system\n\n- P is the number of phases in equilibrium\n\nIn a three-component system (C = 3), if we consider the system at a fixed temperature and pressure (F = 0), the equation becomes:\n\n0 = 3 - P + 2\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nHowever, this result suggests that five phases can coexist at equilibrium, but in practice, for a three-component system, the maximum number of phases that can be in equilibrium is four. This is because in a three-component system, the phase rule allows for up to four phases to coexist at a single point in the phase diagram, known as the eutectic point.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
