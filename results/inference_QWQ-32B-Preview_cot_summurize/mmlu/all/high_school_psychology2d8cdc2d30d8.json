Now, they're considering adding a school interest inventory to the mix. The question is asking about the major concern the psychologist should have when deciding whether to include the interest inventory scores in the regression analysis.\n\nOption A is about the intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores. While it's important to consider how predictor variables relate to each other to avoid multicollinearity, which can mess up the regression analysis, it's not directly related to the decision about including the interest inventory.\n\nOption B talks about how much the multiple correlation increases when the interest inventory score is added as a predictor. Multiple correlation is essentially how well all the predictor variables together predict the outcome variable, which in this case is GPA. So, this seems relevant because it directly addresses the predictive power gained by adding the interest inventory.\n\nOption C mentions the zero-order correlation between GPA and the interest inventory score. Zero-order correlation is just the direct relationship between two variables without controlling for others. While this is important, it might not tell the whole story because the interest inventory could be related to GPA through other variables already included in the model, like achievement and aptitude scores.\n\nOption D is about the difference in correlations: the interest inventory with GPA versus the aptitude and achievement scores with GPA. This seems a bit convoluted. It's not immediately clear how this difference would inform the decision to include the interest inventory.\n\nComparing these options, option B seems to be the most directly relevant to the decision. The school psychologist should be concerned with whether adding the interest inventory score actually improves the prediction of GPA beyond what's already provided by the achievement and aptitude scores. In other words, does it add significant predictive value to the model?\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
