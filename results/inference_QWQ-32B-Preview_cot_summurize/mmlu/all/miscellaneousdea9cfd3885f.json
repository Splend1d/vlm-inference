I need to figure out which one is the correct translation for 'yes' in French.\n\nFirst, I know that in French, 'yes' is usually translated as 'oui.' I've heard that before in movies and from French-speaking friends. So, option B seems likely to be the correct answer.\n\nLet's double-check the other options to make sure. Option A is 'qui,' which I think means 'who' in French. So, that doesn't mean 'yes.'\n\nOption C is 'ja.' That doesn't sound familiar as a French word. In fact, 'ja' is a German word that means 'yes,' but this question is about French, so that can't be right.\n\nOption D is 'okey-dokey.' That sounds more like an informal English way of saying 'okay' or 'alright.' It doesn't seem to be a French word at all.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. oui.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
