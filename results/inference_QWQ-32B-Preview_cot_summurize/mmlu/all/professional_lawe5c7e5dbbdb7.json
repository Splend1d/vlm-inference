                    "text": "Let's break this down step by step. We have three people involved: a man, his brother, and their friend. They all discuss murdering the man's neighbor because the neighbor allegedly took shots at the man's dog but missed. They agree on a plan to poison the neighbor with strychnine, and the friend provides information on how to get the poison. They go and get the poison, but when it comes time to carry out the plan, the friend refuses to participate, saying he was only there for planning and advice but didn't intend to commit murder. The man and his brother then take the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but the neighbor refuses to drink it. They are caught and arrested.\n\nThe statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. So, we need to understand what constitutes criminal conspiracy and attempted murder, and how the overt act requirement affects their liability.\n\nFirst, let's define criminal conspiracy. Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, along with an intent to achieve the objective of the agreement. In many jurisdictions, an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is required for liability, but this can vary.\n\nAttempted murder is a separate offense, which requires an intent to kill and a substantial step towards committing the killing.\n\nGiven that the statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy, we need to identify if such an act was performed by the conspirators.\n\nIn this scenario, the three men discussed and agreed on a plan to poison the neighbor. The friend provided information on how to get the poison, and they all went and obtained it. These actions seem to be overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nHowever, when it came time to actually poison the neighbor, the friend refused to participate. The man and his brother proceeded to take the poison to the neighbor, but the neighbor refused to drink it.\n\nNow, let's consider the criminal responsibility of each individual.\n\n1. The man and his brother:\n\n- They agreed to commit murder by poisoning the neighbor.\n\n- They took overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, such as obtaining the poison and attempting to administer it to the neighbor.\n\n- They intended to kill the neighbor and took substantial steps towards that end, which could constitute attempted murder.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the man and his brother are guilty of both criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.\n\n2. The friend:\n\n- He was involved in the planning and provided advice on how to get the poison.\n\n- He accompanied them to get the poison, which is an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n- However, he refused to participate in the actual poisoning, stating that he was only there for planning and advice and did not intend to commit murder.\n\nDespite his refusal to participate in the final act, he was part of the conspiracy up to that point. His provision of information and assistance in obtaining the poison constitutes participation in the conspiracy.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, once someone is a party to a conspiracy, they remain liable for the conspiracy even if they later withdraw or refuse to participate in the final act. However, withdrawal before the commission of the crime can be a defense in some cases, provided certain conditions are met, such as notifying law enforcement or taking steps to prevent the crime.\n\nIn this case, the friend's refusal to participate in the actual poisoning might be seen as an attempt to withdraw from the conspiracy. However, the effectiveness of such withdrawal depends on the jurisdiction and the specific facts.\n\nGiven that the friend did not take any steps to prevent the crime or notify authorities, his refusal alone may not be sufficient to absolve him of conspiracy charges.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the friend is also guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.\n\nThis seems accurate for the man and his brother, but it doesn't address the friend's liability.\n\nB. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.\n\nThis seems incorrect because the man and his brother took substantial steps towards committing murder, which should constitute attempted murder.\n\nC. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.\n\nThis seems incorrect because the friend was involved in the conspiracy up to the point of obtaining the poison, which is an overt act.\n\nD. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n\nThis seems the most accurate, as it holds the man and his brother responsible for both conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend responsible for conspiracy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
