One evening, the consumer was driving along a city street when he saw the traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, he quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed because of a defect in the brake mechanism. The consumer then swerved to avoid hitting a bus that was crossing the intersection at a right angle to him. As a result of the swerve, the consumer's car rode up on the sidewalk and overturned, pinning a pedestrian. Both the consumer and the pedestrian were severely injured. If the consumer asserts a claim against the car dealer based on strict liability in tort, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the brakes failed while the consumer was driving his car.\nB. Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\nC. No, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up.\nD. No, because the car dealer carefully inspected the car before selling it.\n"

                    "text": "This question is about a consumer who bought a new station wagon from a car dealer and later got into an accident due to brake failure. The consumer is now trying to sue the car dealer based on strict liability in tort. We need to determine if the plaintiff (the consumer) will prevail in this case.\n\nFirst, let's understand what strict liability in tort means. Strict liability is a legal doctrine that holds a defendant liable for damages or injuries even if they did not act negligently. In product liability cases, strict liability often applies to manufacturers or sellers of defective products that cause harm.\n\nIn this scenario, the consumer is asserting a claim against the car dealer based on strict liability. So, we need to see if the conditions for strict liability are met in this case.\n\nOption A says yes, because the brakes failed while the consumer was driving his car. While it's true that the brakes failed during driving, strict liability isn't just about the product failing; it's about whether the failure was due to a defect that existed when the product was sold.\n\nOption B says yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car. This seems more accurate. If there was a defect in the brake mechanism at the time of sale, and that defect caused the brakes to fail, leading to the accident, then strict liability could apply.\n\nOption C says no, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up. This refers to the concept of contributory negligence, which can bar or reduce the plaintiff's recovery if they are found to have contributed to their own harm. However, in many jurisdictions, strict liability cases do not consider the plaintiff's conduct; the focus is on whether the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\n\nOption D says no, because the car dealer carefully inspected the car before selling it. This suggests that the dealer was diligent and therefore shouldn't be held liable. However, in strict liability, the seller's knowledge or inspection practices aren't the main issue; it's about whether the product left the seller's control with a defect that caused harm.\n\nGiven this, option B seems to be the correct answer. The consumer will prevail because the brakes failed due to a defect present when the consumer purchased the car. The fact that the dealer inspected the car doesn't necessarily mean they discovered or should have discovered the defect, especially if it's a manufacturing defect that might not be apparent through a standard inspection.\n\nAlso, regarding option C, even if the consumer contributed to the accident by speeding up, in strict liability cases, the plaintiff's contributory negligence may not bar recovery, depending on the jurisdiction. Some places have comparative negligence rules where the damages are apportioned based on fault.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be focusing on whether the plaintiff will prevail based on strict liability, and in that context, the key factor is whether there was a defect in the product at the time of sale that caused the harm.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
