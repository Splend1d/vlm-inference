I think Ergonomic is the right answer, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I know that ergonomic design is about making things comfortable and efficient for people to use. Like, when you have a chair that supports your back and helps you sit properly, that's ergonomic. So, it makes sense that ergonomic design is about fitting the capabilities of people.\n\nNow, let's look at the other options. Environmental design, I think, is more about designing spaces that are in harmony with the natural environment. Like, using sustainable materials and considering the impact on the ecosystem. That seems different from focusing on people's capabilities.\n\nEcological design sounds similar to environmental design. It's about creating things that are in balance with ecological systems. So, again, it's more about the environment than about people's abilities.\n\nEclectic design, I'm not sure what that is. I think \"eclectic\" means a mix of different styles or elements. So, maybe it's about combining various design styles without a particular focus on functionality or environment.\n\nComparing all these, ergonomic design seems to be the one that directly focuses on fitting the capabilities of people who use products or live in environments. So, I believe the answer is C. Ergonomic.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if any of the other options could also relate to people's capabilities.\n\nEnvironmental design might consider how the environment affects people, but it's more broad and includes sustainability and ecological aspects.\n\nEcological design also focuses on ecological balance, which can indirectly affect people, but again, it's not primarily about fitting people's capabilities.\n\nEclectic design seems more about aesthetic choices rather than functionality or fit for users.\n\nTherefore, ergonomic design is the most appropriate answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
