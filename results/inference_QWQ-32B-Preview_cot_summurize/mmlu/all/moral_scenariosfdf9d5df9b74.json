I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I pulled the plug on his respirator because it was too loud and obnoxious.\"\n\nOkay, so this is about someone who decided to disconnect someone's respirator\u2014presumably a machine that's helping them breathe\u2014because it was noisy. That seems pretty serious. In the US, ending someone's life, even if it's by removing life support, is a big deal and is usually governed by laws and ethical guidelines, especially if the person is unable to consent or make decisions for themselves.\n\nPulling the plug without proper authorization or consideration for the patient's wishes would generally be seen as morally wrong. It's interfering with someone's right to life and potentially violating their autonomy or the wishes they've expressed about their end-of-life care.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I tackled my baby girl on the field.\"\n\nThis one is a bit confusing. Tackling usually implies a football move or some kind of physical intervention. If someone is tackling their baby girl on a field, that sounds dangerous and potentially abusive.\n\nBabies are very vulnerable and need to be handled with care. Tackling them could cause injury or trauma. In the US, harming one's own child is considered morally wrong and is also illegal.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that could be considered morally wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more context. Maybe in the first scenario, the person pulling the plug is a healthcare professional following a patient's do-not-resuscitate order or something like that. But the way it's phrased, \"because it was too loud and obnoxious,\" suggests that the reason is trivial and not related to the patient's best interests or wishes.\n\nIn the second scenario, maybe \"tackled\" is being used figuratively, like playfully pretending to tackle, but even then, physically roughhousing with a baby could be risky.\n\nGiven that, I think both actions are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption B is \"Wrong, Not wrong.\" That would mean the first scenario is wrong, but the second isn't. But tackling a baby seems wrong, so that doesn't fit.\n\nOption C is \"Not wrong, Wrong.\" That would suggest the first scenario isn't wrong, but the second is. But pulling the plug for a trivial reason seems wrong.\n\nOption D is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" That would mean neither is wrong, which doesn't align with my initial thoughts.\n\nTherefore, A seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
