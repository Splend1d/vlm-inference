She said, \"Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work.\" She said she would go over it with her boss to see if he liked it. Several months later, the writer saw a casting call for a new series. The plot and characters were nearly identical to those described in his synopsis. He sued the producer for breach of contract. The producer defended by arguing that there was no contract. What is the likely ruling of the court?\n\nA. The court will rule that there is an express contract because there was a meeting of the mind and mutual assent to the basic terms.\nB. The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested.\nC. The court will rule that there was no consideration specifically mentioned and under those circumstances, the law viewed the synopsis as a gift to the producer.\nD.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. A writer sends a four-page synopsis in response to an ad for new ideas and discusses it with the producer's assistant, who assures that they always pay for a writer's work. Later, the writer sees a casting call for a new series that resembles his idea and sues for breach of contract, but the producer argues there was no contract. We need to figure out the likely court ruling among the given options.\n\nFirst, let's understand what constitutes a contract. A contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, and consideration. In this case, the writer submitted his synopsis, which could be seen as an offer, and the producer's assistant indicated that they pay for such work, suggesting a willingness to accept and provide consideration.\n\nOption A suggests an express contract, which is one where the terms are clearly stated and agreed upon. However, in this scenario, the terms aren't explicitly detailed. The assistant says, \"we always pay for a writer's work,\" but there's no specific mention of payment terms, like how much or when. So, while there's an indication of payment, the specifics are lacking, which might make an express contract less straightforward.\n\nOption B proposes an implied in fact contract, which is formed by the actions of the parties, even without explicit agreement. Here, the writer submitted his work expecting compensation, and the assistant affirmed that they pay for such work. Their conduct suggests an understanding that the writer would be compensated for his contribution. Given that, it's possible for a court to find an implied contract based on their interactions and the expectations they set.\n\nOption C states that there was no consideration specified, and thus the synopsis was a gift. However, the assistant's statement about always paying for a writer's work suggests that compensation was expected. In contract law, consideration doesn't have to be specified in detail; it just needs to be present. Here, the writer's work is the consideration offered in exchange for payment. So, arguing that there was no consideration seems weak, given the assistant's assurance of payment.\n\nOption D claims that there were too many terms left out, making it too indefinite to be a contract. While it's true that many terms aren't specified, like the amount of payment or specific duties, courts can sometimes imply missing terms based on industry standards or the parties' conduct. The key question is whether there was a meeting of the minds on the essential terms.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems the most plausible. The parties' conduct and statements suggest an implied in fact contract, where the writer expected to be paid for his work, and the producer's representative affirmed that payment is standard practice. The lack of detailed terms doesn't necessarily invalidate the contract; it just might make it harder to enforce specific terms.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that ideas themselves are generally not protectable under contract law, and there are legal doctrines like the idea submission rule that might affect the outcome. But based solely on the information provided and focusing on contract formation, option B appears to be the most likely ruling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
