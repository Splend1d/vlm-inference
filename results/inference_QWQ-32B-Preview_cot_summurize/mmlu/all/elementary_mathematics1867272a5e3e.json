So, for the shows, it's 3 times 30 minutes. And he also watched 1 movie that was 90 minutes long. So, I need to add up the time for the shows and the movie to find out the total time he spent watching TV.\n\nFirst, the shows: 3 shows times 30 minutes each. That would be 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.\n\nThen, the movie: 1 movie times 90 minutes = 90 minutes.\n\nNow, total time is the shows plus the movie: 90 minutes + 90 minutes = 180 minutes.\n\nSo, the total number of minutes Sanjay watched television last weekend is 180 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 100\n\nB. 120\n\nC. 150\n\nD. 180\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 180.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
