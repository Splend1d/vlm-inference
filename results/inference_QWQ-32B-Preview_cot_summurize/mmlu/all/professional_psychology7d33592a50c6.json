                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what type of attachment this 20-month-old has with her mother based on their interaction in a new play environment. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the baby is nervous and clings to her mother when they're in this new place. That seems pretty normal for a young child in an unfamiliar setting. But then, she pushes her mother away and doesn't want any hugs, even though she looks anxious. Her facial expression shows anxiety, but she looks away from her mother, which might mean she's avoiding eye contact or maybe trying to cope with her feelings on her own.\n\nThe mother, in response, turns away from the baby as well. That's interesting. Maybe she's respecting the child's need for space, or perhaps she's feeling frustrated or something.\n\nNow, I need to recall the different types of attachment styles to see which one fits this scenario.\n\nThere's secure attachment, which is when a child uses the mother as a safe base to explore from and seeks comfort from her when upset. But in this case, the child is pushing the mother away, which doesn't sound very secure.\n\nThen there's insecure-avoidant attachment, where children avoid seeking comfort from their parents, showing little emotion when reunited after a separation. They might not seek proximity to the parent and can appear indifferent.\n\nInsecure-resistant (or ambivalent) attachment is characterized by children who are clingy and overly dependent, showing distress when the parent leaves but then resisting comfort when the parent returns.\n\nInsecure-disorganized attachment is when children show a lack of consistent strategy in dealing with their parents' absence and return, displaying confused or contradictory behaviors.\n\nLooking back at the scenario, the child is initially clingy but then pushes the mother away and avoids physical contact, while showing anxiety. The mother also turns away. This sounds a lot like insecure-avoidant attachment, where the child avoids seeking comfort and the mother might not be very responsive to the child's needs.\n\nBut wait, in insecure-avoidant attachment, children usually don't show much emotion and avoid contact, which matches the child's behavior here. However, the mother's turning away might suggest that she's not very attentive or responsive to her child's needs, which could contribute to the child developing an avoidant attachment style.\n\nOn the other hand, insecure-resistant attachment involves children who are clingy but also resistant to comfort when the mother tries to provide it. In this case, the child does cling at first but then pushes away, which is a bit different.\n\nInsecure-disorganized attachment seems less likely here because there doesn't seem to be contradictory or confused behavior; it's more a case of avoiding contact and showing anxiety.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the most likely answer is B. Insecure avoidant.\n\nBut I should double-check. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nSecure attachment typically involves a balance between exploring and seeking comfort from the parent when needed. In this scenario, the child isn't exploring and is showing anxiety, which suggests insecurity.\n\nInsecure-avoidant attachment aligns with the child avoiding the mother and showing little seeking behavior, despite being anxious.\n\nInsecure-resistant attachment might involve more resistance and ambivalence, like wanting contact but then pushing away, but in this case, it seems more one-sided in terms of avoidance.\n\nInsecure-disorganized attachment would involve behaviors that don't fit neatly into the other categories, like freezing or disjointed movements, which aren't described here.\n\nTherefore, I think insecure-avoidant is the best fit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
