                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which argument is the strongest for the woman in this situation. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the man and woman lived together but weren't married. They bought a house together, but only the man's name is on the deed because he had better credit and could get a mortgage. He worked as a school vice-principal, and she gave up her night law school classes to stay home and be a homemaker. She worked as a waitress and paid for household expenses like food, laundry, etc., while he paid for the mortgage, taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs, and other expenses.\n\nAfter some years, they became estranged, and he asked her to leave. She moved out and wants to get half of the home's equity value and a share of other property and accounts in his name from their time together.\n\nNow, she's considering different legal arguments to support her claim. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. There is an express contract between them to share the property equally.\n\nAn express contract is a clear, agreed-upon agreement between parties. In this case, did they have a written or verbal agreement that they would share the property equally? If they did, that would be straightforward. But from what's described, it seems like the deed is only in his name, and there's no mention of any formal agreement about sharing equity. So, this might be weak unless there's evidence of such a contract.\n\nB. He has been unjustly enriched and he owes her restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory.\n\nUnjust enrichment happens when one party benefits at another's expense without legal justification. Quasi-contract is an implied contract imposed by law to prevent unjust enrichment.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman contributed to the household by working as a waitress and paying for various expenses. The man paid for the mortgage and other house-related expenses. If her contributions helped him maintain the house and potentially increase its value, there might be an argument for unjust enrichment.\n\nShe could argue that her financial contributions (through paying household expenses) allowed him to focus on his job and possibly accumulate other assets. Without her contributions, he might not have been able to maintain the house or build up other property and accounts.\n\nThis seems like a plausible argument because she did contribute financially to the household, even if not directly to the house mortgage.\n\nC. She is entitled to damages based on a legal theory of fraudulent conversion.\n\nFraudulent conversion typically involves someone wrongfully taking or converting another's property for their own use, with intent to defraud.\n\nIn this case, it's not clear that there was any fraudulent activity. The house was bought with the man's name on the deed, and he paid for the mortgage and related expenses. She didn't have her name on the deed, so it's not like he took something that was hers. So, this argument seems less strong.\n\nD. She may be remunerated under the federal civil rights laws prohibiting gender discrimination.\n\nThis is an interesting point. If there's evidence that the man treated her differently because of her gender, and that led to her being denied a share of the property, there might be a claim under civil rights laws.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, it seems more like a dispute over property division between two people who lived together but weren't married. Without explicit evidence of gender discrimination, this argument might be a stretch.\n\nComparing all these options, option B seems the strongest. The man may have been unjustly enriched by the woman's contributions to the household, and she could seek restitution based on quasi-contract theories.\n\nAdditionally, in some jurisdictions, there's a concept called \"equitable estoppel\" or \"constructive trust\" that might apply here. If she can prove that she relied on his promises or representations to her detriment (like giving up her law school classes), the court might impose a constructive trust on the property in her favor.\n\nAnother angle could be \"palimony\" or \"equitable distribution\" claims, which are sometimes recognized in unmarried couples who have lived together and contributed to each other's well-being.\n\nHowever, based on the options provided, B seems to be the best and strongest argument for the woman to obtain a fair share of the property.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
