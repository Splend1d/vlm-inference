So, the question is about determining how a product can be useful, identifying the target price, finding a place to sell the product, and deciding how to promote it best. It's asking which of the options\u2014market research, positioning, marketing mix, or segmenting\u2014best exemplifies using these steps.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nMarket research is all about gathering information about the market, including potential customers, competitors, and market trends. It helps in understanding what customers need and what they are willing to pay.\n\nPositioning is about how a product is perceived by the customers in comparison to competitors. It's about creating a unique place in the market for the product.\n\nMarketing mix refers to the combination of product, price, place, and promotion strategies that a company uses to sell its product. It's often referred to as the four Ps: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion.\n\nSegmenting is the process of dividing a broad market into subsets of consumers who have similar needs or characteristics. It helps in tailoring marketing strategies to specific groups.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it mentions determining how the product can be useful, which sounds like understanding the product and its features. Identifying the target price is about setting the right price point for the market. Finding a place to sell the product involves distribution channels and where to make the product available. Deciding how to promote it best is about choosing the right marketing channels and messages.\n\nAll these elements\u2014product, price, place, and promotion\u2014sound a lot like the marketing mix. In fact, the marketing mix is exactly about deciding on these four aspects of the marketing strategy.\n\nMarket research might be used to inform these decisions, but the question is about using these steps, not just gathering information.\n\nPositioning is more about how the product is perceived, which is related but not exactly the same as deciding on the product, price, place, and promotion.\n\nSegmenting is about dividing the market into smaller groups, which again is a step that might inform the marketing mix but is not the same as deciding on the four Ps.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be C. marketing mix.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf I think about market research, it would involve surveying customers to find out what they need, what they think of the product, what price they are willing to pay, where they prefer to buy products, and what kind of promotions appeal to them. So, market research provides the data to make decisions about the marketing mix.\n\nPositioning would come after deciding on the marketing mix, using that information to create a unique image for the product in the mind of the customer.\n\nSegmenting is about identifying different groups within the market, which can then be targeted with specific marketing mix strategies.\n\nSo, while all these concepts are related and part of the overall marketing process, the specific steps mentioned in the question\u2014determining usefulness, setting price, choosing place to sell, and deciding on promotion\u2014directly correspond to the marketing mix.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is C. marketing mix.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
