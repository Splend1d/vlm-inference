                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"How many moles of HCl must be added to sufficient water to form 3 liters of a 2 M HCl solution?\" And there are options: A. 1 mol, B. 2 mol, C. 3 mol, D. 6 mol.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about making a solution with a certain molarity by adding a specific amount of solute, which in this case is HCl, to water.\n\nI remember that molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The formula is:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{\\text{moles of solute}}{\\text{liters of solution}} \\]\n\nSo, in this problem, I'm given the desired molarity (2 M) and the volume of the solution (3 liters), and I need to find out how many moles of HCl are required.\n\nLooking at the formula, I can rearrange it to solve for moles of solute:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of solute} = M \\times \\text{liters of solution} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of HCl} = 2 \\, M \\times 3 \\, L = 6 \\, \\text{moles} \\]\n\nSo, it seems like the answer should be 6 moles, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing here. The question says \"sufficient water\" to form the solution. Does that change anything? I don't think so, because the molarity is based on the final volume of the solution, not just the amount of water added.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any reactions or changes in volume when HCl is added to water, but since it's a strong acid, it dissociates completely, and the volume change should be negligible for this calculation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that molarity can be affected by temperature, but since no temperature is specified, I'll assume standard conditions.\n\nLet me look at the other options to see if any of them make sense. Option A is 1 mol, which would give a molarity of approximately 0.33 M, way below the required 2 M. Option B is 2 mol, which would be about 0.67 M, still not 2 M. Option C is 3 mol, which would be 1 M, still short of the required 2 M. Only option D, 6 mol, gives the required 2 M.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. It seems straightforward based on the definition of molarity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
