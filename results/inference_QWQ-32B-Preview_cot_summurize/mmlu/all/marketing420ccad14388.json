Organizational size.\n\nB. Demographics.\n\nC. Product type.\n\nD. Price.\n\nAlright, let's think about this. Market segmentation is all about dividing a broad market into subsets of consumers who have common needs or characteristics, and who might require separate products or marketing mixes.\n\nFirst off, option A is \"Organizational size.\" Now, organizational size is more relevant when you're dealing with B2B markets, where you're selling to other businesses. In B2B, the size of the organization can be a significant factor because different sized companies have different needs and buying powers. But the question is about consumer markets, which are B2C\u2014business to consumer. So, while organizational size is important in some contexts, it's not the most commonly used basis for consumer market segmentation.\n\nOption B is \"Demographics.\" Demographics refer to statistical data relating to the population and particular groups within it. In marketing, demographic segmentation involves dividing the market based on variables like age, gender, income, occupation, education, and so on. This is a very common approach because these factors can greatly influence consumer behavior and purchasing decisions. For example, a company might target young adults with higher incomes for luxury products, or older adults for retirement planning services.\n\nOption C is \"Product type.\" This seems a bit vague. Product type might be relevant for segmenting markets in terms of what products are being offered, but it's not a basis for segmenting consumers themselves. Consumers are segmented based on their characteristics, not based on the products. So, this doesn't seem like the right answer.\n\nOption D is \"Price.\" Price can be a factor in consumer behavior; some consumers are more price-sensitive than others. However, using price as a basis for segmentation is more about how you position your product rather than a characteristic of the consumers themselves. It's not typically used as a primary basis for segmenting consumer markets.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like demographics is the most commonly used basis for segmenting consumer markets. It allows companies to tailor their marketing efforts more effectively to groups of people who are likely to have similar needs and respond similarly to marketing actions.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Demographics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
