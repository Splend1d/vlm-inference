                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about corruption in political parties in Ethiopia as of 2013. The options are 24%, 44%, 64%, and 84%. I don't remember the exact statistics, so I need to think about what I know about Ethiopia's political climate around that time.\n\nFirst, I recall that Ethiopia has a one-party dominant system, with the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) holding power for many years. The EPRDF has been accused of suppressing opposition and human rights abuses. So, given this context, it's likely that perceptions of corruption within political parties might be\u8f83\u9ad8.\n\nBut perceptions of corruption can vary, and it's important to consider that corruption is a complex issue. Maybe there are surveys or reports that have measured public opinion on this topic. Perhaps Transparency International or other organizations have data on corruption perceptions in Ethiopia around 2013.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n\n- 24% seems quite low. If only 24% of people think political parties are corrupt, that would suggest a relatively clean political system, which might not align with the general reputation.\n\n- 44% is a bit over half. That might suggest a significant portion but not a majority thinks political parties are corrupt.\n\n- 64% is nearly two-thirds, indicating a substantial majority with negative views on corruption in political parties.\n\n- 84% is very high, suggesting that almost everyone believes political parties are corrupt.\n\nGiven the political climate and the dominance of one party, it's possible that a high percentage of the population perceives corruption in political parties. However, it's also possible that due to state control over media and information, the actual perception might be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a specific event in 2013 that affected public perception of corruption. I need to recall if anything notable happened in Ethiopia in 2013 related to corruption or political scandals.\n\nThinking back, I don't remember any major corruption scandals in Ethiopia in 2013. That year was marked more by political unrest and protests in some regions, but I'm not sure how that directly relates to perceptions of corruption.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that in countries with dominant parties, corruption perceptions tend to be higher because of lack of accountability. So, maybe a higher percentage like 64% or 84% is more plausible.\n\nOn the other hand, the government might have been making efforts to combat corruption, which could lower the percentage. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nLet me try to eliminate some options. 24% seems too low, given the context. So, I can probably rule that out.\n\nBetween 44%, 64%, and 84%, it's harder to decide. Maybe 84% is too high, as it would imply almost everyone thinks political parties are corrupt, which might not be the case.\n\nSo, perhaps 64% is a reasonable estimate. A significant majority sees corruption in political parties, but it's not unanimous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 44% is more accurate, suggesting that less than half the population perceives corruption, which could be possible if the government has taken steps to address the issue.\n\nWait, but considering the political system in Ethiopia at that time, I think 64% is more likely. It suggests a substantial portion of the population is concerned about corruption in political parties.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option C, 64%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
