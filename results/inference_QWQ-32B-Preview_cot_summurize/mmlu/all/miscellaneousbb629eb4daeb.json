                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which one of these World War II leaders wasn't at the Yalta Conference. The options are Stalin, Mussolini, Churchill, and Roosevelt. I know that the Yalta Conference was a big meeting during World War II where the leaders of the main Allied powers got together to discuss important things like how to defeat Nazi Germany and what to do after the war.\n\nFirst, I remember that Stalin was definitely there. He was the leader of the Soviet Union, and they were one of the big Allies. So, Stalin was at Yalta.\n\nNext, Churchill was the prime minister of the United Kingdom at the time, and he was also there. I think he attended representing Britain.\n\nThen, there's Roosevelt. He was the President of the United States during World War II, and he was present at Yalta as well, representing the U.S.\n\nNow, Mussolini was the leader of Italy, which was actually on the Axis side, allied with Germany and Japan. But wait, Italy had a complicated role in World War II. Initially, Italy was part of the Axis, but later in the war, Italy switched sides. By the time of the Yalta Conference in 1945, Italy had already surrendered to the Allies, and Mussolini was no longer in power. In fact, I think Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian partisans in April 1945, just after the Yalta Conference took place in February 1945.\n\nSo, considering that, it seems like Mussolini wasn't at the Yalta Conference. He wasn't in power anymore, and he wasn't representing any government at that point.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Mussolini.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Was there any involvement of Mussolini in the Yalta Conference? From what I recall, the main participants were Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill. Sometimes, other officials or advisors were present, but Mussolini certainly wasn't one of them, given that he was on the opposing side and had been deposed by that time.\n\nYeah, I think that's correct. So, the leader who was not at the Yalta Conference is Mussolini.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Mussolini}} \\]"
