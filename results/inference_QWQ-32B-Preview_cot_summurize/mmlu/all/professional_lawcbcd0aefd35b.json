                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, Jones is on trial for driving under the influence of marijuana, and there's a videotape from a pot party showing him exhaling a big cloud of smoke and saying something about great weed. Then, Jones takes the stand and says he's an honest person and didn't drive erratically. On cross-examination, the prosecutor wants to ask him if he lied in his divorce trial last year.\n\nNow, Jones' attorney is going to object to that question, and we need to figure out what the court is likely to decide about its admissibility.\n\nOption A says it's admissible because the question goes to Jones' credibility as a witness. Hmm, that makes sense in a way because if Jones has lied before, it could affect how credible he is now. But I think there are rules about when and how you can impeach a witness's credibility with prior bad acts.\n\nOption B says it's admissible as long as the prosecutor produces a certified copy of the conviction. Okay, so this is similar to A but adds the condition of having proper evidence. Maybe the prosecutor needs to have proof of the lie from the divorce trial.\n\nOption C says it's not admissible because specific instances of conduct can't be proved with extrinsic evidence. Extrinsic evidence means evidence from outside the current proceedings, like bringing in external documents or witnesses. So, if the prosecutor wants to prove that Jones lied in his divorce trial, they might need to bring in records or testimony from that trial.\n\nOption D says it's not admissible because it's irrelevant. But I think that might not be accurate because, as I thought earlier, his past lying could relate to his current credibility.\n\nLet me think about this. In general, when a witness takes the stand, their credibility can be impeached by showing that they have a history of untruthfulness. One way to do this is to question them about specific instances where they have lied before.\n\nHowever, there are rules about how this can be done. For example, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 608 deals with a witness's character for truthfulness. It allows examination of a witness about their character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, but it limits the use of specific instances of conduct to attack or support the witness's character unless the conduct is an offense that reflects on honesty.\n\nIn this case, lying in a divorce trial would be a specific instance of conduct involving untruthfulness. So, according to Rule 608(b), such instances generally cannot be inquired about on cross-examination, unless they are probative of the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.\n\nBut there's a exception for crimes that involve dishonesty or false statement, as defined in Rule 609. If Jones was convicted of perjury or something similar in the divorce trial, then his conviction could be admissible to impeach his credibility.\n\nHowever, the question doesn't specify whether Jones was actually convicted of lying in the divorce trial. It just says the prosecutor wants to ask if Jones lied in his divorce trial last year.\n\nSo, if there's no conviction, then asking about whether he lied in a specific instance might not be allowed because it's a specific instance of conduct, and extrinsic evidence isn't permitted for that under Rule 608(b).\n\nBut, if there is a conviction for perjury or similar, then under Rule 609, the conviction could be admissible for impeachment purposes, provided that the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect.\n\nGiven that, option B seems plausible: the question is admissible if the prosecutor can produce a certified copy of the conviction. That would provide proper evidence of the prior dishonest act.\n\nOption C also seems relevant because it mentions that specific instances of conduct can't be proved with extrinsic evidence. That aligns with Rule 608(b)'s prohibition on using extrinsic evidence to prove specific acts of conduct for impeachment purposes.\n\nOption A is broad because it says the question is admissible just because it goes to credibility, but without considering whether there's a conviction or not.\n\nOption D says it's not admissible because it's irrelevant, but I don't think that's correct because credibility is relevant in determining whether to believe a witness.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most accurate answer is C: not admissible, because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence.\n\nHowever, if there is a conviction for a crime involving dishonesty, then option B might also be correct, but since the question doesn't specify a conviction, I think C is the better choice.\n\nWait, but option B says it's admissible so long as the prosecutor produces a certified copy of the conviction. If there is a conviction, then perhaps both B and C could be argued, but given the options, I think C is more universally correct because without a conviction, asking about specific instances of lying wouldn't be allowed.\n\nMoreover, in some jurisdictions, even with a conviction, there might be time limits or other restrictions on using the conviction for impeachment.\n\nTherefore, I think the court is likely to hold that the prosecutor's question is not admissible because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
