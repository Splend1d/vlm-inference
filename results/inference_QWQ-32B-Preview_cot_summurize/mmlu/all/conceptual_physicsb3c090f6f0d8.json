                    "text": "Let's see what's going on here. We have an element that emits an alpha particle, and then its products emit two beta particles in succession. We need to find out how the atomic number changes as a result of these emissions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what alpha and beta particles are and how their emissions affect the atomic number of an element.\n\nAn alpha particle is essentially the nucleus of a helium atom, which means it has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. When an element emits an alpha particle, its atomic number decreases by 2 because it loses 2 protons, and its mass number decreases by 4 because it loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\nA beta particle is an electron (in the case of beta minus decay) or a positron (in the case of beta plus decay). In beta minus decay, a neutron is converted into a proton and an electron, and the electron is emitted. This increases the atomic number by 1 because the number of protons increases by 1. In beta plus decay, a proton is converted into a neutron and a positron, and the positron is emitted. This decreases the atomic number by 1.\n\nIn this problem, it doesn't specify the type of beta decay, but it mentions \"beta particles,\" which typically refers to beta minus decay, where electrons are emitted, and the atomic number increases by 1 per beta particle.\n\nSo, let's outline the sequence of events:\n\n1. The original element emits an alpha particle.\n\n- Atomic number decreases by 2.\n\n2. The product from step 1 emits a beta particle.\n\n- Atomic number increases by 1.\n\n3. The product from step 2 emits another beta particle.\n\n- Atomic number increases by another 1.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net change in the atomic number:\n\n- Initial atomic number: Z\n\n- After alpha emission: Z - 2\n\n- After first beta emission: (Z - 2) + 1 = Z - 1\n\n- After second beta emission: (Z - 1) + 1 = Z\n\nSo, the final atomic number is Z, which is the same as the initial atomic number. Therefore, the atomic number is changed by zero.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this because the question might be tricky.\n\nIs it possible that the beta particles are beta plus, which would decrease the atomic number?\n\nThe problem says \"beta particles,\" which usually means beta minus, but to be thorough, let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Both beta emissions are beta minus.\n\n- Alpha emission: Z -> Z - 2\n\n- First beta minus: Z - 2 -> Z - 1\n\n- Second beta minus: Z - 1 -> Z\n\n- Net change: Z - Z = 0\n\nCase 2: Both beta emissions are beta plus.\n\n- Alpha emission: Z -> Z - 2\n\n- First beta plus: Z - 2 -> Z - 3\n\n- Second beta plus: Z - 3 -> Z - 4\n\n- Net change: Z - 4 - Z = -4\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nCase 3: First beta is beta minus, second is beta plus.\n\n- Alpha emission: Z -> Z - 2\n\n- First beta minus: Z - 2 -> Z - 1\n\n- Second beta plus: Z - 1 -> Z - 2\n\n- Net change: Z - 2 - Z = -2\n\nCase 4: First beta is beta plus, second is beta minus.\n\n- Alpha emission: Z -> Z - 2\n\n- First beta plus: Z - 2 -> Z - 3\n\n- Second beta minus: Z - 3 -> Z - 2\n\n- Net change: Z - 2 - Z = -2\n\nSo, in cases where there is a mix of beta minus and beta plus emissions, the net change is -2, which is option C.\n\nBut the problem says \"beta particles,\" which typically refers to beta minus decay, especially since beta plus decay (positron emission) is less common.\n\nGiven that, the most likely scenario is case 1, where both beta emissions are beta minus, resulting in no net change in the atomic number.\n\nHowever, since there are scenarios where the net change could be -2, and that's an option, but the typical interpretation would lead to option A, zero change.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps the problem expects the student to consider both types of beta decay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the element undergoes alpha decay, then the product undergoes two beta minus decays, resulting in no net change, or it could be interpreted differently.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. zero\n\nB. minus 1\n\nC. minus 2\n\nD. plus 1\n\nGiven that in the typical case (both beta minus), the net change is zero, which is option A.\n\nIn mixed cases, it could be minus 2, which is option C.\n\nBut the problem seems to be expecting a single answer, so perhaps it's A, zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific scenario or context I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that after alpha decay, the product emits two beta particles, which could be beta minus or beta plus, but likely beta minus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the element emits an alpha particle, and then its products emit two beta particles, which might be from different daughter nuclei.\n\nBut I think the intention is that one daughter emits two beta particles in succession.\n\nGiven that, and assuming beta minus decay, the net change is zero.\n\nAlternatively, if it's beta plus, it would be minus 2.\n\nBut again, \"beta particles\" usually refers to beta minus.\n\nPerhaps the answer is A, zero.\n\nAlternatively, considering that alpha decay reduces Z by 2, and two beta minus emissions each increase Z by 1, so total change is -2 +1 +1 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the atomic number is unchanged, which is option A.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
