From what I know, a nation is a large group of people who share a common culture, history, language, or other characteristics, and who usually live in a specific territory. But, it's not exactly the same as a state or a country, although sometimes it is used interchangeably.\n\nOption A says: \"Nations may be made up of different ethnic-identity groups.\" Hmm, that sounds right. A nation can have multiple ethnic groups, like in Canada, where there are Indigenous peoples, Europeans, Asians, and others. So, diversity in ethnicity is possible within a nation.\n\nOption B: \"Nations may be difficult to distinguish from societies.\" This is interesting. Society is a broad term that can refer to a group of people living together in an ordered community. A nation can be seen as a type of society, but not all societies are nations. So, there might be some overlap, making them difficult to distinguish sometimes.\n\nOption C: \"Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state.\" Now, this is tricky. Traditionally, a nation-state is a country where the nation and the state coincide, meaning the nation's territory matches the state's borders. But not all nations have their own state; think of the Kurdish nation, which spans across Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. So, nations aren't always defined by state borders.\n\nOption D: \"Nations may contain multiple religious identity groups.\" Definitely. Many nations are religiously diverse. For example, the United States has people of various religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and more.\n\nSo, looking back, option C seems to be the one that might not always be true. Because nations aren't necessarily defined by state boundaries, especially in cases where a nation is spread across multiple states or where a state contains multiple nations.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
