                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the Minoans and their practices during times of difficulty. The options are about different things they might have done to appease the gods. Let's see.\n\nOption A says they sacrificed adults and occasionally children. I've heard about ancient cultures sacrificing animals or even people to their gods, especially in times of crisis. But I'm not sure if the Minoans did that.\n\nOption B is about burning their own houses to the ground. That seems extreme. I can't imagine why they would do that to appease the gods. Maybe as a form of purification?\n\nOption C mentions fasting for long periods. Fasting is a common practice in many religions to show devotion or seek favor from the gods. It's possible.\n\nOption D is about abstaining from sexual relations. Again, some religions have practices of celibacy or abstinence for religious purposes.\n\nI need to think about what I know about the Minoans. They were an ancient civilization on Crete, known for their advanced culture and art, especially their frescoes. They flourished around 2000-1450 BCE.\n\nI recall that they had a religion with various deities, including a Mother Goddess. They had palaces like Knossos, which was a central place in their society.\n\nIn times of difficulty, like natural disasters or wars, ancient peoples often turned to their gods and performed rituals or practices to appease them.\n\nLet me consider each option again.\n\nOption A: sacrificing adults and children. I think in some cultures, human sacrifices were made during crises, but I'm not sure about the Minoans. I seem to remember that the Minoans were generally a peaceful people, known more for their trade and art than for warfare.\n\nOption B: burning their houses. That seems drastic. Maybe if there was a plague or some contamination, they might burn their homes to purify, but I don't recall any specific information about that regarding the Minoans.\n\nOption C: fasting. This is a common practice in many religions as a form of penance or to seek divine favor. It's plausible that the Minoans might have fasted during times of stress.\n\nOption D: abstaining from sexual relations. Some religious practices involve sexual abstinence, like during certain rituals or periods of purification. It's possible, but I don't know if there's evidence for that in Minoan culture.\n\nPerhaps I should consider what archaeological evidence or historical records tell us about Minoan religious practices.\n\nThe Minoans left behind frescoes and other art that depict various scenes, including religious ceremonies. From what I've seen, there are images of rituals, but I don't recall any that specifically show human sacrifices.\n\nAlso, the Minoans were known for their bull-leaping ceremonies, which were probably religious in nature, but didn't involve human sacrifices.\n\nOn the other hand, there are stories from Greek mythology about human sacrifices, like the Minotaur and the youths sent from Athens to be sacrificed, but I think that's more Greek legend than historical fact.\n\nMaybe the Greeks projected some of their own practices or fears onto the Minoans.\n\nI should also consider that the Minoan civilization declined around 1450 BCE, possibly due to the eruption of Thera (Santorini), a massive volcanic event.\n\nAfter the eruption, there was a period of instability and likely great stress for the Minoans.\n\nI wonder if there's any evidence of them performing certain practices to appease the gods during that time.\n\nPerhaps looking at their religious artifacts or changes in their rituals after the eruption could give a clue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe examining comparative religion could help. Seeing what other contemporary cultures did in times of stress might give an idea of what the Minoans did.\n\nFor example, the Egyptians had practices to appease their gods during times of famine or flood.\n\nBut I need to focus on the Minoans specifically.\n\nLet me think about the options again.\n\nSacrificing adults and children (option A) seems unlikely given the general peaceful nature of Minoan society as we understand it.\n\nBurning their houses (option B) seems too destructive and not aligned with their cultural practices.\n\nFasting (option C) is a common and less extreme practice that aligns with many religious traditions.\n\nAbstaining from sexual relations (option D) could be possible, but it's harder to verify without specific evidence.\n\nI think between C and D, C is more likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe none of the above is correct, and the answer is something else entirely.\n\nWait, maybe the question is expecting the answer based on archaeological evidence or historical texts.\n\nBut the Minoans had a script called Linear A, which is mostly undeciphered, so it's unlikely that there are textual records detailing their religious practices.\n\nPerhaps there are some deciphered tablets that mention religious practices, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are archaeological findings that suggest certain practices during times of stress.\n\nFor example, if there are signs of houses being burned down around the time of the Thera eruption, that might support option B.\n\nOr if there are human remains that suggest sacrifices, that could support option A.\n\nBut I don't recall any such findings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Minoans made offerings or held special ceremonies, but that's not among the options.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. sacrificed adults and occasionally children\n\nB. burnt their own houses to the ground\n\nC. fasted for long periods\n\nD. abstained from sexual relations\n\nI think the most plausible answer is C. Fasting for long periods.\n\nIt's a common practice in many religions, and it doesn't require any specific archaeological evidence to support it, as it leaves no material trace.\n\nSacrifices might leave traces, like human remains, but as far as I know, there's no evidence of human sacrifices in Minoan culture.\n\nBurning houses would leave archaeological evidence of deliberate burning, which, to my knowledge, hasn't been found.\n\nAbstaining from sexual relations is possible, but again, without any evidence, it's hard to say.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination and based on common religious practices, fasting seems the most likely answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
