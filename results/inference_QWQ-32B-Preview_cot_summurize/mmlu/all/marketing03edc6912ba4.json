The options are personal selling, sales promotion, direct marketing, and public relations. I think public relations might be the answer, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these elements entails.\n\nPersonal selling is directly interacting with customers to sell products or services. It's more about one-on-one communication and building relationships with individual clients.\n\nSales promotion involves short-term incentives to boost sales, like discounts, coupons, or contests. It's geared towards encouraging immediate purchases.\n\nDirect marketing is about reaching out to customers directly, often through mail, email, or telephone, to promote products or services. It's more about direct communication and often involves a call to action.\n\nPublic relations, on the other hand, is about managing the spread of information between an organization and its publics. It includes creating and maintaining a positive image, managing reputation, and handling crises.\n\nGiven that, public relations seems to be the most fitting answer because it deals with managing the organization's image and reputation, which includes handling unfavorable stories and events.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf there's an unfavorable story or event, personal selling might not be the best approach because it's more about individual interactions and selling products, not about managing the company's overall image.\n\nSales promotion is focused on boosting sales through incentives, which again doesn't directly address image issues or unfavorable events.\n\nDirect marketing is about communicating directly with customers to promote products, but it's not primarily concerned with managing the company's image or handling negative events.\n\nPublic relations, however, is specifically tasked with managing the organization's image and reputation. It involves communicating with the public, managing crises, and promoting a positive image.\n\nSo, it makes sense that public relations would handle unfavorable stories and events and work to promote a good corporate image.\n\nI think D. Public relations is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
