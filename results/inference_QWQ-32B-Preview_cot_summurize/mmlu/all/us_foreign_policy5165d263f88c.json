During the 1930s, the US was still recovering from the Great Depression, and Roosevelt's New Deal policies were focused on domestic issues and economic recovery. So, it makes sense that he would prioritize internal reform over getting involved in international affairs.\n\nOption B says he believed German domination of Europe would be in US interests. That seems unlikely because Germany was becoming increasingly aggressive under Hitler, and their actions were leading to tension and eventually war in Europe. I don't think Roosevelt would have seen that as beneficial to the US.\n\nOption C says he always favored isolationism. Well, Roosevelt was a complex figure, and his views evolved over time. While he may have favored isolationism in the 1930s, especially given the mood of the American public, he later led the US into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor. So, saying he always favored isolationism might not be accurate.\n\nOption D, all of the above, can't be right if option B is incorrect.\n\nSo, I think A is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
