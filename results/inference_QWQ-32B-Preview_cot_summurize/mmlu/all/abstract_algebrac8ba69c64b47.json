                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** If \\( T: V \\rightarrow W \\) is a linear transformation and \\( \\dim(V) < \\dim(W) < 1 \\), then \\( T \\) must be injective.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the conditions given. We have two vector spaces, \\( V \\) and \\( W \\), and a linear transformation \\( T \\) from \\( V \\) to \\( W \\). The dimensions are such that \\( \\dim(V) < \\dim(W) < 1 \\).\n\nWait a minute, \\( \\dim(W) < 1 \\)? Dimensions of vector spaces are non-negative integers, right? So, \\( \\dim(W) < 1 \\) would imply that \\( \\dim(W) = 0 \\), which means \\( W \\) is the trivial vector space consisting only of the zero vector.\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\dim(V) < \\dim(W) = 0 \\), which would mean \\( \\dim(V) < 0 \\). But dimensions can't be negative. So, this seems like an impossible scenario. There are no vector spaces with negative dimensions.\n\nTherefore, the premise itself is invalid because it's not possible to have \\( \\dim(W) < 1 \\) and \\( \\dim(V) < \\dim(W) \\). Maybe there's a typo in the statement?\n\nAssuming it's a trick question to test understanding of dimensions and injectivity, perhaps the intended statement was \\( \\dim(V) < \\dim(W) \\), without the \\( \\dim(W) < 1 \\) part. In that case, we know that if \\( \\dim(V) < \\dim(W) \\), it's possible for \\( T \\) to be injective, but it's not necessarily always injective. For example, you could have a linear transformation that maps all of \\( V \\) to the zero vector in \\( W \\), which is not injective.\n\nHowever, based on the given statement with \\( \\dim(W) < 1 \\), which is impossible, I would say that Statement 1 is False because the premise is invalid.\n\n**Statement 2:** Let \\( \\dim(V) = n \\) and suppose that \\( T: V \\rightarrow V \\) is linear. If \\( T \\) is injective, then it is a bijection.\n\nOkay, here we have a linear transformation from a vector space \\( V \\) to itself, and the dimension of \\( V \\) is \\( n \\). We're told that \\( T \\) is injective and need to determine if it's necessarily a bijection.\n\nFirst, recall that for a linear transformation from a finite-dimensional vector space to itself, injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity are all equivalent. This is a consequence of the rank-nullity theorem.\n\nSpecifically, the rank-nullity theorem states that for a linear transformation \\( T: V \\rightarrow V \\),\n\n\\[ \\dim(V) = \\dim(\\ker(T)) + \\dim(\\operatorname{im}(T)) \\]\n\nIf \\( T \\) is injective, then \\( \\ker(T) = \\{0\\} \\), so \\( \\dim(\\ker(T)) = 0 \\). Therefore,\n\n\\[ \\dim(V) = 0 + \\dim(\\operatorname{im}(T)) \\implies \\dim(\\operatorname{im}(T)) = n \\]\n\nSince \\( \\operatorname{im}(T) \\) is a subspace of \\( V \\) and has the same dimension as \\( V \\), it must be that \\( \\operatorname{im}(T) = V \\). Therefore, \\( T \\) is surjective.\n\nSince \\( T \\) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is True.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement 1: False\n\n- Statement 2: True\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
