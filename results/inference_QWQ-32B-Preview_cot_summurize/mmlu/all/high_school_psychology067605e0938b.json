We need to figure out what this exemplifies among the options: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, or omission training.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what each of these terms means.\n\nPositive reinforcement is when something desirable is added to encourage a behavior. For example, giving a child a sticker for good behavior.\n\nNegative reinforcement is when something unpleasant is removed to encourage a behavior. Like taking off a bandage that hurts, making the child feel better.\n\nPositive punishment is when something unpleasant is added to discourage a behavior. For example, giving extra homework for misbehaving.\n\nOmission training, I think, is about reinforcing a behavior by removing something, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the child is being removed from the classroom because they are being disruptive. The child wants to stay with their class, but they are removed due to their bad behavior.\n\nSo, the behavior is disruption, and the consequence is being removed from the classroom.\n\nI think this is meant to discourage the disruptive behavior by removing the child from the class, which they want to be in.\n\nSo, it's like adding an unpleasant thing (being removed from class) to discourage a behavior (disruption). That sounds like positive punishment.\n\nWait, but is being removed from class really adding something unpleasant? Maybe it is, because the child wants to be with their class, so removing them is unpleasant for them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's negative reinforcement, where the removal is meant to remove the disruptive behavior, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nNo, I think it's positive punishment because something unpleasant is added (removal from class) to decrease the disruptive behavior.\n\nLet me check if omission training fits here. Omission training is about reinforcing a behavior by not presenting a stimulus, I think. But in this case, the consequence is removal, which is adding something (the experience of being removed), so it doesn't seem to fit.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. positive punishment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
