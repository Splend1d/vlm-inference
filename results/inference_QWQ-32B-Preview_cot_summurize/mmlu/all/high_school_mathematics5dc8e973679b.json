                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. John has 12 marbles in total, each of different colors, and among them, there is one red, one green, and one blue marble. He needs to choose 4 marbles, but with the condition that exactly one of the chosen marbles is either red, green, or blue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"exactly one\" means in this context. It means that out of the three special marbles (red, green, blue), only one of them should be included in the selection of 4 marbles. So, I can't have two or all three of them in the selection; only one is allowed.\n\nAlright, so let's break this down. There are three special marbles: red, green, and blue. I need to choose exactly one of these three to include in my selection of 4 marbles. That means, first, I need to choose which one of these three I want to include.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one of these three marbles is simply 3, because there are three options: red, green, or blue.\n\nNow, since I'm choosing 4 marbles in total and one of them is already chosen from the three special marbles, I need to choose the remaining 3 marbles from the other marbles that are not special. Wait, but which marbles are not special? Well, out of the 12 marbles, three are special (red, green, blue), so the remaining marbles are 12 - 3 = 9 marbles.\n\nSo, after choosing one special marble, I need to choose 3 more marbles from these 9 non-special marbles.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 9 is given by the combination formula, which is C(9,3), where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time.\n\nI recall that the formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nSo, C(9,3) = 9! / (3!(9 - 3)!) = (9*8*7*6!) / (3*2*1 * 6!) = (9*8*7) / (6) = (504) / 6 = 84.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check that calculation.\n\nActually, 9! is 9 factorial, which is 9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1, but in the combination formula, the 6! in the numerator and denominator cancel out, so it's indeed C(9,3) = (9*8*7) / (3*2*1) = (504) / 6 = 84.\n\nOkay, so there are 84 ways to choose the 3 non-special marbles from the 9 available.\n\nNow, since I have 3 choices for the special marble and for each of those choices, there are 84 ways to choose the non-special marbles, the total number of ways should be 3 * 84.\n\nSo, 3 * 84 = 252.\n\nWait a minute, but let's see if there's another way to look at this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as first selecting which one of the three special marbles to include, and then selecting the remaining 3 marbles from the 9 non-special ones, which is what I just did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of all possible ways to choose 4 marbles from 12 and then subtract the cases where none or more than one of the special marbles are included.\n\nBut, that might be more complicated. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to choose 4 marbles from 12 is C(12,4).\n\nC(12,4) = 12! / (4!(12 - 4)!) = (12*11*10*9*8!) / (4*3*2*1 * 8!)) = (12*11*10*9) / 24 = (11880) / 24 = 495.\n\nSo, there are 495 ways to choose any 4 marbles from 12.\n\nNow, if I want exactly one special marble, I need to subtract the cases where none or more than one special marble is included.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to choose 4 marbles with none of the special marbles is C(9,4), since there are 9 non-special marbles.\n\nC(9,4) = 9! / (4!(9 - 4)!) = (9*8*7*6*5!) / (4*3*2*1 * 5!)) = (9*8*7*6) / 24 = (3024) / 24 = 126.\n\nSo, there are 126 ways to choose 4 marbles with none of the special ones.\n\nNext, the number of ways to choose 4 marbles with more than one special marble. That means choosing 2 or 3 special marbles.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to choose 2 special marbles and 2 non-special marbles.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 special marbles from 3 is C(3,2) = 3.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 non-special marbles from 9 is C(9,2) = 36.\n\nSo, the total for this case is 3 * 36 = 108.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose all 3 special marbles and 1 non-special marble.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 special marbles from 3 is C(3,3) = 1.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 non-special marble from 9 is C(9,1) = 9.\n\nSo, the total for this case is 1 * 9 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 4 marbles with more than one special marble is 108 + 9 = 117.\n\nNow, to find the number of ways to choose exactly one special marble, I can subtract the number of ways with none or more than one special marble from the total number of ways.\n\nSo, it would be total ways - (ways with none + ways with more than one).\n\nThat is, 495 - (126 + 117) = 495 - 243 = 252.\n\nWait, that matches the earlier result I got by directly calculating it as 3 * 84 = 252.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the number of ways is 252.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 252.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 252\n\nB. 276\n\nC. 441\n\nD. 84\n\nOption A is 252, which matches our calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let's think again.\n\nIs there any overlap or something I haven't considered?\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to consider that exactly one of the special marbles is chosen, and the rest are non-special.\n\nSo, number of ways to choose which special marble is included: 3.\n\nNumber of ways to choose the remaining 3 marbles from the 9 non-special ones: C(9,3) = 84.\n\nTotal: 3 * 84 = 252.\n\nAlternatively, using the total number of ways minus the unwanted cases: 495 - (126 + 117) = 252.\n\nBoth methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that 252 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 252.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{252} \\]"
