                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these tests is best for assessing the general cognitive abilities of a nonverbal adolescent. Let's see what each one offers.\n\nFirst up, the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales\u20135. I know that the Stanford-Binet is a well-respected intelligence test, but I'm not sure how accommodating it is for nonverbal individuals. Maybe I should look into whether it has nonverbal components or if it's primarily verbal.\n\nNext, the Leiter\u2013R. I recall that the Leiter is designed to assess intelligence without relying on language or motor skills, which sounds perfect for a nonverbal adolescent. It must be useful in cases where traditional verbal tests aren't appropriate.\n\nThen there's the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children\u2013II. I think the Kaufman tests are known for being culture-fair and suitable for a variety of populations, including those with language difficulties. Maybe it has features that make it appropriate for nonverbal individuals.\n\nLastly, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u2013IV. The WISC is one of the most commonly used intelligence tests for children, but I believe it has both verbal and performance subtests. Perhaps the performance subtests could be useful for a nonverbal adolescent.\n\nHmm, I need to think about which one is the most appropriate. Since the adolescent is nonverbal, I need a test that doesn't rely heavily on speech or language comprehension.\n\nLet me consider the Leiter\u2013R first. As I mentioned, it's designed to be nonverbal, which seems ideal. It focuses on nonverbal reasoning and problem-solving skills, which should be suitable for assessing general cognitive abilities without requiring verbal interaction.\n\nNow, the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children\u2013II is also known for being less dependent on language, but I'm not sure how nonverbal it is. Maybe I should check if it includes tasks that don't require verbal response.\n\nThe Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales\u20135 might have some nonverbal components, but I have a feeling that it's more geared towards verbal assessment. I may be wrong, though.\n\nAnd the WISC-IV has performance subtests, which are nonverbal, but I wonder if they are sufficient on their own to get a comprehensive measure of general cognitive abilities.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should look up each test's description to see their approach to assessing nonverbal individuals.\n\nStarting with the Leiter\u2013R, it's explicitly designed for assessing individuals with developmental disabilities, hearing impairments, and those who are not proficient in the language of the test. It uses visual-perceptual and reasoning tasks, so no verbal instructions or responses are needed. That sounds perfect for a nonverbal adolescent.\n\nThe Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children\u2013II is described as being culture-fair and appropriate for individuals with language disabilities. It has separate scales for simultaneous and successive processing, which might not require verbal ability, but I'm not sure about the extent to which verbal interaction is needed during the test.\n\nThe Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales\u20135 is a comprehensive intelligence test that assesses a range of cognitive abilities. It does include nonverbal subtests, but I think it places more emphasis on verbal abilities. So, it might not be the best choice for a nonverbal individual.\n\nThe WISC-IV has verbal and performance subtests, but the verbal subtests would obviously be challenging for a nonverbal adolescent. However, the performance subtests are nonverbal and could provide some assessment of cognitive abilities, but perhaps not as comprehensive as a test specifically designed for nonverbal individuals.\n\nComparing all of these, the Leiter\u2013R seems to be the most appropriate choice for a nonverbal adolescent because it is specifically designed to assess intelligence without relying on language or motor skills. It should provide a more accurate measure of the adolescent's general cognitive abilities in this case.\n\nI think the answer is B. Leiter\u2013R.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
