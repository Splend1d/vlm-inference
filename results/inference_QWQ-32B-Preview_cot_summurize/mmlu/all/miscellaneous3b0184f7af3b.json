                    "text": "Let's see, I need to figure out what color Marge Simpson's hair is. I remember Marge is a character from the Simpsons animated show. She's the mother of the family. Let me think about her appearance.\n\nI recall that she has blue hair, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's blue, or is it green? Wait, no, I think her hair is blue. In the show, she has these big blue hairdos, right? Like, she has these big blue curls or something.\n\nLet me try to visualize her. Okay, so Homer is the dad with the big belly and yellow skin, and Bart is the mischievous son. Lisa is the smart daughter with yellow hair, and Maggie is the baby who just says \"Dah\". So, Marge is the mom.\n\nI think her hair is blue because it stands out compared to the yellow of Homer and the kids. Yellow is the dominant color for the family, so maybe her blue hair is to differentiate her.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's not blue. Maybe it's green. Or perhaps it's purple. I'm getting confused now. Maybe I should think about other characters in the show and their colors.\n\nHomer is yellow, Bart has yellow skin and orange hair, Lisa has yellow skin and blond hair, Maggie has yellow skin and brown hair, and Marge has yellow skin and... I think blue hair.\n\nBut let's consider the options given:\n\nA. yellow\n\nB. purple\n\nC. blue\n\nD. brown\n\nYellow is already the skin color for the family, so maybe not yellow for hair. Purple could be a possibility, but I don't recall anyone having purple hair in the Simpsons. Blue seems plausible, and brown could be an option too, but Maggie has brown hair.\n\nWait, Maggie has brown hair, but Marge has big, curly hair that's a different color. I think it's blue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Marge has blue hair to represent wisdom or something. I don't know, that might be a stretch.\n\nLet me think about other blue-colored things associated with Marge. Maybe her hair is blue to contrast with Homer's yellow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps her hair is blue to represent her calm and composed nature.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should go with blue, but I'm starting to doubt myself.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that Marge's hair is blue because in the show, she often wears blue outfits, so maybe her hair matches her clothes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps her hair is blue to stand out in the family, which is mostly yellow.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should choose another color.\n\nLet's eliminate some options. Yellow is probably not her hair color because the skin is yellow, and having yellow hair too might not make sense.\n\nPurple could be a possibility, but I don't recall seeing Marge with purple hair.\n\nBrown is Maggie's hair color, so maybe not.\n\nSo, between blue and purple, I think blue is more likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Marge has blond hair, but that's not an option here.\n\nWait, maybe her hair is blond, but animated as yellow, but no, Lisa has yellow hair.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should just go with blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
