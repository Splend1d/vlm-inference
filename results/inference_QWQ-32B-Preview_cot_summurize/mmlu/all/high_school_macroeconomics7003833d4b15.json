                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about nations and their ability to produce goods. It's talking about opportunity costs and comparative advantages. Hmm, I need to remember what these terms mean.\n\nSo, first off, opportunity cost is what you give up when you choose one option over another. In the context of nations producing goods, it's about what each nation has to give up to produce a certain good.\n\nComparative advantage, I think, is related to which nation can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost compared to another nation. So, if Nation A can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than Nation B, that means Nation A has a comparative advantage in producing that good.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I have this straight. Absolute advantage is different; that's when a nation can produce more of a good using the same amount of resources compared to another nation.\n\nSo, in this question, it's specifically about opportunity costs, which points towards comparative advantage.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Nation A has comparative advantage in the production of that good.\n\nB. Nation B has comparative advantage in the production of that good.\n\nC. Nation A has absolute advantage in the production of that good.\n\nD. Nation B has absolute advantage in the production of that good.\n\nGiven that Nation A can produce the good at a lower opportunity cost than Nation B, that should mean Nation A has the comparative advantage.\n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about an example. Suppose Nation A can produce either 10 units of good X or 20 units of good Y, using the same resources.\n\nNation B, on the other hand, can produce either 15 units of good X or 30 units of good Y, using the same resources.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the opportunity costs.\n\nFor Nation A:\n\n- Opportunity cost of producing one unit of X is 2 units of Y (since 10 X = 20 Y, so 1 X = 2 Y).\n\n- Opportunity cost of producing one unit of Y is 0.5 units of X (since 20 Y = 10 X, so 1 Y = 0.5 X).\n\nFor Nation B:\n\n- Opportunity cost of producing one unit of X is 2 units of Y (30 Y / 15 X = 2 Y per X).\n\n- Opportunity cost of producing one unit of Y is 0.5 units of X (15 X / 30 Y = 0.5 X per Y).\n\nWait a second, in this example, both nations have the same opportunity costs for each good. So maybe I need a different example.\n\nLet me adjust the numbers.\n\nSuppose Nation A can produce either 10 units of X or 20 units of Y.\n\nNation B can produce either 15 units of X or 45 units of Y.\n\nNow, for Nation A:\n\n- Opportunity cost of X is 2 Y (10 X = 20 Y \u2192 1 X = 2 Y).\n\n- Opportunity cost of Y is 0.5 X (20 Y = 10 X \u2192 1 Y = 0.5 X).\n\nFor Nation B:\n\n- Opportunity cost of X is 3 Y (15 X = 45 Y \u2192 1 X = 3 Y).\n\n- Opportunity cost of Y is 0.333 X (45 Y = 15 X \u2192 1 Y = 0.333 X).\n\nSo, for good X, Nation A has a lower opportunity cost (2 Y vs. 3 Y for Nation B). Similarly, for good Y, Nation A has a lower opportunity cost (0.5 X vs. 0.333 X for Nation B).\n\nWait, actually, in this case, Nation B has a lower opportunity cost for producing Y compared to Nation A.\n\nWait, 0.333 X per Y for Nation B vs. 0.5 X per Y for Nation A. So Nation B gives up less X to produce one Y, meaning it has a lower opportunity cost for Y.\n\nSo, according to the definition, Nation B has a comparative advantage in producing Y, while Nation A has a comparative advantage in producing X, since it has a lower opportunity cost for X.\n\nWait, but in the question, it's saying \"Nation A can produce a good at lower opportunity cost than Nation B can produce the same good.\"\n\nIn my example, for good X, Nation A has a lower opportunity cost than Nation B, so Nation A has a comparative advantage in X.\n\nSimilarly, for good Y, Nation B has a lower opportunity cost, so Nation B has a comparative advantage in Y.\n\nSo, in general, if Nation A has a lower opportunity cost for a particular good, it has a comparative advantage in that good.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A: Nation A has comparative advantage in the production of that good.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any scenario where this might not hold.\n\nSuppose both nations have the same opportunity cost for a good. Then, neither has a comparative advantage over the other.\n\nBut in the question, it specifies that Nation A can produce the good at a lower opportunity cost, so it's not the same.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I'm not confusing comparative advantage with absolute advantage.\n\nAbsolute advantage is about who can produce more of a good with the same amount of resources, regardless of opportunity costs.\n\nIn my earlier example, Nation B can produce more of both goods compared to Nation A, so Nation B has an absolute advantage in both goods.\n\nBut despite that, Nation A still has a comparative advantage in producing X, because its opportunity cost for X is lower than Nation B's.\n\nSo, even if Nation B is more efficient in producing both goods (absolute advantage), Nation A can still have a comparative advantage in one of them.\n\nThis is a key concept in international trade: countries can benefit from trading even if one country is more efficient in producing all goods, as long as their opportunity costs differ.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Nation A has comparative advantage in the production of that good.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
