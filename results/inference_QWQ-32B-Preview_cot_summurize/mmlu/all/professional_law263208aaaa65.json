She filed a declaratory judgment action against the Evergreen Registrar to have her considered a resident and asked for no money damages.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the federal court should do in this situation. So, Imma Grant went to Evergreen State University and was considered a nonresident student, which meant she paid higher tuition. She thinks that's unfair and wants to be considered a resident student instead. She sued the registrar to change her status, but she's not asking for any money; she just wants the status changed.\n\nNow, she's already a senior, and because she spent the previous year at Evergreen, she's now considered a resident student. So, the issue that she's suing about might not matter anymore because her status has already changed.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Dismiss the suit as moot.\n\nB. Dismiss the suit because Imma lacked standing to sue initially.\n\nC. Hear the case if it appears that Ms. Grant is diligently prosecuting the matter.\n\nD. Hear the case due to the amicus interests.\n\nFirst, option A: dismissing the suit as moot. A moot issue is one that no longer matters because the situation has changed. Since Imma is now a resident student, the original issue might be considered moot. But I'm not sure because maybe the court could still decide the issue for future students.\n\nOption B: dismissing the suit because Imma lacked standing initially. Standing means that she had the right to bring the suit in the first place. I think she had standing because she was directly affected by the regulation. She was being charged higher tuition because of it.\n\nOption C: hearing the case if she's diligently prosecuting it. I'm not sure what \"diligently prosecuting\" means exactly, but it seems like she is, since she's pursuing the lawsuit.\n\nOption D: hearing the case because of the amicus interests. Amicus briefs are filed by people who aren't directly involved in the case but have an interest in the outcome. Fourteen groups filed amicus briefs in support of Imma, so maybe the court should hear the case because of that.\n\nI need to think about which one is the most appropriate.\n\nFirst, is the suit moot? Imma is now a resident student, so the original issue might be resolved for her. However, the regulation itself hasn't changed, so this could affect other students in the same situation. Maybe the court would want to address the regulation for the benefit of future students.\n\nOption B says to dismiss the suit because she lacked standing initially. But I think she did have standing because she was directly affected by the regulation.\n\nOption C mentions hearing the case if she's diligently prosecuting it. I think she is, since she's continuing with the lawsuit. But I'm not sure why this would be the deciding factor.\n\nOption D suggests hearing the case because of the amicus interests. The fact that many groups are interested in the outcome might indicate that the issue is important and affects more than just Imma.\n\nI think the key here is whether the suit is moot. If it is, then the court might dismiss it. But if there's still a live controversy\u2014especially considering the amicus briefs and the potential impact on other students\u2014maybe the court should hear it.\n\nLet me see what else I can find.\n\nIn legal terms, a case can be dismissed as moot if the issue has been resolved or if the court's decision won't have any practical effect. In Imma's case, since her status has changed, the immediate issue might be resolved for her. However, if the regulation remains the same and could affect other students similarly in the future, there might be enough of a public interest for the court to hear the case.\n\nAdditionally, sometimes courts will hear cases that are moot if they involve important legal questions that are likely to recur, and avoiding injuries that are capable of repetition yet evading review.\n\nIn Imma's case, if the issue is likely to come up again with other students, the court might decide to hear it now, even if it's moot for her personally.\n\nAlso, the fact that fourteen groups filed amicus briefs suggests that there's significant interest in having the court address the regulation.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the best answer is C: Hear the case if it appears that Ms. Grant is diligently prosecuting the matter.\n\nThis seems reasonable because even though her personal situation may have changed, if she's still pursuing the case diligently, and there are broader interests at stake, the court might proceed.\n\nAlternatively, D: Hear the case due to the amicus interests, also seems plausible.\n\nBut between C and D, I think C is a bit more directly related to Imma's actions, while D focuses on the external interest.\n\nI think C is the better choice because it emphasizes that the court should hear the case if Imma is actively pursuing it, which she is.\n\nSo, I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
