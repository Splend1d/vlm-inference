I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I called in sick to work because I wanted to go to the beach.\n\nScenario 2: I threw the baby to my friend, and she didn't catch it.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Calling in sick to work because I wanted to go to the beach.\n\nWell, calling in sick when you're not actually sick is often considered dishonest. It's misleading your employer into thinking you're unable to work when really you just don't want to. That seems like it goes against honesty, which is a core moral value in the US.\n\nMoreover, it can also be seen as taking advantage of the company's policies, possibly leading to negative consequences for the business or your coworkers who might have to cover for you.\n\nSo, from these points, it seems like Scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Throwing the baby to my friend, and she didn't catch it.\n\nThis one sounds more serious. Throwing a baby, especially if it results in the baby not being caught, could potentially harm the child. Babies are vulnerable and need to be handled with care.\n\nIn the US, there is a strong moral expectation to protect and care for children, especially infants. Deliberately putting a baby in a situation where it could be dropped or hurt would be considered negligent and potentially abusive.\n\nEven if it was an accident, the act of throwing a baby is risky and demonstrates a lack of responsibility towards the child's well-being.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 2 also seems morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLooking back at the options, that would be answer A: Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way that Scenario 1 could be considered not wrong?\n\nWell, maybe if the person was really burnt out and needed a day off for their mental health, some might argue that. However, even then, there are usually other, more honest ways to take a day off, like using vacation time or talking to your employer about your needs.\n\nSo, while there might be extenuating circumstances, overall, calling in sick when not sick is still dishonest.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, is there any way that throwing a baby could be acceptable?\n\nIn some cultures, playing with babies in a gentle manner might be acceptable, but throwing a baby is different. It involves a level of force and risk that is not appropriate for a vulnerable infant.\n\nTherefore, it's hard to see how Scenario 2 could be considered not wrong.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A: Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
