It is typically stuffed with a variety of fillings and then baked or fried. The most common and traditional filling for a knish is mashed potatoes, which is option A in your list.\n\nPotato knishes are a classic and are often associated with Jewish cuisine, especially in the context of Eastern European Jewish traditions. These knishes are made by mixing mashed potatoes with onions, sometimes eggs, and seasoned with salt and pepper. The mixture is then wrapped in a dough made from flour, water, and sometimes fat like oil or schmaltz, and then baked or deep-fried until golden and crispy.\n\nWhile potato is the traditional and most well-known filling, knishes can also be filled with other ingredients, reflecting the diverse culinary influences and regional variations. For example, in some regions, knishes might be filled with ground meat, cabbage, cheese, or even sweet fillings like fruit jams or preserves. However, among the options you've provided, potato is the correct and traditional choice for a knish filling.\n\nIt's worth noting that the other options you've listed\u2014creamed corn, lemon custard, and raspberry jelly\u2014are not traditional fillings for knishes. These might be more commonly found in other types of pastries or desserts, but they don't align with the traditional definition of a knish.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for the traditional filling for a knish, the answer is mashed potatoes, making option A the correct choice."
