So, first things first, I need to remember what the embourgeoisement thesis is all about. From what I recall, it's a sociological concept that deals with changes in the working class and their adoption of middle-class values and lifestyles. Let me see which option matches this.\n\nOption A says: \"capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority.\" Hmm, that sounds more like a description of changes in management structures within companies, maybe related to bureaucracy taking over, but I don't think that's directly about embourgeoisement. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B: \"the affluent working class is adopting middle-class values and ways of life.\" Okay, this seems pretty spot on. Embourgeoisement is about working-class people adopting the customs and values of the bourgeoisie, right? So, this looks like a strong candidate.\n\nOption C: \"white-collar occupations are being 'deskilled' by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace.\" This seems to be about how technology is changing the nature of white-collar jobs, perhaps making them require less skill or changing the skills needed. But again, this doesn't directly relate to the working class adopting middle-class values, so probably not C.\n\nOption D: \"the class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes.\" This sounds more like a description of class fluidity or the disappearance of traditional class structures. While embourgeoisement might be a factor in changing class structures, this option is more about the overall class system breaking down, which isn't specifically about working-class adoption of middle-class values.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, option B seems to directly capture the essence of the embourgeoisement thesis. It's about the affluent working class\u2014probably those who have higher incomes or more stable jobs\u2014starting to live and think like the middle class. Maybe they're buying homes in better neighborhoods, sending their kids to private schools, or engaging in hobbies and behaviors typical of the middle class.\n\nI also recall that this thesis was somewhat controversial. Some sociologists argue that it's happening, while others might say that there are still clear distinctions between the working class and the middle class, and that the adoption of middle-class values is not universal or complete among the working class.\n\nAdditionally, I think it's important to consider the context in which this thesis is being proposed. For example, in post-war Europe, there was a period of economic growth and increasing standards of living, which might have facilitated such a shift. But in more recent times, with economic inequalities on the rise, perhaps the embourgeoisement process is less prevalent.\n\nOverall, though, based on the options provided, I believe that option B is the correct answer. It directly describes the core idea of the embourgeoisement thesis: the affluent working class adopting middle-class values and ways of life.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
