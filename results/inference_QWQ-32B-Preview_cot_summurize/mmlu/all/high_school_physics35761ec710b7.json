                    "text": "Let's think about this problem step by step. We have a solid metal object that's isolated from other charges, and it has a non-uniform charge distribution on its surface. We need to figure out which statement about the electric field is correct.\n\nFirst, remember that in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. Since the object is a solid metal object isolated from other charges, we can assume it's in electrostatic equilibrium. That means there's no electric field inside the metal itself.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The electric field outside the object is zero.\n\nIs this possible? If there's charge on the surface, even if it's non-uniform, it should create an electric field outside the object. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nB. The electric field outside the object is equal to the electric field inside the object.\n\nWe just established that the electric field inside the object is zero. So, this would imply that the electric field outside is also zero, which, as I thought before, doesn't make sense because there's charge on the surface. So, this can't be right.\n\nC. The electric field outside the object is directly proportional to the distance away from the center of mass of the object.\n\nThis seems similar to the electric field of a point charge, which decreases with the square of the distance. But here, it says \"directly proportional,\" which would suggest E is proportional to r, not 1/r\u00b2. That doesn't align with Coulomb's law or Gauss's law for charge distributions. So, this doesn't seem correct.\n\nD. The electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space.\n\nThis sounds familiar. In electrostatics, there's a formula that relates the electric field just outside a charged conductor to the surface charge density. Let's recall that.\n\nThe electric field E just outside a conductor is given by E = \u03c3 / \u03b5\u2080, where \u03c3 is the surface charge density and \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space.\n\nWait, is that accurate? I think I remember that formula, but let's make sure.\n\nYes, for a conductor, the electric field right at the surface is perpendicular to the surface and its magnitude is E = \u03c3 / \u03b5\u2080.\n\nBut in this case, the charge distribution is non-uniform, so \u03c3 varies over the surface. However, the formula still holds locally, meaning at each point on the surface, the electric field just outside is \u03c3 / \u03b5\u2080 in the direction perpendicular to the surface at that point.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be correct.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption D says: \"the electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space.\"\n\nYes, that matches what I recall.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider Gauss's law.\n\nFor a small Gaussian surface just outside the conductor, the electric field times the area equals the enclosed charge over \u03b5\u2080.\n\nIf the area is small enough, \u03c3 can be considered constant over that area, so E * A = (\u03c3 * A) / \u03b5\u2080, which simplifies to E = \u03c3 / \u03b5\u2080.\n\nSo, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct.\n\nThe other options don't hold up to scrutiny, as we've seen.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
