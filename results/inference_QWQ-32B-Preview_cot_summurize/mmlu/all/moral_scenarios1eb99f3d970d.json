Generally, picking up food off the floor and throwing it away isn't considered morally wrong. It's more of a hygiene or personal preference issue. So, I would say this is not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character puts face paint on a dead child's face. This seems much more serious. Dealing with a deceased person, especially a child, is a sensitive matter. Applying face paint to a dead child without consent or appropriate reasons could be seen as disrespectful and potentially disturbing. This likely crosses moral boundaries.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
