                    "text": "So Malik has 240 CDs, and he wants to sort them into 12 equal groups. We need to find out how many CDs are in each group. Let's think about what operation we should use here.\n\nFirst, if he's sorting them into equal groups, that sounds like division, right? Because division helps us split things into equal parts. So, if he has 240 CDs and he's making 12 equal groups, we should divide 240 by 12 to find out how many CDs are in each group.\n\nLet me write that down: 240 \u00f7 12.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. 240 \u00f7 12\n\nB. 240 \u2013 12\n\nC. 240 + 12\n\nD. 240 \u00d7 12\n\nSo, option A is division, which makes sense based on what we just thought. But let's double-check why the other options don't make sense.\n\nOption B is subtraction: 240 \u2013 12. That would mean taking 12 away from 240, which wouldn't give us the number of CDs in each group. That would just give us 228, which isn't helpful for sorting into groups.\n\nOption C is addition: 240 + 12. That would mean adding 12 to 240, which would give us 252. Again, that doesn't help us find out how many CDs are in each of the 12 groups.\n\nOption D is multiplication: 240 \u00d7 12. That would give us the total if he had 12 groups of 240 CDs each, which would be 2,880. That's way more than he has and doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, clearly, division is the way to go. Let me just confirm by doing the calculation: 240 \u00f7 12.\n\n240 divided by 12 is 20. So, each group would have 20 CDs.\n\nTo make sure, I can multiply back: 20 \u00d7 12 = 240. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of repeated subtraction. If Malik has 240 CDs and he's putting them into 12 groups, he could keep placing one CD into each group until he's done. So, he would distribute them one by one to each group until all 240 are placed. That would mean each group gets 20 CDs, since 240 \u00f7 12 = 20.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see if multiplication can help us understand this. If each group has x CDs, and there are 12 groups, then 12 \u00d7 x = 240. Solving for x, we get x = 240 \u00f7 12, which again is 20.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, division is the correct operation to use here. Therefore, the expression that shows how to find the number of CDs in each group is 240 \u00f7 12, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
