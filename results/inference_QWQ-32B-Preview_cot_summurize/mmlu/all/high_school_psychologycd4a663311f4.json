                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says that all public institutions subscribe to certain ethical guidelines except one. So, I need to identify which of the options A, B, C, or D is not universally subscribed to by public institutions.\n\nFirst, I'll look at option A: \"avoiding unnecessary deception to humans.\" This seems like a pretty standard ethical guideline. Public institutions are expected to be transparent and honest with the public. Deceiving people without a good reason would undermine trust, so it makes sense that they would avoid unnecessary deception.\n\nNext, option B: \"avoiding unnecessary pain to humans and other animals.\" This also appears to be a fundamental ethical principle. Causing unnecessary pain is generally considered unethical, whether it's to humans or animals. Public institutions, especially those involved in research or policy-making, should strive to minimize harm.\n\nOption C: \"avoiding use of animals when computers are available.\" This one seems a bit more specific. It's about choosing to use computers instead of animals, presumably in research or testing scenarios. While using computers instead of animals can be ethically preferable to reduce animal suffering, it might not always be possible or appropriate. The availability of computer models doesn't necessarily mean they can fully replace animal testing in all cases. So, this might be the exception.\n\nFinally, option D: \"protecting confidentiality.\" This is another important ethical guideline. Public institutions handle a lot of sensitive information, and protecting confidentiality is crucial to maintain trust and privacy.\n\nComparing all these options, A, B, and D seem like broad, fundamental ethical principles that most public institutions would subscribe to. Option C, however, seems more specific and perhaps not universally applicable, depending on the institution's purposes and capabilities.\n\nMaybe the key here is understanding what \"all public institutions\" entails. Some public institutions might not engage in activities where animal testing is relevant, such as libraries or municipal offices. For those institutions, option C might not be directly applicable. However, research institutions or those involved in regulatory affairs might have to consider using animals in their work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that even when computers are available, there might be valid reasons to use animals in certain contexts, such as medical research where animal models are necessary to understand biological processes. In such cases, avoiding the use of animals might not always be ethical if it hinders important research that could benefit human and animal health.\n\nTherefore, option C might be the one that public institutions do not universally subscribe to, because there are scenarios where using animals is considered necessary and ethical, despite the availability of computer models.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. But I should double-check.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\n- A: Avoiding unnecessary deception to humans. This seems universally ethical.\n\n- B: Avoiding unnecessary pain to humans and other animals. Again, a broad ethical principle.\n\n- C: Avoiding use of animals when computers are available. This might have exceptions based on the nature of the research or work.\n\n- D: Protecting confidentiality. Essential for most public institutions.\n\nYes, I think C is the exception because it's not always possible or ethical to avoid using animals, even when computers are available, depending on the specific context and goals of the institution's work.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
