Working memory\n\nD. Meta-memory\n\nHmm, I need to think about this carefully. I remember that our cognitive system processes information in a specific sequence, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps.\n\nFirst off, sensory memory is where information from our senses is temporarily held. Like, when you see something, that image is briefly stored in your sensory memory before it's either discarded or passed on to the next stage. So, that seems pretty initial.\n\nThen there's the perceptual processor. I think this is where sensory information is interpreted and made meaningful. So, after sensory memory, maybe this is the next step.\n\nWorking memory is where we actively manipulate and work with information. That seems like it comes after we've already processed and made sense of the sensory input.\n\nMeta-memory is a bit different; I think it's more about our knowledge and awareness of our own memory processes. Not sure if that's part of the initial information intake.\n\nSo, if I had to guess, I'd say sensory memory is where information first enters our cognitive system. But let me double-check.\n\nI recall that the cognitive processing of information typically follows this path: sensory input \u2192 sensory memory \u2192 perceptual processing \u2192 working memory \u2192 long-term memory, and so on.\n\nSo, according to this sequence, sensory memory would be the first stop for incoming information.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any step before sensory memory. Like, is there something that happens before the senses even register the information?\n\nWell, the senses themselves are the first point of contact with the environment, right? So, sensory memory is where that raw sensory information is first held in our cognitive system.\n\nPerceptual processing comes after, where the brain starts to make sense of that sensory information, identifying objects, interpreting sounds, etc.\n\nWorking memory is involved when we need to hold and manipulate information for tasks, like problem-solving or comprehension.\n\nAnd meta-memory is more about our strategic control over memory processes, like knowing what helps us remember things better.\n\nSo, in terms of the initial entry point for information, sensory memory seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Sensory memory \u2013 seems right based on what I just thought.\n\nOption B: Perceptual processor \u2013 this seems like it comes after sensory memory, so probably not the first entry point.\n\nOption C: Working memory \u2013 definitely comes after perceptual processing.\n\nOption D: Meta-memory \u2013 this seems even further down the line.\n\nTherefore, I'm fairly confident that the answer is A. Sensory memory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
