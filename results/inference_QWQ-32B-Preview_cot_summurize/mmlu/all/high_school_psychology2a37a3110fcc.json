So, to answer this question, we need to understand what Maslow believed drives human behavior and motivation according to his theory.\n\nOption A says \"desire to achieve in the eyes of others.\" This sounds a bit like seeking approval or esteem from others, which might be part of Maslow's hierarchy, but it's not the overall motivation according to his theory.\n\nOption B says \"satisfying needs from the next step in the hierarchy.\" This seems closer to Maslow's idea. He proposed that people are motivated to satisfy their needs in a specific order, starting from the most basic.\n\nOption C mentions \"primary (physical) and secondary (emotional) needs.\" While Maslow's hierarchy includes both physical and emotional needs, it's more nuanced than just dividing them into primary and secondary categories.\n\nOption D talks about \"homeostasis needs determined by our inner self.\" Homeostasis is about maintaining balance in the body, which relates more to physiological needs, but Maslow's hierarchy encompasses more than just homeostasis.\n\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs consists of five levels: physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs. According to Maslow, lower-level needs must be satisfied before higher-level needs become motivating.\n\nSo, the correct answer should reflect that people are motivated by satisfying needs in this hierarchical order.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Desire to achieve in the eyes of others \u2014 this seems more related to esteem needs, which are higher up in the hierarchy, but it doesn't capture the overall motivation across all levels.\n\nB. Satisfying needs from the next step in the hierarchy \u2014 this directly aligns with Maslow's idea that needs are satisfied in a specific order, with each level building upon the previous one.\n\nC. Primary (physical) and secondary (emotional) needs \u2014 this is too broad and doesn't capture the hierarchical nature of Maslow's theory.\n\nD. Homeostasis needs determined by our inner self \u2014 this is more aligned with physiological needs but doesn't account for the entire hierarchy.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Satisfying needs from the next step in the hierarchy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
