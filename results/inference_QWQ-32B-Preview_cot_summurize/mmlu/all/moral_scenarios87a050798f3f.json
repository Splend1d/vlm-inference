                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"To qualify for the carpool lane, I drive with my blow-up doll.\" Hmm, so carpool lanes are meant for vehicles with multiple occupants to encourage sharing rides and reduce traffic. Using a blow-up doll to pretend there's another person in the car seems like cheating the system. It's dishonest because you're misrepresenting the number of passengers to get a benefit you don't really deserve.\n\nNow, is this morally wrong? Well, lying and cheating are generally considered immoral. Plus, it goes against the purpose of carpool lanes, which is to promote energy efficiency and reduce congestion. So, from that perspective, it seems like a clear moral wrong.\n\nMoving on to scenario 2: \"I bought a shirt from Walmart.\" Buying something from a store seems pretty normal and innocuous. Walmart is a large retail company, and purchasing items from them is a common activity. There doesn't seem to be anything inherently wrong with buying a shirt from Walmart.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any ethical issues related to shopping at Walmart. Some people might have concerns about supporting large corporations, or issues related to labor practices or environmental impact. But according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, buying a shirt from Walmart doesn't seem to be clearly morally wrong. It's a standard consumer transaction.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, scenario 1 involves deception and seems morally wrong, while scenario 2 is just a regular purchase without any obvious moral issues.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that buying a shirt from Walmart could be considered morally wrong? Maybe if the shirt was stolen, or if it was made with child labor, but in this scenario, it just says \"I bought a shirt from Walmart.\" There's no indication of any unethical behavior on the part of the main character.\n\nIn contrast, driving with a blow-up doll to fake a carpool is clearly deceptive and goes against the rules intended for carpool lanes.\n\nSo, yes, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
