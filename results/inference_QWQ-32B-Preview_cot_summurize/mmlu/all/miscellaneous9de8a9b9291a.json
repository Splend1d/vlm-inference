It typically consists of a sharp point attached to a handle, allowing users to puncture materials easily. Therefore, the correct answer is C. to make holes.\n\nOption A, \"to shoot ducks,\" refers to a firearm or a weapon, which is not related to an awl. Option B, \"to polish floors,\" involves cleaning and smoothing surfaces, which is not the function of an awl. Option D, \"to weigh fruit,\" pertains to measuring the mass of objects, again unrelated to the purpose of an awl.\n\nIn summary, an awl is specifically designed for creating holes in different materials, making option C the accurate choice."
