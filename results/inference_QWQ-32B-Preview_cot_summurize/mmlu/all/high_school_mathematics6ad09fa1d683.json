Let's go through the steps one by one.\n\nFirst, we need to find the square roots of 200 and 121.\n\nThe square root of 121 is straightforward because 121 is a perfect square:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{121} = 11\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the square root of 200. Since 200 is not a perfect square, we'll get a decimal approximation. We can calculate it as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{200} \\approx 14.142\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much larger 14.142 is compared to 11, expressed as a percentage. To do this, we can use the formula for percentage increase:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Original Value}}{\\text{Original Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"New Value\" is \\(\\sqrt{200} \\approx 14.142\\), and the \"Original Value\" is \\(\\sqrt{121} = 11\\). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{14.142 - 11}{11} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the difference between the new value and the original value:\n\n\\[\n14.142 - 11 = 3.142\n\\]\n\nThen, divide this difference by the original value:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3.142}{11} \\approx 0.2856\n\\]\n\nFinally, multiply by 100% to convert it to a percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.2856 \\times 100\\% \\approx 28.56\\%\n\\]\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be expressed to the nearest whole number. Rounding 28.56% to the nearest whole number gives us 29%.\n\nTherefore, the positive square root of 200 is approximately 29% larger than the positive square root of 121.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 29\n"
