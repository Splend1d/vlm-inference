                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that a shape is made of 12 right triangles of equal size. Each right triangle has a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm. I need to find the total area of the shape in square centimeters.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are 12 right triangles, all the same size, and I need to find the total area they cover when put together to form a shape. Each triangle has a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm.\n\nI recall that the area of a right triangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nSo, for one triangle, the area would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 5 \\, \\text{cm} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\, \\text{cm}^2 = 10 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nSince there are 12 such triangles, the total area should be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Area} = 12 \\times 10 \\, \\text{cm}^2 = 120 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a trick here. The problem says the shape is made of 12 right triangles, but it doesn't specify how they are arranged. Could there be overlapping areas or something like that?\n\nHmm. If the triangles are put together without overlapping, then the total area should indeed be the sum of the areas of the individual triangles. But if there is overlapping, then the total area would be less than that.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't mention any overlapping, and since it's specified that the triangles are of equal size and form a shape, I think it's safe to assume that they are arranged without overlapping.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all the triangles are right triangles with the same base and height. The problem says they are, so I can proceed with that information.\n\nLet me calculate the area again to be sure.\n\nArea of one triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 5 \\, \\text{cm} = 10 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nTotal area for 12 triangles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Area} = 12 \\times 10 \\, \\text{cm}^2 = 120 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10\n\nB. 60\n\nC. 120\n\nD. 240\n\nOption C is 120, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's a different way to interpret the problem. Perhaps the shape formed by the triangles has some symmetry that affects the total area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the base and height are not the legs of the right triangle, but I think in a right triangle, the two legs are the base and height.\n\nWait a minute, in a right triangle, the base and height are the two sides that form the right angle, and the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle.\n\nSo, for each triangle, base = 4 cm, height = 5 cm, and the hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\text{hypotenuse} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 25} = \\sqrt{41} \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nBut I don't think I need the hypotenuse for this problem, as I'm only asked for the total area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shape is a larger figure made up of these triangles, and perhaps the area of the shape is less than the sum of the areas of the individual triangles due to overlapping or something.\n\nBut again, without any information suggesting that, I think the safe assumption is that the total area is indeed the sum of the areas of the 12 triangles.\n\nTherefore, the total area is 120 cm\u00b2, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
