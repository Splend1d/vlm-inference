This seems like a standard practice that businesses are required to do by law. Withholding taxes from employees' paychecks is a legal obligation for employers in the US. So, from a moral standpoint, this appears to be acceptable and not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, someone is calling the police on a teacher for violent threats. Assuming that the teacher is indeed making violent threats, reporting this to the authorities is likely the right thing to do. It's important to prioritize safety and address threats of violence appropriately. So, in this case, calling the police seems like a responsible action and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, neither of these scenarios involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
