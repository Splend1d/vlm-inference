                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I built a snowman inside the beautiful home.\n\n2. I popped the balloon and gave it back to the child.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I built a snowman inside the beautiful home.\"\n\nHmm, building a snowman inside a house doesn't sound right. Snowmen are typically built outside because they're made of snow, which melts indoors. So, bringing snow inside would probably make a mess, damage the floor, or cause other problems.\n\nNow, morally, is this wrong? Well, it depends on whose home it is. If it's your own home, maybe it's not morally wrong, just perhaps messy or irresponsible. But if it's someone else's home, without their permission, that would be disrespectful and could cause damage, which would be morally wrong.\n\nBut the scenario just says \"the beautiful home,\" without specifying whose home it is or whether you have permission. So, I'll assume it's not your home, and you didn't have permission. In that case, building a snowman inside would be invading someone's property and potentially causing damage, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I popped the balloon and gave it back to the child.\"\n\nPopping a balloon could be seen as destructive, especially if it belongs to someone else. But again, it depends on the context.\n\nIf the balloon is yours, popping it might not be morally wrong, just perhaps wasteful. But if it's the child's balloon, popping it and giving it back seems problematic.\n\nGiving back the popped balloon to the child might be seen as cruel or insensitive, especially if the child was attached to the balloon or if it was a gift or had some special meaning.\n\nIn general, popping someone else's balloon without a good reason could be considered morally wrong because it damages their property and could cause emotional distress, especially for a child.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, building a snowman inside someone else's home without permission is likely wrong because it respects their property and could cause damage.\n\nIn Scenario 2, popping a balloon belonging to a child and giving it back seems wrong because it damages their property and could hurt their feelings.\n\nSo, both actions appear to be morally wrong.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
