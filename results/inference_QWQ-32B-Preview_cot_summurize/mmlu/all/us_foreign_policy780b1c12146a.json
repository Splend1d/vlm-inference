It also aimed to prevent the spread of communism by making sure that European countries didn't turn to the Soviet Union for help, which relates to option B. Additionally, by providing this aid, the US increased its influence in Europe, which is what option C suggests. So, all three points seem to be accurate descriptions of the Marshall Plan."
