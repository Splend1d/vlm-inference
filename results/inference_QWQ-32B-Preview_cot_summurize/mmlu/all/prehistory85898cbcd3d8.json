The options are A. chunkey, B. atlatl, C. burin, and D. petroglyph.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms refers to.\n\nA. Chunkey: I think chunkey was a game played by Native Americans, involving rolling a disk and throwing sticks at it. So, that doesn't seem related to a spear-throwing device.\n\nB. Atlatl: I've heard of this before. It's a spear-thrower, a tool used to throw spears with greater force and distance. So, this seems promising.\n\nC. Burin: This is a type of stone tool, like a chisel, used for engraving or working bone or antler. Not a spear-throwing device.\n\nD. Petroglyph: This is an image carved into rock, like a ancient drawing. Again, not related to a spear-thrower.\n\nSo, between these options, atlatl seems to be the correct term for a spear-throwing device.\n\nNow, the question specifies that it was developed in Europe more than 30,000 years ago. I know that the atlatl is an ancient weapon used by various cultures around the world, including in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic period, which aligns with the time frame mentioned.\n\nBut the question is asking for the Aztec word for this device. I need to confirm if \"atlatl\" is indeed the Aztec term.\n\nI recall that \"atlatl\" is the Nahuatl word, which was the language of the Aztecs. So, it makes sense that \"atlatl\" would be the Aztec term for this spear-throwing device.\n\nTo double-check, I can consider if any of the other options might refer to similar devices. Chunkey is definitely not related to spear-throwing, and burin and petroglyph are types of tools or art, not weapons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. atlatl.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
