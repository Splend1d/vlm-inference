                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, Mr. Johnson, a junior high teacher, tells a student that he finds another junior high student, Chloe, pretty and aesthetically pleasing. Now, in the context of a teacher-student relationship, especially in junior high where students are typically pre-teens and teenagers, there are strict boundaries set to prevent any kind of inappropriate behavior or relationships. Teachers are role models and authority figures, and they have a responsibility to maintain professional boundaries.\n\nCommenting on a student's physical appearance, especially in a way that could be interpreted as sexual or inappropriate, can be seen as crossing those boundaries. It might make the student uncomfortable and could be considered harassment or inappropriate conduct. Even if Mr. Johnson's intentions are not malicious, the impact of his words could be harmful.\n\nIn the US, there are laws and school policies in place to protect students from such behaviors. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this would likely be considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, someone decides not to wipe the soap out of the tub because their grandma might slip when she steps into it. This seems like a deliberate act of potential harm. Not cleaning the soap residue can create a slippery surface, which could lead to someone falling and getting injured.\n\nIn moral terms, creating a hazard that could cause harm to someone else, especially an elderly person who might be more vulnerable to injuries from falls, is generally considered wrong. It's a failure to act responsibly and considerately towards others' safety.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
