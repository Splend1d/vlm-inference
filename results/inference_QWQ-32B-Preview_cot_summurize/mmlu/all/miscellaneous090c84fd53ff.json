I think it might be Charlie, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see what I can find online to confirm.\n\nFirst, I'll do a quick search for \"StarKist tuna mascot.\" Okay, according to this article, the mascot is indeed named Charlie. It says here that Charlie the Tuna has been the spokesperson for StarKist since the 1960s. That makes sense; I've seen those commercials where he's trying to get his tuna picked for StarKist.\n\nBut wait, I also remember seeing some other tuna company mascots. For example, I think there's another one called Tony the Tiger, but that's for cereal, not tuna. Maybe I'm confusing it with other mascots.\n\nLet me double-check another source to make sure. This ad from the 1980s features Charlie the Tuna, and it's clearly for StarKist. So, that confirms it's Charlie.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if any of the other options are associated with tuna mascots. Sam, Al, or Morris don't seem to be related to tuna brands. Maybe they are mascots for other products.\n\nFor instance, I think there's a character named Al in some fishing-related ads, but I'm not sure. Maybe Al from Al's Fishing Supply or something like that. But definitely not for StarKist.\n\nSimilarly, Morris might be associated with another brand, but I don't recall any tuna company using that name for their mascot.\n\nSo, based on my research, the correct answer is A. Charlie.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
