                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal scenario. So, we've got a marine biologist living in an exclusive residential area who has a large tank in his backyard with a great white shark in it. Some neighbors are concerned and afraid, especially about their children wandering onto his property. To ease their fears, he invites them over to see the shark tank. While a neighbor is standing near the tank, the shark splashes its tail, and the neighbor gets very wet. This neighbor had a cold at the time and ends up developing bronchitis. Now, she's suing the resident based on strict liability for the damages incurred from being drenched by the shark.\n\nFirst off, let's understand what strict liability means in this context. Strict liability is a legal doctrine that holds someone responsible for damages or injuries even if they didn't act negligently or with intent to harm. In the case of wild animals, there's a principle that the keeper of a wild animal is strictly liable for any damages caused by that animal, because these animals are considered inherently dangerous.\n\nOption A says: \"recover, because the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused to others by the animals.\" This seems promising. Indeed, great white sharks are wild animals, and their keepers are generally strictly liable for any harm they cause. So, if the neighbor was injured by the shark, and strict liability applies, she should be able to recover damages.\n\nOption B suggests: \"recover, because the smell from the shark tank was a nuisance.\" While the smell might be a nuisance, the neighbor's injury came from being splashed by the shark, not from the smell. So, this seems tangential to the main issue of the shark causing harm.\n\nOption C states: \"not recover, because she suffered injury only because she had a cold and, therefore, was unusually vulnerable to harm from being splashed with water.\" This introduces the concept of assumption of risk or perhaps contributory negligence. However, in strict liability cases, the plaintiff's vulnerabilities typically don't bar recovery. The defendant is liable regardless of the plaintiff's condition, as long as the harm was caused by the dangerous activity or animal.\n\nOption D says: \"not recover, because she did not suffer the type of harm normally inflicted by a shark.\" Great white sharks are known for their biting abilities, which can cause severe injuries or death. In this case, the harm came from being splashed, which is not the typical harm one associates with sharks. However, the shark's action still caused damage\u2014getting the neighbor wet, which led to bronchitis because she had a cold.\n\nNow, in strict liability cases involving wild animals, the liability usually extends to any harm caused by the animal's inherent nature. Even if the harm isn't the most typical form of damage, if it results from the animal's actions, the owner may still be liable.\n\nIn this scenario, the shark splashing its tail and drenching the neighbor seems like an action that is within the animal's natural behavior. Sharks move their tails to swim, and a splash could be an incidental part of that movement. Since the shark is a wild animal, and its keeper is strictly liable for harms it causes, it's likely that the neighbor can recover damages.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the neighbor had a cold and developed bronchitis as a result of getting wet might be considered an aggravation of an existing condition. In law, defendants are liable for all consequences flowing from their actions, even if some harms are unforeseeable or exacerbated by the plaintiff's pre-existing conditions.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the most accurate: the neighbor will most likely recover because the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused to others by the animals.\n\nHowever, it's worth considering that strict liability might have limits. For instance, if the harm was purely economic or if there was no direct contact. But in this case, there was direct contact\u2014being splashed by the shark\u2014which led to a physical injury.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the resident invited the neighbors over to see the shark tank might impose a duty of care on the resident to ensure their safety while viewing the tank. But since the question is based on strict liability, we should focus on that doctrine rather than negligence.\n\nIn conclusion, given that great white sharks are wild animals and their keepers are strictly liable for harms caused by them, and considering that the harm here was directly caused by the shark's action, the neighbor should be able to recover damages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
