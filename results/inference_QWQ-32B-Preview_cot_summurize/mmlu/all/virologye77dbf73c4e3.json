Dmitri Iwanowsky\n\nD. Jonas Salk\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about each of these scientists and their contributions to science.\n\nStarting with Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, he was a Dutch microscopist who is often considered one of the founders of microbiology. He's famous for his work on improving the microscope and for being one of the first to observe and describe single-celled organisms, which he called \"animalcules.\" So, he was definitely involved in early studies of microorganisms, but I'm not sure if he discovered viruses.\n\nNext, Charles Chamberland was a French bacteriologist. He's known for inventing the Bunsen burner and the Chamberland filter, which was a porcelain filter with very small pores that could remove bacteria from liquids. This filter was later used in experiments to study viruses, but I don't think he discovered viruses himself.\n\nDmitri Iwanowsky was a Russian botanist who is often credited with the discovery of viruses. In the late 19th century, he was studying a disease that affects tobacco plants, known as tobacco mosaic disease. He found that the infectious agent causing this disease could pass through filters that retained bacteria, suggesting that it was much smaller than bacteria. He called this agent a \"virus,\" from the Latin word meaning \"poison\" or \"slimy liquid.\" So, this sounds promising.\n\nLastly, Jonas Salk was an American virologist best known for developing the first successful polio vaccine. He did important work in virology, but his work came much later, in the mid-20th century, whereas the discovery of viruses occurred earlier.\n\nGiven this information, it seems like Dmitri Iwanowsky is the most likely candidate for discovering the first virus. His work on the tobacco mosaic virus laid the foundation for the field of virology.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should double-check if there's any other scientist who might have discovered a virus before him. For example, Martinus Beijerinck, a Dutch microbiologist, also studied the tobacco mosaic disease around the same time as Iwanowsky and is sometimes credited with discovering viruses because he coined the term \"virus\" and demonstrated that the infectious agent was a liquid-borne agent that could pass through filters.\n\nHowever, Iwanowsky published his findings first, in 1892, while Beijerinck published his work in 1898. So, although both made important contributions, Iwanowsky was earlier in recognizing that there was an infectious agent smaller than bacteria.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. The botanist Dmitri Iwanowsky.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
