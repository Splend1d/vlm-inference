                    "text": "So I've got this question: \"What is the remainder of 21 divided by 7?\" And there are options: A. 21, B. 7, C. 1, D. None of these.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a remainder is. Like, when you divide one number by another, the remainder is what's left over if the first number isn't perfectly divisible by the second one.\n\nSo, in this case, we're dividing 21 by 7. I know that 7 times 3 is 21, right? 7 x 3 = 21. So, 21 divided by 7 should be 3, with no leftover stuff.\n\nWait, so if there's no leftover, does that mean the remainder is zero? But zero isn't one of the options here. The options are 21, 7, 1, or none of these.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nSo, division is basically figuring out how many times one number fits into another. Here, 7 fits into 21 exactly 3 times, because 7 x 3 = 21.\n\nSo, 21 - (7 x 3) = 21 - 21 = 0. So, the remainder is zero.\n\nBut zero isn't listed as an option. So, maybe the answer is D, none of these.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Maybe I'm making a mistake.\n\nLet me try another way. Let's use the division formula:\n\nDividend = Divisor x Quotient + Remainder.\n\nHere, the dividend is 21, the divisor is 7. We've said the quotient is 3, and the remainder is 0.\n\nSo, 21 = 7 x 3 + 0. That checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider remainder 21, like option A, let's see:\n\n21 = 7 x 0 + 21. That's true, but that would mean the quotient is 0, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, but in division, the quotient is how many times the divisor fits into the dividend, which is 3, not 0.\n\nSo, that doesn't make sense. Option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B is 7. If remainder is 7, then:\n\n21 = 7 x 2 + 7. But that's 14 + 7 = 21, which is correct, but in division, the remainder should always be less than the divisor.\n\nI think that's a rule: the remainder has to be less than the divisor. So, if the divisor is 7, the remainder can't be 7; it has to be less than 7.\n\nSo, option B is invalid.\n\nOption C is 1. Let's see:\n\nIf remainder is 1, then 21 = 7 x some quotient + 1.\n\nLet's see, 7 x 2 = 14, plus 1 is 15, which is not 21.\n\n7 x 3 = 21, plus 1 would be 22, which is too big.\n\nSo, that doesn't work either.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find a quotient where 7 times quotient plus 1 equals 21.\n\nSo, 7q + 1 = 21 \u21d2 7q = 20 \u21d2 q = 20/7, which is not a whole number. But in integer division, quotient is a whole number.\n\nSo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, none of the options A, B, or C are correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be D, none of these.\n\nBut, I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Maybe there's a different way to interpret the question.\n\nLet me read it again: \"What is the remainder of 21 divided by 7?\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone thinks that the remainder is 7, but as I thought earlier, that's not possible because the remainder has to be less than the divisor.\n\nOr maybe they think the remainder is 21, but again, that doesn't make sense because 21 is bigger than 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they think the remainder is 1, but as we saw, that doesn't add up.\n\nSo, I stick with D, none of these.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any mathematical context where a remainder could be defined differently.\n\nIn some programming languages, for example, the modulo operation can sometimes yield negative remainders, but in basic arithmetic, remainders are non-negative and less than the divisor.\n\nIn this case, since we're dealing with straightforward arithmetic, I don't think that applies.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
