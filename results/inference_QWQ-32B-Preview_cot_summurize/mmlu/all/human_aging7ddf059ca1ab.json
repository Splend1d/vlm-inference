                    "text": "Let's see what excess disability means. I have this multiple-choice question here, and I need to pick the correct definition from the options provided.\n\nOption A says: \"Not due to the disease but due instead to malignant social psychology.\" Hmm, that sounds interesting. So, it's suggesting that excess disability is caused by negative social factors rather than the disease itself. Maybe something like stigma or social isolation exacerbating the condition.\n\nOption B: \"In excess of the average for that particular disorder.\" This seems straightforward. It's saying that excess disability is when someone has more disability than what is normally expected for their specific disease.\n\nOption C: \"Found only in the last stage of Alzheimer's.\" This is specifying a particular disease, Alzheimer's, and saying that excess disability only occurs in its final stage.\n\nOption D: \"Those that can be successfully treated by medicine if they are caught early enough.\" This suggests that excess disability refers to symptoms that are treatable early on but maybe become more severe if not addressed\u53ca\u65f6.\n\nI need to think about which one makes the most sense. Let's consider what \"excess disability\" might mean. The term \"excess\" implies that there is more disability than what would be expected based on the disease alone. So, maybe it's about factors beyond the disease that contribute to greater disability.\n\nOption A talks about malignant social psychology, which could include things like discrimination, lack of social support, or other social issues that might make a person's disability worse. That seems plausible.\n\nOption B says \"in excess of the average for that particular disorder.\" This also makes sense because it directly relates to the idea that some people have more disability than others with the same disease.\n\nOption C is very specific to Alzheimer's and only in the last stage. That seems too narrow, as excess disability could apply to various diseases at different stages.\n\nOption D is about treatable symptoms caught early. While early intervention is important, it doesn't directly define what excess disability is.\n\nBetween options A and B, both seem relevant. Option A focuses on social factors contributing to excess disability, while option B is more general, referring to any disability beyond the average for the disorder.\n\nI think option B is broader and more accurate because excess disability can be due to various factors, including but not limited to social ones. For example, individual differences in physical condition, access to healthcare, or personal resilience could all contribute to excess disability.\n\nSo, I would go with option B: \"In excess of the average for that particular disorder.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
