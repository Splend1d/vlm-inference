I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I took both of my kids by their hands and ran away from the burning house.\"\n\nSo, here, the person is taking their kids by the hand and running away from a burning house. Hmm, burning house sounds dangerous, so running away seems like a sensible thing to do to escape harm. It's their responsibility as a parent to protect their children from danger. So, in this case, I don't think there's anything morally wrong with trying to save your own kids from a burning house.\n\nSecond scenario: \"In order to impress Taylor Swift, I tried to learn how to write songs.\"\n\nOkay, so this person wants to impress Taylor Swift and is trying to learn songwriting for that purpose. Well, wanting to impress someone and putting effort into learning a new skill seems pretty normal and harmless. It's admirable, actually, to pursue a goal like that. There's nothing morally wrong with trying to improve yourself or learn something new, even if it's to impress someone.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them seems to involve any clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn the first scenario, taking kids by the hand and running away from a burning house\u2014 that's clearly a safety measure. It's protecting children from harm, which is a parent's responsibility. No moral issues there.\n\nIn the second scenario, trying to learn songwriting to impress Taylor Swift\u2014 that's a personal goal. It doesn't harm anyone; in fact, it's a positive pursuit. So, again, no moral wrongdoing.\n\nYeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
