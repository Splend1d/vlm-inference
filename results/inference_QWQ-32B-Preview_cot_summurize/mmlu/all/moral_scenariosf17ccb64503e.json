                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I swerved away from the pedestrian walking along the busy roadway.\n\n2. I took his wallet after getting a ride home from the bar.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I swerved away from the pedestrian walking along the busy roadway.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky. So, there's a pedestrian walking along a busy roadway, and I swerved away from them. Morally, what's going on here?\n\nFirst, pedestrians on busy roadways might be in danger, right? They shouldn't be walking there because it's unsafe. So, if I swerve away from them, am I doing something wrong?\n\nWell, swerving away could mean I'm avoiding hitting them, which seems like a good thing, morally speaking. Protecting human life and preventing harm is generally considered morally right.\n\nBut, on the other hand, maybe by swerving away, I could be endangering others, like other drivers or passengers in my car. So, maybe it's not that straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the context. If the pedestrian is walking on the roadway where they shouldn't be, and I swerve to avoid hitting them, that might be the safer choice for everyone involved. It's better to avoid a collision, even if it means swerving away from the pedestrian.\n\nBut, maybe there are laws or moral expectations about yielding to pedestrians, even if they're in the wrong place. I'm not sure about that.\n\nLet me think differently. If I don't swerve and hit the pedestrian, that would be clearly wrong, right? Causing harm or death to someone unnecessarily is morally wrong.\n\nSo, by swerving away, I'm preventing that harm, which should be morally right.\n\nBut, perhaps there's more to it. Maybe there's a concept of responsibility here. If the pedestrian is where they shouldn't be, maybe I'm not fully responsible for their safety. But morally, we still have a duty to avoid harming others, even if they're acting irresponsibly.\n\nI think, overall, swerving away to avoid hitting a pedestrian, even if they're in the wrong place, is the morally right thing to do. So, this scenario doesn't involve something morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: I took his wallet after getting a ride home from the bar.\n\nOkay, this seems pretty straightforward. Taking someone's wallet without their permission is stealing, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nIt doesn't matter that they gave me a ride home from the bar; taking their wallet is still theft, which goes against basic moral standards of respecting others' property.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. So, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 1.\n\nIs there any way that swerving away from the pedestrian could be considered wrong?\n\nWell, maybe if by swerving away, I end up hitting someone else or causing an accident that hurts others. In that case, my action could be considered morally wrong because I caused harm to others.\n\nBut, in the scenario, it just says I swerved away from the pedestrian. It doesn't specify if I hit someone else or caused an accident. So, perhaps I should assume that I swerved away safely without harming anyone else.\n\nIn that case, it's still the right thing to do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an expectation to report the pedestrian to the authorities or to make sure they're safe, but taking action to avoid hitting them seems paramount.\n\nI think my initial assessment stands: swerving away to avoid hitting a pedestrian is morally right, and taking someone's wallet is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
