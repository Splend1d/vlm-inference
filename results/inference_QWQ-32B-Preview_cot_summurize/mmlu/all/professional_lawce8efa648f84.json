                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal scenario. We have a dance student who was injured while exercising in her apartment building, and now she's suing the building owner. The owner wants to testify about something the janitor told him, but there's a question about whether this testimony is admissible in court.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the context. The student was doing extra leg-strengthening exercises, including leaping and bounding up stairs, when she fell and broke her leg due to a loose floorboard. The janitor had warned her earlier that she was bound to get hurt if she kept it up because there were problems with the floor.\n\nNow, the building owner wants to testify that the janitor told him, \"I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.\" The question is whether this statement is admissible in court.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.\n\nB. Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.\n\nC. No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.\n\nD. No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what hearsay is. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the building owner wants to testify about what the janitor told him, which is an out-of-court statement.\n\nOption A suggests that it's a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party, but I'm not familiar with that specific exception. Maybe it's referring to something like a statement against interest or present sense impression, but I'm not sure. I need to double-check that.\n\nOption B says that it's admissible because the building owner can testify and be questioned about it. Well, just because someone can testify about something doesn't necessarily make it admissible, especially if it's hearsay.\n\nOption C says it's irrelevant and immaterial. I don't think that's the case here. The statement relates to the warning given to the student about the floor condition, which is directly relevant to the student's injury and the building's maintenance issues.\n\nOption D says it's hearsay within hearsay, which makes sense because the building owner is testifying about what the janitor told him, and within that statement, the janitor is reporting what he told the student. So, there are two levels of hearsay here.\n\nNow, hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception. So, if this statement doesn't fit into any hearsay exception, it should be excluded.\n\nLet's consider the statement: \"I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.\" This seems like the janitor is reporting what he said to the student, which might be considered a prior statement of his own words. There are exceptions for statements of the declarant's then-existing state of mind or for statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, but neither seems to apply here.\n\nWait, maybe the statement is considered a then-existing state of mind or something related to the janitor's perception of the floor condition. But I'm not sure if that qualifies as an exception.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is being offered not for the truth of the matter asserted but for some other purpose, like to show notice or knowledge on the part of the building owner. If that's the case, maybe it's not considered hearsay.\n\nLet me think about that. If the building owner is testifying about what the janitor told him to show that the owner had knowledge of potential hazards in the building, then the statement might be admissible for that purpose, not to prove that the floor was indeed dangerous, but to show that the owner knew or should have known about potential issues.\n\nIn that case, the statement would not be offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that the floor was dangerous), but rather to show the owner's knowledge or notice of the condition.\n\nIf that's the case, then it might be admissible under the exception for statements offered to show state of mind, intent, or knowledge.\n\nHowever, in the statement, the janitor is reporting what he told the student, which adds another layer of complexity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is considered a admission by a party-opponent if the janitor works for the building owner, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, maybe there's a hearsay exception for statements by agents concerning the scope of their employment. If the janitor is an agent of the building owner, and he's making statements within the scope of his employment, perhaps that statement is admissible under the agency exception to hearsay.\n\nBut again, the statement is what the janitor told the student, which might still be considered hearsay within hearsay.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to consider the purpose for which the building owner is offering the janitor's statement.\n\nIf the owner is trying to show that the student was warned about the potential danger, then perhaps the statement is being offered to prove that the student had notice of the danger, which could affect her contributory negligence or assumption of risk.\n\nBut in that case, the statement would still be hearsay unless it falls under an exception.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is considered a statement against interest, but I don't think so, because the janitor is warning the student about the danger, which doesn't necessarily incriminate him or the building owner.\n\nAnother possibility is that the statement is considered a present recollection recorded, but that seems unlikely.\n\nMaybe the statement is being offered to impeach the student's testimony if she claims she had no idea about the floor condition, but that would depend on the context.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most accurate answer is option D: No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because there might be an exception that allows the statement to be admissible for showing notice or knowledge on the part of the building owner.\n\nBut considering the double layer of hearsay, it might still be inadmissible unless there are specific exceptions that apply to both levels of hearsay.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
