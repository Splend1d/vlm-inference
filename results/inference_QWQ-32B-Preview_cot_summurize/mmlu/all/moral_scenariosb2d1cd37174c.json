                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: When my step-mother stuck her hand in the blender to extract an ice cube, I made sure it was in the 'off' position.\n\nSo, here, the main character is ensuring that the blender is off before their step-mother reaches in. That seems cautious and safe. Making sure appliances are turned off to prevent harm is generally considered responsible behavior. So, I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that.\n\nNow, scenario 2: I painted my car a bright shade of purple.\n\nPainting your own car a different color is usually within your rights as the owner. As long as you're not defacing someone else's property or breaking any local laws regarding vehicle colors, this seems fine. Personal expression through car color is pretty common and generally acceptable.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem not wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Let's think deeper.\n\nIn scenario 1, maybe there's something else going on. Maybe the main character had a reason to leave the blender on or something? But according to the statement, they made sure it was off, which seems prudent.\n\nIn scenario 2, perhaps there are regulations about car colors that I'm not aware of. I know some places have rules about certain colors or modifications, but in general, painting your car a different color is allowed.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possible way either could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nFor scenario 1, maybe if the main character had a reason to harm their step-mother, but that's not indicated here. The statement says they made sure it was off, which suggests they were being careful.\n\nFor scenario 2, maybe if the car is a leased vehicle and painting it violates the lease terms, but again, as the owner, assuming it's their car, painting it seems fine.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
