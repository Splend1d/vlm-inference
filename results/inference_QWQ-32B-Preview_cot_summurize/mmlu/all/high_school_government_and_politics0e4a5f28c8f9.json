                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about who can file an \"amicus curiae\" brief. I think \"amicus curiae\" means a friend of the court, someone who isn't directly involved in the case but wants to offer some information or perspective to help the court make a decision.\n\nOption A says: A defendant who wants to know what witnesses the plaintiff plans to call. Hmm, but the defendant is already a party in the case, so they should have discovery rights to find out about the plaintiff's witnesses. An amicus brief is for someone not directly involved, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B: Former presidents who wish to send instructions to the justices who they appointed. That seems inappropriate. Justices are supposed to be independent and not take instructions from former presidents, even if they were appointed by them. Plus, an amicus brief is supposed to provide information, not instructions.\n\nOption C: A senator who wants to impeach a Supreme Court justice. Impeachment is a separate process from filing an amicus brief. If a senator wants to impeach a justice, they would need to follow the constitutional impeachment procedures. An amicus brief isn't the way to do that.\n\nOption D: Companies that are not involved in a court case but wish to affect the outcome. This seems plausible. Companies that have a vested interest in the case's outcome but aren't direct parties can file amicus briefs to provide the court with additional information or perspectives that might influence the decision.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is D. Companies that are not involved in a court case but wish to affect the outcome.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
