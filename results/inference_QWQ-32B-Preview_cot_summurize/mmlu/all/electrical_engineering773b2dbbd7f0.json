                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says \"1 F is theoretically equal to\" and gives a few options. So, 1 F refers to 1 Farad, which is the unit of capacitance in the International System of Units (SI). Capacitance is the ability of a component to store electrical energy in an electric field.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of a Farad. I remember that one Farad is defined as the capacitance of a capacitor that has a potential difference of one volt across its plates when it's holding one coulomb of charge. In other words, it's the ratio of the charge stored to the voltage applied.\n\nMathematically, that's expressed as:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{Q}{V} \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is capacitance in Farads, \\( Q \\) is the charge in Coulombs, and \\( V \\) is the voltage in Volts.\n\nSo, rearranging that, 1 Farad would be:\n\n\\[ 1 F = \\frac{1 C}{1 V} \\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1 ohm of resistance\n\nB. ratio of 1 V to 1 C\n\nC. ratio of 1 C to 1 V\n\nD. none of these\n\nOption A is about resistance, which is measured in ohms and is related to Ohm's law, \\( V = IR \\), but that's not about capacitance. So, A doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says the ratio of 1 V to 1 C, which would be \\( \\frac{1 V}{1 C} \\). But from the formula, it's actually \\( \\frac{1 C}{1 V} \\), so B is incorrect.\n\nOption C says the ratio of 1 C to 1 V, which matches the formula I recalled, \\( \\frac{1 C}{1 V} \\), so that seems correct.\n\nOption D is \"none of these,\" but since C seems to be correct, D isn't necessary.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here. Is there another way to interpret 1 Farad?\n\nI know that in capacitors, the units relate charge, voltage, and capacitance. Sometimes, people might confuse it with the relationship in resistors, where resistance is voltage over current, but that's ohms, not farads.\n\nAlso, sometimes people might think of the time constant in an RC circuit, which is \\( \\tau = RC \\), but that would be in seconds, not farads.\n\nNo, I think the straightforward definition is the way to go here. 1 Farad is indeed the ratio of 1 Coulomb to 1 Volt.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. ratio of 1 C to 1 V.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
