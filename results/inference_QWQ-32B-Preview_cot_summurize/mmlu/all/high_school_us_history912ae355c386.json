We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality \u2026 but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.\u2026\nWe will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.\n\u2014Senator Huey P.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Senator Huey P. Long and his \"Share Our Wealth Society.\" He's proposing to limit the wealth of big men in the country, setting a maximum of $50 million for any individual and guaranteeing a certain level of wealth for every family. It's interesting to see this kind of wealth redistribution being proposed back in 1934 during the Great Depression.\n\nNow, the question is asking how President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to political challenges like Senator Long's. The options are:\n\nA. Announcing that he would not run for re-election\n\nB. Launching the Second New Deal, a series of legislative acts including Social Security\n\nC. Diverting people's attention by allowing the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor\n\nD. Urging Congress to cut taxes and deregulate the economy\n\nFirst off, option C is way off. There's no way FDR would allow the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor to divert attention. That's a completely absurd and historically inaccurate choice. It must be a trick option.\n\nOption A doesn't make sense either. FDR was quite popular and went on to run for re-election multiple times, serving an unprecedented four terms. So, announcing he wouldn't run for re-election in response to political challenges doesn't align with what actually happened.\n\nOption D seems contrary to what FDR was doing during the New Deal. The New Deal was characterized by increased government intervention in the economy, not cutting taxes and deregulating. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nThat leaves option B, launching the Second New Deal, which included Social Security. I recall that the New Deal had two phases: the First New Deal and the Second New Deal. The First New Deal was more about emergency relief and economic recovery, while the Second New Deal introduced more progressive reforms aimed at social justice and equality.\n\nSenator Long's proposals seem to be tapping into the same sentiments that led to the Second New Deal. FDR might have responded to challenges from the left, like Long's movement, by moving to implement more progressive policies to undermine the support for more radical solutions.\n\nSocial Security, in particular, was a landmark legislation that provided a safety net for the elderly, unemployed, and families, which aligns with the idea of guaranteeing a certain level of wealth or well-being for every family.\n\nSo, it makes sense that FDR would launch the Second New Deal in response to political challenges like Senator Long's, to address the same concerns and prevent the growth of more radical movements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Launching the Second New Deal, a series of legislative acts including Social Security.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
