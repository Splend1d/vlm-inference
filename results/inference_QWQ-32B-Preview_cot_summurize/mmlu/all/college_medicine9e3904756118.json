                    "text": "So I've got this question about DNA replication and I'm a bit confused. It says that DNA polymerase creates new DNA by adding complementary nucleotides to a template strand from the original double-stranded DNA. Then it mentions that a section of the template strand has a ratio of 3:2 of A:T bases, and asks for the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complementary strand of DNA. The options are 3:2, 1:1, 2:3, or cannot be determined.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on during DNA replication. DNA polymerase reads the template strand and synthesizes a new strand that's complementary to it. In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). So, if the template strand has A, the new strand will have T, and vice versa.\n\nThe question is focusing on a specific section of the template strand where the ratio of A to T is 3:2. That means for every 3 A's, there are 2 T's in that section of the template.\n\nNow, in the complementary strand, every A in the template corresponds to a T, and every T in the template corresponds to an A. So, if the template has more A's than T's, the complementary strand should have more T's than A's.\n\nLet me try to figure this out with some numbers. Suppose in the template strand, there are 3 A's and 2 T's, making a total of 5 bases in this section.\n\nIn the complementary strand:\n\n- For each A in the template, there's a T.\n\n- For each T in the template, there's an A.\n\nSo, in the complementary strand:\n\n- Number of T's = number of A's in the template = 3\n\n- Number of A's = number of T's in the template = 2\n\nTherefore, the ratio of A:T in the complementary strand is 2:3.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this. Maybe I should consider the entire double helix and the fact that in double-stranded DNA, the amount of A equals the amount of T, and G equals C, according to Chargaff's rules. But in this case, it's specifying a particular section of the template strand with a skewed ratio of A to T, so perhaps that doesn't directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio in the complementary strand would be the inverse of the template strand's ratio. If the template has A:T = 3:2, then the complementary strand should have T:A = 3:2, which is the same as A:T = 2:3.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nBut let's think about it another way. If the template has more A's than T's, meaning more T's are being placed in the complementary strand, which would mean more T's than A's in the complementary strand, hence A:T = 2:3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the ratio cannot be determined without knowing the entire sequence.\n\nWait, no, because the complementary strand's composition is directly determined by the template strand's composition.\n\nLet me consider that in the template strand, A pairs with T in the complementary strand, and T pairs with A.\n\nSo, the number of A's in the complementary strand equals the number of T's in the template strand.\n\nSimilarly, the number of T's in the complementary strand equals the number of A's in the template strand.\n\nGiven that, if the template has A:T = 3:2, then in the complementary strand, A:T = T:A = 2:3.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2:3.\n\nBut let's see what the options are:\n\nA. 3:2\n\nB. 1:1\n\nC. 2:3\n\nD. cannot be determined\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer based on this reasoning.\n\nBut why would someone think it's 1:1? Maybe if they forget that A pairs with T and T pairs with A, and mistakenly think that the base pairing maintains the same ratio, which it doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they think that in double-stranded DNA, A always equals T, but in this case, it's specifically about a section of the template strand with a skewed ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they think that DNA polymerase introduces errors, but the question doesn't suggest any errors or mutations, so we can assume faithful replication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they think that the ratio cannot be determined because they don't know the entire sequence, but actually, based on the complementary base pairing, it's directly determinable.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. 2:3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
