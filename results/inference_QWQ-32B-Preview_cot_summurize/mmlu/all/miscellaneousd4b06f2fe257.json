                    "text": "The capital of North Dakota is Bismarck. So, the correct answer is A. Bismarck.\n\nLet me explain a bit more about this. North Dakota is a state in the United States, and like all states, it has a capital city where the state government is located. Bismarck has been the capital of North Dakota since 1883. It's located in the central part of the state, near the Missouri River.\n\nNow, looking at the other options:\n\n- B. Fargo: Fargo is actually in North Dakota, but it's not the capital. It's a major city in the state, known for its universities and being a center for commerce.\n\n- C. Sioux Falls: This is interesting because Sioux Falls is not in North Dakota; it's the capital of South Dakota. So, that's a different state altogether.\n\n- D. Pierre: Pierre is the capital of South Dakota, not North Dakota.\n\nSo, to summarize, if you're asked for the capital of North Dakota, the correct answer is A. Bismarck.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
