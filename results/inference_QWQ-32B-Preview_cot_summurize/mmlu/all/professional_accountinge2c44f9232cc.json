                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a shoe retailer and their sales and returns policy. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe company allows customers to return shoes within 90 days of purchase, and they estimate that 5% of their sales will be returned within that period. In the current month, they had sales of $200,000 and returns of $5,000 from sales made in prior months.\n\nThe question is asking for the net sales revenue for new sales made during the month. So, I need to figure out what amount the company should record as net sales revenue for these new sales.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between gross sales and net sales. Gross sales are the total sales before any deductions, while net sales are gross sales minus returns, allowances, and discounts.\n\nIn this case, the company has sales of $200,000, and they estimate that 5% of these sales will be returned within 90 days. So, the estimated returns for these new sales would be 5% of $200,000.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n5% of $200,000 is 0.05 * $200,000 = $10,000.\n\nSo, the company estimates that $10,000 worth of the new sales will be returned.\n\nNow, the problem also mentions that there were returns of $5,000 from sales made in prior months. But since the question is asking for net sales revenue for new sales made during the month, I think I should focus on the new sales and their estimated returns.\n\nTherefore, the net sales revenue for new sales would be gross sales minus the estimated returns for those sales.\n\nSo, $200,000 - $10,000 = $190,000.\n\nWait a minute, but the answer options include $190,000, which is option B.\n\nBut let me double-check if I'm missing something.\n\nIs there any reason why the returns from prior months should affect the net sales revenue for new sales?\n\nI don't think so, because those returns are related to previous sales, not the new sales made during the month.\n\nSo, the net sales revenue for new sales should indeed be $190,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company records returns from prior months as a reduction in current sales revenue. But that doesn't make much sense because those returns should reverse the revenue recognized in the period the sales were made.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider both the estimated returns for new sales and the actual returns from prior sales.\n\nBut again, the question specifically asks for net sales revenue for new sales made during the month.\n\nSo, I think the appropriate approach is to take the new sales and subtract the estimated returns for those sales.\n\nTherefore, $200,000 - $10,000 = $190,000.\n\nI think option B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
