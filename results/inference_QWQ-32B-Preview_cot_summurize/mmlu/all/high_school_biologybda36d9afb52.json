                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about squirrels that a biologist studied over 15 years. The population was always between 30 and 45 squirrels, and more than half of the babies didn't make it to reproduce because of food competition and predators. Then, in one generation, 90% of the babies lived to reproduce, and the population shot up to 80. I need to figure out which inferences might be true based on this information.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Normally, in this population, more than half of the squirrels born don't survive to reproduce. That means only less than 50% make it. But in this particular generation, 90% of the babies survived to reproduce, which is a big jump. As a result, the population increased to 80, which is higher than the previous maximum of 45.\n\nSo, what could have caused this change? Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The amount of available food may have increased.\n\nB. The number of predators may have decreased.\n\nC. The squirrels of subsequent generations should show greater levels of genetic variation than previous generations, because squirrels that would not have survived in the past will now survive.\n\nD. A, B, and C.\n\nAlright, let's consider each one.\n\nOption A: If the amount of available food increased, that could certainly help more squirrels survive. With more food, there's less competition, so more babies could make it to reproduce. That makes sense.\n\nOption B: If the number of predators decreased, that would also reduce the number of squirrels being killed, allowing more to reach reproductive age. So, that's another plausible reason for the increase in survival rate.\n\nOption C: This one is a bit trickier. It's saying that because more squirrels are surviving, including some that wouldn't have in the past, there should be greater genetic variation in future generations. Hmm.\n\nWait a minute. Normally, in natural selection, only the fittest survive to reproduce, which can lead to less genetic variation over time as certain traits become more prevalent. But in this case, if suddenly a higher proportion of squirrels are surviving, including some that maybe wouldn't have otherwise, that could introduce more genetic variation into the gene pool because a broader range of traits are being passed on.\n\nSo, it seems like option C could also be true.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. If more squirrels are surviving because there's more food or fewer predators, does that necessarily mean that genetic variation will increase?\n\nWell, genetic variation is influenced by several factors, including mutation, gene flow, sexual reproduction, and genetic drift. In this scenario, it's not immediately clear that genetic variation would increase just because more squirrels are surviving.\n\nIn fact, if more squirrels are surviving because there's more food, but the same traits are still advantageous, maybe the genetic composition doesn't change that much. Or, if fewer predators mean that predation pressure is reduced, again, maybe the genetic makeup of the population doesn't change drastically.\n\nWait, but the option says that squirrels that would not have survived in the past will now survive, which implies that perhaps individuals with traits that were previously disadvantageous are now surviving and reproducing. That could indeed introduce more genetic variation into the population, because a wider range of traits are being passed on to the next generation.\n\nSo, option C seems plausible.\n\nNow, option D says A, B, and C. If all three of the previous options are possible, then D would be the correct choice.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nFirst, options A and B both provide reasonable explanations for why more squirrels might survive to reproduce. More food reduces competition, fewer predators mean less mortality. Both make sense.\n\nOption C is a bit more speculative, but as I thought earlier, if more squirrels are surviving, including those with traits that were previously non-viable, that could lead to increased genetic variation.\n\nTherefore, it seems that all three options could be true, making D the correct choice.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there might be other factors at play that aren't mentioned here. For example, maybe there was a change in the squirrels' behavior or biology that allowed more of them to survive, rather than changes in the environment like food availability or predator numbers.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems that environmental changes like more food or fewer predators are the most likely explanations for the increase in survival rate.\n\nAlso, regarding option C, it's important to note that while increased survival of a broader range of individuals could lead to greater genetic variation, it's also possible that if the population is growing rapidly, genetic drift might play a role, which could reduce genetic variation.\n\nBut given the information provided, it seems that options A, B, and C are all possible inferences.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely D. A, B, and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
