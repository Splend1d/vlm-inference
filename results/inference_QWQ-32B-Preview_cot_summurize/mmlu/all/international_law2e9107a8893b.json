                    "text": "Let's see, I need to pick the statement that best describes the UK Constitution. I know a bit about this, but I need to make sure I get it right.\n\nOption A says that the UK Constitution's only source of power is that of the sovereign. Hmm, I think that's not entirely accurate. I recall that in the UK, there's something called the Crown-in-Parliament, which is the sovereign acting with the advice of Parliament. So, power comes from both the monarch and Parliament, but I'm not sure if that's the complete picture.\n\nOption B states that the UK Constitution gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of Parliament. I think this is interesting. In many countries, the judiciary can declare laws unconstitutional, but I'm not sure if that's the case in the UK. I think in the UK, Parliament is sovereign, meaning that it can make or unmake any law, and the judiciary doesn't have the power to overturn its acts. But maybe things have changed with human rights legislation. I need to think about that.\n\nOption C says that the UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources. Yeah, I remember that the UK Constitution is unique because it's not written in a single document like in the US or France. Instead, it's made up of various laws, conventions, and practices. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D claims that the UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights. Now, I know that the UK has a Bill of Rights, but I think it's from 1689, and it's more about limiting the power of the monarchy and establishing certain rights for Parliament. I don't think it serves as the foundation of the entire constitution. Plus, the UK also has the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights, but again, I don't think that's the base of the constitution.\n\nLet me consider each option again. Option A seems too narrow because it only mentions the sovereign, ignoring Parliament and other sources of power. Option B might be misrepresenting the relationship between the judiciary and Parliament in the UK. Option C aligns with what I know about the UK Constitution being unwritten and sourced from multiple places. Option D doesn't seem accurate because the constitution isn't based solely on a Bill of Rights.\n\nI think the best answer is C: The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources. This reflects the reality that the UK Constitution is not contained in a single document but is instead composed of various statutes, common law, conventions, and practices that have developed over time.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check option B. Does the UK judiciary have the power to overturn acts of Parliament? From what I know, parliamentary sovereignty is a key principle of the UK constitution, meaning that Parliament can make or unmake any law, and the courts cannot override its legislation. However, with the Human Rights Act 1998, courts can make declarations of incompatibility, which suggest that a law doesn't comply with the Human Rights Act, but they can't actually strike it down. So, in that sense, the judiciary doesn't have the power to overturn acts of Parliament. Therefore, option B seems incorrect.\n\nOption A is also problematic because it suggests that the sovereign is the only source of power, which isn't the case. Power in the UK is distributed among the monarch, Parliament, and the judiciary, with Parliament being the supreme legislative body.\n\nOption D is unlikely because, as I mentioned, the UK doesn't have a single founding document like a constitution, and the Bill of Rights is just one part of the constitutional framework.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe that option C is the correct answer: The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
