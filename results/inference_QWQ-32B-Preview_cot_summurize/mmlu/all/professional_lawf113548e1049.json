                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this problem. So, there's a doctor who owns a two-acre tract just outside the city. She divides it into 12 lots, sells 11 of them with deeds that say the property can only be used for single-family residences, and keeps one for herself. So far, so good.\n\nThen, two years later, all the other lot owners have built houses on their lots, and the doctor digs a well on her property to supply water to all the lot owners. A year after that, a veterinarian who lives on a lot adjacent to the doctor's digs her own well, which diverts water from the doctor's well, leaving the doctor without water.\n\nNow, the doctor sues the veterinarian. The question is, what remedy, if any, is available to the doctor?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. An injunction should be decreed enjoining the veterinarian from using her well.\n\nB. The doctor should be entitled to recover money damages from the veterinarian.\n\nC. The veterinarian should be required to supply water to the doctor.\n\nD. There is no remedy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal principles involved here. It seems like this might be a case involving property rights, easements, or perhaps nuisance.\n\nThe doctor had a well that was supplying water to all the lot owners. Then the veterinarian dug her own well, which diverted water from the doctor's well. So, it sounds like the veterinarian's well is interfering with the doctor's well.\n\nI need to think about whether the doctor has a right to the water from her well that isn't interfered with by the veterinarian.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's such a thing as a water rights issue here. In some places, water rights are regulated by law, and someone diverting water can be liable.\n\nAlso, since the veterinarian's lot is adjacent to the doctor's, maybe there are some property law principles that apply here, like lateral support or something like that.\n\nWait, lateral support is more about the physical support of the land, not about water diversion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a case of nuisance. The veterinarian's well is causing harm to the doctor's well by diverting the water, which could be seen as a nuisance.\n\nIf it's a nuisance, then the doctor might be entitled to an injunction to stop the veterinarian from using her well, or to money damages for the harm caused.\n\nLooking back at the options, that would make options A and B possible remedies.\n\nOption C is a bit unusual. Requiring the veterinarian to supply water to the doctor seems like an equitable remedy, but it might not be straightforward.\n\nOption D suggests there's no remedy, which might be possible if there's no legal basis for the doctor's claim.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe there's an easement involved. The doctor was supplying water to all the lot owners, so perhaps there was an implied easement for water supply.\n\nBut the veterinarian is on a different, adjacent lot, not one of the subdivided lots. So, perhaps the easement argument doesn't directly apply here.\n\nWait, the veterinarian's lot is adjacent to the doctor's lot, but it's not one of the 12 lots in the subdivision. It might be a separate parcel altogether.\n\nIn that case, the deeds with the single-family residence restriction don't apply to the veterinarian's lot, since it's adjacent, not part of the subdivision.\n\nSo, the veterinarian is not bound by the restrictions in the subdivision deeds.\n\nNow, back to the water issue. If the veterinarian's well is diverting water from the doctor's well, is there a legal remedy?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, water rights are based on the principle of prior appropriation, where the first person to use a water source has priority rights over later users.\n\nIn other places, it might be based on riparian rights, where owners of land adjacent to a water source have the right to use the water.\n\nBut in this case, it's a well, so it's groundwater, which might be subject to different rules.\n\nI think in many places, groundwater is considered subject to the rule of capture, meaning that whoever can capture the water by digging a well has the right to use it, without liability to others whose wells might be affected.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions to this rule, especially if the veterinarian's well is causing harm to the doctor's well.\n\nAlternatively, there might be statutory laws that regulate well drilling and protect existing water supplies.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the doctor could seek an injunction to prevent the veterinarian from using her well, on the grounds that it's causing harm to the doctor's well.\n\nOr, the doctor might be entitled to money damages for the loss of water supply.\n\nOption C, requiring the veterinarian to supply water to the doctor, seems like a possible equitable remedy, but it might be less common.\n\nOption D, no remedy, might be possible if there's no legal basis for the doctor's claim.\n\nConsidering that, I think options A and B are both possible remedies, depending on the specific legal circumstances.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the remedy, if any, that is available.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is B, money damages, because it's a more standard remedy in cases where harm is caused, and it might be difficult to get an injunction, especially if the veterinarian has a legal right to dig her own well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both A and B are possible, but since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps only one option is correct.\n\nLooking back at the options, only A and B seem plausible.\n\nOption C seems a bit too specific and perhaps not a standard remedy.\n\nOption D would mean there's no legal remedy, which might not be the case if there's a cause of action for nuisance or some other tort.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is B, money damages, because the doctor can claim compensation for the loss of water supply due to the veterinarian's well.\n\nAn injunction might be more difficult to obtain, especially if the veterinarian has a legal right to her own well.\n\nTherefore, the doctor should be entitled to recover money damages from the veterinarian.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
