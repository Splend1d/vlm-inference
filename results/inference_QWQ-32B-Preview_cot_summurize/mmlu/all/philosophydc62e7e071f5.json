                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what Jeremy Bentham, the philosopher, thought about utilitarian calculations. So, utilitarianism is a theory that says we should do whatever brings the most happiness or pleasure to the greatest number of people. Bentham was one of the key figures in developing this idea.\n\nNow, the question is asking about his view on how these utilitarian calculations should be used in everyday decision-making. There are four options:\n\nA. Should be performed before each action.\n\nB. Don't need to be done before each action, but should always be kept in mind.\n\nC. Are just a formal tool and don't really apply in practice.\n\nD. Are fundamentally flawed.\n\nI need to think about what Bentham actually believed. I remember that he thought happiness could be measured, and he even came up with something called the \"felicific calculus,\" which is a way to calculate the pleasure and pain that an action would produce.\n\nSo, option A says that these calculations should be done before every action. That seems a bit extreme. Imagine having to calculate the potential happiness of every little thing you do, like deciding what to eat or what to wear. That would be time-consuming and impractical.\n\nOption B suggests that while you don't have to do the calculations every time, you should always keep the principle in mind. That sounds more reasonable. It allows for practicality in everyday life but still guides your decisions towards maximizing happiness.\n\nOption C says that utilitarian calculations are just a formal device with no practical use. But Bentham was known for trying to make ethics more scientific and measurable, so I don't think he would see it as without practical application.\n\nOption D claims that utilitarian calculations are fundamentally flawed. But if he thought that, it's unlikely he would have spent so much time developing the felicific calculus.\n\nLooking back, Bentham believed that moral decisions should aim to maximize utility, which is the balance of pleasure over pain. He thought that this could be calculated to some extent, but he also recognized that in practice, it's not always feasible to do detailed calculations for every decision.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is the best answer: utilitarian calculations don't need to be performed before each action, but the principle should always be kept in mind. This way, people can make decisions that generally promote the greatest happiness without getting bogged down in constant calculations.\n\nMoreover, Bentham's felicific calculus was more of a theoretical framework to understand how to measure utility, rather than a practical tool to be used in every situation. So, expecting people to perform these calculations before every action might not have been his intention.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B: need not be performed before each action, but should always be kept in mind.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
