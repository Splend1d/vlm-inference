                    "text": "So I have this problem: find the length of the curve y = ln x between the points where y = 1/2 and y = 1. The options are A. 0.53, B. 0.86, C. 1.18, and D. 1.36. I'm a bit rusty on curve lengths, but I remember that the formula for the arc length of a function y = f(x) from x = a to x = b is:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2} \\, dx \\]\n\nFirst, I need to express the curve in terms of x, since the formula is in terms of x. Given y = ln x, I can solve for x in terms of y:\n\n\\[ x = e^y \\]\n\nSo, the curve is x = e^y. Now, I need to find the arc length with respect to y. The formula for arc length in terms of y is:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{c}^{d} \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{dx}{dy}\\right)^2} \\, dy \\]\n\nGiven that, I need to find dx/dy. Since x = e^y,\n\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dy} = e^y \\]\n\nSo, the integrand becomes:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 + (e^y)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + e^{2y}} \\]\n\nTherefore, the arc length is:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{1/2}^{1} \\sqrt{1 + e^{2y}} \\, dy \\]\n\nThis integral looks a bit tricky. Maybe there's a substitution that can simplify it. Let's try letting u = e^y, so du = e^y dy, or dy = du/u.\n\nWhen y = 1/2, u = e^{1/2}, and when y = 1, u = e.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{e^{1/2}}^{e} \\sqrt{1 + u^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{u} \\, du = \\int_{e^{1/2}}^{e} \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + u^2}}{u} \\, du \\]\n\nHmm, this doesn't seem much simpler. Maybe another substitution? Let's try a hyperbolic substitution since sqrt(1 + u^2) suggests a connection to hyperbolic functions.\n\nLet u = sinh t, then du = cosh t dt, and sqrt(1 + u^2) = sqrt(1 + sinh^2 t) = cosh t.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\frac{cosh t}{sinh t} \\cdot cosh t \\, dt = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\frac{cosh^2 t}{sinh t} \\, dt \\]\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a better way. Let's consider the original integral:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{1/2}^{1} \\sqrt{1 + e^{2y}} \\, dy \\]\n\nPerhaps integrating by parts could help. Let's set:\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe rationalizing the integrand or using a different substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expressing sqrt(1 + e^{2y}) in a different form. Let's see:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 + e^{2y}} = \\sqrt{e^{2y} + 1} = e^y \\sqrt{1 + e^{-2y}} \\]\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{1/2}^{1} e^y \\sqrt{1 + e^{-2y}} \\, dy \\]\n\nThis still seems complicated. Maybe expanding sqrt(1 + e^{-2y}) as a series, but that might not be practical for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the substitution v = e^y, so dv = e^y dy, but that seems similar to what I did earlier.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can use the substitution u = sqrt(1 + e^{2y}), then u^2 = 1 + e^{2y}, so 2u du = 2 e^{2y} dy, or du = (e^{2y}/u) dy.\n\nHmm, this seems circular. Not sure if that helps.\n\nLet me try to express dy in terms of u. From u = sqrt(1 + e^{2y}), then e^{2y} = u^2 - 1, so 2 e^{2y} dy = 2 u du, hence dy = (u du)/(e^{2y}) = (u du)/(u^2 - 1).\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{u_1}^{u_2} u \\cdot \\frac{u}{u^2 - 1} \\, du = \\int_{u_1}^{u_2} \\frac{u^2}{u^2 - 1} \\, du \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{u_1}^{u_2} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{u^2 - 1}\\right) \\, du = \\int_{u_1}^{u_2} 1 \\, du + \\int_{u_1}^{u_2} \\frac{1}{u^2 - 1} \\, du \\]\n\nThe first integral is just u evaluated from u1 to u2. The second integral can be solved using partial fractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{u^2 - 1} = \\frac{1}{(u - 1)(u + 1)} = \\frac{A}{u - 1} + \\frac{B}{u + 1} \\]\n\nSolving for A and B:\n\n1 = A(u + 1) + B(u - 1)\n\nSet u = 1: 1 = 2A => A = 1/2\n\nSet u = -1: 1 = -2B => B = -1/2\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{1}{u^2 - 1} \\, du = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\frac{1}{u - 1} \\, du - \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\frac{1}{u + 1} \\, du = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left| \\frac{u - 1}{u + 1} \\right| + C \\]\n\nTherefore, the arc length is:\n\n\\[ L = \\left[ u + \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left| \\frac{u - 1}{u + 1} \\right| \\right]_{u_1}^{u_2} \\]\n\nNow, recall that u = sqrt(1 + e^{2y}), so we need to evaluate this from y = 1/2 to y = 1, which corresponds to u1 = sqrt(1 + e^{1}) and u2 = sqrt(1 + e^{2}).\n\nWait, actually, u = sqrt(1 + e^{2y}), so u1 = sqrt(1 + e^{1}) and u2 = sqrt(1 + e^{2}).\n\nBut to make it clearer, let's express u in terms of y and then substitute back.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this integral. Maybe using numerical methods or looking for a different substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for small values, e^{2y} dominates, but in this case, y is between 0.5 and 1, so e^{2y} is between e and e^2, which are approximately 2.718 and 7.389, respectively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify the integrand.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the substitution t = e^y, then dt = e^y dy, or dy = dt/t.\n\nWhen y = 1/2, t = e^{1/2}, and when y = 1, t = e.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{e^{1/2}}^{e} \\sqrt{1 + t^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{t} \\, dt = \\int_{e^{1/2}}^{e} \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + t^2}}{t} \\, dt \\]\n\nThis looks similar to what I had before. Maybe I can use another substitution here, like t = tan \u03b8, but that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t = sinh \u03b8, since sqrt(1 + t^2) = cosh \u03b8.\n\nSo, let t = sinh \u03b8, then dt = cosh \u03b8 d\u03b8.\n\nWhen t = e^{1/2}, \u03b8 = arcsinh(e^{1/2}), and when t = e, \u03b8 = arcsinh(e).\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\frac{\\cosh \u03b8}{\\sinh \u03b8} \\cdot \\cosh \u03b8 \\, d\u03b8 = \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\frac{\\cosh^2 \u03b8}{\\sinh \u03b8} \\, d\u03b8 \\]\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's an identity I can use for cosh^2 \u03b8.\n\nRecall that cosh^2 \u03b8 = (1 + cosh 2\u03b8)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\frac{1 + \\cosh 2\u03b8}{2 \\sinh \u03b8} \\, d\u03b8 = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\frac{1}{\\sinh \u03b8} \\, d\u03b8 + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\frac{\\cosh 2\u03b8}{\\sinh \u03b8} \\, d\u03b8 \\]\n\nThis seems even more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nLet me try to evaluate the integral numerically. Given the options are numerical values, perhaps I can approximate the integral.\n\nThe integral is:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{1/2}^{1} \\sqrt{1 + e^{2y}} \\, dy \\]\n\nI can use numerical integration techniques like the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule to approximate this integral.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the integrand at y = 0.5 and y = 1.\n\nAt y = 0.5:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 + e^{1}} = \\sqrt{1 + 2.718} \\approx \\sqrt{3.718} \\approx 1.928 \\]\n\nAt y = 1:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 + e^{2}} = \\sqrt{1 + 7.389} \\approx \\sqrt{8.389} \\approx 2.896 \\]\n\nNow, using the trapezoidal rule:\n\n\\[ L \\approx \\frac{1 - 0.5}{2} \\left( 1.928 + 2.896 \\right) = 0.25 \\times 4.824 = 1.206 \\]\n\nThis approximation gives 1.206, which is closest to option C. 1.18. But maybe I can get a better approximation.\n\nLet's try Simpson's rule, which is more accurate. Simpson's rule for two intervals is:\n\n\\[ L \\approx \\frac{1 - 0.5}{6} \\left( f(0.5) + 4 f(0.75) + f(1) \\right) \\]\n\nI need to find f(0.75):\n\n\\[ f(0.75) = \\sqrt{1 + e^{1.5}} \\]\n\ne^{1.5} \u2248 4.4817\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ f(0.75) = \\sqrt{1 + 4.4817} = \\sqrt{5.4817} \\approx 2.341 \\]\n\nNow, applying Simpson's rule:\n\n\\[ L \\approx \\frac{0.5}{6} \\left( 1.928 + 4 \\times 2.341 + 2.896 \\right) = \\frac{0.5}{6} \\left( 1.928 + 9.364 + 2.896 \\right) = \\frac{0.5}{6} \\times 14.188 \\approx 1.182 \\]\n\nThis gives approximately 1.182, which matches option C. 1.18.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I could use more intervals in Simpson's rule, but given the options, 1.18 seems to be the correct choice.\n\nTherefore, the length of the curve y = ln x between y = 1/2 and y = 1 is approximately 1.18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.18} \\]"
