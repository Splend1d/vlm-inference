                    "text": "The Federal National Mortgage Association is known by the nickname \"Fannie Mae.\" So, the correct answer is D. Fannie Mae.\n\nTo provide some additional context, Fannie Mae was established during the Great Depression to expand the flow of mortgage money, particularly in times of economic stress. It does this by purchasing mortgages from lenders, pooling them, and selling them as mortgage-backed securities on the secondary mortgage market. This process provides lenders with more funds to make new loans, thereby increasing the availability of housing finance.\n\nAnother similar entity is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as \"Freddie Mac,\" which performs a similar function in the mortgage market. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play crucial roles in the U.S. housing finance system.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Fannie Mae:** Federal National Mortgage Association\n\n- **Freddie Mac:** Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\n\n- Both are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that support the mortgage market.\n\n- They purchase mortgages from lenders, package them into securities, and sell them to investors.\n\n- This process increases the liquidity in the mortgage market and helps to lower mortgage rates for borrowers.\n\n**Other Options Explained:**\n\n- **A. Morty:** This is not a recognized nickname for any major financial institution.\n\n- **B. FEMA:** This stands for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is an agency of the Department of Homeland Security responsible for responding to disasters and helping communities recover.\n\n- **C. Freddie Mac:** As mentioned, this is the nickname for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, which is similar to Fannie Mae but a separate entity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUnderstanding the nicknames and functions of these institutions can be helpful in grasping the structure of the U.S. housing finance system. Fannie Mae, in particular, plays a vital role in ensuring that mortgage funds are available to homebuyers, especially during economic downturns.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) official website\n\n- Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) official website\n\n- U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\n\n**References:**\n\n- Fannie Mae.
