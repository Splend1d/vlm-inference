I need to choose the correct name from these options:\n\nA. dibromotrichloropropane\n\nB. dibromotrichloropentane\n\nC. 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane\n\nD. 2,3-bromochloropentane\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to name organic compounds, specifically halogenated alkanes. I remember that the name should include the root name based on the number of carbon atoms, followed by the positions and names of the halogen substituents.\n\nLooking at the structure: CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3\n\n- It has 5 carbon atoms, so the root name should be \"pentane.\"\n\n- There's a bromine atom on the second carbon and a chlorine atom on the third carbon.\n\nSo, the name should reflect that there's a bromine at position 2 and a chlorine at position 3 of pentane.\n\nOption A: dibromotrichloropropane\n\n- This suggests two bromines and three chlorines in a propane structure, which doesn't match our structure.\n\nOption B: dibromotrichloropentane\n\n- Again, suggests two bromines and three chlorines in a pentane structure. But our structure has only one bromine and one chlorine.\n\nOption C: 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane\n\n- This seems to correctly indicate a bromine at position 2 and a chlorine at position 3 of pentane.\n\nOption D: 2,3-bromochloropentane\n\n- This is a bit ambiguous. It might mean that positions 2 and 3 have both a bromine and a chlorine, but in reality, position 2 has a bromine and position 3 has a chlorine.\n\nBetween C and D, option C seems clearer and more standard in IUPAC nomenclature.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- The parent chain has 5 carbons: pentane.\n\n- Substituents: bromine at position 2 and chlorine at position 3.\n\n- So, 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane makes sense.\n\nOption D: 2,3-bromochloropentane could be interpreted as having both bromine and chlorine on positions 2 and 3, which isn't the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
