                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character did something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I could not see to help the stranded swimmer.\"\n\nHmm, this seems a bit unclear. Does it mean the person couldn't see the swimmer, so they didn't know to help? Or does it mean they saw the swimmer was stranded but chose not to help? The wording is a little confusing.\n\nIf it's the first interpretation, that the person couldn't see the swimmer, so they didn't help because they didn't know about it, then maybe they didn't do anything wrong. They couldn't see, so they couldn't assist.\n\nBut if it means they saw the swimmer was stranded and chose not to help, that would be different. In that case, not helping someone in distress could be considered morally wrong, especially if helping was within their capabilities and didn't put them at risk.\n\nGiven that, I think we need to assume that \"could not see\" means they were unable to see the swimmer, perhaps due to poor visibility or some other reason. So, they didn't help because they didn't know about the situation. In that case, they didn't do anything wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I made sure to take some hotel stationery as a souvenir.\"\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. The person took some hotel stationery, like pens or notepads, to keep as a souvenir.\n\nIs this morally wrong? Well, hotel stationery is typically provided for guests to use during their stay, but taking it as a souvenir might be seen as inappropriate or even theft, depending on the hotel's policies.\n\nSome people might think it's harmless and that hotels expect guests to take a few items with them. Others might consider it wrong because it's essentially taking something that doesn't belong to them without permission.\n\nIn the US, generally, taking small items like stationery from a hotel is considered tacky or disrespectful, but not necessarily morally wrong on the same level as, say, stealing valuable items.\n\nHowever, since the question asks about ordinary moral standards, and considering that taking hotel property without permission could be seen as theft, which is morally wrong, I would lean towards saying it is wrong.\n\nBut maybe it's a gray area. Some might argue that taking a single pen or a notepad isn't a big deal, while others might say it's still wrong.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's not clearly morally wrong, but more of a minor infraction.\n\nBut the options provided are \"Wrong\" and \"Not wrong,\" so I need to choose one for each scenario.\n\nFor Scenario 1, if \"could not see\" means they couldn't see the swimmer and thus didn't help because they didn't know, then it's not wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, taking hotel stationery as a souvenir might be considered wrong by some, but perhaps not universally seen as morally wrong.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier thoughts, Scenario 1 might not be wrong, and Scenario 2 might be somewhat wrong, but not entirely clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure about Scenario 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe neither is clearly morally wrong, so D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both are wrong in some way.\n\nWait, Scenario 1: if they saw the swimmer was stranded and didn't help, that would be wrong.\n\nBut the wording is \"could not see to help,\" which might mean they were unable to see, so they didn't help.\n\nIn that case, it's not their fault, so not wrong.\n\nScenario 2: taking hotel stationery might be considered wrong, but perhaps not clearly so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, taking hotel stationery is not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one is wrong and one is not.\n\nI think I need to consider what ordinary moral standards would dictate in each situation.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if they couldn't see the swimmer, so they didn't help, that seems acceptable. They didn't know, so they couldn't help.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking hotel stationery might be seen as acceptable, as it's common for guests to take small items.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
