The options are a bit complex, so I need to think carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the 'broad church' of security studies means. I think it refers to an inclusive approach that encompasses various perspectives and definitions of security beyond the traditional state-centric view. So, it's about expanding the scope of security studies to include different referent objects and threats.\n\nOption A says: \"To question the referent object, to question the traditional conception of military security as paramount to the state, and to change the way in which security is studied.\" This seems relevant because it mentions questioning the traditional view of military security and changing the study of security, which aligns with a broader approach.\n\nOption B: \"To address security from a positivist perspective, challenging the dominance of traditional security paradigms, and shifting academic attention to the individual as a referent point.\" This also sounds interesting. It mentions challenging traditional paradigms and shifting focus to the individual, which is a broader perspective.\n\nOption C: \"To question the dominance of liberalism and realism in the international system, to apply critical knowledge to the security dilemma faced by states and to redress the power imbalances that lead to intra-state conflict.\" This option focuses on questioning dominant theories and addressing power imbalances, which could be part of a broader security studies agenda.\n\nOption D: \"To account for all possible referent objects and expand the definition of security so far as to allow for a broadening of the school to encompass any agent that threatens those referent objects.\" This seems directly in line with the idea of a 'broad church' by inclusive of various referent objects and threats.\n\nNow, I need to recall what Krause and Williams say about this. I remember that they argue for a inclusive approach in security studies that accommodates diverse perspectives and definitions of security. They emphasize the need to consider various referent objects beyond just the state, such as individuals, groups, and even non-human entities like the environment.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to capture this idea most accurately. It talks about accounting for all possible referent objects and expanding the definition of security to include any agent that threatens those objects. This aligns well with the notion of a 'broad church' that encompasses a wide range of security concerns and perspectives.\n\nOption A is also attractive because it mentions questioning the traditional conception of military security and changing the way security is studied. While this is important, it seems more focused on methodology and challenging established norms, whereas option D is more about the scope and inclusivity of security studies.\n\nOption B mentions positivist perspective, which might not fully align with Krause and Williams' view, as they may not necessarily advocate for a positivist approach. Also, shifting focus to the individual is just one aspect of broadening security studies, but option D seems more comprehensive.\n\nOption C focuses on questioning liberalism and realism and addressing power imbalances. While these are important aspects, it seems more oriented towards political theory and less towards the broadening of security studies as a discipline.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D. It most accurately reflects the agenda that would attract scholars to the 'broad church' of security studies by emphasizing the inclusion of all possible referent objects and expanding the definition of security to cover a wide range of threats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
