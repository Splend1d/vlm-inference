                    "text": "Let's see what the 1976 Tarasoff decision is all about. I remember it's a significant case in psychology and law, but I need to recall the specifics.\n\nOption A mentions the right of a parent to inspect and request modifications to their child\u2019s school records. That sounds familiar, like it's related to education law, maybe something like the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). But I think that's not directly from the Tarasoff decision.\n\nOption B talks about a psychologist\u2019s \u201cduty to protect\u201d the intended victim of a therapy client. Hmm, that rings a bell. Tarasoff is often associated with the duty to warn or protect in cases where a client poses a threat to others. Let me think about that.\n\nOption C mentions the \u201c80% rule\u201d as a standard for determining the fairness of a selection test or other employment procedure. That seems related to employment discrimination and validation of selection procedures, perhaps under the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. Not sure if that's connected to Tarasoff.\n\nOption D is about a psychologist\u2019s duty to report suspected or known cases of child abuse. That sounds more like mandatory reporting laws, which do exist, but again, I'm not sure if Tarasoff is directly establishing that.\n\nLet me try to recall the details of the Tarasoff case. It involved a therapist and a client where the client made threats against another individual, and the question was whether the therapist had a duty to warn the potential victim or take steps to protect them.\n\nIn 1976, the California Supreme Court ruled in Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California that therapists have a duty to warn and protect potential victims from their clients' threats of harm. This established the concept of duty to protect in psychology and related fields.\n\nSo, based on that, option B seems to be the correct answer: a psychologist\u2019s \u201cduty to protect\u201d the intended victim of a therapy client.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption A is likely related to educational records and privacy, which is an important area but not directly from Tarasoff.\n\nOption C's 80% rule is associated with employment testing and adverse impact, which is part of employment discrimination law but not connected to Tarasoff.\n\nOption D pertains to reporting child abuse, which is mandated by law in many jurisdictions, but again, not directly from the Tarasoff decision.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. the psychologist\u2019s \u201cduty to protect\u201d the intended victim of a therapy client.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
