                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about intraperiod income tax allocation. So, the question is: \"Which of the following items is not subject to the application of intraperiod income tax allocation?\" and the options are:\n\nA. Discontinued operations\n\nB. Income from continuing operations\n\nC. Extraordinary gains and losses\n\nD. Operating income.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what intraperiod income tax allocation is. From what I recall, it's a method used in financial accounting to allocate income taxes to different components of income in the income statement. This is important because different parts of the income statement might have different tax treatments, and this allocation helps provide a clearer picture of the tax effects associated with each component.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Discontinued operations. Discontinued operations are revenues and expenses related to a part of the business that has been sold, abandoned, or is in the process of being disposed of. According to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), taxes related to discontinued operations are allocated separately from the taxes on continuing operations. So, it seems like discontinued operations do have their own tax allocation, which might mean they are subject to intraperiod tax allocation.\n\nOption B: Income from continuing operations. This is the core part of the income statement that includes the revenues and expenses from the company's ongoing business activities. Income from continuing operations is typically the primary component for which intraperiod tax allocation is applied, as it represents the normal operations of the business.\n\nOption C: Extraordinary gains and losses. These are unusual and infrequent events that are material in amount. Examples might include gains from expropriation settlements or losses from natural disasters. GAAP requires that these be presented net of tax, meaning that any taxes associated with extraordinary items are allocated to those specific items.\n\nOption D: Operating income. Operating income is the profit from a company's core business operations, excluding interest and taxes. It's essentially revenue minus operating expenses. I need to think about whether taxes are allocated specifically to operating income or if it's combined with other components.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to recall the structure of the income statement and how taxes are allocated across different components.\n\nTypically, the income statement is structured in a way that shows:\n\n1. Income from continuing operations\n\n2. Discontinued operations\n\n3. Extraordinary items\n\n4. Prior period adjustments\n\n5. Cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFor each of these components, taxes are allocated based on the income or loss associated with that component. This is what intraperiod tax allocation is all about: assigning the appropriate amount of tax to each component of income.\n\nSo, considering that, let's revisit the options.\n\nOption A: Discontinued operations\u2014yes, taxes are allocated to this component.\n\nOption B: Income from continuing operations\u2014definitely, this is the main component for tax allocation.\n\nOption C: Extraordinary gains and losses\u2014yes, taxes are allocated to these items as well.\n\nOption D: Operating income\u2014now, operating income is part of income from continuing operations, but I'm not sure if taxes are allocated directly to operating income or to the overall continuing operations.\n\nWait, perhaps operating income is before non-operating items like interest income and expense, and taxes are allocated to income from continuing operations, which includes operating income and non-operating items.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe operating income is not a separate component for which taxes are allocated independently.\n\nIn other words, taxes are allocated to income from continuing operations as a whole, which includes operating income and non-operating items, but operating income itself doesn't have a separate tax allocation.\n\n\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0cdiscontinued operations, extraordinary items\u7b49\u90fd\u6709\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u7a0e\u6b3e\u5206\u914d\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u72ec\u5e94\u7528\u671f\u4e2d\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5206\u914d\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u3002\n\n\u518d\u770b\u770b\u6559\u6750\u6216\u8005\u76f8\u5173\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u80fd\u66f4\u660e\u786e\u3002\n\n\u6839\u636e\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e00\u822c\u516c\u8ba4\u4f1a\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff08US GAAP\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fFASB ASC 740 \u201c\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u201d\uff0c\u89c4\u5b9a\u4e86\u671f\u4e2d\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\n\n\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5e94\u8be5\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6536\u5165\u62a5\u8868\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5982\u6301\u7eed\u7ecf\u8425\u3001\u7ec8\u6b62\u7ecf\u8425\u3001\u975e\u5e38\u9879\u76ee\u7b49\u3002\n\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u5165\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u6536\u5165\u51cf\u53bb\u8425\u4e1a\u8d39\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u8425\u4e1a\u6027\u6536\u5165\u548c\u652f\u51fa\uff0c\u5982\u5229\u606f\u6536\u5165\u548c\u652f\u51fa\u3001\u80a1\u606f\u6536\u5165\u7b49\u3002\n\n\u5728\u5206\u914d\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u7ecf\u8425\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6536\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u914d\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u72ec\u5e94\u7528\u671f\u4e2d\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5206\u914d\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u3002\n\n\u518d\u770b\u770b\u5176\u4ed6\u9009\u9879\uff1a\n\nA. \u7ec8\u6b62\u7ecf\u8425\uff1a\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5355\u72ec\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7a0e\u6b3e\u3002\n\nB. \u6301\u7eed\u7ecf\u8425\u7684\u6536\u5165\uff1a\u662f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u8fd9\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n\nC. \u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u4e5f\u662f\u5355\u72ec\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u7a0e\u6b3e\u3002\n\nD. \u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u5165\uff1a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5305\u542b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7ecf\u8425\u7684\u6536\u5165\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5355\u72ec\u5206\u914d\u7a0e\u6b3e\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u72ec\u5e94\u7528\u671f\u4e2d\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5206\u914d\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u80fd\u662fD. \u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u5165\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u67e5\u627e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4f1a\u8ba1\u51c6\u5219\u6216\u8005\u6559\u6750\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\n\n\u5047\u8bbe\u6211\u6709\u4e00\u672c\u4f1a\u8ba1\u6559\u6750\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u67e5\u627e\u201c\u671f\u4e2d\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5206\u914d\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ae0\u8282\u3002\n\n\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4f1a\u8ba1\u6559\u6750\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f1a\u89e3\u91ca\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6536\u5165\u62a5\u8868\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\n\n\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728FASB ASC 740\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c4\u5b9a\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u5982\u4f55\u62a5\u544a\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8981\u6c42\u5c06\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6301\u7eed\u7ecf\u8425\u3001\u7ec8\u6b62\u7ecf\u8425\u3001\u975e\u5e38\u9879\u76ee\u7b49\u3002\n\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u5165\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5728\u7ecf\u8425\u4e1a\u7ee9\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5355\u72ec\u5206\u914d\u7a0e\u6b3e\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5408\u7406\u5730\u8ba4\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u72ec\u5e94\u7528\u671f\u4e2d\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5206\u914d\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u662fD. \u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u5165\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
