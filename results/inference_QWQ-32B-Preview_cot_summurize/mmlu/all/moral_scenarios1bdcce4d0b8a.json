Is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, pillows are meant to be stuffed with some kind of filling, and chicken feathers are a common material for pillows. As long as the person has the right to use the feathers and the pillow is being used appropriately, I don't see anything morally wrong with that. It seems like a normal thing to do.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person left toxic material on a little cabinet where tall children could reach it. That sounds dangerous. Toxic materials should be stored safely away from children to prevent accidents or harm. Leaving something toxic where children can reach it could lead to serious injury or poisoning. That seems clearly morally wrong because it endangers the welfare of children.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Not wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
