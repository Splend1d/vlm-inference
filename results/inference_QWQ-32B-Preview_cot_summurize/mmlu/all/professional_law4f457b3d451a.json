                    "text": "I've got this question about federal court procedures, specifically regarding interrogatories in a civil case. Let me try to wrap my head around it.\n\nSo, the plaintiff's attorney served the defendant with the summons, complaint, and 25 interrogatories. The interrogatories are asking about the defendant's contentions in the case and need to be answered within 30 days after service. Now, the question is, which of these grounds is the defendant likely to succeed on in getting a protective order?\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Interrogatories are only proper to discover facts, not contentions.\" Hmm, I think interrogatories can ask about a party's contentions, but maybe there's a limit. I recall that Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows interrogatories to ask about any matter that can be inquired into under Rule 26, which is about the scope of discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) says parties may obtain discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case. So, asking about contentions might be okay, but perhaps there's more to it.\n\nOption B: \"Interrogatories may not be served until an answer to the complaint is filed.\" I don't think that's correct. According to Rule 33, interrogatories can be served along with the summons and complaint. In fact, the rules encourage early discovery, so I don't see why interrogatories couldn't be served right away.\n\nOption C: \"Interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan.\" Again, I don't recall any rule that requires this sequence. Rule 26(f) does require the parties to confer and plan for discovery, but that's supposed to happen after the complaint is served, and before any discovery is conducted, but I don't think it prohibits serving interrogatories before that conference.\n\nOption D: \"The interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\" Now, this seems promising. Rule 33(a)(2) states that without the court's permission or a stipulation of the parties, a party may serve no more than 25 written interrogatories, including all discrete subparts. So, if there are more than 25 interrogatories, that could be a problem.\n\nWait a minute, the plaintiff served 25 interrogatories. Does that mean option D is incorrect because it's exactly 25? But I need to check the rule carefully. Rule 33(a)(2) says \"no more than 25 written interrogatories...including all discrete subparts.\" So, if there are 25 interrogatories, but each has multiple subparts, those subparts count towards the total number.\n\nBut in this case, it just says \"25 interrogatories,\" without mentioning subparts. So, perhaps it's exactly 25, and no permission is needed. Maybe option D isn't the right answer.\n\nLet me go back to option A. Maybe that's the key here. Can interrogatories ask about contentions?\n\nRule 33(a)(1) says that an interrogatory can ask about any matters that can be inquired into under Rule 26(b), subject to the limitations in Rule 33(a)(2)-(4). Rule 26(b)(1) allows discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense. So, asking about contentions might be allowed.\n\nBut perhaps there's a limit to how broad the interrogatories can be. Rule 33(d) says that if an interrogatory calls for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, the responding party may answer in terms of opinion or contention or may state that it will invoke trial privileges if the matter is raised at trial.\n\nSo, it seems like asking about contentions is permissible, but perhaps the way it's phrased could be problematic.\n\nWait, maybe option A is correct because interrogatories should be about facts, not contentions. But according to Rule 33(d), you can ask about contentions, but the responding party has certain options in how to answer.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that asking about contentions might be too broad or invasive, and the court might grant a protective order on that basis.\n\nOption B seems incorrect because, as I recall, there's no requirement that interrogatories can only be served after the answer is filed.\n\nOption C also seems misplaced because, although parties are supposed to confer and plan discovery, I don't think there's a prohibition on serving interrogatories before that conference takes place.\n\nOption D might not apply here since exactly 25 interrogatories were served, and no mention is made of subparts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the time frame for answering is the issue. The interrogatories state that they are to be answered within 30 days after service. But according to Rule 33(b)(2), the time to answer interrogatories is 30 days after service, so that seems okay.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if serving interrogatories along with the summons and complaint is proper. Rule 4(m) discusses the time for serving the summons and complaint, but I don't think it addresses serving discovery at the same time.\n\nActually, Rule 4(m) is about the time for serving the summons and complaint, not about serving discovery documents. Rule 33 doesn't specify when interrogatories can be served, other than the time limits for answering them.\n\nI think the key here is option D. Even though exactly 25 interrogatories were served, if any of them have subparts, that could exceed the limit. But since the question doesn't mention subparts, I'll assume there are no subparts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court has local rules that limit the number of interrogatories that can be served initially. But since the question doesn't mention any local rules, I'll assume that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is option A: interrogatories are only proper to discover facts, not contentions. Even though Rule 33 allows for interrogatories about contentions, the defendant might argue that asking about contentions is improper, and the court might agree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the defendant can argue that the interrogatories are overly broad or burdensome, which would fall under Rule 26(c), allowing for a protective order.\n\nBut none of the options specifically mention overbreadth or burden. Option A might be the closest, as it suggests that interrogatories are only for discovering facts, not contentions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the defendant can argue that serving interrogatories along with the summons and complaint is too early, before the conference required by Rule 26(f). But again, I don't think the rules prohibit that.\n\nWait, Rule 26(d)(1) does impose some limitations on when discovery can begin. It says that a party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f), except in a proceeding in which Rule 26(f) does not require the parties to confer, or when authorized by these rules or by order of the court.\n\nSo, perhaps serving interrogatories before the Rule 26(f) conference would be improper.\n\nBut Rule 26(f) requires the parties to confer and plan for discovery, usually within 21 days after any defendant has been served with the complaint.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff served the defendant with the summons, complaint, and interrogatories at the same time. So, perhaps the Rule 26(f) conference hasn't occurred yet.\n\nIf that's the case, then serving interrogatories before the conference might violate Rule 26(d)(1), making option C potentially correct.\n\nWait, option C says: \"Interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan.\" That sounds a lot like what Rule 26(d)(1) requires.\n\nSo, if the parties haven't yet conferred as required by Rule 26(f), then serving interrogatories might be premature, and the defendant could seek a protective order on that basis.\n\nThis seems like a strong argument.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option D is still the best answer because even though only 25 interrogatories were served, if any of them have multiple subparts, that could exceed the limit.\n\nBut again, the question doesn't mention subparts, so I'll assume there are none.\n\nComparing options A, C, and D, I think option C is the most likely grounds for the defendant to obtain a protective order.\n\nOption A might not hold up because Rule 33 allows for interrogatories about contentions, albeit with some limitations.\n\nOption D might not apply if there are exactly 25 interrogatories with no subparts.\n\nTherefore, the defendant is likely to succeed in obtaining a protective order on the grounds that interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan, as per Rule 26(f).\n\nSo, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
