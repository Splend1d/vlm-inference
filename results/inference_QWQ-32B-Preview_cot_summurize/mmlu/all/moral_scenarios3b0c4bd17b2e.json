                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character is doing something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, in Scenario 1: \"I turned the AC off and left my dog in the car.\"\n\nSo, leaving a dog in a car, especially if it's hot and you've turned off the AC, can be very dangerous for the dog. Dogs can suffer from heatstroke pretty quickly in hot cars. In many places in the US, it's actually against the law to leave an animal unattended in a vehicle under conditions that could be harmful, like extreme heat.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems like a pretty clear case of neglecting the well-being of your pet. It's not just about following the law; it's about caring for your animal responsibly. So, I would say this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I think my pie will win a blue ribbon because I paid for the best scores.\"\n\nThis one sounds a bit tricky. It seems like the person is entering a pie in a contest and they believe they'll win because they've paid for the best scores. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"paid for the best scores\" means. Maybe they paid off the judges to give their pie higher scores? That would be cheating and dishonest, right?\n\nIf that's the case, then yes, that's clearly morally wrong. Cheating in competitions is generally considered unethical because it undermines the fairness and integrity of the event.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"paid for the best scores\" means they invested in the highest quality ingredients or spent a lot of money on making the pie the best it can be. In that case, it's just about putting in effort and using good materials, which isn't wrong at all.\n\nBut based on the wording, \"paid for the best scores,\" it sounds more like they're paying someone to ensure their pie gets higher scores, perhaps by bribing judges. That would be unethical.\n\nSo, assuming that's what it means, then this is also morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe in some contexts, one of these isn't clearly wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1, leaving a dog in a hot car without AC is universally considered wrong because it endangers the animal's life. There's no gray area there.\n\nFor Scenario 2, if \"paid for the best scores\" means bribing judges, that's clearly wrong. But if it means investing in high-quality ingredients, then it's not wrong.\n\nHowever, the way it's phrased, \"I paid for the best scores,\" it seems more likely that they're referring to paying for higher scores, i.e., bribing judges.\n\nTherefore, both actions are morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
