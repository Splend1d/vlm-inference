                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out if this proposed state law is constitutional. So, there's a state law that says vacant public school buildings have to be sold at auction to the highest bidder. But now, a city's school board wants to pass a new law that would let them sell a vacant school building to a local church for less than its market value, specifically for use as the church's school. If this new law passes, is it constitutional?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because a statute specially authorizing the sale of the building without competitive bidding would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nB. No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nC. Yes, because surplus government property is not subject to the limitations imposed by the establishment clause as incorporated into the establishment clause as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nD. Yes, because the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the establishment clause is. I know it's part of the First Amendment, which says \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" And since the Fourteenth Amendment applies this to the states, too.\n\nSo, option B says no, because it would be establishing religion, which is prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. That sounds plausible, but maybe there are exceptions.\n\nOption C says yes, because surplus government property isn't subject to the establishment clause limitations. I'm not sure about that. I think the establishment clause applies to all government actions, including\u5904\u7f6e surplus property.\n\nOption D says yes, because the law wouldn't primarily or substantially support religious activities. But if the church is going to use the building for its school, which might include religious instruction, is that considered supporting religious activities?\n\nOption A says no, because selling without competitive bidding violates equal protection. That's another angle. Equal protection requires that similar situations be treated similarly, unless there's a good reason.\n\nLet me think about this. The current law requires selling to the highest bidder at auction, which seems fair and equal. But the new law would allow selling to this specific church at below market value. That does seem to treat the church differently from other potential buyers.\n\nWhy is the city's school board proposing this? Maybe they have a relationship with the church, or perhaps they think it's better for the community. But from a legal standpoint, is it fair to single out one buyer and give them a special deal?\n\nIn terms of the establishment clause, is selling a building to a church for use as a school considered promoting religion? The church school might teach religious values along with secular subjects. So, is providing them with a building aiding their religious mission?\n\nI recall that the Supreme Court has ruled on cases involving government funding to religious schools. In some cases, like providing textbooks or transportation, it was allowed, but directly funding religious activities was not. So, maybe providing a building falls somewhere in between.\n\nBut in this case, it's not just funding; it's transferring ownership of a building at below market value. That seems like a substantial benefit to the church.\n\nAlso, the new law would only apply to this specific sale, making it seem like special treatment for the church.\n\nSo, considering the establishment clause, is this an impermissible endorsement of religion? The government can't promote or favor one religion over others, or religion in general.\n\nMoreover, by selling below market value, the city is essentially subsidizing the church's school. Is that acceptable?\n\nI think option B is strong, but maybe there are reasons why it would be okay.\n\nOption D says that the law wouldn't primarily or substantially support religious activities. But if the building is going to be used for a church school, which likely includes religious education, it seems like it would be supporting those activities.\n\nOption C seems incorrect because the establishment clause applies to all government actions, including\u5904\u7f6e of surplus property.\n\nOption A is about equal protection. By allowing the sale to the church without competitive bidding, it's favoring one buyer over others, which could be seen as unequal treatment.\n\nBut maybe there's a public interest in having the building used for educational purposes, even if it's a religious school.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the church could buy the building at auction like anyone else, and if they offer the highest bid, then it's fine. But here, the proposal is to sell it to them below market value.\n\nI think that raises issues under both the establishment clause and equal protection.\n\nSo, between options A and B, both seem plausible, but maybe B is more directly on point because it's about the relationship between government and religion.\n\nOption D tries to argue that the support isn't primary or substantial, but given that it's a building being provided below market value, that seems like a substantial benefit.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B: No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
