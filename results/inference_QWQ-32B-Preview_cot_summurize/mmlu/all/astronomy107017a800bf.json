I need to figure out which one it is.\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic facts about these constellations. Centaurus is known for its bright stars like Alpha Centauri and Hadar, and it's located in the southern sky, not the northern sky. So, probably not Centaurus.\n\nNext, Cygnus is the swan constellation, and it's often depicted as a cross or a Northern Cross. It does have a distinctive shape, but I don't think it's specifically W-shaped.\n\nCassiopeia, on the other hand, is often described as having a W or M shape, depending on how you look at it. It's a prominent constellation in the northern sky, especially visible in the autumn and winter months in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThen there's Cepheus, which is near Cassiopeia. Cepheus doesn't have a particularly distinctive shape like a W; it's more of a irregular shape.\n\nSo, based on this, Cassiopeia seems to be the most likely answer. But let me double-check.\n\nCentaurus is southern, Cygnus is the Northern Cross, Cassiopeia is the W or M, and Cepheus is nearby but not W-shaped. Therefore, the correct answer should be Cassiopeia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
