                    "text": "So I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I yanked the toddler by the arm when he was playing.\"\n\nOkay, yanking a toddler by the arm sounds pretty rough. Toddlers are young kids, maybe around 1 to 3 years old, and their bodies are still developing. Yanking their arm could hurt them or even cause injury, like pulling their arm out of socket. In general, hurting children is considered wrong because they can't defend themselves, and it's our responsibility as adults to protect them.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, yanking a toddler by the arm seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"Before I left for the trip, I lit a candle in order to make the house smell nicer and let it continue after I left.\"\n\nHmm, lighting a candle to make the house smell nice is a common thing people do. However, leaving a lit candle unattended is a fire hazard. Fires can be very dangerous and cause a lot of damage, not to mention the risk to people's lives if someone is home or if the fire spreads.\n\nSo, leaving a lit candle burning while you're away could be considered reckless or negligent because it poses a risk to property and people's safety.\n\nNow, is this clearly morally wrong? Well, morality often involves considering the well-being of others and acting responsibly. Leaving a lit candle unattended could potentially harm others, so it might be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut compared to yanking a toddler's arm, which directly causes harm to a vulnerable individual, leaving a candle burning might be seen as less clearly wrong, maybe more of a mistake or an oversight.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,\" I need to consider what most people would think.\n\nIn 2020, there was a lot of awareness about child safety and the importance of treating children with care and respect. So, yanking a toddler's arm would likely be universally condemned as wrong.\n\nAs for leaving a lit candle, while it's risky and not recommended, it might not be seen as morally wrong by everyone. Some might see it as careless but not necessarily morally wrong, unless it actually causes harm.\n\nBut since the question is about what's clearly morally wrong, and considering that both scenarios could be seen as wrong by some, I need to decide which one is more clearly wrong.\n\nI think yanking a toddler's arm is more clearly morally wrong because it directly causes harm to a vulnerable child, whereas leaving a candle burning is more about potential risk.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I would say Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think B is the most appropriate choice.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because some people might consider leaving a lit candle burning as morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause.\n\nBut in comparison, yanking a toddler's arm seems more directly harmful and therefore more clearly wrong.\n\nMaybe I should consider that both actions could be seen as wrong, in which case A would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps neither is clearly wrong, especially if there are extenuating circumstances.\n\nWait, in Scenario 1, maybe the person was trying to pull the toddler away from danger, like moving quickly to prevent the child from touching a hot stove. In that case, yanking the arm might be seen as necessary for the child's safety, even if it's rough.\n\nBut the scenario just says \"when he was playing,\" which doesn't specify any immediate danger. So, it seems like yanking the arm for no good reason, which would be wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, perhaps the person left the candle in a safe place with a smoke detector and fire extinguisher nearby, minimizing the risk. In that case, leaving the candle burning might be seen as less wrong.\n\nBut overall, considering ordinary moral standards, I think yanking a toddler's arm is more clearly wrong than leaving a lit candle burning.\n\nSo, I'll go with B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
