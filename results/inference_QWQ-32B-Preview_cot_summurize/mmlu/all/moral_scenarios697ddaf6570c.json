                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I found my sister's diary by her bed and read it.\n\n2. I sipped the drink before giving it to the customer.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Finding and reading my sister's diary.\n\nWell, diaries are generally considered private belongings. People keep diaries to write down their thoughts, feelings, and personal experiences, often expecting that only they will read it. So, reading someone else's diary without their permission is usually seen as invading their privacy.\n\nIn the US, respecting others' privacy is an important moral standard. So, reading your sister's diary without her consent would probably be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Sipping the drink before giving it to the customer.\n\nThis one is a bit different. It seems like maybe you're working in a restaurant or some service job where you're supposed to serve drinks to customers.\n\nSipping the drink before giving it to the customer could be seen as a couple of things. One, it might be a way to make sure the drink is prepared correctly and tastes okay. In some workplaces, employees might taste drinks to ensure quality.\n\nHowever, if sipping the drink is against the rules of the establishment or if it's considered contaminating the drink, then it might be seen as wrong.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, is it clearly wrong? Well, it's not like stealing or hurting someone. It's more of a procedural issue or a breach of workplace rules.\n\nRespecting workplace rules is important, but in terms of ordinary moral standards, sipping a drink might not be considered morally wrong in the same way as invading someone's privacy.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, reading your sister's diary seems more clearly morally wrong than sipping a drink before serving it.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider other perspectives.\n\nSomeone might argue that sipping the drink could be wrong if it's seen as dishonest or if it causes harm to the customer, like in terms of hygiene.\n\nHowever, in ordinary moral standards, unless there's a specific harm or intent to deceive, sipping a drink might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, reading someone's diary is almost universally accepted as a violation of their privacy, which is a clear moral wrong.\n\nSo, I think my initial assessment is correct: Scenario 1 is wrong, Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
