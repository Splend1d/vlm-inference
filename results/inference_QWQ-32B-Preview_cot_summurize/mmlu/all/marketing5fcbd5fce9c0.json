So, it's related to assuring customers that they're getting a good deal.\n\nOption A is \"Price competitiveness.\" That sounds like the company is just stating that their prices are competitive, but it might not necessarily provide assurance to the customer in a concrete way.\n\nOption B is \"Price assurance.\" This seems similar to price guarantee, but maybe it's more general. It could be a policy or a statement that assures customers about the pricing, but again, it's a bit vague.\n\nOption C is \"Reference prices.\" I think this might refer to showing customers what other companies charge for similar products, so they can compare and see that this company's prices are competitive. That could give them peace of mind.\n\nOption D is \"Price guarantee schemes.\" This sounds like specific programs or guarantees that the company offers, perhaps promising to match or beat competitors' prices. That would definitely give customers peace of mind.\n\nSo, considering all these options, I think both C and D are directly aimed at providing customers with the assurance of competitive pricing. Reference prices let them compare, and price guarantee schemes assure them that they're getting the best price.\n\nBut since the question might be expecting a single answer, I might lean towards D, \"Price guarantee schemes,\" because it directly addresses the assurance aspect by offering guarantees, which is a strong way to assure customers.\n\nWait, but option A is \"Price competitiveness.\" Maybe this refers to the company communicating their competitive pricing through marketing or statements, which could also provide some assurance to customers.\n\nOption B, \"Price assurance,\" is similar to D, but D seems more specific and actionable.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is D, \"Price guarantee schemes,\" because it's a concrete action that companies take to assure customers about their prices.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's another option that might be better.\n\nOption C, \"Reference prices,\" is also important because it allows customers to make their own comparisons, which can provide peace of mind.\n\nHowever, the question is about providing customers with the peace of mind knowing that the company they are purchasing from is competitive in price.\n\nBoth C and D seem relevant, but if I had to choose one, I'd go with D, \"Price guarantee schemes,\" because it directly assures customers about the company's pricing competitiveness, often with a guarantee to match or beat competitors' prices.\n\nSo, my final answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
