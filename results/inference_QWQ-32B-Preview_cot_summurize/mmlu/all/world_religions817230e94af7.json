I think I've heard of Ban Zhao before in relation to writings about women, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see what I can recall.\n\nFirst off, Ban Zhao is a well-known figure in Chinese history, especially for her writings on ethics and morality. I believe she lived during the Han Dynasty. One of her notable works is the \"N\u00fcjie\" or \"Instructions for Women,\" which is a text that discusses the proper behavior for women in society. So, that sounds similar to \"Admonitions for Women.\" Maybe \"Admonitions for Women\" is another title for \"N\u00fcjie\" or perhaps it's a different work by Ban Zhao.\n\nNow, Laozi is the founder of Taoism, and his main work is the \"Tao Te Ching.\" I don't think he wrote anything specifically about women, at least not that I can recall. Mencius is a Confucian philosopher, and while he wrote extensively on ethics and politics, I don't think he had a specific work titled \"Admonitions for Women.\" Liu Xiang was also a scholar and official during the Western Han Dynasty, known for editing and compiling ancient texts, but I don't recall him writing about women specifically.\n\nLet me try to remember more about Ban Zhao. She was a female scholar and historian who wrote several works, including \"The Lessons for Women\" or \"N\u00fcjie,\" which was intended to instruct women on how to behave properly according to Confucian ideals. Given that, it seems likely that she is the author of \"Admonitions for Women,\" especially if that's another title for \"N\u00fcjie.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Admonitions for Women\" is a different work by Ban Zhao. I should check if she wrote multiple texts on this subject. I know that Ban Zhao also wrote the \"Biographies of Exemplary Women,\" which is a collection of stories about virtuous women in Chinese history. So, maybe \"Admonitions for Women\" is a separate text where she provides direct advice or rules for women's conduct.\n\nComparing the other options, Laozi, Mencius, and Liu Xiang are all important figures, but their main works don't seem directly related to admonishing women. Laozi's focus is on Taoist philosophy, Mencius on Confucian ethics and human nature, and Liu Xiang on compiling and preserving ancient texts.\n\nTherefore, based on what I know about Ban Zhao and her writings on women's roles and behavior, I think the correct answer is A. Ban Zhao.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if \"Admonitions for Women\" could be a translation of a different text by one of these authors. But given that Ban Zhao is the most associated with writings about women, it still points towards her being the author.\n\nSo, my answer is A. Ban Zhao.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
