Cocaine use can have serious negative effects on both the mother and the developing fetus.\n\nWhen a pregnant woman uses cocaine, the drug crosses the placenta and affects the fetus directly. This can lead to a variety of complications, including:\n\n1. **Low Birth Weight Babies:** Cocaine use increases the risk of preterm labor and restricted fetal growth, resulting in babies who are born weighing less than they should for their gestational age. Low birth weight is associated with various health problems and developmental delays.\n\n2. **Poorer Growth and Lower Intelligence:** Exposure to cocaine in utero can impair the fetus's growth and development, leading to poorer physical growth and cognitive development. This can manifest as lower IQ scores, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems later in life.\n\n3. **Smaller Head Circumference:** Cocaine use during pregnancy has been linked to smaller head circumference in newborns, which may indicate reduced brain growth and development. This can have long-term consequences for the child's cognitive and neurological functions.\n\nOverall, cocaine abuse during pregnancy is a significant public health concern due to the multitude of adverse effects it can have on the developing fetus. It is crucial for pregnant women to avoid drug use and seek help if they are struggling with addiction to ensure the best possible outcomes for themselves and their babies.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- National Institute on Drug Abuse.
