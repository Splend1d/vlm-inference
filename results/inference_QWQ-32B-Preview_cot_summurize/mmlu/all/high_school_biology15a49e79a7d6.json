                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this question about neurons and their membrane potential. It says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts, and we need to figure out what that's called. The options are depolarization, repolarization, hyperpolarization, or an action potential.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what membrane potential is. In neurons, the membrane potential is the difference in electrical charge across the cell membrane. Normally, neurons are at resting potential, which is around -70 millivolts. This means the inside of the neuron is negative compared to the outside.\n\nNow, the question says the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. Wait, that's interesting because normally, the resting potential is -70 millivolts, but here it starts at +50 millivolts. That seems like an unusual starting point. Maybe this is during some phase of the action potential.\n\nLet me recall the phases of an action potential. Typically, an action potential starts with depolarization, where the membrane potential becomes less negative or even positive. Then there's repolarization, where it returns to the resting potential, and sometimes there's hyperpolarization, where it becomes more negative than the resting potential.\n\nSo, if the membrane potential is changing from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts, that means it's becoming more negative. That sounds like repolarization, where the neuron is returning to its resting state after being depolarized.\n\nBut wait, hyperpolarization is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. In this case, going from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts, it's not just returning to resting potential; it's going beyond that. So, maybe it's hyperpolarization.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful. Hyperpolarization is when the membrane potential is more negative than the resting potential, which is -70 millivolts. So, going from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts includes both repolarization and hyperpolarization.\n\nBut the question is, what is this change called? Is it depolarization, repolarization, hyperpolarization, or an action potential?\n\nDepolarization is when the membrane potential becomes less negative or more positive, which is the opposite of what's happening here.\n\nRepolarization is when the membrane potential returns to its resting state after being depolarized.\n\nHyperpolarization is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential.\n\nAn action potential is the entire sequence of depolarization, repolarization, and sometimes hyperpolarization.\n\nGiven that the membrane potential is changing from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts, it seems like the neuron is returning to its resting state after being depolarized, which would be repolarization. But since it's going beyond the resting potential, it might include hyperpolarization as well.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the entire change from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts is part of the repolarization phase, and if it goes beyond -70 millivolts, that's hyperpolarization.\n\nBut the question says it changes to -70 millivolts, which is the resting potential. So, if it's going from +50 millivolts back to -70 millivolts, that's repolarization.\n\nIf it went to, say, -80 millivolts, then that would be hyperpolarization.\n\nSo, in this case, since it's going back to -70 millivolts, it's repolarization.\n\nWait, but the starting point is +50 millivolts, which is more positive than the resting potential. That seems unusual. Maybe the neuron is in a state of depolarization at +50 millivolts, and then it's repolarizing back to -70 millivolts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the resting potential is -70 millivolts, and +50 millivolts is a depolarized state, like the peak of the action potential. Then, going back to -70 millivolts would be repolarization.\n\nBut, in some cases, after depolarization, there can be a hyperpolarization phase where the membrane potential becomes more negative than resting potential.\n\nHowever, the question specifies that it's changing to -70 millivolts, which is the resting potential, so perhaps it's just repolarization.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is depolarization to +50 millivolts, then repolarization back to -70 millivolts, and hyperpolarization beyond that.\n\nBut according to the question, it's changing from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts, which is repolarization.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are meant to identify the overall process, in which case, an action potential includes both depolarization and repolarization.\n\nBut the question specifies \"a change in a neuron membrane potential from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts,\" which is specifically the repolarization phase.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is repolarization.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a better fit among the options.\n\nDepolarization is the opposite, so that's not it.\n\nRepolarization fits, as it's returning to resting potential.\n\nHyperpolarization would be going beyond resting potential.\n\nAn action potential is the entire process.\n\nGiven that, repolarization seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the membrane potential is changing from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts, it's moving from a depolarized state back to the resting state.\n\nRepolarization is defined as the return to resting potential after depolarization.\n\nTherefore, this change is repolarization.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. repolarization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
