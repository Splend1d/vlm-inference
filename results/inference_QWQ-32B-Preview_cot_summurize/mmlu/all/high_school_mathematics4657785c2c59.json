The expression we need to calculate is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot a^4 + a^{2+1-3}\n\\]\n\nAnd we're given that \\( a = 42 \\). But actually, when I look at the expression, I notice that many terms will simplify, and perhaps the value of \\( a \\) isn't as important as simplifying the expression first.\n\nLet me break it down part by part.\n\nFirst, there's \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\). That's the same as \\( \\frac{1}{a^4} \\).\n\nThen, that's multiplied by 2 and by \\( a^4 \\). So, \\( \\frac{1}{a^4} \\cdot 2 \\cdot a^4 \\).\n\nI can see that \\( \\frac{1}{a^4} \\) and \\( a^4 \\) will cancel each other out, right? Because \\( \\frac{1}{a^4} \\cdot a^4 = 1 \\). So, this part simplifies to \\( 1 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\).\n\nNext, there's the second term: \\( a^{2+1-3} \\).\n\nLet's simplify the exponent: \\( 2 + 1 - 3 = 0 \\). So, this is \\( a^0 \\), which is 1, as long as \\( a \\) isn't zero.\n\nGiven that \\( a = 42 \\), which is not zero, \\( a^0 = 1 \\).\n\nNow, putting it all together: the first part simplifies to 2, and the second part is 1. So, \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\).\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that first part to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWe have \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot a^4 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\), that's \\( \\frac{1}{a^4} \\).\n\nThen, multiplying by \\( a^4 \\), we get \\( \\frac{1}{a^4} \\cdot a^4 = 1 \\).\n\nThen, multiplying by 2, it's \\( 1 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnd the second term, \\( a^{2+1-3} = a^0 = 1 \\).\n\nSo, overall, \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0\nB. 1\nC. 2\nD. 3\n\nIt seems like the answer should be D. 3.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the expression.\n\nWait, maybe the formatting is confusing. Let me look at the expression again:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot a^4 + a^{2+1-3}\n\\]\n\nIs there any ambiguity in the order of operations?\n\nFirst, exponents are calculated before multiplication and addition.\n\nSo, \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\) is correctly calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{a^4} \\).\n\nThen, multiplying by 2 and \\( a^4 \\), in that order.\n\nFinally, adding \\( a^{2+1-3} \\), which is \\( a^0 = 1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression is meant to be \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\cdot (2 \\cdot a^4) + a^{2+1-3} \\), but that shouldn't change the result because multiplication is associative.\n\nLet me try plugging in \\( a = 42 \\) to verify.\n\nFirst, \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{42}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{42^4} \\).\n\nThen, \\( 2 \\cdot 42^4 = 2 \\cdot 42^4 \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{1}{42^4} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 42^4 = 2 \\).\n\nPlus \\( 42^{0} = 1 \\).\n\nTotal is \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\).\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the simplification of the first part.\n\nLet's calculate \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot a^4 \\) step by step.\n\nFirst, \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{a^4} \\).\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{1}{a^4} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{2}{a^4} \\).\n\nNext, \\( \\frac{2}{a^4} \\cdot a^4 = 2 \\).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnd \\( a^{2+1-3} = a^0 = 1 \\).\n\nSo, total is 3.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake in assuming \\( a^{2+1-3} = a^0 = 1 \\). Is there any possibility that the exponents don't simplify to zero?\n\nLet's double-check the exponent: \\( 2 + 1 - 3 = 0 \\), which is clearly zero.\n\nSo, \\( a^0 = 1 \\), no matter what \\( a \\) is (as long as \\( a \\neq 0 \\), which it isn't in this case).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3.\n\nBut let's consider if the expression could be interpreted differently due to grouping.\n\nSuppose the expression is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\cdot (2 \\cdot a^4 + a^{2+1-3}}) \\).\n\nBut that's not how it's written. The expression is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot a^4 + a^{2+1-3} \\), which is clearly addition outside the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4 \\cdot (2 \\cdot a^4) + a^{2+1-3} \\), which is the same as before.\n\nIn any case, the result remains 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
