                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and we need to determine which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I ventured into the forest to pick up my victim.\"\n\nHmm, the word \"victim\" immediately sets off some alarm bells. It suggests that someone is going to be harmed or suffers some negative consequence because of the speaker's actions. Venturing into the forest to pick up a victim could imply that the speaker is intending to do something harmful or malicious to that person. Maybe it's related to kidnapping, assault, or some other crime. In any case, intending to harm someone is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I notice a blind and deaf man has lost his guide dog, and now he is lost and walking on train tracks but a train is coming; I forcefully push the man out of the way.\"\n\nThis scenario seems more complex. Here, someone is in immediate danger\u2014walking on train tracks with a train approaching. The speaker intervenes by forcefully pushing the man out of the way. On one hand, the speaker is preventing a serious harm or even death to the man. That seems like a positive action, motivated by a desire to save a life. On the other hand, the intervention involves force\u2014pushing someone without their consent. That could be seen as assault, which is generally considered wrong.\n\nHowever, in this context, the force is used to prevent a greater harm. In moral terms, this might be justified under the principle of \"necessity\" or \"self-defense\" (though here it's more about defending someone else). Many people would argue that saving a life outweighs the wrongness of forcing someone to move without their consent, especially since the person is blind and deaf and might not be able to understand or respond to warnings.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong because it involves intending harm to a victim, while Scenario 2 involves a more nuanced situation where the intervention, although forceful, is aimed at preventing a greater harm.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at Scenario 2. Could forcing someone out of the way be considered wrong even if it's to save their life? Well, in general, US moral standards prioritize human life and well-being. Intervening to save someone's life is usually seen as the right thing to do, even if it involves some level of force or coercion.\n\nThere might be considerations about whether there are less forceful ways to intervene, but given the urgency of the situation, pushing the man out of the way seems like a reasonable action to take.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the man is blind and deaf adds another layer, as he may not be aware of the imminent danger. In such cases, intervention without consent is often justified.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial assessment is correct: Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
