With regard to study-skills training, the school psychologist should stress which of the following principles while advising Ms. Harcar?\n\nA. The study skills of students with disabilities are improved when they are given a single, specific study strategy to follow for all subjects.\nB. Students with disabilities often develop study skills on their own and need only some guidance and reinforcement by the teacher.\nC. Training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches.\nD. Study strategies are best taught in a small group by having students practice collaborative problem-solving activities modeled by the teacher.\n"

                    "text": "So Ms. Harcar is a new sixth-grade teacher, and she's concerned about a student named Anthony who has a mild learning disability. He's doing well day to day but struggles with tests. The school psychologist, who knows Anthony well, is meeting with her to discuss how to incorporate study-skills training into classroom activities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what study-skills training entails, especially for students with learning disabilities. I know that learning disabilities can affect how students process information, so strategies that help them organize and retain information are crucial.\n\nOption A says that students with disabilities should be given a single, specific study strategy to follow for all subjects. But I think that might be too restrictive. Different subjects require different approaches, and what works for math might not work for history. So, this seems too simplistic.\n\nOption B suggests that students with disabilities often develop study skills on their own and just need some guidance and reinforcement from the teacher. While some students might be able to do this, I think many students with learning disabilities need more structured support to develop effective study skills. So, this might not be sufficient.\n\nOption C talks about helping students guide their own thinking to organize their study behaviors and use varied study approaches. This sounds more comprehensive. It involves metacognition, which is thinking about one's own thinking, and that's important for developing effective learning strategies. It also mentions using varied approaches, which makes sense because different strategies work better for different learners and subjects.\n\nOption D focuses on teaching study strategies in small groups through collaborative problem-solving activities modeled by the teacher. While group work can be beneficial, not all students may thrive in that environment, especially those with social difficulties or who prefer individual learning. Also, modeling is important, but it might not cover the full range of needs for students with learning disabilities.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to align best with current educational practices for students with learning disabilities. It emphasizes metacognitive skills and flexibility in study approaches, which are key for students who need to compensate for their learning challenges.\n\nSo, the school psychologist should stress that training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
