Each decimal digit (0 through 9) is represented by its own binary sequence. Since the largest decimal digit is 9, we need to find out how many bits are required to represent numbers from 0 to 9 in binary.\n\nLet's consider the binary representations of the decimal digits from 0 to 9:\n\n- 0: 0000\n\n- 1: 0001\n\n- 2: 0010\n\n- 3: 0011\n\n- 4: 0100\n\n- 5: 0101\n\n- 6: 0110\n\n- 7: 0111\n\n- 8: 1000\n\n- 9: 1001\n\nAs we can see, each decimal digit is represented by a 4-bit binary number. Even though some digits could be represented with fewer bits (for example, 0 with 0000 and 1 with 0001), the standard BCD encoding uses 4 bits for each digit to ensure consistency and simplicity in processing.\n\nUsing 4 bits allows for a total of 16 possible combinations (from 0000 to 1111), but in BCD, only the first 10 combinations (0000 to 1001) are used to represent the decimal digits 0 through 9. The remaining 6 combinations (1010 to 1111) are invalid in BCD and are not used.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits required to store one BCD digit is 4.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 4"
