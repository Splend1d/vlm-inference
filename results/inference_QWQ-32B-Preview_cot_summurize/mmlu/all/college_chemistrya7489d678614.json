                    "text": "So I've got this question here about oxidation-reduction potentials, and I need to figure out which of these reactions is most likely to occur based on that. Let's see, I have four options:\n\nA. Al(s) + 3 NaNO3(aq) \u2192 3 Na(s) + Al(NO3)3(aq)\n\nB. Zn(s) + 2 Ag(NO3)(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)\n\nC. Pb(s) + Ca(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 Ca(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\n\nD. Pb(s) + 2 LiNO3(aq) \u2192 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what oxidation-reduction potential is. I know that in redox reactions, one species is oxidized (loses electrons) and another is reduced (gains electrons). The tendency of a species to be reduced is measured by its reduction potential, which is often given in standard reduction potential tables.\n\nSo, to determine which reaction is most likely to occur, I should look at the standard reduction potentials of the half-reactions involved in each option. The reaction will proceed spontaneously if the standard cell potential (E\u00b0cell) is positive, which is calculated as E\u00b0cell = E\u00b0cathode - E\u00b0anode.\n\nI think I should look up the standard reduction potentials for each half-reaction in the options. Let me try to break down each option into its half-reactions and find their E\u00b0 values.\n\nStarting with option A:\n\nAl(s) + 3 NaNO3(aq) \u2192 3 Na(s) + Al(NO3)3(aq)\n\nSo, this seems like aluminum is reacting with sodium nitrate to produce sodium and aluminum nitrate.\n\nLet me try to write the half-reactions:\n\nFirst, aluminum is going from 0 oxidation state to +3 in Al(NO3)3, so it's being oxidized:\n\nAl(s) \u2192 Al3+ + 3e-\n\nSecond, sodium is going from +1 in NaNO3 to 0 in Na(s), so it's being reduced:\n\nNa+ + e- \u2192 Na(s)\n\nSo, the overall reaction is:\n\nAl(s) + 3 Na+ \u2192 3 Na(s) + Al3+\n\nNow, to find E\u00b0cell, I need to look up the standard reduction potentials for Al3+/Al and Na+/Na.\n\nFrom standard reduction potential tables:\n\nAl3+ + 3e- \u2192 Al(s) E\u00b0 = -1.66 V\n\nNa+ + e- \u2192 Na(s) E\u00b0 = -2.71 V\n\nWait, but in the reaction, aluminum is being oxidized, so I need to reverse the first half-reaction:\n\nAl(s) \u2192 Al3+ + 3e- E\u00b0 = +1.66 V\n\nAnd sodium is being reduced:\n\nNa+ + e- \u2192 Na(s) E\u00b0 = -2.71 V\n\nThen, E\u00b0cell = E\u00b0cathode - E\u00b0anode\n\nHere, cathode is where reduction occurs (sodium reduction), and anode is where oxidation occurs (aluminum oxidation).\n\nSo, E\u00b0cell = (-2.71 V) - (+1.66 V) = -4.37 V\n\nThis is negative, which means the reaction is not spontaneous under standard conditions. So, this reaction is unlikely to occur.\n\nMoving on to option B:\n\nZn(s) + 2 Ag(NO3)(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)\n\nSo, zinc is reacting with silver nitrate to produce silver and zinc nitrate.\n\nHalf-reactions:\n\nZn(s) \u2192 Zn2+ + 2e- (oxidation)\n\n2 Ag+ + 2e- \u2192 2 Ag(s) (reduction)\n\nFrom standard reduction potential tables:\n\nZn2+ + 2e- \u2192 Zn(s) E\u00b0 = -0.76 V\n\nSo, oxidation: Zn(s) \u2192 Zn2+ + 2e- E\u00b0 = +0.76 V\n\nReduction: Ag+ + e- \u2192 Ag(s) E\u00b0 = +0.80 V\n\nWait, but the reaction has 2 Ag+, so the half-reaction is multiplied by 2:\n\n2 Ag+ + 2e- \u2192 2 Ag(s) E\u00b0 = +0.80 V\n\nThen, E\u00b0cell = E\u00b0cathode - E\u00b0anode = (+0.80 V) - (+0.76 V) = +0.04 V\n\nThis is positive, so the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions. This seems likely to occur.\n\nOption C:\n\nPb(s) + Ca(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 Ca(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\n\nSo, lead is reacting with calcium nitrate to produce calcium and lead nitrate.\n\nHalf-reactions:\n\nPb(s) \u2192 Pb2+ + 2e- (oxidation)\n\nCa2+ + 2e- \u2192 Ca(s) (reduction)\n\nFrom standard reduction potential tables:\n\nPb2+ + 2e- \u2192 Pb(s) E\u00b0 = -0.13 V\n\nSo, oxidation: Pb(s) \u2192 Pb2+ + 2e- E\u00b0 = +0.13 V\n\nReduction: Ca2+ + 2e- \u2192 Ca(s) E\u00b0 = -2.87 V\n\nThen, E\u00b0cell = E\u00b0cathode - E\u00b0anode = (-2.87 V) - (+0.13 V) = -3.00 V\n\nThis is negative, so the reaction is not spontaneous under standard conditions. Unlikely to occur.\n\nOption D:\n\nPb(s) + 2 LiNO3(aq) \u2192 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\n\nSo, lead is reacting with lithium nitrate to produce lithium and lead nitrate.\n\nHalf-reactions:\n\nPb(s) \u2192 Pb2+ + 2e- (oxidation)\n\n2 Li+ + 2e- \u2192 2 Li(s) (reduction)\n\nFrom standard reduction potential tables:\n\nPb2+ + 2e- \u2192 Pb(s) E\u00b0 = -0.13 V\n\nSo, oxidation: Pb(s) \u2192 Pb2+ + 2e- E\u00b0 = +0.13 V\n\nReduction: Li+ + e- \u2192 Li(s) E\u00b0 = -3.04 V\n\nFor 2 Li+, it's 2 times the E\u00b0, but actually, E\u00b0 is intensive, so it remains the same at -3.04 V.\n\nThen, E\u00b0cell = E\u00b0cathode - E\u00b0anode = (-3.04 V) - (+0.13 V) = -3.17 V\n\nAgain, negative, so not spontaneous under standard conditions. Unlikely to occur.\n\nComparing all options, only option B has a positive E\u00b0cell, indicating a spontaneous reaction under standard conditions. Therefore, option B is most likely to occur.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
