But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nStalin's speech is most strongly influenced by which of the following?\n\nA. Appeasement\nB. Fascism\nC. Communism\nD. Secret treaties\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this question about Stalin's speech from 1931. He's talking about Russia's history of being beaten because of its backwardness and how they need to not lag behind anymore. The question is asking which of these influenced his speech the most: Appeasement, Fascism, Communism, or Secret treaties.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means and how they relate to Stalin's speech.\n\nAppeasement is a policy where you give in to an aggressor's demands to keep the peace. It's like giving someone what they want to avoid conflict. But in Stalin's speech, he's talking about not wanting to be beaten and not wanting to lag behind. It seems like he's advocating for strength and progress, not for giving in to others. So, appeasement doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nFascism is a political ideology that emphasizes a strong, centralized government, often with a dictator, and it promotes nationalism and sometimes racism. It's different from communism in many ways. Stalin was a communist leader, so it's unlikely that fascism influenced his speech. In fact, communists and fascists were often enemies. So, fascism probably isn't the answer.\n\nCommunism is the ideology that Stalin followed. It's about creating a classless society where everything is owned communally, and the means of production are controlled by the state for the benefit of all. In his speech, Stalin is talking about moving forward, industrializing, and not being left behind, which are all goals of communism, especially in the context of the Soviet Union under Stalin. So, communism seems like a strong candidate.\n\nSecret treaties are agreements made in secret between nations, often involving territorial gains or other advantages. While secret treaties were certainly a part of international politics, especially before and during World War I, it's not clear how they directly influenced Stalin's speech about internal development and not being beaten by external powers.\n\nLooking back, Stalin was a communist leader, and his speech is about pushing forward with industrialization and not falling behind, which aligns with communist goals of building a strong, modern socialist state. He's emphasizing the need for progress to avoid being beaten by external forces, which had happened in Russia's past due to backwardness.\n\nSo, among the options given, communism seems to be the ideology that most strongly influenced Stalin's speech.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
