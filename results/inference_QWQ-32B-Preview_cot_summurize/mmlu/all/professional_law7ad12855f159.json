                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario involving a sculptor and his neighbor. So, the sculptor had a summer cottage on a small lake and needed a way to get to it easily. He made an agreement with his neighbor, who owned some land next to his, to grant him a right-of-way over a 30-foot wide strip of land that was a quarter-mile long along the eastern edge of the neighbor's property. This was all in writing, so it's an express grant of an easement.\n\nNow, the sculptor and his family moved to Europe for business reasons and haven't used the cottage or the roadway for 11 years. During this time, the neighbor built an access ramp to his dock that blocks the road to the sculptor's cottage. When the sculptor comes back from Europe and finds out about this, he sues the neighbor to have the ramp removed.\n\nThe question is, which of these options is the court most likely to choose?\n\nOption A says the court would hold in the neighbor's favor because the sculptor's absence for 11 years constituted an abandonment of the easement.\n\nOption B says the court would hold in the neighbor's favor because the dominant owner (that's the sculptor) has an affirmative duty to notify the servient tenement holder (the neighbor) of non-use.\n\nOption C says the court would hold in the sculptor's favor because mere non-use, however long continued, will not as a rule effectuate an abandonment.\n\nOption D says the court would hold in the sculptor's favor because of the validity of the agreement for the express grant of the easement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an easement is. An easement is a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose. In this case, it's a right-of-way for the sculptor to access his cottage.\n\nThere are different types of easements, but here it's an express easement because it was granted in writing by the neighbor.\n\nNow, the issue is whether the sculptor's non-use of the easement for 11 years constitutes an abandonment, which would allow the neighbor to obstruct it.\n\nAbandonment of an easement generally requires an intention to abandon, coupled with an act that demonstrates that intention. Non-use alone isn't always sufficient to show abandonment, especially if there's a valid reason for the non-use, like the sculptor being abroad for work.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, mere non-use, no matter how long, doesn't automatically abandon an easement. The easement remains in place until it's formally released or extinguished by law.\n\nOption A suggests that 11 years of non-use constitutes abandonment. But, as I just thought, non-use alone might not be enough to constitute abandonment unless there's clear intent.\n\nOption B mentions an affirmative duty to notify the servient tenement holder of non-use. I'm not sure about this one. I don't recall a legal duty for the dominant tenant to notify the servient tenant about non-use. It seems unusual.\n\nOption C aligns with what I'm recalling: that mere non-use doesn't typically abandon an easement.\n\nOption D focuses on the validity of the express grant agreement. Since the easement was granted in writing, it's a valid easement unless it's been abandoned or released.\n\nGiven this, it seems like options C and D are stronger arguments for the sculptor.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Maybe there are legal principles or cases that address this specific situation.\n\nIn property law, abandonment of an easement usually requires some overt act showing intent to abandon. For example, building a permanent structure over the easement area might indicate abandonment. But in this case, the sculptor didn't do anything; it was the neighbor who built the ramp.\n\nAdditionally, the sculptor had a valid reason for not using the easement\u2014being abroad for work. This suggests that the non-use was involuntary or at least excusable.\n\nSome jurisdictions might have specific statutes regarding abandonment of easements, but in the absence of such laws, common law principles would apply, which generally require a clear intention to abandon.\n\nMoreover, easements are considered appurtenant to the land (meaning they run with the land) unless they are easements in gross, which are personal to the grantee. In this case, since it's for access to the cottage, it's likely an appurtenant easement, which typically doesn't abandon unless there's a merger of the dominant and servient tenements or a release.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that the sculptor still retains his easement rights, and the neighbor's construction of the ramp obstructing the roadway would be a violation of those rights.\n\nTherefore, the court would most likely hold in the sculptor's favor, probably under option C, that mere non-use doesn't effectuate an abandonment.\n\nOption D is also attractive, but it seems more straightforward than option C. However, option C directly addresses the issue of non-use, which is the crux of the neighbor's potential defense.\n\nI think the best answer is C: hold in the sculptor's favor, because mere non-use, however long continued, will not as a rule effectuate an abandonment.\n\nThis aligns with general principles of property law regarding easements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
