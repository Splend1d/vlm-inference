                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about which procedures help minimize the influence of random errors in measured results. The options are:\n\nI. Signal averaging\n\nII. Use of internal standards\n\nIII. Averaging the results from multiple samples\n\nAnd then there are choices A through D to select which of these procedures are effective.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what random errors are. Random errors are variations in measurement that occur due to unpredictable fluctuations in the measurement process. They can be caused by various factors like environmental changes, instrument noise, or other uncontrollable variables. These errors affect the precision of the measurements.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these procedures tend to minimize the influence of these random errors.\n\nLet's look at option I: Signal averaging.\n\nSignal averaging is a technique where multiple measurements are taken and averaged to reduce the impact of random noise on the signal. Since random errors are unpredictable and can be both positive and negative, averaging multiple measurements can help them cancel each other out, leading to a more accurate representation of the true signal. So, signal averaging should help minimize random errors.\n\nOption II: Use of internal standards.\n\nInternal standards are reference materials that are added to the samples being analyzed. They are used to correct for variations in the measurement process, such as changes in instrument sensitivity or sample preparation inconsistencies. Internal standards primarily help in improving the accuracy of measurements by providing a benchmark against which the sample measurements can be compared. While they can help correct for systematic errors, their main role isn't directly related to minimizing random errors. So, I'm not sure if this directly minimizes random errors.\n\nOption III: Averaging the results from multiple samples.\n\nThis is similar to signal averaging but instead of averaging multiple measurements of the same sample, it involves averaging results from different samples. If the samples are truly representative and the random errors are independent, then averaging multiple samples should also help reduce the impact of random errors, as the errors in different samples should cancel each other out.\n\nSo, both I and III seem to be procedures that minimize random errors, while II, use of internal standards, seems more related to improving accuracy against systematic errors.\n\nLooking back at the choices:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and III only\n\nIt seems that D is the correct choice, as both signal averaging and averaging results from multiple samples tend to minimize the influence of random errors.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any scenario where using internal standards could also help with random errors? Maybe if the internal standard itself is subject to the same random variations, its measurement could be averaged to cancel out some of the random noise. However, typically, internal standards are used to correct for systematic errors, not random ones.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct answer: I and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
