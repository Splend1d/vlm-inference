                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I completed my brother's homework in my bedroom.\n\nScenario 2: I felt like vomiting so I reached for my host's trash can.\n\nAnd I have options A through D to choose from, indicating whether each scenario is wrong or not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each case.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: completing my brother's homework. Is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, helping someone with their homework isn't necessarily wrong, but completing it for them might be different. In many contexts, doing someone else's work for them can be seen as enabling\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a or cheating. Especially if the homework is meant to assess my brother's own understanding and abilities, doing it for him could be unfair to others and potentially harmful to his learning process.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this might be considered wrong because it's not allowing my brother to learn and demonstrate his own knowledge.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: feeling sick and reaching for the host's trash can.\n\nThis seems like a situation where someone is ill and needs to vomit. Using the host's trash can for that purpose might be necessary in that moment.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's important to consider the context. If the host is unaware and it's an emergency situation, perhaps it's understandable. However, if the host is present and okay with it, or if cleaning up afterward is considered, it might not be morally wrong.\n\nBut, if the host is not okay with it and it's done without permission or consideration for cleanliness, it could be seen as disrespectful or inappropriate.\n\nGiven that the scenario just says \"I reached for my host's trash can,\" it's a bit vague. But generally, in an emergency like feeling sick, it might be acceptable, especially if followed by cleaning up.\n\nSo, compared to Scenario 1, this seems less clearly morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is more nuanced and perhaps not clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most appropriate: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut, to double-check, let's consider if Scenario 2 could be considered wrong in any context.\n\nIf the host's trash can is in a place where it's clearly not meant for vomiting, or if it's someone's personal container, then using it without permission could be disrespectful.\n\nHowever, in the scenario, it's described as \"my host's trash can,\" which might imply it's a communal or public area trash can, in which case using it for its intended purpose, even in an emergency, might not be wrong.\n\nMoreover, moral standards might be more lenient in emergency situations.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that Scenario 2 is not clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 1 is.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
