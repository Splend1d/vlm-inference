                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Buddhism, and I need to figure out which form focuses on social engagement and attracts lay participation. The options are Zen Buddhism, Chan Buddhism, Humanistic Buddhism, and Pure Land Buddhism. I think I need to recall some basics about each of these branches.\n\nFirst, Zen Buddhism is a school that's pretty well-known in the West. It's known for its meditation practices, like zazen, and for its emphasis on direct experience and intuition over scholarly study. It's more about personal enlightenment through meditation. I don't recall it being\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u793e\u4f1a\u53c2\u4e0e or lay involvement, but maybe I'm wrong.\n\nChan Buddhism, I think, is actually the Chinese precursor to Zen Buddhism. Zen is the Japanese version of Chan. So, probably similar characteristics, focusing on meditation and direct experience. Maybe not so much on social engagement.\n\nHumanistic Buddhism sounds interesting. The term \"humanistic\" makes me think of focusing on human values and worldly concerns, rather than just spiritual matters. Maybe this is the one that emphasizes social engagement and involves laypeople more actively.\n\nThen there's Pure Land Buddhism, which is another popular form, especially in East Asia. It's known for its devotional practices, focusing on Amitabha Buddha and the aspiration to be reborn in the Pure Land, where conditions are favorable for achieving enlightenment. It's more about faith and devotion, perhaps less about social engagement.\n\nComparing these, Humanistic Buddhism seems like the most likely candidate for focusing on social engagement and attracting lay participation. I recall that it emphasizes applying Buddhist teachings to everyday life, engaging in society, and performing acts of compassion and service. It seems to be more inclusive of laypeople, encouraging them to participate in Buddhist practices beyond just temple rituals.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should think about some famous Humanistic Buddhist figures or organizations. For example, Master Hsing Yun is a prominent figure in Humanistic Buddhism, and he's known for his efforts in promoting education, culture, and social welfare. His Fo Guang Shan order is very active in these areas, involving both monastics and laypeople.\n\nOn the other hand, Zen and Chan Buddhism tend to be more focused on monastic life and meditation practice, although laypeople do participate. But their emphasis seems more on individual spiritual cultivation rather than social engagement.\n\nPure Land Buddhism is also popular among laypeople because of its accessibility\u2014just reciting the Buddha's name is said to bring merit and rebirth in the Pure Land. But again, it's more about personal salvation through faith rather than engaging in social issues.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the answer is C. Humanistic Buddhism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
