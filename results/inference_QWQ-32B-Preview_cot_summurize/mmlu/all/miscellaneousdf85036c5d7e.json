                    "text": "Let's think about this question step by step. The hydrologic cycle involves various processes where water moves through different states\u2014solid, liquid, and gas\u2014around the Earth. Each of these state changes involves energy absorption or release. The question is asking during which of these processes water molecules absorb energy.\n\nFirst, let's recall what happens when water changes state:\n\n1. **Melting**: Ice turns into water. This requires absorption of energy.\n\n2. **Freezing**: Water turns into ice. This releases energy.\n\n3. **Evaporation**: Water turns into water vapor. This requires absorption of energy.\n\n4. **Condensation**: Water vapor turns into water droplets or clouds. This releases energy.\n\n5. **Sublimation**: Ice turns directly into water vapor. This requires absorption of energy.\n\n6. **Deposition**: Water vapor turns directly into ice. This releases energy.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n**Option A: Formation of ice from water**\n\nThis is freezing, where water turns into ice. As I recall, freezing releases energy. So, water molecules are releasing energy in this process, not absorbing it.\n\n**Option B: Formation of a cloud from water vapor**\n\nThis is condensation, where water vapor turns into liquid water droplets forming clouds. Condensation releases energy, so again, water molecules are giving off energy here.\n\n**Option C: Runoff along the land surface**\n\nRunoff is the flow of water over the land surface, usually into rivers, lakes, or oceans. This is more of a physical movement rather than a change in state. No significant energy absorption or release is directly associated with runoff itself, though there might be some heat exchange with the environment.\n\n**Option D: Evaporation from the ocean surface**\n\nEvaporation is when water turns into water vapor. This process requires energy absorption; water molecules absorb heat to change from liquid to gas.\n\nSo, based on this, the process where water molecules absorb energy is evaporation.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. Is there any other option where energy is absorbed?\n\nOption A is freezing, which releases energy.\n\nOption B is condensation, which also releases energy.\n\nOption C is runoff, which doesn't involve a state change, so likely no significant energy absorption.\n\nOption D is evaporation, which requires energy absorption.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other process in the hydrologic cycle that involves energy absorption.\n\nSublimation is another process where ice turns directly into water vapor, and that also requires energy absorption. However, sublimation isn't listed in the options.\n\nSo, among the given options, evaporation is the process where water molecules absorb energy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
