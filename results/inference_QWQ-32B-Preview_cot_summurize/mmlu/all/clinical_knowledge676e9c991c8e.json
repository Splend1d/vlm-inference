                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about thyroid swelling. I need to figure out which statement among the options is true. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"It always elevates on swallowing.\" I know that the thyroid gland is located in the neck, and when a person swallows, the thyroid gland can move upwards because it's attached to the larynx. So, a thyroid swelling, which is a lump or enlargement in the thyroid gland, might also move upwards during swallowing. But does it always do that? I think some thyroid swellings might not move as expected, especially if they are connected to surrounding structures or if they are actually lymph nodes or other types of masses. So, I'm not entirely sure about this one. Maybe it's not always the case.\n\nOption B says: \"Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign.\" Hmm, lymph node enlargement around the thyroid could be a sign of inflammation or infection, but in the context of thyroid cancer, enlarged lymph nodes could indicate metastasis, which is not a good thing. So, I think enlarged lymph nodes might not be a good prognostic sign for thyroid swelling, especially if it's cancerous. Maybe this statement is incorrect.\n\nOption C says: \"An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone.\" Ultrasound is a common imaging technique used to evaluate thyroid nodules. It can show the size, shape, and characteristics of the nodule, such as whether it's solid or cystic. However, ultrasound isn't specifically designed to determine if a nodule is actively secreting hormone. To assess hormone secretion, other tests like a thyroid function test or a radioactive iodine uptake test might be more appropriate. So, I don't think this is the best answer.\n\nOption D says: \"A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer.\" Isotope scanning, also known as a thyroid scan, uses radioactive iodine to visualize the thyroid gland and see which parts are actively taking up iodine, indicating hormone production. A functioning nodule would take up iodine, suggesting it's producing hormone. In general, functioning nodules are less likely to be cancerous because cancerous nodules tend not to take up iodine as much. So, this seems like a plausible statement.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Option A: Not sure if it always elevates on swallowing.\n\n- Option B: Enlarged lymph nodes might not be a good sign, especially in cancer.\n\n- Option C: Ultrasound isn't the best test to determine hormone secretion.\n\n- Option D: Functioning nodules on isotope scanning are unlikely to be cancerous.\n\nBased on this, I think option D is the correct answer. But to be thorough, I should double-check.\n\nI recall that thyroid cancer often presents as a non-functioning nodule, meaning it doesn't take up iodine well. Therefore, a functioning nodule, which does take up iodine, is less likely to be cancerous. This aligns with option D.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is D: A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
