                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about excise taxes on good X in a competitive market. I need to figure out which statement is true given that an excise tax is imposed on the production of good X. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"If the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the price rises by the amount of the tax.\" Hmm, perfectly elastic demand means that any change in price will cause an infinite change in quantity demanded. In other words, consumers are extremely sensitive to price changes. So, if the demand is perfectly elastic, and a tax is imposed on producers, who would typically pass on the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices, but in this case, because demand is perfectly elastic, any price increase would lead to zero quantity demanded. Therefore, producers can't pass on the tax to consumers; they have to absorb the entire tax themselves to keep the price the same. So, actually, the price shouldn't rise at all. Therefore, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says: \"The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is more elastic.\" Okay, so if demand is more elastic, that means consumers are more responsive to price changes. In this case, if the price increases due to the tax, consumers will reduce their quantity demanded significantly. Therefore, producers would have to absorb more of the tax to avoid losing sales. So, actually, the consumer's burden should be lower when demand is more elastic because producers are forced to absorb more of the tax. So, option B seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says: \"Consumer surplus rises as a result of the tax.\" Imposing a tax generally reduces consumer surplus because the price paid by consumers increases, and the quantity traded decreases. So, consumer surplus should decrease, not rise, due to the tax. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D says: \"The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is less elastic.\" So, if demand is less elastic, consumers are less responsive to price changes. That means even if the price increases due to the tax, consumers won't reduce their quantity demanded much. In this scenario, producers can pass on more of the tax to consumers because consumers don't have many alternatives. Therefore, the consumer's burden of the tax would be higher when demand is less elastic. This seems logical.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because with perfectly elastic demand, the price shouldn't rise; producers absorb the entire tax.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because the consumer's burden decreases as demand becomes more elastic.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because consumer surplus decreases with a tax.\n\n- Option D is correct because with less elastic demand, consumers bear more of the tax burden.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
