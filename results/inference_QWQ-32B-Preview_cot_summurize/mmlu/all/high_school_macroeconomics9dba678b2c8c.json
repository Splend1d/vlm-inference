The standard of living can often be measured by looking at the output per person, which is also known as productivity.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the output per person for each country.\n\nFor Country A:\n- Output: 1200 units\n- Population: 100 persons\n- Output per person = Output / Population = 1200 / 100 = 12 units per person\n\nFor Country B:\n- Output: 2400 units\n- Population: 400 persons\n- Output per person = Output / Population = 2400 / 400 = 6 units per person\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements one by one.\n\nA. Country A has a higher standard of living than country B.\n- Since Country A has an output per person of 12 units and Country B has 6 units per person, Country A indeed has a higher standard of living based on this measure.\n\nB. Country A has a lower standard of living than country B.\n- This is contrary to what we've calculated. Country A has a higher output per person, so this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. Country A and B have identical living standards.\n- Given that their output per person is different (12 vs. 6), their living standards are not identical. This statement is incorrect.\n\nD. Country A is less productive than country B.\n- Productivity, in this context, is measured by output per person. Since Country A has higher output per person, it is more productive, not less. This statement is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is A. Country A has a higher standard of living than country B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
