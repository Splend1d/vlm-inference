                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about changes in children's language-learning ability during the latter part of their first year. So, we're talking about around 9 to 12 months old, I think. The options are:\n\nA. They become less able to perceive sound distinctions not made in their own language.\n\nB. They begin to be sensitive to rhythms in speech patterns.\n\nC. They begin to utter their first words in a systematic progression determined by selective reinforcement of babbling.\n\nD. They begin producing more language than they can comprehend.\n\nHmm, I need to think about what typically happens in language development at this age.\n\nOption A mentions that they become less able to perceive sound distinctions not made in their own language. I recall that infants are born with the ability to distinguish sounds from all languages, but as they grow and are exposed to their native language, their perception becomes more specialized. So, by the end of the first year, they might be losing some of that ability to distinguish non-native sounds. That seems plausible.\n\nOption B says they begin to be sensitive to rhythms in speech patterns. I think that sensitivity to rhythmic patterns in language might develop earlier than this. Maybe it's already present before the end of the first year.\n\nOption C mentions that they begin to utter their first words in a systematic progression determined by selective reinforcement of babbling. Well, babbling usually starts around 6 months, and by the end of the first year, some children might be saying their first words, but it's varies a lot. Also, the idea of selective reinforcement influencing which sounds become words is interesting, but I'm not sure if that's the primary change happening in the latter part of the first year.\n\nOption D says they begin producing more language than they can comprehend. That seems unlikely because typically, understanding comes before production. Children understand more than they can say.\n\nLet me think again. The question is about changes in their language-learning ability. So, it's not just about what they're doing, but how their ability to learn language is changing.\n\nOption A seems to be about a change in perceptual abilities, which is crucial for language learning. If they're becoming less able to perceive non-native sounds, that means they're narrowing their perceptual range to focus on the sounds of their own language. That's an important change in their language-learning ability.\n\nOption B, about sensitivity to rhythms, might be something that's already present, as I said before. Maybe it's not so much a change in ability as much as a continuing development.\n\nOption C is about starting to say first words, which is a production milestone, but I'm not sure if that's the primary change in their language-learning ability.\n\nOption D doesn't make much sense to me because production typically lags behind comprehension in language development.\n\nSo, between these options, I think option A is the most accurate. Children are becoming more specialized in perceiving the sounds of their native language and less able to distinguish sounds from other languages that aren't part of their own language's phonetic inventory.\n\nI remember reading about how babies have a broad ability to distinguish sounds at birth, but over time, this ability becomes more refined and specific to their native language. This process is called perceptual narrowing or perceptual narrowing effect.\n\nFor example, Japanese infants can distinguish between the English /r/ and /l/ sounds until about 6-12 months of age, after which they lose this ability because these sounds are not phonemically distinct in Japanese.\n\nSo, in the latter part of their first year, around 9-12 months, it makes sense that children are undergoing this change in their ability to perceive sound distinctions not made in their own language.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
