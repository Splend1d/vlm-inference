                    "text": "Let's tackle this system of equations. We have:\n\n(1) \\( 888x + 889y = 890 \\)\n\n(2) \\( 891x + 892y = 893 \\)\n\nAnd we need to find \\( x - y \\). Hmm, looks a bit tricky at first glance because the coefficients are pretty close to each other. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to simplify this.\n\nFirst, I think I'll try to eliminate one of the variables to solve for the other. Let's see if subtracting one equation from the other helps.\n\nIf I subtract equation (1) from equation (2), I get:\n\n\\( (891x - 888x) + (892y - 889y) = 893 - 890 \\)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( 3x + 3y = 3 \\)\n\nOh, that's interesting. I can factor out a 3:\n\n\\( 3(x + y) = 3 \\)\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\( x + y = 1 \\)\n\nAlright, so now I know that \\( x + y = 1 \\). That's one relationship between x and y.\n\nNow, I need another equation to solve for x and y individually or to find \\( x - y \\) directly. I already have \\( x + y = 1 \\), so maybe I can find another equation involving x - y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can solve for one variable in terms of the other using \\( x + y = 1 \\) and substitute back into one of the original equations.\n\nLet me try that. From \\( x + y = 1 \\), I can express y in terms of x:\n\n\\( y = 1 - x \\)\n\nNow, substitute this into equation (1):\n\n\\( 888x + 889(1 - x) = 890 \\)\n\nLet's expand that:\n\n\\( 888x + 889 - 889x = 890 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( (888x - 889x) + 889 = 890 \\)\n\n\\( -x + 889 = 890 \\)\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n\\( -x = 890 - 889 \\)\n\n\\( -x = 1 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = -1 \\)\n\nNow, plug this back into \\( y = 1 - x \\):\n\n\\( y = 1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( y = 2 \\), so \\( x - y = -1 - 2 = -3 \\)\n\nWait a minute, that's one possible answer, but let's check if it satisfies both original equations.\n\nPlug \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( y = 2 \\) into equation (1):\n\n\\( 888*(-1) + 889*2 = -888 + 1778 = 890 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, into equation (2):\n\n\\( 891*(-1) + 892*2 = -891 + 1784 = 893 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks good. So, \\( x - y = -3 \\)\n\nBut, let's see if there's another way to approach this, maybe without solving for x and y individually.\n\nLet's consider the original equations again:\n\n(1) \\( 888x + 889y = 890 \\)\n\n(2) \\( 891x + 892y = 893 \\)\n\nI wonder if there's a way to manipulate these equations to directly find \\( x - y \\).\n\nLet's try to create a new equation that involves \\( x - y \\). Maybe I can add or subtract the equations in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express both equations in terms of x - y.\n\nWait, another idea: since I already have \\( x + y = 1 \\), and I need \\( x - y \\), maybe I can set up a system with \\( x + y = 1 \\) and another equation involving \\( x - y \\).\n\nBut, I need another equation. Maybe I can subtract a multiple of one equation from the other to eliminate y.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, equation (1):\n\n\\( 888x + 889y = 890 \\)\n\nEquation (2):\n\n\\( 891x + 892y = 893 \\)\n\nLet me try to eliminate y. To do that, I can make the coefficients of y the same in both equations and then subtract.\n\nMultiply equation (1) by 892:\n\n\\( 888x*892 + 889y*892 = 890*892 \\)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n\\( 888x*892 = 888*892x \\)\n\nLet me compute 888*892.\n\nWell, 888*892 is a big number, maybe there's a smarter way to do this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the coefficients are very close to each other.\n\nLet me look at the coefficients again:\n\nIn equation (1): 888x + 889y = 890\n\nIn equation (2): 891x + 892y = 893\n\nI notice that 891 - 888 = 3, and 892 - 889 = 3, and 893 - 890 = 3.\n\nThat's similar to what I did earlier, leading to \\( x + y = 1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the differences between the coefficients.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use Cramer's rule or matrix methods, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the equations in terms of x - y.\n\nLet me set \\( z = x - y \\), and I already have \\( x + y = 1 \\).\n\nNow, I have:\n\n\\( x + y = 1 \\)\n\n\\( x - y = z \\)\n\nI can solve for x and y in terms of z.\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n\\( (x + y) + (x - y) = 1 + z \\)\n\n\\( 2x = 1 + z \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = \\frac{1 + z}{2} \\)\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n\\( (x + y) - (x - y) = 1 - z \\)\n\n\\( 2y = 1 - z \\)\n\nSo, \\( y = \\frac{1 - z}{2} \\)\n\nNow, plug these expressions for x and y back into one of the original equations to solve for z.\n\nLet's use equation (1):\n\n\\( 888x + 889y = 890 \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( x = \\frac{1 + z}{2} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{1 - z}{2} \\):\n\n\\( 888*\\frac{1 + z}{2} + 889*\\frac{1 - z}{2} = 890 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( \\frac{888(1 + z) + 889(1 - z)}{2} = 890 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\( 888(1 + z) + 889(1 - z) = 1780 \\)\n\nExpand:\n\n\\( 888 + 888z + 889 - 889z = 1780 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( (888 + 889) + (888z - 889z) = 1780 \\)\n\n\\( 1777 - z = 1780 \\)\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\n\\( -z = 1780 - 1777 \\)\n\n\\( -z = 3 \\)\n\nSo, \\( z = -3 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( x - y = -3 \\)\n\nThis matches what I found earlier by solving for x and y individually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way to see this.\n\nLooking back at the original equations, maybe there's a pattern or a relationship that I'm missing.\n\nWait, let's consider the general form of the equations.\n\nSuppose we have:\n\n\\( ax + by = c \\)\n\n\\( dx + ey = f \\)\n\nAnd we want to find x - y.\n\nOne way is to solve for x and y in terms of a, b, d, e, c, f, but that might be too general for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to manipulate the equations to directly get x - y.\n\nAnother thought: since the coefficients are very close, maybe I can subtract a multiple of one equation from the other to isolate x - y.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nTake equation (2) minus equation (1):\n\n\\( (891x - 888x) + (892y - 889y) = 893 - 890 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 3x + 3y = 3 \\)\n\nAs before, leading to \\( x + y = 1 \\)\n\nNow, if I could find another equation that is a multiple or a different combination that gives me x - y directly, that would be great.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can add or subtract the equations in a certain way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider multiplying equation (1) by a certain factor and then adding or subtracting equation (2).\n\nLet's try multiplying equation (1) by 2:\n\n\\( 2*(888x + 889y) = 2*890 \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\( 1776x + 1778y = 1780 \\)\n\nNow, subtract equation (2):\n\n\\( 1776x + 1778y - (891x + 892y) = 1780 - 893 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( (1776x - 891x) + (1778y - 892y) = 887 \\)\n\n\\( 885x + 886y = 887 \\)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the differences in coefficients more carefully.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the initial approach is the most straightforward: solve for x + y, then solve for x and y individually or express them in terms of z = x - y.\n\nSince I already have z = -3, and that matches with the individual solutions for x and y, I think that's the answer.\n\nTherefore, the value of x - y is -3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-3} \\]"
