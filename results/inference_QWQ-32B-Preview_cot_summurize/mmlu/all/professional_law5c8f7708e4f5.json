Over the course of time, the land development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern development and a western development, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that \"the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single- family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. \"After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:\"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern development. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, grantor \u0080\u0094 land development company, its successors and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. \"At the time of this conveyance, the land development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what kind of interest the country club has in the 50-acre tract it bought from the land development company. There are four options: A. Fee simple determinable, B. Fee simple subject to condition subsequent, C. Determinable fee subject to an executory interest, and D. Easement appurtenant. I need to understand the differences between these and see which one fits the description in the deed.\n\nFirst, let's look at the deed provisions:\n\n1. The property can be used as a country club with specific features like a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, and eating facilities.\n\n2. It can also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development, with residential restrictions conforming to those in the eastern development.\n\n3. The restrictions are covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant, the grantor (land development company) may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed.\n\nSo, the country club gets this 50-acre tract with some specific uses allowed, and there are conditions attached to how it can use the land.\n\nLet's start by understanding what each of these interests means.\n\nA. Fee simple determinable: This is an estate that lasts until a specific condition occurs. When that condition occurs, the estate automatically ends without any action required by the grantor. For example, \"To A for as long as the property is used for a park.\"\n\nB. Fee simple subject to condition subsequent: This is similar to a determinable fee, but instead of automatically ending when the condition occurs, it gives the grantor the power to terminate the estate if the condition is breached. The grantor must take action to terminate it.\n\nC. Determinable fee subject to an executory interest: I'm not entirely sure about this one, but I think it might be a combination of a determinable fee and an executory interest, which is a future interest held by a third party that springs into possession when a certain condition occurs.\n\nD. Easement appurtenant: This is a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose, and it benefits the land it's attached to. For example, a right-of-way across a neighbor's property.\n\nLooking back at the deed, it says that for breach of any covenant, the grantor may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate. This sounds like the grantor has the power to terminate the estate upon breach, which suggests it's a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because the grantor must take action to terminate it.\n\nIn a fee simple determinable, the estate would automatically terminate upon the breach without any action needed from the grantor.\n\nSo, option B seems more appropriate here.\n\nBut let's consider option C: Determinable fee subject to an executory interest. I'm not entirely clear on what this means, but an executory interest is a future interest held by a third party that takes possession when a certain condition occurs. In this case, the deed doesn't mention any third party; it's between the land development company and the country club.\n\nOption D, easement appurtenant, doesn't seem to fit because an easement is a right to use land, not an ownership interest. The country club purchased a 50-acre tract, so it's more than just an easement.\n\nTherefore, between A and B, I think B is the better answer because the grantor has the power to terminate upon breach, which is characteristic of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nBut let me double-check. The deed says: \"for breach of any covenant herein, grantor... may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby.\"\n\nThis explicitly gives the grantor the power to terminate, which is consistent with a condition subsequent.\n\nIf it were a determinable fee, it would likely say something like \"so long as\" or \"until\" a certain condition occurs, and the estate would automatically terminate without any action.\n\nSo, based on this, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
