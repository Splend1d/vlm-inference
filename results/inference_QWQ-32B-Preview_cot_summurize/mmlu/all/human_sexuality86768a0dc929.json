                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about monks and nuns in both Eastern religions and Christianity. It says they affirm celibacy, virginity, and poverty, and I need to know which ethical system that follows. The options are legalism, asceticism, situationism, and hedonism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these ethical systems is about.\n\nLegalism, I think, is about following rules and laws strictly. Like, there are set rules, and you have to obey them without much question. Maybe in some religions, there are strict codes of conduct that monks and nuns have to follow, so that could be a possibility.\n\nAsceticism sounds familiar. I think it has to do with self-discipline and denying yourself worldly pleasures. Celibacy and poverty sound a lot like denying oneself physical relationships and material possessions. So, that seems very related.\n\nSituationism, I'm not sure about that. I think it's an ethical theory where the morality of an action depends on the situation. It's more about considering the context and consequences rather than following fixed rules. That doesn't seem directly related to the practices of monks and nuns.\n\nHedonism is all about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. It's the opposite of asceticism, really. Monks and nuns who practice celibacy and poverty are giving up potential pleasures for a higher purpose, so hedonism doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nGiven these brief definitions, it seems like asceticism is the most appropriate choice. Monks and nuns who choose celibacy, virginity, and poverty are practicing self-denial and discipline, which are key aspects of asceticism.\n\nBut let me double-check. In Eastern religions like Buddhism, monks renounce worldly life, including possessions and family, to seek enlightenment. Similarly, in Christianity, monks and nuns take vows of poverty, chastity, and sometimes obedience. All of these practices involve giving up personal desires and material comforts for spiritual growth.\n\nLegalism might be partially applicable because there are rules to follow, but the core of legalism is about adherence to law, not necessarily about personal sacrifice and self-denial.\n\nSituationism doesn't fit because it's more about moral decision-making based on specific situations, whereas the practices of monks and nuns are based on lifelong commitments to certain principles.\n\nHedonism is clearly opposite, as it promotes seeking pleasure, which is what monks and nuns are renouncing.\n\nTherefore, the ethical system that best describes the practices of celibacy, virginity, and poverty in both Eastern and Christian monastic orders is asceticism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
