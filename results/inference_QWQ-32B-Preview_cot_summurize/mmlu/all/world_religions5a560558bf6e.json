                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question. It's asking about a woman mystic who exemplified the all-consuming love of the divine, and it gives four options: Rumi, Rabi'a, Fatimah, and Khadija.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who each of these\u4eba\u7269 is and their significance in the context of mysticism and their relationship with the divine.\n\nStarting with Rumi: I know that Rumi was a 13th-century Persian poet, scholar, and Sufi mystic. His full name was Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi. He's famous for his poetry, which often expresses deep spiritual love and connection with the divine. However, Rumi was a man, not a woman, so he can't be the answer here.\n\nNext, Rabi'a: I think Rabi'a was a female Sufi mystic. I recall that she lived in the 8th century in Basra, which is now in Iraq. She's known for her approach to Sufism that emphasized love over fear in the relationship with God. She taught that one should love God not out of fear of punishment or hope for reward, but simply because of God's beauty and loveliness. This sounds like the kind of all-consuming love of the divine that the question is referring to. So, Rabi'a seems like a strong candidate.\n\nThen, Fatimah: She was the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad and Khadija, and she's revered in both Sunni and Shia Islam for her righteousness and compassion. While she was certainly a pious and beloved figure, I don't recall specific teachings or writings from her that focus on mysticism or the all-consuming love of the divine in the same way that Rumi or Rabi'a are known.\n\nLastly, Khadija: She was the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad and played a significant role in supporting him, both emotionally and financially, especially during the early days of Islam. She's respected for her wisdom and faith, but again, I don't recall her being particularly known for mysticism or expressing an all-consuming love of the divine in a way that would fit this description.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Rabi'a is the most appropriate answer. She was a woman mystic who is renowned for her teachings on loving God for God's own sake, without any ulterior motives, which aligns with the description of all-consuming love of the divine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
