                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a 12-ounce soft drink has 41 grams of sugar, and that's 14% of the normal daily allowance for sugar. I need to find out approximately how many grams of sugar are recommended in a normal diet. The options are A. 5.74, B. 69, C. 293, and D. 574.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, 41 grams is 14% of the normal daily allowance. I need to find out what the total normal daily allowance is. This sounds like a percentage problem, where I know the part and the percentage, and I need to find the whole.\n\nThe formula for this is:\n\nTotal allowance = (Part) / (Percentage)\n\nBut I need to make sure the percentage is in decimal form. So, 14% is 0.14 in decimal form.\n\nSo, Total allowance = 41 grams / 0.14\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n41 divided by 0.14.\n\nFirst, I can think of it as 41 divided by 14, but since 0.14 is 14/100, it's the same as 41 divided by (14/100), which is the same as 41 multiplied by (100/14).\n\nSo, 41 * (100/14) = 4100 / 14\n\nNow, let's do the division.\n\n14 goes into 41 two times (28), subtract that from 41, and get 13.\n\nBring down a 0, so it's 130.\n\n14 goes into 130 nine times (126), subtract that, and get 4.\n\nBring down another 0, so it's 40.\n\n14 goes into 40 two times (28), subtract that, and get 12.\n\nSo, 4100 divided by 14 is 292.8571..., which is approximately 293 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 293 seems to be the closest.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculation.\n\n41 / 0.14.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimal.\n\nSo, 41 / 0.14 = (41 * 100) / (0.14 * 100) = 4100 / 14\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nNow, 4100 divided by 14.\n\nLet me do the division step by step.\n\n14 * 200 = 2800\n\nSubtract that from 4100: 4100 - 2800 = 1300\n\n14 * 90 = 1260\n\nSubtract that from 1300: 1300 - 1260 = 40\n\n14 * 2 = 28\n\nSubtract that from 40: 40 - 28 = 12\n\nSo, the total is 200 + 90 + 2 = 292, with a remainder of 12.\n\nSo, 4100 divided by 14 is 292 with a remainder of 12, which is 292 and 12/14, which simplifies to 292 and 6/7, or approximately 292.857 grams.\n\nRounding that to the nearest whole number gives us 293 grams.\n\nSo, the normal daily allowance is approximately 293 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 293 matches this.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up the equation:\n\nLet x be the total normal daily allowance.\n\nThen, 14% of x is 41 grams.\n\nSo, 0.14x = 41\n\nSolving for x: x = 41 / 0.14\n\nWhich is the same calculation I did earlier.\n\nSo, no issues there.\n\nAnother way to think about percentages is to use the proportion formula:\n\nPart / Whole = Percentage / 100\n\nSo, 41 / x = 14 / 100\n\nCross-multiplying: 14x = 41 * 100\n\nSo, 14x = 4100\n\nThen, x = 4100 / 14\n\nAgain, the same calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I end up with approximately 293 grams.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 293.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility of misinterpretation in the question.\n\nThe question says \"a 12-ounce soft drink has 41 grams of sugar, which is 14% of the normal daily allowance for sugar.\" It's clear that 41 grams is 14% of the total daily allowance, and I need to find the total.\n\nAlso, the question asks for an approximate value, and 293 is clearly the closest option.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me check if 14% of 293 is approximately 41 grams.\n\nCalculating 14% of 293:\n\n0.14 * 293 = 41.02 grams\n\nWhich is very close to 41 grams, confirming that my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the recommended normal daily allowance of sugar is approximately 293 grams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
