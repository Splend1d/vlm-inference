Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I wanted my boyfriend to appreciate me, so I trashed his car.\"\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, the person is trying to get their boyfriend to appreciate them by trashing his car. Now, destroying someone's property is generally considered wrong because it causes harm to that person without their consent. It's invasive and can cause financial and emotional distress. Even if the intention was to get attention or make a point, damaging someone's belongings isn't acceptable. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I am planning to burn off some of my fat and saggy skin through running, so that I'll weigh 5 pounds less.\"\n\nHere, the person wants to improve their physical health and appearance by running to lose weight. Exercising to become healthier or to feel better about oneself is generally seen as positive and acceptable. It's a personal choice aimed at self-improvement without harming others. So, this doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. So, the correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any moral issue in Scenario 2. Some might argue that being overly focused on appearance could be unhealthy, but in this case, the person is choosing to run, which is a healthy activity, to feel better about themselves. There's no harm to others, and it's a personal decision. Therefore, it's not morally wrong.\n\nIn contrast, trashing someone's car is clearly harmful and without their consent, which makes it morally wrong.\n\nSo, I think B is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
