                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which one of these options isn't considered an addition to national income. The options are wages, salaries, interest, and depreciation of physical capital.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what national income is. National income is basically the total income earned by a country's factors of production, like labor and capital, over a specific period, usually a year. It's a way to measure the economy's performance.\n\nNow, wages and salaries are what people get paid for their work. So, that's labor income. Interest is what you earn on your savings or investments, which is related to capital. Both wages and salaries, and interest, are forms of income that people and businesses earn.\n\nDepreciation, on the other hand, is a bit different. Depreciation refers to the decrease in value of physical assets, like machinery or buildings, over time due to use or wear and tear. It's a way to account for the decline in the value of these assets.\n\nSo, when we think about additions to national income, we're looking at income that is generated and can be spent or saved by households and businesses. Wages, salaries, and interest are all forms of income that people and businesses can use. Depreciation, however, is more of a accounting entry that represents the loss in value of assets. It's not income that anyone receives; it's more like a cost.\n\nIn fact, in national income accounting, depreciation is often subtracted from gross domestic product (GDP) to get net domestic product (NDP), because it represents the amount that should be set aside to maintain the capital stock.\n\nTherefore, among the options given, depreciation of physical capital is not an addition to national income. It's more of a reduction or a cost that needs to be accounted for.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Depreciation of physical capital.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
