If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nLouis XIV was aided by many able advisors, but which of the following advisors helped him to reorganize France and make it into a world power?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about Louis XIV and his advisors. It's asking which advisor helped him reorganize France and make it into a world power. The options are Jean Martinet, Cardinal Mazarin, Jean Baptiste Colbert, and the Duke of Burgundy.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who each of these people was and what they did for Louis XIV.\n\nJean Martinet was known as Louis XIV's chief military advisor. He was famous for reforming the French army, introducing drill tactics that were widely adopted across Europe. So, he played a significant role in strengthening France's military power.\n\nCardinal Mazarin was Louis XIV's chief minister and regent during Louis's early years. He was instrumental in consolidating royal power and dealing with external threats through his diplomatic and political maneuvers. However, by the time Louis XIV took full control, Mazarin had already passed away.\n\nJean Baptiste Colbert was Louis XIV's finance minister. He is renowned for his efforts in reforming the French economy, promoting industry and trade, and centralizing financial administration. Colbert's policies were crucial in building France's economic strength and making it a major player on the international stage.\n\nThe Duke of Burgundy was a member of the royal family but wasn't specifically known for advising Louis XIV in the same way as the others mentioned. He might have had some influence, but he wasn't a primary advisor in the same league as Martinet, Mazarin, or Colbert.\n\nNow, the question is about reorganizing France and making it a world power. This suggests that the advisor in question was involved in broad reforms that enhanced France's status internationally.\n\nMartinet's focus was on the military, which certainly contributed to France's power, but the question seems to be more about overall reorganization and making France a world power, which might involve more than just military strength.\n\nCardinal Mazarin was important during Louis XIV's formative years, but since he died before Louis took full control, his direct influence in reorganizing France under Louis XIV's rule was limited.\n\nColbert, on the other hand, was deeply involved in restructuring France's economy and finance, which would have had a broad impact on the country's overall strength and its ability to project power internationally.\n\nConsidering this, it seems that Jean Baptiste Colbert is the advisor who most directly helped Louis XIV reorganize France and make it into a world power through his economic and financial reforms.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Jean Baptiste Colbert, his finance minister.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
