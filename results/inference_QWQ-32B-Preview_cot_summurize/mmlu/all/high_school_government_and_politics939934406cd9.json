This landmark case established the principle of the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel being applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Prior to this decision, only indigent defendants in federal cases were guaranteed the right to an attorney. The Gideon v. Wainwright ruling ensured that all individuals facing criminal charges, regardless of their financial status, have the right to legal representation, which is a fundamental aspect of a fair trial."
