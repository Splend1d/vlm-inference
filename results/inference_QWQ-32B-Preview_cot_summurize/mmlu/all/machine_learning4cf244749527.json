                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. Starting with Statement 1: \"The set of all rectangles in the 2D plane (which includes non axis-aligned rectangles) can shatter a set of 5 points.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a set of shapes to \"shatter\" a set of points. In the context of machine learning, particularly in computational learning theory, the concept of shattering relates to the capacity of a hypothesis class to distinguish between all possible labelings of a set of points.\n\nSo, if a set of rectangles can shatter a set of 5 points, it means that for any possible way of labeling those 5 points as positive or negative, there exists a rectangle that can separate the positive points from the negative ones.\n\nNow, considering rectangles in the 2D plane, including non-axis-aligned rectangles, I need to think about whether such rectangles can separate any possible arrangement of 5 points.\n\nLet me consider some scenarios:\n\n1. **All 5 points are in convex position:** This means no point is inside the convex hull of the other four. In this case, it might be challenging to find a rectangle that can separate certain labelings, especially if the labeling is such that points are interleaved in a way that doesn't allow a clean separation.\n\n2. **Some points are inside the convex hull of others:** This could make it easier or harder, depending on the labeling.\n\nI recall that the VC-dimension of axis-aligned rectangles is 4, meaning they can shatter any set of 4 points but not necessarily 5. However, this statement is about all rectangles, not just axis-aligned ones. So, perhaps allowing for rotation increases the expressive power.\n\nI need to think about whether there are configurations of 5 points that no rectangle, regardless of its orientation, can separate.\n\nLet's consider a specific example: suppose I have 5 points arranged in a cross shape, with one point at the center and four points at the north, south, east, and west positions. If I label the center point positive and the four outer points negative, can a rectangle separate them?\n\nIn this case, any rectangle that includes the center point will likely include at least one of the outer points, depending on its size and orientation. It might be possible to find a rectangle that includes the center but excludes the outer points, perhaps by making it very small, but I need to consider if that's always possible.\n\nAlternatively, think about points that are in general position, no three points are colinear. Even in such cases, it's not guaranteed that a rectangle can separate any arbitrary labeling.\n\nI recall that the VC-dimension of rectangles in the plane is 4, but that might be for axis-aligned rectangles. For arbitrary rectangles, including rotations, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I think the VC-dimension of arbitrary rectangles in the plane is still 4. Rotating the rectangles doesn't increase the VC-dimension beyond 4. So, it shouldn't be able to shatter any set of 5 points.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is likely false.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"The VC-dimension of k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k = 1 is infinite.\"\n\nThe k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) classifier with k=1 is a non-parametric method where the classification of a test point is determined by the class of its nearest neighbor in the training set.\n\nThe VC-dimension is a measure of the capacity of a statistical classification algorithm, defined as the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can shatter.\n\nFor k-NN with k=1, the decision function is based on the closest training point to the test point. Essentially, each training point defines a region of influence around itself, and the classification of a test point depends on which training point is closest.\n\nI need to consider whether there exists a finite number that bounds the VC-dimension of this classifier.\n\nIn the case of 1-NN, the classifier can be seen as assigning each training point its own Voronoi cell, and the classification of a test point is determined by which Voronoi cell it falls into.\n\nNow, can this classifier shatter an arbitrary number of points? In other words, can it correctly classify any possible labeling of any set of points, no matter how large, by adjusting the positions of the training points?\n\nConsider a set of points where each point is its own training example. For any labeling of these points, the 1-NN classifier will classify each test point based on its nearest training point, which is itself, assuming no two points are at the same location.\n\nIn this case, the classifier can perfectly classify any labeling of the points, because each point is its own nearest neighbor.\n\nThis suggests that the VC-dimension is infinite, as there is no finite bound on the number of points that can be shattered.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful. In practice, the positions of the training points are fixed, and the test points are classified based on their distances to these fixed training points.\n\nBut in the definition of VC-dimension, the training points can be chosen adversarially to maximize the number of shattered points.\n\nSo, if I have n training points, and I can shatter any set of n points by choosing appropriate positions for the training points, then the VC-dimension would be n.\n\nBut since n can be arbitrarily large, does that mean the VC-dimension is infinite?\n\nWait, actually, in the standard definition of VC-dimension for a classifier, the training points are fixed, and the capacity is measured based on how well the classifier can shatter points relative to these fixed training points.\n\nIn the case of 1-NN, since each test point is classified based on its nearest training point, and the training points are fixed, the classifier's capacity is not infinite.\n\nIn fact, the VC-dimension of k-NN is a complex topic, but I believe that for k=1, the VC-dimension is finite and equals the dimension of the instance space plus one.\n\nFor example, in a 2D plane, the VC-dimension would be 3.\n\nWait, I might be confusing this with other classifiers.\n\nUpon further reflection, the VC-dimension of k-NN is actually infinite when k=1, because for any set of points, you can position the training points such that each test point has a unique nearest neighbor, allowing for arbitrary labeling.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Statement 1: False\n\n- Statement 2: True\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
