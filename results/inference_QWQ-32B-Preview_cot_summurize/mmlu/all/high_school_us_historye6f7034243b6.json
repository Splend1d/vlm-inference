The civil rights movement.\n\nC. The New Right.\n\nD. The New Left.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Port Huron Statement is. From the excerpt, it seems like it's from the 1960s, and it mentions being from 1962. The statement talks about the United States being wealthy and strong, with the atom bomb, and it mentions the United Nations and American values like freedom and equality.\n\nThen, it says that as people grew up, they started to see issues like racial bigotry in the South and the threat of the Cold War and nuclear weapons. It mentions moving from complacency to activism because of these troubling events.\n\nSo, it seems like this statement is from a group of people who were concerned about social and political issues in the 1960s, particularly racial inequality and the Cold War.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nA. The labor union movement. Labor unions are about workers' rights and better working conditions. While the 1960s saw some labor activism, the excerpt doesn't mention anything about workers' rights or labor issues. It focuses more on racial equality and the Cold War. So, this seems less likely.\n\nB. The civil rights movement. This movement was indeed prominent in the 1960s, especially in the Southern United States, fighting against racial segregation and discrimination. The excerpt mentions \"the Southern struggle against racial bigotry,\" which directly relates to the civil rights movement. So, this is a strong candidate.\n\nC. The New Right. The New Right is a political movement that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, associated with conservative politics, free-market economics, and social conservatism. The Port Huron Statement is from 1962, which is before the New Right really took shape. Also, the tone of the statement seems more liberal or progressive, not conservative. So, this probably isn't the right answer.\n\nD. The New Left. The New Left was a political movement in the 1960s and 1970s, primarily among college students, that was concerned with issues like civil rights, opposition to the Vietnam War, and social justice. It was seen as a departure from the Old Left, which was more associated with labor unions and communism.\n\nGiven that the Port Huron Statement is from 1962 and talks about moving from complacency to activism regarding issues like racial bigotry and the Cold War, it sounds very much like the kind of document that would come from the New Left.\n\nBut wait, option B, the civil rights movement, also seems very relevant because it directly mentions the Southern struggle against racial bigotry.\n\nSo, which one is more accurate? Is the Port Huron Statement more specifically associated with the New Left, or with the civil rights movement?\n\nI think the New Left is a broader movement that included concerns about civil rights, but also other issues like opposition to the Vietnam War and broader social justice issues. The excerpt mentions both racial bigotry and the Cold War, which aligns with the New Left's concerns.\n\nMoreover, I recall that the Port Huron Statement was founded by Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), which was a key group in the New Left. So, that would suggest that it's more closely associated with the New Left.\n\nBut it's also important because it addresses civil rights issues, so there's overlap.\n\nHowever, the question is asking which movement it can most clearly be seen as an important document in.\n\nGiven that the New Left was a broader movement that encompassed civil rights along with other issues, and that the Port Huron Statement was a founding document of SDS, which was a New Left organization, I think the most accurate answer is D. The New Left.\n\nOption B, the civil rights movement, is certainly relevant, but the statement seems to be part of a larger critique of society and politics, not just focused on civil rights.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of the Cold War and the Bomb suggests a concern with foreign policy, which was also a key issue for the New Left, particularly in their opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is D. The New Left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
