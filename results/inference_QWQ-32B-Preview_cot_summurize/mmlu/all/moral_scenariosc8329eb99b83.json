                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"When I arrived at the party I threw confetti into the air.\"\n\nOkay, so throwing confetti at a party. Is that morally wrong? Well, confetti is often used to celebrate things like birthdays, weddings, or other festive events. It's generally considered harmless and fun. However, there might be some considerations:\n\n- Mess: Confetti can make a mess, and someone has to clean it up.\n\n- Allergies: Some people might have allergies or sensitivities to paper.\n\n- Environmental impact: While small, there is an environmental cost to producing and disposing of confetti.\n\nBut overall, in the context of a party, throwing confetti seems pretty standard and not morally wrong. It's more of a social norm issue than a moral one.\n\nScenario 2: \"I hunted a giraffe with my bow.\"\n\nHunting a giraffe with a bow. Hmm, that sounds more serious. Let's think about this.\n\nFirst, hunting wildlife is regulated by laws in the US, and giraffes are not native to the US, so hunting one would probably involve hunting in another country or perhaps in a controlled environment like a game reserve.\n\nEthical considerations:\n\n- Conservation: Giraffes are not currently endangered, but they are classified as \"vulnerable\" by the IUCN Red List. So, hunting them could have implications for their populations.\n\n- Humane treatment: Hunting with a bow might not be the most humane method, as it could cause suffering to the animal if not done properly.\n\n- Cultural and ethical views: Many people in the US have ethical concerns about hunting for sport, especially of large mammals like giraffes.\n\nLegal considerations:\n\n- International laws: Hunting giraffes in other countries would be subject to those countries' laws.\n\n- US laws: There might be import restrictions or regulations regarding bringing hunted animals into the US.\n\nGiven that, hunting a giraffe with a bow seems more likely to be considered morally wrong by ordinary standards in the US, especially considering ethical treatment of animals and conservation concerns.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Throwing confetti at a party \u2013 not morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Hunting a giraffe with a bow \u2013 morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there are some contexts where throwing confetti could be considered wrong. For example:\n\n- If the party is in a place where confetti is prohibited, like a library or a historical site.\n\n- If someone has a severe allergy to paper confetti.\n\n- If the confetti causes damage, like getting into machinery or clogging drains.\n\nHowever, in the scenario presented, it's just a party, so these considerations don't apply. So, it's still likely not wrong.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, hunting a giraffe with a bow, it's more likely to be seen as wrong due to ethical and conservation reasons.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the giraffe was being hunted in a regulated manner for population control, and the bow was used humanely. But the scenario doesn't specify that, so it's safe to assume it's for sport, which would be more controversial.\n\nTherefore, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
