                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about case studies in qualitative research. So, the key here is to identify which statement about case studies isn't correct, given that in qualitative research, theories emerge from the data rather than being imposed beforehand, and that the research helps refine hypotheses.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what a case study is in this context. A case study is an in-depth analysis of a particular case, which could be an individual, a group, an organization, or even an event. It's a detailed examination, often involving multiple methods of data collection, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject.\n\nOption A says: \"Case studies are used for attitude measurement, preferences, & satisfaction.\" Well, that sounds plausible. In market research or social sciences, case studies can indeed be used to explore people's attitudes, preferences, and satisfaction levels towards products, services, policies, etc. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"Case studies are based on the assumption that the case can be generalized.\" Hmm, this one rings a bell. In qualitative research, especially with case studies, generalizability is not typically a primary goal. Case studies often focus on in-depth understanding of a particular context or instance, and findings are usually not intended to be generalized to a larger population. Instead, they aim for transferability, meaning that readers can decide for themselves if the findings apply to similar situations. So, this statement seems incorrect because case studies don't assume that the case can be generalized.\n\nOption C: \"Case studies are most useful as pilot studies to identify variables that can be studied in other ways.\" This makes sense. Sometimes, case studies are used\u524d\u671f\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u6216\u5b9a\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u6253\u4e0b\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\nOption D: \"Case studies are a detailed examination of a single case.\" Yep, that's pretty much the definition we started with. Case studies do involve a thorough investigation of one particular case, so this is accurate.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that option B is the statement that cannot be correct about case studies. Case studies aren't based on the assumption that the case can be generalized; instead, they aim for in-depth understanding and transferability rather than generalizability.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider why generalizability isn't a focus in case studies. Qualitative research, including case studies, is often about understanding complex phenomena in their natural settings. The context is crucial, and what's true in one case may not hold in another due to differences in context. Therefore, researchers using case studies are more interested in providing rich, detailed descriptions that allow readers to see the nuances of the situation, rather than making claims that apply universally.\n\nMoreover, in qualitative research, the emphasis is on theory development from the data, as mentioned in the question. This approach, known as grounded theory, involves iteratively collecting and analyzing data to build theories that are grounded in the reality observed, rather than testing pre-existing hypotheses.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the statement that case studies are based on the assumption that the case can be generalized is incorrect. Instead, case studies typically aim for in-depth understanding and transferability of insights to similar contexts, rather than generalizing findings to a broader population.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
