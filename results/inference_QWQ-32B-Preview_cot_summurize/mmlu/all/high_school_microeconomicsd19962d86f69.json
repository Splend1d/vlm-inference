                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about beef prices and how they affect demand and consumer spending. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nSo, the price of beef rises by 10 percent, and as a result, the quantity of beef demanded falls by 20 percent. I need to conclude something about the demand for beef and how it affects consumer spending.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what price elasticity of demand means. Price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nIn this case, the price increases by 10%, and the quantity demanded decreases by 20%. So, the price elasticity of demand (PED) would be:\n\nPED = (% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in price) = (-20%) / (10%) = -2\n\nThe negative sign indicates that price and quantity demanded are inversely related, which makes sense because as price goes up, quantity demanded goes down, and vice versa. However, for the purposes of classifying elasticity, we usually consider the absolute value. So, |PED| = 2.\n\nNow, I need to know what this value tells me about the elasticity of demand. Generally:\n\n- If |PED| > 1, demand is considered elastic. This means that quantity demanded is relatively responsive to price changes.\n\n- If |PED| < 1, demand is considered inelastic. This means that quantity demanded is not very responsive to price changes.\n\n- If |PED| = 1, demand is unit elastic, meaning that percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price.\n\nIn this case, |PED| = 2, which is greater than 1, so demand for beef is price elastic.\n\nNext, I need to think about how this affects consumer spending on beef. Consumer spending is essentially the total amount that consumers are spending on beef, which is price multiplied by quantity demanded.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nP = original price\n\nQ = original quantity demanded\n\nThen, new price P' = P + 0.10P = 1.10P\n\nNew quantity demanded Q' = Q - 0.20Q = 0.80Q\n\nSo, original spending = P * Q\n\nNew spending = P' * Q' = (1.10P) * (0.80Q) = 0.88 * P * Q\n\nComparing new spending to original spending:\n\n0.88 * P * Q < P * Q\n\nSo, consumer spending on beef is falling.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that.\n\nOriginal spending: P * Q\n\nNew spending: 1.10P * 0.80Q = 0.88PQ\n\nYes, 0.88PQ is less than PQ, so consumer spending is indeed falling.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. demand for beef is price elastic and consumer spending on beef is falling.\n\nB. demand for beef is price elastic and consumer spending on beef is rising.\n\nC. demand for beef is price inelastic and consumer spending on beef is falling.\n\nD. demand for beef is price inelastic and consumer spending on beef is rising.\n\nFrom our analysis, demand is price elastic (since |PED| = 2 > 1) and consumer spending is falling (from PQ to 0.88PQ).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption B says that consumer spending is rising, but we've calculated that it's falling, so that's incorrect.\n\nOption C says demand is price inelastic, which would be the case if |PED| < 1, but here it's 2, which is elastic.\n\nOption D combines price inelastic demand with rising consumer spending, but again, our calculations show demand is elastic and spending is falling.\n\nSo, indeed, A is the correct choice.\n\nIt's also worth noting that when demand is elastic (|PED| > 1), a price increase leads to a proportionally larger decrease in quantity demanded, which results in total revenue (or consumer spending) falling. This is consistent with what we've calculated.\n\nSimilarly, if demand were inelastic (|PED| < 1), a price increase would lead to a proportionally smaller decrease in quantity demanded, resulting in total revenue rising.\n\nAnd if demand were unit elastic (|PED| = 1), a price change would not affect total revenue, since the percentage changes offset each other.\n\nSo, this example illustrates the relationship between price elasticity of demand and the effect of price changes on total revenue or consumer spending.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
