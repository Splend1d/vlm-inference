According to terms of the agreement, the broker promised to undertake best efforts to sell the estate for a purchase price of not less than $1,250,000. The contract also provided that the broker was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The brokerage agreement was effective for a period of two months. One month later, the broker notified the owner that she had found a buyer who wanted to purchase the property for $1,500,000. That same day, the broker handed the owner a real estate sales contract, signed by the buyer, in which the buyer agreed to pay $1,500,000 for the purchase of the estate. The owner investigated the buyer and discovered he had sufficient funds to purchase the estate. However, the owner changed his mind and decided not to sell the property. He told the broker that he would not sign the agreement. In addition, the owner told the broker that he was canceling their brokerage agreement because he was withdrawing the estate from the market. The owner also refused to pay the broker any commission.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the correct measure of recovery for the broker in this scenario. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a brokerage agreement between the owner and the broker. The agreement states that the broker will try to sell the estate for at least $1,250,000 and will get a 5% commission on the gross sale price if the sale goes through. The agreement is for two months.\n\nSo, one month in, the broker finds a buyer who wants to buy the estate for $1,500,000 and hands the owner a signed sales contract from the buyer. The owner checks out the buyer and finds they have enough money, but then decides not to sell and tells the broker he won't sign the agreement and is canceling their agreement.\n\nNow, the broker is suing the owner for breach of contract, and we need to determine the proper measure of recovery.\n\nOption A says nothing, because a condition precedent\u2014consummation of the sale and transfer of title\u2014hasn't occurred. But wait, the broker did find a buyer willing to buy at the desired price. So, maybe there's more to it.\n\nOption B is quantum meruit, which is like being paid for the value of the services rendered. The broker did find a buyer, so maybe the owner should pay something for that effort.\n\nOption C says $75,000, which is 5% of $1,500,000, because all conditions precedent were fulfilled when the broker produced a buyer who was ready, willing, and able to perform.\n\nOption D is similar to C but adds that the consummation condition is excused by the owner's refusal without cause to accept the buyer's offer.\n\nLet's think about what a condition precedent is. It's an event that must happen before a party's performance is due. In this case, the commission is due upon consummation of the sale and transfer of title.\n\nBut here, the broker found a buyer willing to buy at $1,500,000, which is above the minimum. The owner could have gone through with the sale, but chose not to.\n\nIn real estate brokerage agreements, there are different types: some are fee for service, others are exclusive right to sell, and others are exclusive agency.\n\nI think this is an exclusive agency agreement, where the broker is entitled to a commission only if they produce a qualified buyer.\n\nBut in this case, the owner is refusing to sell to the qualified buyer. So, is the condition precedent (consummation of the sale) still not met because the owner refused to sell, or is the broker entitled to the commission because they did their part by finding a qualified buyer?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, if the broker produces a ready, willing, and able buyer, and the owner refuses to sell without justification, the broker may be entitled to the commission as if the sale had occurred.\n\nThis seems similar to option D.\n\nOption A seems too harsh, as the broker did perform a significant part of their obligation by finding a buyer.\n\nOption B, quantum meruit, might be applicable if there was no contract for a commission, but here there is a commission specified in the agreement.\n\nOption C suggests that since the broker found a buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, which is above the minimum, the commission should be paid as if the sale occurred.\n\nOption D is similar but emphasizes that the owner's refusal without cause excuses the consummation condition.\n\nI think option D is the most accurate because it takes into account the owner's refusal without justification, which prevents the consummation of the sale.\n\nSo, the broker's proper measure of recovery would be $75,000, equivalent to 5% of $1,500,000, because the owner's refusal without cause excuses the condition precedent of consummation.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the owner had valid reasons to refuse the buyer, perhaps due to the buyer's inability to perform, that would be different. But here, the owner investigated and found the buyer had sufficient funds, so there doesn't seem to be any justification for refusing the sale.\n\nTherefore, it appears that the broker should be entitled to the commission as if the sale had occurred, which is $75,000.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
