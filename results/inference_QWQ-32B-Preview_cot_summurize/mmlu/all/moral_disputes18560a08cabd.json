                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out Hardin's approach to moral issues related to hunger and poverty. The options are consequentialist, virtue ethics, ethics of prima facie duty, or a Christian/Marxist approach. I need to decide which one best describes his view.\n\nFirst, I should recall what each of these ethical approaches entails. Consequentialism is about evaluating the outcomes or consequences of actions to determine their moral value. Utilitarianism is a prominent example, where the goal is to maximize overall happiness or utility.\n\nVirtue ethics focuses on the character and virtues of the moral agent rather than on specific actions or consequences. It's about being a good person and cultivating moral virtues.\n\nEthics of prima facie duty suggests that there are multiple duties that may conflict, and one must decide which duty is most pressing in a given situation. W.D. Ross is associated with this approach.\n\nA Christian/Marxist approach would combine elements of Christian ethics, which often emphasize love, compassion, and care for the poor, with Marxist ideas about economic equality and critique of capitalism.\n\nNow, I need to think about Hardin's views on hunger and poverty. Garrett Hardin is known for his essay \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" where he discusses how shared resources can be overused and depleted when individuals act in their own self-interest. This concept might relate to issues of hunger and poverty, especially in terms of resource distribution and population growth.\n\nHardin was concerned about overpopulation and its impact on resources, which directly relates to hunger and poverty. He argued that unrestricted reproduction could lead to resource depletion and increased poverty. His perspective seems to focus on the consequences of actions, particularly the long-term effects of population growth on available resources.\n\nGiven this, it seems like Hardin's approach is consequentialist because he evaluates policies and actions based on their outcomes regarding resource sustainability and the welfare of future generations.\n\nBut let's consider if virtue ethics could be a fit. While virtue ethics emphasizes character and virtues, Hardin's work doesn't seem to center on the moral character of individuals as much as it does on the consequences of their actions on shared resources. So, consequentialism still seems more appropriate.\n\nEthics of prima facie duty involves balancing multiple duties. Hardin might acknowledge various duties, such as the duty to reproduce and the duty to preserve resources, but his focus is more on the consequences of these actions rather than on balancing duties. Therefore, consequentialism remains the primary candidate.\n\nA Christian/Marxist approach combines religious ethics with socialist ideas. Hardin's work doesn't explicitly draw from Christian teachings or Marxist theory. His arguments are more based on economic and ecological principles, focusing on the practical consequences of resource use and population growth.\n\nMoreover, Hardin is known for advocating for limited resources and the need for regulations to prevent overuse, which aligns with consequentialist thinking that seeks the best overall outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, Hardin's approach to the moral issues of hunger and poverty is essentially consequentialist, as he evaluates actions based on their consequences for resource sustainability and the well-being of society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
