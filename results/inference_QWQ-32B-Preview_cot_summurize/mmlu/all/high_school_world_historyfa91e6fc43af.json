But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil.

                    "text": "So I've got these two passages here, one from William Bentinck, who was the Governor-General of India in 1829, and the other from George Simpson, who was the Head of the Northern Department of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1826. The question is asking about the first passage and how it undermines a commonly held assumption about Western imperialism. The options are:\n\nA. That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices\n\nB. That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits\n\nC. That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations\n\nD. That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the first passage is saying. William Bentinck is talking about the practice of Sati, which was the burning of widows on their husband's funeral pyre in some parts of India. He's contemplating whether to continue allowing this practice or to prohibit it. He acknowledges that either decision comes with a heavy responsibility. On one hand, allowing the practice means consenting to the death of hundreds of innocent people, which is horrifying. On the other hand, prohibiting it might jeopardize the safety of the British Empire in India.\n\nBentinck seems to be wrestling with the moral imperative to stop a cruel practice versus the practical considerations of maintaining political stability and security. He mentions that when they had powerful neighbors and more reason to doubt their own security, it might have been expedient to be more cautious. But now that they are supreme, he opines in favor of an open and general prohibition of Sati.\n\nSo, what does this say about commonly held assumptions about Western imperialism?\n\nOption A suggests that European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices. Well, in this case, Sati was a religious practice, and Bentinck is considering prohibiting it. So, this seems to align with option A, but the question is whether this passage undermines that assumption.\n\nOption B is about European colonizers being deeply concerned with turning profits. The passage doesn't really address economic concerns or profit-making, so perhaps this isn't directly relevant.\n\nOption C suggests that European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations. Bentinck's dilemma shows that while there might be a moral impulse to impose their own norms against such practices, there are also significant political and security considerations that might temper that eagerness.\n\nOption D is about colonizers resorting to armed force to impose their will. Again, the passage doesn't directly address the use of force.\n\nGiven this, I think option C is the most relevant. The passage suggests that even when there was a moral impulse to prohibit a native practice like Sati, European colonizers were cautious about doing so due to fears of destabilizing their rule. This contradicts the idea that they were uniformly eager to impose their cultural norms, as there were instances where they held back for practical reasons.\n\nIn contrast, option A suggests that the passage undermines the assumption that colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices. But Bentinck is considering doing exactly that\u2014interfering with Sati, which was a religious practice. So, the passage actually supports that assumption rather than undermining it.\n\nOption B isn't directly addressed in the passage, and option D is about the use of force, which isn't discussed here.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is C: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations. The passage suggests that while there was a desire to do so in the case of Sati, there were also significant reservations based on political stability and security concerns, indicating that their eagerness was not uniform and was tempered by practical considerations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
