Investment in human capital. C. Increase in production of SUVs. D. Racial discrimination. I need to figure out which one doesn't qualify as a reason for differences in wages.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a wage differential is. It's basically when people get paid different amounts for different jobs or under different circumstances. There are various reasons why this might happen, and the question is asking which one of these options isn't a valid reason for such differences.\n\nOption A is \"Higher risk job.\" I know that sometimes jobs that are more dangerous or have higher physical demands come with higher pay to compensate workers for the extra risks they're taking. So, this seems like a legitimate basis for wage differences.\n\nOption B is \"Investment in human capital.\" Human capital refers to the skills, education, and experience that a worker has. Generally, the more educated or skilled someone is, the higher their potential earnings. So, this also seems like a reasonable basis for wage differentials.\n\nOption C is \"Increase in production of SUVs.\" Hmm, this one is a bit different. It's about a specific industry or product. I'm not sure how an increase in the production of SUVs directly relates to wage differentials. Maybe if there's higher demand for SUVs, workers in that sector could earn more, but is that a general basis for wage differentials across the board? It seems more specific and perhaps not a fundamental reason like the others.\n\nOption D is \"Racial discrimination.\" Unfortunately, discrimination based on race or other factors can lead to wage disparities. This is an unfortunate reality in many societies, where certain groups are paid less for the same work. So, this is definitely a factor that can cause wage differentials, although it's an unjust one.\n\nComparing all these options, A, B, and D seem to be general factors that can affect wages across different industries and jobs. Option C, on the other hand, is specific to a particular industry or product. It's more about market demand for a specific good rather than a general principle that applies to wage differentials in general.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Increase in production of SUVs, because it's too specific and not a general basis for wage differentials like the other options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
