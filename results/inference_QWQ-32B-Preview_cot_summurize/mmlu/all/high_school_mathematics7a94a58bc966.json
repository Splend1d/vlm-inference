                    "text": "So I've got this equation to solve: \\(3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 9^{x + 2}\\). I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\(x\\). The options are 1, 2, -2, and 0.\n\nFirst, I should remember that when dealing with exponential equations, especially when the bases are the same or can be made the same, it's often helpful to set the exponents equal to each other.\n\nLooking at the equation, I see that 3 and 9 are both powers of 3. Specifically, 9 is \\(3^2\\). So, I can rewrite 9 as \\(3^2\\), which might help me have the same base on both sides of the equation.\n\nSo, \\(9^{x + 2}\\) can be rewritten as \\((3^2)^{x + 2}\\). Using the exponent rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\), this becomes \\(3^{2(x + 2)}\\).\n\nNow, my equation looks like this: \\(3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 3^{2(x + 2)}\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n\\(x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2(x + 2)\\).\n\nAlright, now I need to solve this equation for \\(x\\).\n\nFirst, expand the right side: \\(2(x + 2) = 2x + 4\\).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n\\(x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2x + 4\\).\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\(x^2 + 4x + 4 - 2x - 4 = 0\\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(x^2 + 2x = 0\\).\n\nI can factor this:\n\n\\(x(x + 2) = 0\\).\n\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = -2\\).\n\nNow, the question asks for the sum of all possible values of \\(x\\). So, I add these solutions together: \\(0 + (-2) = -2\\).\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C is -2, which seems to match my answer. However, I should double-check if these are indeed the only solutions and if I've interpreted the question correctly.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"the sum of all possible values of \\(x\\)\", and option C is -2, which is what I got. But let's see why option D, which is 0, might be tempting. Maybe there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me re-examine the steps.\n\nStarting from the original equation: \\(3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 9^{x + 2}\\).\n\nRewriting 9 as \\(3^2\\), so \\(9^{x + 2} = (3^2)^{x + 2} = 3^{2(x + 2)}\\).\n\nSo, \\(3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 3^{2(x + 2)}\\).\n\nSetting the exponents equal: \\(x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2(x + 2)\\).\n\nExpanding the right side: \\(2x + 4\\).\n\nSo, \\(x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2x + 4\\).\n\nBringing all terms to one side: \\(x^2 + 4x + 4 - 2x - 4 = 0\\).\n\nSimplifying: \\(x^2 + 2x = 0\\).\n\nFactoring: \\(x(x + 2) = 0\\).\n\nThus, \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = -2\\).\n\nSum of solutions: \\(0 + (-2) = -2\\).\n\nSeems correct. But perhaps there's another way to approach this problem, or maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider taking the logarithm of both sides, but since the bases are the same, setting the exponents equal is the straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could graph both sides and find the points of intersection, but that's more time-consuming and not necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider substituting the options back into the original equation to see which ones work.\n\nLet's try option D, which is 0.\n\nIf \\(x = 0\\), then:\n\nLeft side: \\(3^{0^2 + 4(0) + 4} = 3^{0 + 0 + 4} = 3^4 = 81\\).\n\nRight side: \\(9^{0 + 2} = 9^2 = 81\\).\n\nSo, \\(x = 0\\) is a solution.\n\nNow, option C is -2.\n\nIf \\(x = -2\\), then:\n\nLeft side: \\(3^{(-2)^2 + 4(-2) + 4} = 3^{4 - 8 + 4} = 3^{0} = 1\\).\n\nRight side: \\(9^{-2 + 2} = 9^{0} = 1\\).\n\nSo, \\(x = -2\\) is also a solution.\n\nNow, are there any other solutions? Let's see.\n\nFrom the equation \\(x(x + 2) = 0\\), the only solutions are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = -2\\). So, no other solutions exist.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of \\(x\\) is indeed \\(0 + (-2) = -2\\).\n\nBut the question is asking for the sum of all possible values of \\(x\\), and according to my calculation, it's -2. However, option D is 0, which might be misleading because it's one of the solutions, but not the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted differently.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider if there are any restrictions on \\(x\\). For example, are there any values of \\(x\\) that would make the exponents undefined or anything like that? In this case, since the exponents are all polynomials, they're defined for all real numbers, so no restrictions there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider if both solutions satisfy the original equation, which they do, as I've checked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing if I know that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is \\(-b/a\\). In this case, the equation I ended up with was \\(x^2 + 2x = 0\\), so \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), and the sum of the roots is \\(-2/1 = -2\\), which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C, -2.\n\nBut why is option D, 0, included? Maybe because 0 is one of the solutions, but the question asks for the sum of all possible values, not the individual solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options, or perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, let's read the question again: \"Solve for the sum of all possible values of \\(x\\) when \\(3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 9^{x + 2}\\).\"\n\nIt clearly asks for the sum of all possible values of \\(x\\), and according to my calculations, it's -2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C, -2.\n\nBut to ensure completeness, let's consider if the equation can be manipulated differently.\n\nStarting again with \\(3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 9^{x + 2}\\), and since \\(9 = 3^2\\), we have \\(3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 3^{2(x + 2)}\\).\n\nSetting the exponents equal: \\(x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2x + 4\\).\n\nSimplifying: \\(x^2 + 2x = 0\\), which factors to \\(x(x + 2) = 0\\), giving \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = -2\\).\n\nSum is -2.\n\nAlternatively, completing the square for the exponent on the left side:\n\n\\(x^2 + 4x + 4 = (x + 2)^2\\).\n\nSo, \\(3^{(x + 2)^2} = 9^{x + 2} = 3^{2(x + 2)}\\).\n\nSo, \\(3^{(x + 2)^2} = 3^{2(x + 2)}\\).\n\nSetting the exponents equal: \\((x + 2)^2 = 2(x + 2)\\).\n\nSubtracting \\(2(x + 2)\\) from both sides: \\((x + 2)^2 - 2(x + 2) = 0\\).\n\nFactoring: \\((x + 2)(x + 2 - 2) = (x + 2)x = 0\\).\n\nAgain, \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = -2\\).\n\nSum is -2.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{\\text{C}}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{-2}\\]"
