                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about fungi isn't true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"They all are eukaryotic.\" I know that eukaryotic means their cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Fungi are indeed eukaryotes; that's a basic characteristic of them. So, this seems true.\n\nOption B says, \"They all have rigid cell walls.\" I recall that fungal cells do have cell walls, and they are usually made of chitin or other polymers. So, this also seems correct.\n\nOption C says, \"Most are filamentous.\" I think of molds, which are filamentous, but there are also yeasts, which are single-celled. But overall, a lot of fungi are filamentous, so maybe this is mostly true.\n\nOption D says, \"Some are photosynthetic.\" Now, photosynthesis is something plants do, right? Fungi don't have chlorophyll, as far as I know, so they can't perform photosynthesis. They obtain their nutrients by absorbing organic compounds from other organisms. So, this seems false.\n\nWait a minute, but are there any exceptions? Maybe some fungi have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic organisms. For example, lichens are a partnership between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria, where the algae or cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis. But the fungal partner itself isn't photosynthetic.\n\nAnother thing is, some fungi might live in symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms, but the fungus itself doesn't perform photosynthesis. So, I think it's safe to say that no fungi are photosynthetic.\n\nTherefore, the statement that \"some are photosynthetic\" is not true for fungi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
