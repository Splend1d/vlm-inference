So, I know that the EU has achieved a lot over the years, like creating a single market and introducing a common currency. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A is \"The introduction of a common currency used by many EU countries.\" I believe this refers to the Euro, which is used by a majority of EU member states. That's definitely a big milestone for the EU, promoting economic integration and stability. So, that seems like a key achievement.\n\nOption B is \"A customs union.\" Now, a customs union is when countries agree to have the same external trade policies and typically eliminate tariffs among themselves. The EU has a customs union among its members, which is crucial for their single market. So, that's another important milestone.\n\nOption C is \"A single market.\" The EU's single market is designed to allow the free movement of goods, services, people, and capital across member states. This is fundamental to the EU's structure and has been a major goal since the beginning. Definitely a key milestone.\n\nOption D is \"A common European language.\" Hmm, this is interesting. The EU does promote multilingualism and has several official languages, but it doesn't have a single common language that everyone has to speak. While English is widely used in EU institutions, there isn't a mandate for a common language like there is for the common currency or the single market.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems like the introduction of a common currency, the creation of a customs union, and the development of a single market are all major milestones in the EU's history. However, having a common European language isn't something that the EU has achieved or even really pursued in the same way.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D: A common European language.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
