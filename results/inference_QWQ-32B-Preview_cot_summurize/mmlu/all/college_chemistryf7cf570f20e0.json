                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Which of the following is always true of a spontaneous process?\" And there are four options:\n\nA. The process is exothermic.\n\nB. The process does not involve any work.\n\nC. The entropy of the system increases.\n\nD. The total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about what defines a spontaneous process in thermodynamics. I remember that spontaneous processes are those that occur naturally without any external intervention, and they tend to proceed in a certain direction until they reach equilibrium.\n\nOption A says that the process is exothermic. Exothermic means that the process releases heat to the surroundings. While many spontaneous processes are exothermic, like burning wood or freezing water, I think there are exceptions. For example, melting ice at temperatures above freezing is spontaneous, but it's endothermic because it absorbs heat. So, not all spontaneous processes are exothermic. Therefore, option A might not always be true.\n\nOption B says that the process does not involve any work. Hmm, work in thermodynamics usually refers to energy transfer due to expansion or compression, like in a piston. But spontaneous processes can involve work. For example, a gas expanding into a vacuum does work against the surroundings. Wait, actually, in a vacuum, there's no opposition, so maybe no work is done. But in other cases, like a gas expanding against a piston, work is involved. I need to think carefully here. Maybe this option isn't always true either.\n\nOption C says that the entropy of the system increases. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy of a closed system tends to increase over time. However, for a spontaneous process, it's not just about the entropy of the system but also the surroundings. For example, in an exothermic reaction, the system releases heat, which increases the entropy of the surroundings. So, even if the entropy of the system decreases, the total entropy can still increase. Therefore, option C might not always be true because the entropy of the system itself doesn't have to increase, as long as the total entropy does.\n\nOption D says that the total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases. This seems promising. The second law of thermodynamics states that in any spontaneous process, the total entropy of the universe (which includes the system and the surroundings) must increase. This makes sense because entropy is a state function, and for a spontaneous process to occur, the total entropy must go up.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Option A: Not always true, since some spontaneous processes are endothermic.\n\n- Option B: Not necessarily true, as spontaneous processes can involve work.\n\n- Option C: Not always true, because the entropy of the system can decrease as long as the entropy of the surroundings increases more.\n\n- Option D: This seems to align with the second law of thermodynamics and should always be true for spontaneous processes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. The total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
