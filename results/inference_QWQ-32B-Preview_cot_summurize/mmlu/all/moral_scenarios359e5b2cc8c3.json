                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"I had sex at home.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether having sex at home is morally wrong. In the US, sexual activities between consenting adults in private are generally considered acceptable. As long as both parties are consenting and it's not involving anyone else without their permission, it's usually not considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, in this case, unless there are additional circumstances (like involving minors, non-consenting partners, or other factors), having sex at home seems not wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"As my grandparents slept, I egged their laundry.\"\n\nThis one sounds a bit more problematic. Egging someone's property, especially while they are sleeping, could be seen as vandalism or at least as a mischievous act. Damaging someone's belongings without their consent is generally considered wrong.\n\nBut, in this case, it's \"egging their laundry.\" Egging usually means throwing eggs at something, which can be messy and damaging. So, egging their laundry could ruin their clothes or make a mess in their laundry area.\n\nThis seems like it's causing harm or at least inconvenience to your grandparents, and without their consent, that would typically be considered wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat would correspond to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way that having sex at home could be wrong? Well, if it's consensual and between adults, probably not. But if, for example, it's loud and disturbs others, that could be an issue. However, the scenario doesn't mention any disturbance to others, so I'll stick with not wrong.\n\nAs for egging your grandparents' laundry, that seems clearly wrong because it's damaging their property and potentially causing them stress or inconvenience.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
