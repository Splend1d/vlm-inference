I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I am sneaking in narcotic drugs into a prison and selling them to prisoners.\n\nScenario 2: I told my son to turn on the lawnmower before clearing the blades.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, let's look at Scenario 1. Sneaking in narcotic drugs into a prison and selling them to prisoners. Hmm, that sounds pretty bad. Prisons have strict rules against drugs because they can cause a lot of problems, like addiction, violence, and health issues among prisoners. Plus, selling drugs is illegal in general. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I told my son to turn on the lawnmower before clearing the blades. Hmm, this one is a bit confusing. At first glance, it seems like bad advice because it could be dangerous. Clearing the blades of a lawnmower while it's on could be hazardous, possibly leading to injury. So, telling someone to do that might not be safe or responsible.\n\nBut, maybe there's more to it. Maybe \"clearing the blades\" means removing debris or checking them, which should probably be done when the lawnmower is off for safety reasons. So, instructing someone to turn it on before doing that seems risky.\n\nHowever, perhaps in some contexts, it's necessary to start the lawnmower to check if it's working properly or something like that. But even then, safety precautions should be taken. Overall, it seems like questionable advice, but I'm not sure if it's clearly morally wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems unequivocally wrong, while Scenario 2 is more ambiguous. So, if I had to choose, I'd say Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong, although it might be unwise.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe Scenario 2 is worse than I thought. If I told my son to turn on the lawnmower before clearing the blades, and he gets hurt as a result, that could be morally wrong because I put him in danger. But if no harm came from it, maybe it's just poor judgment rather than a morally wrong action.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Scenario 2 is not clearly morally wrong, especially if no actual harm occurred. So, I think B is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
