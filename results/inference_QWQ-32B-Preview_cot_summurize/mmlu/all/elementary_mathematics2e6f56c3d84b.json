The options are:\n\nA. $649\n\nB. $6,049\n\nC. $6,409\n\nD. $6,490\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"six thousand forty-nine\" means in numbers.\n\nI know that \"thousand\" means 1,000, so six thousand is 6,000.\n\nThen, \"forty\" is 40, and \"nine\" is 9.\n\nSo, putting it all together, six thousand forty-nine should be 6,049.\n\nLet me check the options:\n\nA. $649 \u2013 That's only six hundred forty-nine dollars, which is less than a thousand. That can't be right.\n\nB. $6,049 \u2013 That matches what I thought: six thousand forty-nine.\n\nC. $6,409 \u2013 That's six thousand four hundred nine, which is different.\n\nD. $6,490 \u2013 That's six thousand four hundred ninety, which is also different.\n\nSo, the correct choice should be B. $6,049.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. In numbers, six thousand forty-nine is written as 6,049.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Six thousand is 6,000\n\n- Forty is 40\n\n- Nine is 9\n\n- So, 6,000 + 40 + 9 = 6,049\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nOption A is too small, C and D have different amounts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $6,049.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
