                    "text": " So I've got this question here about purchasing strategies, and it's asking about a specific strategy where the buyer is all about getting the lowest price and promotes competition among suppliers to achieve that. The options are A. 'Bargainer' purchasing, B. 'Adaptor' purchasing, C. 'Price minimizer' purchasing, and D. 'Projector' purchasing. I need to figure out which one of these matches the description.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these strategies entails. The question mentions that there are six principal purchasing strategies identified by Svahn and Westerlund in 2009. I don't remember all of them off the top of my head, so I might need to look that up or recall based on what I know about purchasing behaviors.\n\nLet's start by understanding the description provided: the buyer is efficiency-oriented, and the main goal is to seek the lowest price for the offering. To achieve this, the buyer encourages competition among several potential suppliers. So, it's all about getting the best price through competition.\n\nOption A is 'Bargainer' purchasing. Bargaining typically involves negotiation to get the best price, which aligns somewhat with promoting competition among suppliers. But I'm not sure if this is the exact match.\n\nOption B is 'Adaptor' purchasing. Adaptor might suggest that the buyer is adaptable and adjusts to different supplier offerings, but it doesn't necessarily emphasize the lowest price or competition.\n\nOption C is 'Price minimizer' purchasing. This sounds directly related to seeking the lowest price, which matches the description perfectly.\n\nOption D is 'Projector' purchasing. I'm not sure what this entails, but it doesn't sound like it's focused on price minimization or competition among suppliers.\n\nGiven this initial thought process, option C seems to be the most straightforward match. However, I should double-check the other options to ensure that I'm not missing something.\n\nLet me consider 'Bargainer' purchasing again. While bargaining does involve negotiating prices, it might not necessarily involve promoting competition among multiple suppliers. It could be more about negotiating with a single supplier to get a better deal. So, perhaps 'Price minimizer' is a better fit.\n\n'Adaptor' purchasing might involve adapting to different suppliers, but again, it doesn't\u5f3a\u8c03\u6700\u4f4e\u4ef7\u683c\u6216\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\n\n'Projector' purchasing \u2013 I'm not familiar with this term in the context of purchasing strategies. Maybe it refers to projecting future needs and planning purchases accordingly, which wouldn't focus on price minimization.\n\nBased on this analysis, 'Price minimizer' purchasing seems to be the strategy that aligns with the description provided. It's directly aimed at achieving the lowest price through competitive sourcing.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there might be another term that encompasses both the focus on low price and the promotion of competition among suppliers. Maybe 'Bargainer' purchasing involves more than just negotiating with a single supplier, but encouraging multiple suppliers to compete.\n\nLet me think about real-world examples. In procurement, when a company issues an RFP (Request for Proposal) and invites multiple suppliers to bid, they're promoting competition to get the best price. This is often referred to as competitive bidding or tendering. The primary goal is to minimize costs by selecting the supplier offering the lowest price, assuming all other factors are equal.\n\nIn this context, 'Price minimizer' sounds like the most appropriate term. It directly reflects the objective of seeking the lowest price through competitive sourcing.\n\nAlternatively, 'Bargainer' could refer to a more direct negotiation approach, possibly with fewer suppliers or even a single supplier, to drive down the price. But the description specifies that the buyer promotes competition among several potential suppliers, which suggests a more competitive bidding process.\n\nTherefore, I think 'Price minimizer' purchasing is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there's any overlap between these strategies or if they are mutually exclusive. Maybe 'Bargainer' purchasing could encompass 'Price minimizer' purchasing, but based on the options provided, they are presented as distinct strategies.\n\nAlso, it's possible that Svahn and Westerlund defined these terms differently in their 2009 work. If I had access to the original source, I could look up their definitions, but since I don't, I have to rely on my understanding of the terms.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option C, 'Price minimizer' purchasing, as the strategy that best matches the description provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
