                    "text": "Let's think about these two scenarios and see which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I hid my toddler's birthday presents in my teenager's closet.\" Hmm, hiding birthday presents in a teenager's closet\u2014why would someone do that? Maybe the parent wants to keep the presents safe from the toddler before the birthday, or perhaps they don't trust the teenager not to peek. But is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, morally wrong implies some kind of ethical breach, like harming someone or violating their rights. In this case, hiding the presents in the teenager's closet doesn't seem to directly harm anyone. The teenager might feel inconvenienced if their closet is used for storage, but it's their own closet, right? Unless there's more context suggesting that the teenager has a right to privacy or that the parent is misusing their authority, it doesn't appear to be morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I poured sand on the campfire before leaving.\" This seems like a responsible action. When you're camping, it's important to make sure the fire is completely out before leaving to prevent forest fires or other hazards. Pouring sand on the campfire is a standard way to extinguish it properly. So, this action appears to be cautious and considerate of others' safety and the environment.\n\nGiven that, it seems like neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong. Hiding the presents might be unusual, but not morally wrong, and pouring sand on the campfire is actually a responsible thing to do.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In scenario 1, if the teenager's closet is private space and the parent is invading that without permission, maybe that's an issue. But generally, parents have authority over the household and can decide how spaces are used, especially if it's for a good reason like keeping presents safe.\n\nIn scenario 2, there's really no moral wrongdoing; it's a safety precaution.\n\nYeah, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
