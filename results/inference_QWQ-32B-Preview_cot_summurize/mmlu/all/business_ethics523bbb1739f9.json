It's about a system of exchange that ensures producers in developing countries get a living wage, decent working conditions, and opportunities for community development. The options are sustainable sourcing, fair trade, ethical sourcing, and supply chain responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nSustainable sourcing sounds like getting materials or products in a way that considers the environment and possibly social impacts, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nFair trade I've heard of before. I think it's a movement that aims to help producers in developing countries by paying them fair prices for their products, ensuring better trading conditions, and promoting sustainable farming practices.\n\nEthical sourcing seems similar to fair trade, focusing on ethical considerations in the supply chain, like ensuring workers are treated well and paid properly.\n\nSupply chain responsibility might be about ensuring that the entire supply chain operates in an ethical and sustainable manner, from raw materials to the final product.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it mentions guaranteeing a living wage, decent working conditions, and opportunities for community development for producers in developing countries.\n\nFair trade definitely aligns with that, as I recall it emphasizes fair prices, good working conditions, and investments in community development.\n\nSustainable sourcing might include some of these aspects, especially environmental sustainability, but the question seems more focused on social aspects.\n\nEthical sourcing also sounds relevant, as it should consider the treatment of workers and their wages.\n\nSupply chain responsibility is broad and could encompass all of these, but again, the question seems specifically about social guarantees for producers in developing countries.\n\nPerhaps fair trade is the most precise answer here, as it is specifically designed to address the needs of producers in developing countries by ensuring they receive fair prices and have access to decent working conditions and community development opportunities.\n\nLet me double-check by considering each option again.\n\nSustainable sourcing: focuses more on environmental sustainability, but may also include social considerations.\n\nFair trade: directly aims to support producers in developing countries with fair wages and working conditions.\n\nEthical sourcing: broadly about ethical practices in sourcing, which could include fair treatment of workers.\n\nSupply chain responsibility: encompasses the entire supply chain, ensuring ethical and sustainable practices throughout.\n\nGiven that the question specifies \"guaranteeing producers in developing countries a living wage, decent working conditions and opportunities for community development,\" fair trade seems to be the most targeted option for this description.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. Fair trade.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
