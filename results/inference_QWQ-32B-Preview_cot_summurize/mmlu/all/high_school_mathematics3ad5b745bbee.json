                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a bill of $60 before tax, and we need to find out how much the tip would be using two different methods: the standard 15% tip and the method where people double the sales tax of 8.25%. Then, we'll see how much more the second method is compared to the first, in cents.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard tip of 15% on a $60 bill.\n\nStandard tip = 15% of $60\n\nTo find 15% of 60, we can multiply 60 by 0.15.\n\nStandard tip = 60 * 0.15 = 9\n\nSo, the standard tip is $9.\n\nNext, let's find out what happens when people double the sales tax to calculate the tip.\n\nThe sales tax is 8.25%, so doubling that would be 2 * 8.25% = 16.5%\n\nSo, the tip calculated by doubling the sales tax is 16.5% of $60.\n\nTip by doubling tax = 16.5% of $60\n\nTo find 16.5% of 60, we can multiply 60 by 0.165.\n\nTip by doubling tax = 60 * 0.165\n\nLet me do that multiplication.\n\n60 * 0.165 = 9.9\n\nSo, the tip by doubling the tax is $9.90.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more this is than the standard tip.\n\nDifference = Tip by doubling tax - Standard tip\n\nDifference = 9.90 - 9.00 = 0.90\n\nSo, the difference is $0.90, which is 90 cents.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 90\n\nB. 80\n\nC. 70\n\nD. 60\n\nIt seems like the answer should be A. 90.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, standard tip: 15% of 60 is indeed 9.\n\nThen, doubling the sales tax: 2 * 8.25% = 16.5%\n\n16.5% of 60: 60 * 0.165 = 9.90\n\nDifference: 9.90 - 9.00 = 0.90, which is 90 cents.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some places, sales tax might be applied differently, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Many people in California find the tip by doubling the sales tax, which is 8.25%. By how many cents does this exceed the standard tip on a bill of $60 before tax?\"\n\nSo, it's clear that the sales tax is 8.25%, and people double that to get the tip percentage, which is 16.5%, and then apply it to the bill before tax.\n\nI think I've done it correctly.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the sales tax is included in the bill or not.\n\nWait, the bill is before tax, so the tip is based on the pre-tax amount.\n\nSo, my calculations should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret \"doubling the sales tax.\"\n\nWait, sales tax is 8.25%. Doubling that would be 16.5%.\n\nSo, tip is 16.5% of the bill.\n\nStandard tip is 15% of the bill.\n\nBill is $60.\n\nSo, tip by doubling tax is 16.5% of 60 = 9.90\n\nStandard tip is 15% of 60 = 9.00\n\nDifference is 0.90, which is 90 cents.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 90.\n\nBut since the options are in cents, and 90 cents is 90, that matches option A.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n## Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
