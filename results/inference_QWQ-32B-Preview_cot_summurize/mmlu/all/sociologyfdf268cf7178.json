The options are:\n\nA. a minority group who fill all the top positions of political authority\n\nB. a coalition of social forces with specific skills and abilities\n\nC. a group who circulate between high status positions and exclude others\n\nD. all of the above\n\nI need to recall what Mosca and Pareto said about the ruling elite in their political theories.\n\nFirst, let's think about Mosca. He was an Italian political scientist who developed the theory of the political class or the ruling elite. According to Mosca, in every society, there is a small group of people who hold the most political power and influence. This group is made up of the most capable and talented individuals who are able to acquire and maintain power through their skills and abilities.\n\nSo, option B seems relevant here: \"a coalition of social forces with specific skills and abilities.\" That aligns with Mosca's view that the ruling elite consists of people who have the necessary talents and abilities to govern.\n\nNow, Pareto was another Italian sociologist who also wrote about elites. He introduced the concept of the \"circulation of elites,\" which suggests that while the ruling elite may change over time, the overall structure of elite rule remains the same. Pareto believed that elites are characterized by their ability to exercise power and influence, and that they are distinct from the masses.\n\nOption C mentions \"a group who circulate between high status positions and exclude others,\" which seems to correspond with Pareto's idea of the circulation of elites. So, that appears to be another accurate description.\n\nOption A says, \"a minority group who fill all the top positions of political authority.\" Both Mosca and Pareto would likely agree with this statement, as they viewed the ruling elite as a small minority that holds all the key positions of power in society.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and C each capture different aspects of Mosca and Pareto's views on the ruling elite, it seems that the best answer would be D. all of the above.\n\nTo confirm, let's review each option:\n\nA. Mosca and Pareto both saw the ruling elite as a small minority that holds all the top positions of political authority.\n\nB. Mosca emphasized that the elite is a coalition of social forces with specific skills and abilities.\n\nC. Pareto's concept of the circulation of elites suggests that they move between high-status positions while excluding others from these positions.\n\nTherefore, all three options accurately describe the ruling elite according to Mosca and Pareto's theories.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
