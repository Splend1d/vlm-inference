                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about the admissibility of a witness's prior conviction for impeachment purposes in a criminal trial in Florida. The witness, Sally, has a conviction for vehicular homicide, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 5 years in state imprisonment. She pleaded nolo contendere and received a suspended sentence. The question is asking whether evidence of this conviction is admissible to impeach Sally's testimony.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules regarding the impeachment of witnesses with prior convictions. In Florida, as in many jurisdictions, the rules of evidence govern what can be used to impeach a witness's credibility. Specifically, Florida Evidence Code Section 90.610 deals with attacking the credibility of a witness.\n\nUnder Section 90.610(1), a witness's credibility can be attacked by evidence of a criminal conviction if the crime involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment. However, if the crime did not involve dishonesty or false statement, the evidence is admissible only if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year, and the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant.\n\nIn this case, Sally is a witness for the prosecution, not the defendant. So, the concerns about prejudicing the defendant might be different compared to if Sally were the defendant.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.\"\n\nVehicular homicide is a felony in Florida, and it carries a maximum penalty of up to 5 years in prison, which is more than one year. So, under the general rule, evidence of this conviction could be used to impeach Sally's credibility because it is a crime punishable by more than one year in prison.\n\nBut I need to consider whether vehicular homicide involves dishonesty or false statement. Vehicular homicide typically involves reckless driving leading to death, which doesn't inherently involve dishonesty or false statement. Therefore, the probative value of the conviction for impeachment purposes must be weighed against its prejudicial effect.\n\nHowever, since Sally is a witness for the prosecution and not the defendant, the prejudicial effect might be less concerning. The main issue would be whether the conviction is relevant to her credibility and whether its probative value outweighs any potential prejudice to Sally or the prosecution's case.\n\nOption B says: \"inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.\"\n\nNolo contendere means \"no contest,\" which is a plea where the defendant doesn't admit guilt but accepts the punishment as if guilty. In many jurisdictions, a nolo contendere plea can still be used to impeach a witness's credibility because it results in a conviction.\n\nFlorida Evidence Code Section 90.610(2) states that \"the giving of testimony by a witness is subject to cross-examination as to matters relating thereto that concern the witness's character for honesty or trait of character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.\" It also allows for the introduction of evidence of a conviction under certain conditions, regardless of the type of plea.\n\nSo, even though Sally pleaded nolo contendere, the conviction can still be used for impeachment purposes.\n\nOption C says: \"inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.\"\n\nA suspended sentence means that the judge orders a period of incarceration but suspends its execution, often placing the defendant on probation instead. The fact that Sally received a suspended sentence doesn't necessarily make the conviction inadmissible for impeachment purposes.\n\nUnder Florida law, the imposition of a sentence, including a suspended sentence, is part of the conviction and can be considered when determining the admissibility of the conviction for impeachment.\n\nOption D says: \"inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.\"\n\nThis option suggests that because Sally is a witness and not the defendant, her prior convictions cannot be used to impeach her testimony. However, this is not accurate.\n\nIn fact, witness impeachment is a standard practice in trials, and prior convictions can be used to challenge a witness's credibility, regardless of whether the witness is associated with the prosecution or the defense.\n\nFlorida Evidence Code allows for the impeachment of any witness, including those called by the prosecution, by evidence of prior convictions under the circumstances outlined in the code.\n\nGiven all this, option A seems to be the correct answer: evidence of Sally's conviction is admissible to impeach her because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of one year.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there are any additional factors that might make the conviction inadmissible.\n\nFor example, the age of the conviction could be a factor. Some jurisdictions have rules about the remoteness of a conviction affecting its admissibility. In Florida, Evidence Code Section 90.610(4) provides that evidence of a conviction is inadmissible if a period of more than 10 years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify how long ago the conviction occurred, I'll assume it's within the 10-year limit.\n\nAnother consideration is the impeachment value of the conviction. Since vehicular homicide doesn't involve dishonesty or false statement, its relevance to Sally's truthfulness might be somewhat tenuous. However, because it is a felony punishable by more than one year in prison, it can still be used for impeachment purposes, subject to the court's discretion balancing its probative value against prejudicial effect.\n\nIn this case, since Sally is a witness for the prosecution, and the crime she's testifying about is extortion by a former police officer, her credibility is likely to be crucial. The prosecution would want to ensure that Sally is perceived as credible, but the defense would certainly want to challenge her credibility if possible.\n\nTherefore, the defense would probably seek to introduce evidence of Sally's prior conviction to suggest that she has a history of reckless behavior or disregard for the law, which might call into question her truthfulness or reliability as a witness.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, option A seems to be the correct answer: the evidence of Sally's conviction is admissible to impeach her because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of one year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
