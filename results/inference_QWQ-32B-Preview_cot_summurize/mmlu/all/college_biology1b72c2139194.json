                    "text": "Let's see what mycorrhizal fungi do for plants. I know that mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between fungi and plant roots. So, they must be doing something beneficial for both parties.\n\nOption A says they protect plant roots from desiccation in extremely dry habitats. Hmm, that seems possible. Fungi might help retain moisture around the roots. But I think their main role is related to nutrient uptake.\n\nOption B mentions nitrogen fixation. I know that some fungi can fix nitrogen, but I'm not sure if mycorrhizal fungi are primarily known for that. Maybe they help plants access nitrogen in some way, but I think there's a more direct benefit.\n\nOption C talks about providing access to phosphorus. Phosphorus is indeed an essential element for plants, and it's often limited in soils. I recall that mycorrhizal fungi can extend the root system's reach into the soil, helping plants absorb nutrients like phosphorus that are immobile in soil.\n\nOption D says they provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen. Wait, isn't it usually the plants that provide carbon to the fungi in the form of sugars, and the fungi provide nutrients like phosphorus to the plants? So, this seems a bit off.\n\nLet me think again. The symbiosis between mycorrhizal fungi and plants typically involves the plant providing carbohydrates to the fungi, and the fungi enhancing the plant's nutrient and water uptake, particularly phosphorus.\n\nSo, option C seems the most accurate. They provide access to phosphorus, which is essential and often limited in many soils.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider option A again. While fungi might help retain some moisture, their primary role isn't desiccation protection. That's more related to drought tolerance mechanisms in plants themselves.\n\nOption B about nitrogen fixation\u2014while some fungi can fix nitrogen, mycorrhizal fungi are not primarily known for this function. Legumes have a symbiosis with rhizobia bacteria for nitrogen fixation, not fungi.\n\nOption D has the roles reversed. Plants produce carbon through photosynthesis and supply it to the fungi, who in return help with nutrient uptake.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
