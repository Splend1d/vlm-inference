                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"What is the measure of an angle that turns through 3/4 of a complete circle?\" And there are four options: A. 34\u00b0, B. 43\u00b0, C. 75\u00b0, and D. 270\u00b0. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how many degrees are in a full circle. I think a full circle is 360 degrees. Yeah, that sounds right. So, if a complete circle is 360 degrees, and the angle turns through 3/4 of that circle, I need to find 3/4 of 360 degrees.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nAngle measure = (3/4) \u00d7 360\u00b0\n\nNow, I can calculate that. First, I'll find out what 1/4 of 360 degrees is, and then multiply that by 3.\n\n1/4 of 360\u00b0 is 360\u00b0 \u00f7 4 = 90\u00b0.\n\nSo, 3/4 would be 90\u00b0 \u00d7 3 = 270\u00b0.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there any other way to think about this? Maybe I should consider the concept of angles in a circle.\n\nI know that a full circle is 360\u00b0, a half circle is 180\u00b0, which is a straight angle, and a quarter circle is 90\u00b0, which is a right angle. So, if 1/4 is 90\u00b0, then 3/4 should indeed be 270\u00b0.\n\nLet me double-check my calculation just to be sure. 3/4 times 360\u00b0:\n\n(3 \u00d7 360\u00b0) / 4 = (1080\u00b0) / 4 = 270\u00b0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 34\u00b0 - That's way too small.\n\nB. 43\u00b0 - Still too small.\n\nC. 75\u00b0 - That's bigger than 43\u00b0, but still less than a right angle, which is 90\u00b0.\n\nD. 270\u00b0 - That matches my calculation.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 270\u00b0.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's a trick here. Does \"turns through\" mean something different? I think it just means the angle measures that fraction of the circle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're thinking about fractions differently, but no, 3/4 of 360\u00b0 is clearly 270\u00b0.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that 1/4 is 90\u00b0, so 3/4 would be 270\u00b0.\n\nAlternatively, if you think about the angle in terms of radians, a full circle is 2\u03c0 radians, so 3/4 of that would be (3/4)\u00d72\u03c0 = 3\u03c0/2 radians. But the question is in degrees, so 3\u03c0/2 radians is equivalent to 270\u00b0.\n\nWait, but the options are all in degrees, so that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're expecting the answer in terms of the remaining angle to make a full circle. Like, if an angle is 270\u00b0, the remaining angle to complete the circle would be 90\u00b0. But that doesn't make sense because the question asks for the measure of the angle that turns through 3/4 of a complete circle, which is directly 270\u00b0.\n\nI think I've covered all possible interpretations, and 270\u00b0 is clearly the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance that the angle could be measured in the other direction, like a reflex angle. But 270\u00b0 is already the measure of the angle that turns through 3/4 of the circle, whether it's the minor or major arc. In standard measure, angles are measured in the standard position starting from the positive x-axis and moving counterclockwise.\n\nAlternatively, if you measure it clockwise, it would be a negative angle, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the measure of an angle that turns through 3/4 of a complete circle is 270\u00b0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the full circle measurement:**\n   - A complete circle is 360 degrees.\n\n2. **Calculate the angle for 3/4 of a circle:**\n   - Angle measure = \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 360^\\circ\\)\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - First, find \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of 360 degrees: \\(360^\\circ \\div 4 = 90^\\circ\\)\n   - Then, multiply by 3: \\(90^\\circ \\times 3 = 270^\\circ\\)\n\n4. **Verify the calculation:**\n   - Alternative calculation: \\(\\frac{3 \\times 360^\\circ}{4} = \\frac{1080^\\circ}{4} = 270^\\circ\\)\n   - Confirmation through radian measure: \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 2\\pi \\text{ radians} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}\\), which is equivalent to 270 degrees.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The correct answer is 270 degrees, which corresponds to choice D."
