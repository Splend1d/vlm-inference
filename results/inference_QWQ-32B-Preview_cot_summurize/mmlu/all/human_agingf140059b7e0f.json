                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about people nearing retirement. It says, \"As working people get closer to retirement they are more likely to...\" and then gives four options: A) Be absent from work, B) Invest in craft and hobby books, C) Do some informal planning, or D) Become irritated and anxious.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what typically happens when people approach retirement. Retirement is a big life change, so I imagine people might start thinking more about what they want to do after they stop working. Maybe they start planning for retirement, like figuring out their finances or considering hobbies they want to take up.\n\nOption A says they're more likely to be absent from work. I'm not sure about that. Some people might start taking more time off as they approach retirement, maybe using vacation days or just calling in sick more often. But I don't know if that's a common trend. Maybe some people do that, but I don't think it's the most likely thing.\n\nOption B is about investing in craft and hobby books. That seems plausible because people might start thinking about new interests or hobbies they want to pursue once they retire. Maybe they see retirement as a time to finally try out painting, knitting, or some other craft. So, this could be a likely choice.\n\nOption C is about doing some informal planning. This makes sense too. As retirement approaches, people might start informally planning what their life will look like after they stop working. That could include thinking about where to live, what to do with their time, and how to manage their finances. Informal planning might involve talking to friends, reading articles, or just daydreaming about retirement.\n\nOption D says they become irritated and anxious. While some people might feel anxious about retirement, like worrying about finances or leaving their career, I don't know if that's the most common reaction. Maybe some people feel excited and look forward to retiring, while others are more anxious. It's hard to say which one is more likely in general.\n\nComparing all the options, I think option B and C are the most plausible. Option B because people might start investing in hobbies they plan to take up in retirement, and option C because informal planning is probably common as retirement approaches.\n\nMaybe the best answer is C, do some informal planning, because planning for retirement is a significant aspect of preparing for that life change. It encompasses financial planning, considering lifestyle changes, and thinking about what to do with free time. Investing in craft and hobby books could be part of that planning, but planning seems like a more overarching activity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, invest in craft and hobby books, because the question might be looking for a specific behavior that indicates preparation for retirement activities.\n\nI need to consider which one is more likely in general. Probably, most people engage in some form of planning for retirement, whether it's formal or informal, whereas investing in craft and hobby books might be more specific to certain individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the question is trying to highlight a less obvious choice. If that's the case, perhaps option A, being absent from work, could be the answer if people start disengaging from their jobs as retirement approaches.\n\nBut I think that's less likely. Most people still have responsibilities and may not want to risk their job security by being absent.\n\nOption D, becoming irritated and anxious, might be a possibility for some, but again, it's not clear that this is the most common reaction.\n\nGiven all that, I'm leaning towards option C, do some informal planning, as the most likely activity for working people as they get closer to retirement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
