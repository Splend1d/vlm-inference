                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which organ secretes insulin. Let me think about what I know about insulin.\n\nI remember that insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. It's important for controlling how the body uses and stores glucose. So, it must be secreted by an organ that's involved in metabolism or hormone regulation.\n\nOption A is the gastric parietal cells. I know that these cells are in the stomach and they secrete substances like gastric acid and intrinsic factor. But I don't think they secrete insulin. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B is the pancreas. I've heard about the pancreas in relation to diabetes, which has something to do with insulin. I think the pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions. The exocrine part secretes digestive enzymes, and the endocrine part secretes hormones like insulin and glucagon. So, this sounds promising.\n\nOption C is the walls of the large intestine. I don't think the large intestine is involved in hormone secretion, at least not for insulin. It's more about absorbing water and electrolytes and forming feces. So, probably not C.\n\nOption D is the autonomic nervous system. That's part of the nervous system that controls involuntary functions like heart rate and digestion. While it does regulate many bodily functions, I don't think it directly secretes hormones like insulin. So, likely not D.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my memory. Let me recall where insulin comes from. I think it's produced by beta cells in the pancreas. Yes, that rings a bell. So, the pancreas is the organ that secretes insulin.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any other organs secrete insulin. Like, perhaps the liver or the kidneys. But I don't think so. The liver processes and stores glucose, but insulin is specifically secreted by the pancreas.\n\nAlso, I recall that in type 1 diabetes, the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin, which is why insulin injections are necessary. That further reinforces that the pancreas is the source of insulin.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm confident that the correct answer is B, the pancreas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
