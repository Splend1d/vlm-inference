                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option wasn't an objective of the Commission on Human Security when it was launched. So, first things first, I should probably recall what the Commission on Human Security is and what its main goals were when it was established.\n\nI know that the Commission on Human Security was set up in 2001 by the United Nations to deepen understanding of human security and to propose ways to incorporate the concept into global policy. Human security is a broad concept that goes beyond traditional notions of national security to focus on the safety and well-being of individuals.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. To promote public understanding, engagement, and support of human security and its underlying imperatives.\n\nThis sounds like a likely objective. If you're introducing a new concept like human security, you'd definitely want people to understand it and support it. So, probably, this was one of the goals.\n\nB. To develop the concept of human security as an operational tool for policy formulation and implementation.\n\nAgain, this seems plausible. For human security to be effective, it needs to be translated into actual policies that governments and international organizations can implement. So, developing it as a tool for policy-making makes sense.\n\nC. To propose a concrete program of action to address critical and pervasive threats to human security.\n\nThis also aligns with what I know about the Commission's work. They would have wanted to not just talk about human security but to suggest specific steps to enhance it. So, this seems like another valid objective.\n\nD. To develop a new international justice system to enhance human security.\n\nHmm, this one sounds a bit different. While international justice is certainly related to human security, especially in terms of protecting individuals from violence and abuse, I'm not sure if developing a entirely new international justice system was one of the Commission's stated objectives.\n\nLet me think about this. The Commission was focused on human security, which includes economic, food, health, environmental, personal, community, and political security. So, it's a wide-ranging concept. While justice is a part of it, particularly under political security, creating a new international justice system seems like a very specific and perhaps separate undertaking.\n\nI recall that the International Criminal Court (ICC) already exists for trying individuals for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide. So, maybe the Commission wasn't about creating a new justice system but rather about enhancing existing mechanisms or proposing policies that could complement the ICC's work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Commission did propose some reforms or improvements to the international justice system, but I don't think developing an entirely new system was its primary objective.\n\nComparing all the options, A, B, and C seem directly related to promoting, developing, and implementing the concept of human security, while D seems more specific and perhaps beyond the scope of the Commission's main goals.\n\nTherefore, I would guess that D is the correct answer\u2014that developing a new international justice system was not stated as an objective of the Commission on Human Security when it was launched.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should double-check this. Maybe the Commission did have aspirations to overhaul or create new international justice structures.\n\nLet me consider what I know about the Commission's report, which was published in 2003. In \"Human Security Now,\" the Commission's final report, they did discuss the importance of the rule of law and international justice in promoting human security. For example, they emphasized the need for effective national judicial systems and supported the work of the ICC.\n\nHowever, from what I recall, they didn't call for the development of an entirely new international justice system. Instead, they seemed to focus on strengthening existing institutions and mechanisms to better protect individuals.\n\nMoreover, creating a new international justice system would likely be a massive undertaking, requiring extensive diplomatic and legal efforts, which might be beyond the scope of the Commission's mandate.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option D was not stated as an objective of the Commission on Human Security when it was launched.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
