                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the option that's a characteristic of all living organisms. So, I should think about what all living things have in common.\n\nOption A is \"Move from place to place.\" Hmm, well, not all living organisms can do that. Like plants, they stay in one place, right? So, that can't be the answer.\n\nOption B is \"Detect and respond to changes in the environment.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty general. Do all living organisms do that? Well, even plants can respond to light and gravity. Animals obviously do, and even single-celled organisms like bacteria can move towards food or away from harmful substances. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption C is \"Produce sugars by photosynthesis.\" That's something plants and some other organisms like algae do, but not animals or fungi. So, that can't be universal.\n\nOption D is \"Produce heat to maintain a constant internal temperature.\" That's thermoregulation, and it's mainly associated with warm-blooded animals like mammals and birds. But other animals and plants don't do that. So, that's not universal either.\n\nSo, between these options, option B seems to be the most universal characteristic of living organisms. But just to make sure, let's think about some extreme cases. What about viruses? Some people consider them living, others don't. But even if we consider viruses, they do need to respond to their environment to infect host cells. And what about single-celled organisms? They definitely respond to their environment to find food and avoid danger.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: Detect and respond to changes in the environment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
