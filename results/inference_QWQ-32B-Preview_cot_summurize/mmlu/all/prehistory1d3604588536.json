I recall seeing pictures of their walls where the stones fit together perfectly, like a jigsaw puzzle, without any mortar. That must be one of the options here.\n\nOption A says \"incorporation of wood, earth, and stone.\" Hmm, I know they used stone a lot, but I'm not sure about wood and earth. Maybe in some structures, but I think stone was their primary material.\n\nOption B is \"unprecedented size and sophistication.\" I think their buildings were certainly sophisticated, especially considering they didn't have wheels or iron tools. But I'm not sure if \"unprecedented\" is the right word. There were other ancient cultures with impressive architecture too.\n\nOption C is \"precise jigsaw-like stone masonry.\" That sounds familiar. I've seen images of Inca walls where the stones are cut so precisely that you can't even slip a piece of paper between them. They must have had amazing skills to do that.\n\nOption D is \"use of the vaulted arch.\" I think the Incas are known more for their dry stone walls and terracing than for arches. I don't recall them using vaulted arches extensively.\n\nSo, between A, B, C, and D, I think C is the best answer. Their precise stone masonry is what Inca architecture is most noted for.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
