                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a business that bought a computer from a seller's website. The purchase form had a prominent hyperlink to a page with \"important additional terms and conditions of sale,\" but the purchaser didn't click on that link. So, they didn't actually see those terms before buying.\n\nThen, when the computer was delivered, it came with the additional terms in writing, and there was a bold-lettered notice saying that if the purchaser didn't accept these terms, they had to return the product within 30 days.\n\nAfter 35 days, the business was unhappy with the computer and sued the seller for breach of contract. The seller wants to go to private arbitration based on the additional terms and conditions.\n\nThe question is: Is the purchaser legally bound to participate in arbitration?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms and conditions that were a part of the contract.\n\nB. Yes, because federal law requires that arbitration must be used to attempt an initial resolution with respect to sales that take place on the internet.\n\nC. No, because there was no contract formed due to the purchaser's lack of assent to the additional terms and conditions.\n\nD. No, because federal law requires that a company give 90 days for return and the 30-day provision was null and void.\n\nOkay, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, was there a contract formed? The business purchased the computer from the seller's website, so there was an agreement to buy the computer for a certain price. That seems like a contract was formed for the sale of the computer.\n\nNow, the issue is whether the additional terms and conditions, which include the arbitration clause, are part of the contract.\n\nThe purchase form had a prominent hyperlink to the additional terms, but the purchaser didn't click on it. So, did the purchaser have notice of these terms?\n\nIt seems like the hyperlink was prominent, so presumably, the purchaser should have known that there were additional terms available. However, they didn't actually access that page, so they didn't read the terms.\n\nThen, when the computer was delivered, the terms were included in writing, along with a bold-lettered notice stating that if the purchaser didn't accept the terms, they had to return the product within 30 days.\n\nSo, at this point, the purchaser had actual notice of the terms, and a specific period to object by returning the product.\n\nThe purchaser didn't return the product within 30 days, which suggests that they accepted the terms.\n\nHowever, they waited 35 days and then sued the seller.\n\nSo, option A says yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms.\n\nThat seems plausible, but I need to think about it more deeply.\n\nOption B says yes, because federal law requires arbitration for internet sales.\n\nI don't recall any federal law that mandates arbitration for all internet sales. There might be specific laws or regulations, but generally, arbitration clauses are a matter of contract between the parties.\n\nSo, option B seems less likely.\n\nOption C says no, because there was no contract formed due to lack of assent to the additional terms.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, there was a contract for the sale of the computer. The question is whether the additional terms, including arbitration, are part of that contract.\n\nOption D says no, because federal law requires 90 days for return, and the 30-day provision was null and void.\n\nAgain, I don't know of any federal law that mandates a specific return period for all sales. There might be laws regarding certain types of sales or products, but generally, parties can agree on their own return policies.\n\nSo, option D seems unlikely.\n\nGoing back to option A, it seems that by not returning the product within 30 days, the purchaser accepted the terms and conditions, including the arbitration clause.\n\nHowever, they waited 35 days and then sued, which might be seen as repudiating the contract.\n\nBut legally, did their failure to return the product within 30 days bind them to the terms?\n\nI think yes, because they had a chance to review the terms and return the product if they didn't agree. By keeping the product beyond the 30-day period, they're deemed to have accepted the terms.\n\nTherefore, the arbitration clause would be enforceable, and the purchaser would be legally bound to participate in arbitration.\n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any reason why the additional terms wouldn't be part of the contract?\n\nWell, perhaps if the purchaser never had notice of them, but in this case, they did receive the terms with the delivered product and the notice about the return period.\n\nAlso, hyperlinks can be sufficient to provide notice of additional terms in online contracts.\n\nMoreover, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) deals with sales and has provisions regarding additional terms in contracts.\n\nUnder UCC \u00a7 2-207, additional terms in acceptance or written confirmation are proposals for addition to the contract, and they become part of the contract unless:\n\n(a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;\n\n(b) they materially alter the offer; or\n\n(c) notification of objection to the terms has been given.\n\nIn this case, since the purchaser didn't object within the 30-day period, they may be bound by the additional terms.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there was a contract formed for the sale of the computer, and the additional terms were incorporated into the contract by the purchaser's failure to return the product within 30 days.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there's no mention of any federal law requiring a 90-day return period; it's likely that the parties can set their own return policies.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there's no general federal law requiring arbitration for internet sales.\n\nHence, the correct answer is A: Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms and conditions that were a part of the contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
