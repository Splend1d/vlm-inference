                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which fraction is greater than 2 over 5?\" And there are four options: A. 1 over 5, B. 1 over 10, C. 4 over 10, and D. 5 over 10. I need to figure out which one of these fractions is larger than 2/5.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what 2/5 represents. Two-fifths means 2 parts out of 5. To compare fractions, it's often helpful to have a common denominator or to convert them into decimal form.\n\nLet me consider the options one by one.\n\nOption A is 1 over 5. That's 1/5. Comparing 1/5 and 2/5, it's clear that 1/5 is less than 2/5 because 1 is less than 2 when the denominators are the same.\n\nOption B is 1 over 10, which is 1/10. I know that 1/10 is half of 1/5, so it's even smaller than 1/5. Therefore, 1/10 is also less than 2/5.\n\nNow, option C is 4 over 10. That's 4/10. I can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2, which gives me 2/5. So, 4/10 is equal to 2/5, not greater.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking for a fraction that is greater than 2/5, not equal to it. So, 4/10 is equal, not greater.\n\nOption D is 5 over 10, which is 5/10. Simplifying this by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5 gives me 1/2. Now, is 1/2 greater than 2/5?\n\nTo compare 1/2 and 2/5, I can find a common denominator or convert them to decimals.\n\nLet's convert them to decimals.\n\n2/5 is 0.4, and 1/2 is 0.5. Since 0.5 is greater than 0.4, yes, 1/2 is greater than 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, using a common denominator, the denominators are 5 and 2, so the least common denominator is 10.\n\nConverting 2/5 to tenths: 2/5 = 4/10.\n\nConverting 1/2 to tenths: 1/2 = 5/10.\n\nSince 5/10 is greater than 4/10, again, 1/2 is greater than 2/5.\n\nTherefore, option D, which is 5/10, is greater than 2/5.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: 1/5 is 2/10, which is less than 4/10 (2/5).\n\nOption B: 1/10 is 1/10, which is less than 4/10.\n\nOption C: 4/10 is equal to 2/5.\n\nOption D: 5/10 is greater than 4/10.\n\nSo, indeed, D is the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the fractions in terms of percentages.\n\n2/5 is 40%, 1/5 is 20%, 1/10 is 10%, 4/10 is 40%, and 5/10 is 50%. So, 50% is greater than 40%.\n\nThis confirms that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
