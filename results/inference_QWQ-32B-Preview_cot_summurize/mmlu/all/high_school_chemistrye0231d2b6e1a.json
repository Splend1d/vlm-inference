The molar mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in the formula.\n\nNickel (Ni): 58.69 g/mol\nNitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol\nOxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nNi(NO3)2 consists of:\n- 1 Ni atom: 58.69 g/mol\n- 2 N atoms: 2 \u00d7 14.01 = 28.02 g/mol\n- 6 O atoms: 6 \u00d7 16.00 = 96.00 g/mol\n\nSo, the molar mass of Ni(NO3)2 is:\n58.69 + 28.02 + 96.00 = 182.71 g/mol\n\nNow, we have 30.0 grams of Ni(NO3)2. To find the number of moles, we use the formula:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\nmoles = 30.0 g / 182.71 g/mol \u2248 0.164 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of the solution in liters. The volume is given as 250 mL, which is equal to 0.250 L.\n\nNow, molarity (M) is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution:\n\nM = moles / liters\nM = 0.164 mol / 0.250 L \u2248 0.656 mol/L\n\nTherefore, the molarity of the solution is approximately 0.656 mol/L, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
