                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have 20 computers in the lab, but 2 of them don't work, so that leaves us with 18 computers that are usable.\n\nNow, Mr. Cleary\u2019s class has 14 kids, and Ms. Ntuala\u2019s class has 12 kids, so together there are 14 + 12 = 26 students.\n\nEach computer can be used by at most 2 students. So, with 18 computers, the maximum number of students that can use the computers is 18 * 2 = 36 students. But we only have 26 students, so there are enough computers for everyone.\n\nThe question is asking for the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves. That means some students might be sharing a computer with one other student.\n\nLet\u2019s think about it. If a computer is used by only one student, that student has the computer to themselves. If a computer is used by two students, then neither of those students has the computer to themselves.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of students who have a computer to themselves, we should minimize the number of computers that have two students.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of computers used by one student.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of computers used by two students.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. The total number of computers used is \\( x + y = 18 \\).\n\n2. The total number of students is \\( x + 2y = 26 \\).\n\nWe can solve these equations to find \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nFrom the first equation: \\( x = 18 - y \\).\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n\\( (18 - y) + 2y = 26 \\)\n\n\\( 18 + y = 26 \\)\n\n\\( y = 8 \\)\n\nThen, \\( x = 18 - 8 = 10 \\).\n\nSo, there are 10 computers used by one student and 8 computers used by two students.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves is 10.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's a way to have more than 10 students with computers to themselves.\n\nIf I try to increase \\( x \\), that would mean decreasing \\( y \\), but let's see:\n\nSuppose \\( y = 7 \\), then \\( x = 18 - 7 = 11 \\).\n\nBut then the total number of students would be \\( 11 + 2*7 = 11 + 14 = 25 \\), which is less than 26. So, that's not enough.\n\nIf \\( y = 6 \\), then \\( x = 12 \\), and total students would be \\( 12 + 2*6 = 12 + 12 = 24 \\), which is still less than 26.\n\nSo, to have all 26 students accommodated, we need \\( y \\) to be at least 8, which gives \\( x = 10 \\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves is indeed 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]\n\n"
