                    "text": "Let's see. There's this investor from State A who sued his stockbroker from State B in federal court in State A. The papers were served at the stockbroker's office in State B to an administrative assistant. Now, the stockbroker is saying that the service of process was improper, and has answered the complaint with that defense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"service of process\" means. It's when you officially give someone legal papers that tell them they're being sued. There are rules about how and where you can do this.\n\nThe question says that both states have the same requirements for service of process as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. So, I should look at the Federal Rules to see what's allowed.\n\nLet me recall, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 4, it talks about how to serve someone. For individuals, it usually requires delivering the summons and complaint to the person themselves, or leaving them at their dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion.\n\nIn this case, the papers were delivered to the stockbroker's office in State B, and given to an administrative assistant. So, it wasn't given directly to the stockbroker.\n\nOption A says no, because service was made on a person of suitable age found at the stockbroker's place of employment. Hmm, an administrative assistant could be of suitable age and discretion, I guess. But, was the office considered the stockbroker's dwelling or usual place of abode? Probably not. Usually, place of employment is different from place of abode.\n\nOption B says no, because the stockbroker waived her claim for improper service of process by asserting it in her answer. Waiving means giving up a right. If she answered the complaint and raised the improper service as a defense, does that mean she's waiving it? I don't think so. Usually, raising it in the answer is how you preserve the objection.\n\nOption C says yes, because an individual defendant may not be served by delivering process to a third party found at the defendant's place of employment. This sounds plausible. Maybe federal rules don't allow serving an individual at their workplace to someone else.\n\nOption D says yes, because the process of State A courts is not effective in State B. But wait, this is federal court, not State A court. And the question says it's federal court in State A, but the service was in State B. So, maybe there are rules about serving out of state.\n\nLet me look up Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 4(e)(1) talks about serving an individual within a judicial district. It says you can serve an individual by following the rules of that judicial district. But here, the service was out of the judicial district, in State B.\n\nWait, Rule 4(k) talks about personal jurisdiction, and when you can serve someone in a particular jurisdiction. But the question is about the propriety of the service, not jurisdiction.\n\nMaybe I need to look at Rule 4(f), which is about serving an individual in a foreign country, but this is still within the U.S., just in State B, not State A.\n\nWait, the federal rules do have provisions for serving process in different districts. Rule 4(k)(1)(B) allows for personal jurisdiction if the defendant consents to it or if the court has personal jurisdiction under the constitution.\n\nBut specifically for service of process, Rule 4(h) talks about serving process out of the district. It says that serving process out of the district must be allowed by a federal statute or the law of the state where the service is made.\n\nGiven that both states have the same requirements as the Federal Rules, I need to see what the Federal Rules allow for service out of district.\n\nLooking back, Rule 4(e)(1) allows service within a district, but for out of district, I think Rule 4(k) comes into play for personal jurisdiction, but the service has to be proper.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. If both states have the same requirements as the Federal Rules, then the service would have to comply with the Federal Rules.\n\nIn the Federal Rules, Rule 4(e)(2) allows for service upon an individual anywhere in the U.S. if permitted by the constitution and laws of the U.S.\n\nBut how does service work when it's out of the district? Can you serve someone in State B for a federal case in State A?\n\nI think the rule is that you can serve someone wherever they can be found, as long as the court has personal jurisdiction over them.\n\nBut the question is about whether the service was proper.\n\nIn this case, the process was served at the stockbroker's office in State B to an administrative assistant.\n\nUnder Federal Rule 4(e)(2), service upon an individual in any judicial district may be made:\n\n- Under subsection (e)(1) (which is for within the district);\n\n- As directed by a court order under Rule 4(f);\n\n- As provided in any statute or rule that permits service;\n\n- By following the law of the state in which the district court is located for serving summons in an action brought in its courts.\n\nBut here, since both states have the same requirements as the Federal Rules, I think we can look to the Federal Rules for guidance.\n\nIn the Federal Rules, Rule 4(e)(2)(c) says that if none of the above methods are practicable, then service may be made as directed by the court.\n\nBut in this case, it seems like standard service was attempted.\n\nLooking back, Rule 4(e)(2)(d) allows service in the manner prescribed by the law of the state where the district court is located for serving summons in an action brought in its courts.\n\nSo, since both states have the same requirements as the Federal Rules, perhaps the service was proper.\n\nBut was serving to an administrative assistant at the office acceptable?\n\nLet me check Rule 4(e)(2)(d). It says that service upon an individual may be made by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the individual personally or by leaving them at the individual's dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there.\n\nAlternatively, service may be made by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.\n\nIn this case, the administrative assistant may not be an agent authorized to receive process.\n\nSo, perhaps serving to the administrative assistant wasn't proper.\n\nOption C says yes, because an individual defendant may not be served by delivering process to a third party found at the defendant's place of employment.\n\nThis seems to align with what I'm reading in the Federal Rules.\n\nOption D says yes, because the process of State A courts is not effective in State B.\n\nBut since this is federal court, and both states follow the Federal Rules, I think the federal rules govern.\n\nMoreover, the federal rules allow for service out of district as long as it complies with the rules.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is correct.\n\nWait, but Rule 4(e)(2)(d) allows service in the manner prescribed by the state where the district court is located.\n\nSince State A's rules are the same as the Federal Rules, perhaps State A would allow service at the place of employment.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the service was improper because it wasn't directly to the stockbroker or to someone authorized to accept service.\n\nIn that case, the court might consider the service deficient.\n\nBut the stockbroker has already answered the complaint, raising the defense of improper service.\n\nIs there a concept of waiver here?\n\nOption B says no, because the stockbroker waived her claim for improper service of process by asserting it in her answer.\n\nBut I thought that by raising it in the answer, she's preserving the objection.\n\nWaiver typically occurs when you knowingly ignore or give up a right.\n\nSo, perhaps by answering the complaint and raising improper service, she's not waiving it.\n\nTherefore, option B seems incorrect.\n\nOption A says no, because service was made on a person of suitable age found at the stockbroker's place of employment.\n\nBut, as per the Federal Rules, service on a person of suitable age and discretion at the dwelling or usual place of abode is allowed, but is the place of employment considered the usual place of abode?\n\nProbably not.\n\nPlace of abode usually refers to where someone lives, not where they work.\n\nSo, perhaps serving at the office isn't proper under the Federal Rules.\n\nTherefore, option A might be incorrect.\n\nOption C seems more accurate: yes, because an individual defendant may not be served by delivering process to a third party found at the defendant's place of employment.\n\nBut let me consider if there's a way to serve an individual at their place of employment.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, you can serve an individual at their place of employment by leaving the process with someone at the workplace, perhaps an adult receptionist or similar.\n\nBut under the Federal Rules, it's not explicitly stated.\n\nLooking back, Rule 4(e)(2)(d) refers to state law for service, but since both states follow the Federal Rules, I need to see what the Federal Rules permit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Rule 4(h) governs service out of the district.\n\nRule 4(h)(1)(A) says that service may be made outside a district by following the law of the state in which the district court is located for serving summons in an action brought in its courts.\n\nAgain, since both states follow the Federal Rules, it loops back to the Federal Rules.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to consider that service was attempted at the stockbroker's office in State B to an administrative assistant, and the stockbroker is now claiming that this was improper service.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options:\n\nA. No, because service was made on a person of suitable age found at the stockbroker's place of employment.\n\nB. No, because the stockbroker waived her claim for improper service of process by asserting it in her answer.\n\nC. Yes, because an individual defendant may not be served by delivering process to a third party found at the defendant's place of employment.\n\nD. Yes, because the process of State A courts is not effective in State B.\n\nI think option C is the most accurate.\n\nOption D is less likely because it's federal court, and federal courts have their own rules for service that can apply across state lines.\n\nOption B is incorrect because raising the defense doesn't constitute a waiver.\n\nOption A might be incorrect because serving at the place of employment to a third party may not be allowed under the Federal Rules.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to dismiss the action for improper service of process, choosing option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
