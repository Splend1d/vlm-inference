So, the question is about identifying a specific type of fallacy based on a scenario where someone misrepresents their opponent's position to easily defeat it and then claims to have refuted the opponent's actual argument. That sounds like a classic case of the \"straw person\" fallacy.\n\nTo break it down:\n\n1. **Opposing Arguer's Position:** The person argues against a position that their opponent hasn't actually taken.\n\n2. **Easy Defeat:** They choose this position because it's easier to defeat.\n\n3. **Claim of Significant Damage:** After defeating this misrepresented position, they claim to have significantly weakened the opponent's actual argument.\n\nThis matches the definition of a straw person fallacy, where someone creates a weaker version of their opponent's argument (the \"straw person\") and knocks it down, giving the impression that they've refuted the actual argument.\n\nLet's look at the other options to make sure:\n\nA. **Genetic Fallacy:** This is about attacking the origin or history of something rather than its current merit. For example, saying an idea is bad because it comes from a particular group, not because of its own merits.\n\nB. **Appeal to Emotions:** This involves trying to persuade someone by appealing to their emotions rather than using logical reasoning.\n\nC. **Straw Person:** As mentioned, this is about misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack.\n\nD. **Ignorance of Refutation:** I'm not entirely sure about this one, but it might refer to assuming something is true because it hasn't been proven false, which is similar to an argument from ignorance.\n\nGiven these explanations, option C, the straw person fallacy, seems to fit the scenario described in the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
