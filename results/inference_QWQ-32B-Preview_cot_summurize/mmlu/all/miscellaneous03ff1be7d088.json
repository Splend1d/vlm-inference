Russian is also one of the major languages used in the UN, so C should be official too. Spanish is widely spoken and important internationally, so I believe D is official as well. Now, Japanese seems a bit unsure to me. I don't recall hearing about Japanese being an official language of the UN. Maybe it's not one of them. Let me think about this again.\n\nI remember that the official languages of the UN were established when the organization was founded, and they include the main languages of the major allied powers at that time. So English, French, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish are original official languages. Later, Arabic was added because of its significance in the international community. So that makes six official languages: English, French, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, and Arabic.\n\nLooking at the options, A is Japanese, B is English, C is Russian, and D is Spanish. English, Russian, and Spanish are definitely official languages. Japanese is not among the official languages of the UN. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should double-check the official languages of the UN. According to my knowledge, the official languages are English, French, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, and Arabic. So yes, Japanese is not among them.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Japanese.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
