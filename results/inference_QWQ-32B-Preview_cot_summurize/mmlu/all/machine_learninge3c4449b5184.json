                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. We need to generate two types of matrices using PyTorch 1.8: a $10 \\times 5$ Gaussian matrix with entries sampled from $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu=5, \\sigma^2=16)$, and a $10 \\times 10$ uniform matrix with entries sampled from $U[-1, 1)$. We have four options to choose from, and we need to determine which one correctly produces these matrices.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the Gaussian matrix. We need each entry to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from a normal distribution with mean $\\mu = 5$ and variance $\\sigma^2 = 16$. In PyTorch, the `torch.randn` function generates samples from a standard normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. To adjust the mean and standard deviation, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{scaled\\_dist} = \\sigma \\times \\text{standard\\_normal} + \\mu\n\\]\n\nGiven that $\\sigma^2 = 16$, the standard deviation $\\sigma$ is 4. So, the correct way to generate the Gaussian matrix should be:\n\n\\[\n5 + 4 \\times \\text{torch.randn}(10,5)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. `5 + torch.randn(10,5) * 16`\n\nB. `5 + torch.randn(10,5) * 16`\n\nC. `5 + torch.randn(10,5) * 4`\n\nD. `torch.normal(torch.ones(10,5)*5, torch.ones(5,5)*16)`\n\nOptions A and B both multiply `torch.randn(10,5)` by 16, which would correspond to a standard deviation of 16, not 4. This is incorrect because our required standard deviation is 4.\n\nOption C multiplies by 4, which is correct, as $\\sigma = 4$.\n\nOption D uses `torch.normal` with mean `torch.ones(10,5)*5` and standard deviation `torch.ones(5,5)*16`. Here, the standard deviation is set to 16, not 4, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, for the Gaussian matrix, option C seems correct.\n\nNext, let's consider the uniform matrix. We need a $10 \\times 10$ matrix where each entry is i.i.d. sampled from $U[-1, 1)$. The `torch.rand` function generates samples from $U[0,1)$. To transform this to $U[-1,1)$, we can use:\n\n\\[\n\\text{scaled\\_dist} = 2 \\times \\text{torch.rand}(10,10) - 1\n\\]\n\nLet's see what each option proposes:\n\nA. `torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1)`\n\nB. `(torch.rand(10,10) - 0.5) / 0.5`\n\nC. `2 * torch.rand(10,10) - 1`\n\nD. `2 * torch.rand(10,10) - 1`\n\nOption A attempts to specify `low` and `high` parameters directly in `torch.rand`, but `torch.rand` does not accept these parameters. Instead, it generates tensors with values from $U[0,1)$. So, this is incorrect.\n\nOption B applies a transformation: `(torch.rand(10,10) - 0.5) / 0.5`. Let's see what this does:\n\n- `torch.rand(10,10)` generates values in $[0,1)$.\n\n- Subtracting 0.5 shifts this to $[-0.5, 0.5)$.\n\n- Dividing by 0.5 scales it to $[-1,1)$.\n\nThis also achieves the desired range, but it's a bit more convoluted than necessary.\n\nOption C and D both use `2 * torch.rand(10,10) - 1`, which directly scales and shifts the range from $[0,1)$ to $[-1,1)$.\n\nSo, for the uniform matrix, options C and D are correct.\n\nCombining both parts, we need both the Gaussian and uniform matrices to be correctly generated. From the Gaussian part, only option C is correct. For the uniform part, both C and D are correct. However, option D is incorrect for the Gaussian part.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly generates both matrices is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
