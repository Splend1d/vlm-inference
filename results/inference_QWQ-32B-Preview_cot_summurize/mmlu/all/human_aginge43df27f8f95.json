The question is: \"Older adults generally perform very well when their _____ memory is tested.\" And the options are A. Episodic, B. Working, C. Retrospective, D. Semantic.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each type of memory means:\n\n- Episodic memory is about personal experiences and events that occur in a particular time and place. For example, remembering your birthday party last year.\n\n- Working memory is like the brain's temporary workspace where you hold and manipulate information in mind, especially in the presence of distractions. It's important for tasks like mental arithmetic or following a conversation in a noisy room.\n\n- Retrospective memory refers to the ability to recall past events or information. It's similar to episodic memory but can also include semantic memory, which is about facts and general knowledge.\n\n- Semantic memory is about facts and general knowledge, not tied to personal experiences. For example, knowing that Paris is the capital of France.\n\nNow, considering older adults, I know that as people age, some types of memory decline more than others. Episodic memory, which is about personal events, tends to decline with age. That's why older adults might have trouble remembering recent events or specific instances.\n\nWorking memory also tends to decline with age. It becomes harder to hold and manipulate information in mind, especially when there are distractions.\n\nRetrospective memory, since it includes both episodic and semantic memory, might show mixed results. Episodic part might decline, but semantic might stay stronger.\n\nSemantic memory, on the other hand, is generally preserved in older adults. In fact, older adults often have a lot of factual knowledge and vocabulary that they've accumulated over their lifetime. Studies have shown that semantic memory remains relatively intact with age.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is D. Semantic. Older adults generally perform very well when their semantic memory is tested because they have a wealth of knowledge and facts stored over the years, and this type of memory is less susceptible to age-related decline.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about each option again:\n\nA. Episodic: As I mentioned, this tends to decline with age, so probably not this one.\n\nB. Working: This also tends to decline, so maybe not this one.\n\nC. Retrospective: This is a bit tricky because it includes both episodic and semantic memory. Since episodic memory declines but semantic doesn't, perhaps retrospective memory would show variable performance. But the question says \"perform very well,\" so maybe not the best choice.\n\nD. Semantic: This seems to be the most consistent type of memory in older adults, so I think this is the right answer.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer should be D. Semantic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
