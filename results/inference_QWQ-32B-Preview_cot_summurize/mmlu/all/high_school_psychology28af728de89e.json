This suggests that the memories were still stored in the brain but were not being accessed or retrieved under normal circumstances. Therefore, forgetting in this context is best explained as retrieval failure, meaning that the memory is still encoded and stored but cannot be accessed when needed.\n\nOption A, displacement, refers to a situation where new information pushes out old information from memory, which isn't directly supported by Penfield's findings.\n\nOption B, gradual decay, suggests that memories fade over time due to lack of use, but Penfield's studies indicate that memories can remain intact even if they are not accessed for a long time.\n\nOption D, failure to encode the memories, implies that the memories were never properly stored in the first place, which contradicts the idea that the memories were present and could be elicited through stimulation.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C. retrieval failure."
