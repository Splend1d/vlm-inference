I think it had something to do with college admissions, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me look at the options provided:\n\nA. The rights of students to protest on a publicly funded campus\n\nI don't think that's it. Bakke seems more related to admissions policies rather than student protest rights.\n\nB. In-class prayer at a publicly funded school\n\nThat sounds like it might be related to church and state issues, perhaps a case like Engel v. Vitale. Not sure, but I don't think it's this one.\n\nC. The rights of students to carry concealed weapons on campus\n\nHmm, that seems like a modern issue, but I don't recall Bakke being about gun rights on campus.\n\nD. The use of racial quotas in public university admissions\n\nNow, this rings a bell. I think Bakke was about affirmative action and how universities consider race in their admissions process. Let me think about it.\n\nRegents of the University of California v. Bakke was a landmark case in 1978. It involved Allan Bakke, who had been rejected twice by the University of California, Davis, Medical School. He argued that the school's affirmative action policy, which set aside a certain number of spots for underrepresented minorities, was unconstitutional because it led to his rejection despite having higher qualifications than some admitted minority students.\n\nSo, the crux of the case was whether public universities could use racial quotas in their admissions processes. The Supreme Court ruled that while racial quotas were unconstitutional, race could be one of the factors considered in admissions decisions.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct answer: The use of racial quotas in public university admissions.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly review the other options:\n\nA. Student protest rights: That sounds more like Tinker v. Des Moines or another case focusing on free speech and expression in schools.\n\nB. In-class prayer: Engel v. Vitale dealt with mandatory prayer in public schools, so that's probably what this option is referring to.\n\nC. Concealed weapons on campus: I don't think Bakke involved anything related to guns or weapon policies.\n\nYes, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
