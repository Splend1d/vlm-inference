                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which fallacy is being committed when someone supports a claim just by saying that \"unidentified experts\" agree with it. The options are appeal to tradition, ad verecundiam, appeal to anonymous authority, and snob appeal. I need to understand what each of these means to see which one fits.\n\nFirst, appeal to tradition is when someone argues that something is right or good because it's always been done that way. But in this case, it's about unnamed experts agreeing with a claim, not about traditions. So, probably not A.\n\nNext, ad verecundiam\u2014I think that's Latin for \"to modesty\" or something like that. Actually, ad verecundiam is a type of appeal to authority where someone uses the respect for authority to influence an argument, often by appealing to the testimony of an authority on an unrelated subject. For example, if a celebrity endorses a political candidate, that's ad verecundiam because the celebrity's expertise is in entertainment, not politics. But in this scenario, it's about unidentified experts, not necessarily authorities in an unrelated field. So, maybe not B.\n\nAppeal to anonymous authority sounds pretty close. It's when someone cites an unnamed expert or authority to support their claim. This is problematic because we don't know who the expert is, so we can't verify their credentials or see if they're actually an expert in that area. This seems to match the description in the question. So, option C might be the answer.\n\nThen there's snob appeal, which I think is when someone tries to persuade others by appealing to their sense of exclusivity or superiority. Like, \"Only the elite use this product, so it must be better.\" That doesn't seem directly related to citing unidentified experts, so probably not D.\n\nWait a minute, maybe snob appeal could be related if the arguer is implying that these unidentified experts are part of an elite group whose opinions should be valued. But that seems like a stretch. I think appeal to anonymous authority is a better fit.\n\nLet me double-check. Appeal to anonymous authority: citing unnamed sources or experts to lend credibility to a claim without providing concrete evidence or identifying the authorities. This is a common fallacy because it lacks transparency and doesn't allow the audience to assess the credibility of the source.\n\nAd verecundiam, on the other hand, can involve appealing to the authority of someone who may not be an expert in the relevant field, but in this case, it's about unidentified experts, which seems more aligned with appeal to anonymous authority.\n\nAppeal to tradition is clearly different, as it's about longstanding practices, not expert opinions.\n\nSnob appeal is more about appealing to prestige or exclusivity, which isn't directly about citing experts.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C, appeal to anonymous authority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. appeal to anonymous authority}} \\]"
