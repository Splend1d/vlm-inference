Two police officers went to Bill's house, a two-story colonial. After knocking at the door, they were admitted by Bill's brother, Mark. One of the policemen showed Mark the arrest warrant and asked if he was Bill. He replied that he was Bill's brother and that he was staying at his brother's house while Bill was away on a business trip. The police officer then asked Mark for some identification. Mark was only able to produce an out-of-state driver's license. The other policeman then became suspicious and proceeded to frisk Mark. During the pat-down, the police officer found the following letter, which read:\"Dear Mark,If you could get rid of your brother permanently, we could be together forever. With love,your favorite girl. \"Nervously, Mark then agreed to allow the policemen to search the house. The officers conducted an extensive two-hour search of the house and found nothing of interest to them. As they were leaving, one of the police officers walked over to a parked car in the driveway of the house and noticed that the car's trunk was slightly open. When he looked in the trunk, the police officer discovered Bill's body. If Mark's attorney files a motion to suppress the introduction of the letter into evidence, the court should rule that the evidence is\n\nA. admissible, because it was on the person, or in the presence of the person, who was later arrested.\nB. admissible, because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search.\nC. inadmissible, because the letter was obtained as a result of a non-consensual search and seizure.\nD. inadmissible, because the letter was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure.\n"

So, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a warrant for Bill's arrest because he's accused of selling narcotic drugs, which is against state law. The police go to Bill's house to arrest him. They knock on the door, and Mark, Bill's brother, lets them in. One police officer shows Mark the arrest warrant and asks if he's Bill. Mark says he's Bill's brother and that Bill is away on a business trip.\n\nThen, the officer asks Mark for identification. Mark only has an out-of-state driver's license, which makes one of the officers suspicious. That officer decides to frisk Mark, which is a pat-down search for weapons or other items. During this pat-down, the officer finds a letter in Mark's pocket addressed to him from \"your favorite girl,\" suggesting that Mark should get rid of his brother permanently.\n\nMark, feeling nervous, agrees to let the police search the entire house. They look around for two hours but don't find anything interesting to them. As they're leaving, one officer notices that the car trunk in the driveway is slightly open. Looking inside, he finds Bill's body.\n\nNow, Mark's attorney wants to file a motion to suppress the introduction of that letter into evidence. So, the question is whether the court should consider that evidence admissible or inadmissible, and why.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Admissible, because it was on the person, or in the presence of the person, who was later arrested.\n\nWait, who was arrested here? Bill was the one with the arrest warrant, but the letter was found on Mark, not Bill. So, I'm not sure if this applies.\n\nB. Admissible, because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search.\n\nBut was the search valid? The police had a warrant for Bill's arrest, not for searching Mark's person. They frisked Mark, which is a pat-down for safety reasons, not a full search. So, maybe the search wasn't valid for finding evidence like the letter.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because the letter was obtained as a result of a non-consensual search and seizure.\n\nThe frisk was without Mark's consent, but frisks can be allowed under certain circumstances, like for officer safety. So, was this frisk justified?\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the letter was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure.\n\nThis suggests that the letter was found as a result of an unlawful search.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nFirst, the police had a warrant to arrest Bill, not to search Mark or his person. They went to Bill's house, and Mark answered the door. They showed the warrant to Mark, who identified himself as Bill's brother and said Bill was away.\n\nThen, they asked for ID, and Mark provided an out-of-state driver's license, which made one officer suspicious. Based on that suspicion, they decided to frisk Mark.\n\nNow, a frisk is generally allowed for officer safety if they have a reasonable suspicion that the person may be dangerous or armed. Here, the officer became suspicious after seeing Mark's out-of-state license, but it's not clear what specifically made them suspicious in terms of Mark being dangerous.\n\nSo, was there reasonable suspicion to frisk Mark? Maybe not strongly justified based on the information provided.\n\nIf the frisk wasn't justified, then the letter found during the frisk could be considered the fruit of an illegal search.\n\nFurthermore, Mark later consented to a search of the house, but that's separate from the frisk.\n\nSo, regarding the letter, if the frisk was illegal, then the letter should be suppressed as evidence.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Admissible because it was on the person or in the presence of the person who was later arrested.\n\nBut Bill was the one arrested, and the letter was on Mark, not Bill. So, this doesn't seem to apply.\n\nB. Admissible because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search.\n\nWas the frisk a valid search? Maybe not, if there was no reasonable suspicion for officer safety.\n\nC. Inadmissible because it was obtained as a result of a non-consensual search and seizure.\n\nThe frisk was non-consensual, and if it wasn't justified, then yes.\n\nD. Inadmissible because it was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure.\n\nSimilar to C, but more specifically referring to the evidence being derived from an illegal search.\n\nBetween C and D, D might be a better choice because it specifically refers to the evidence being the fruit of an illegal search, which is a established legal principle.\n\nSo, I think the court should rule that the evidence is inadmissible because it was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
