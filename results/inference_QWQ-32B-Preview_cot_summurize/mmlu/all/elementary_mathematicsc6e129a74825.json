                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"48 m = Box mm.\" And I need to find out what number goes in the box to make this statement true. The options are A. 48,000, B. 480, C. 4,800, and D. 5. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here.\n\nI know that \"m\" stands for meters and \"mm\" stands for millimeters. So, the question is asking me to convert 48 meters into millimeters. I need to figure out how many millimeters are in 48 meters.\n\nI remember that in the metric system, prefixes like \"milli-\" represent certain powers of ten. Specifically, \"milli-\" means one-thousandth (1/1000) of the base unit. So, 1 millimeter is equal to 0.001 meters, or conversely, 1 meter is equal to 1000 millimeters.\n\nSo, if 1 meter equals 1000 millimeters, then 48 meters would equal 48 times 1000 millimeters.\n\nLet me calculate that: 48 \u00d7 1000 = 48,000 millimeters.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I should think about the conversion again. I know that moving from meters to millimeters, I'm going from a larger unit to a smaller unit, so the number should get bigger. Yes, that makes sense. So, multiplying by 1000 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the metric prefixes. From meters to centimeters, it's \u00d7100, and from centimeters to millimeters, it's \u00d710, so from meters to millimeters, it should be \u00d71000.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using decimals. But no, I think the multiplication method is straightforward.\n\nSo, 48 meters is equal to 48,000 millimeters. Looking back at the options, A is 48,000, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options. Option B is 480, which would be if I multiplied by 10 instead of 1000. That seems way off.\n\nOption C is 4,800, which would be if I multiplied by 100. But that would be the conversion to centimeters, not millimeters.\n\nOption D is 5, which is just plain wrong.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. 48,000.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that in some systems, the conversion might be different, but in the International System of Units (SI), which is what we're using here, 1 meter is indeed 1000 millimeters.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance that the question is using a different system, but I don't think so. It's safe to assume SI units unless specified otherwise.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the exponent difference between meters and millimeters. Since milli- is 10^-3, then to convert meters to millimeters, I need to multiply by 10^3, which is 1000.\n\nSo, again, 48 meters times 1000 equals 48,000 millimeters.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The correct answer is A. 48,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
