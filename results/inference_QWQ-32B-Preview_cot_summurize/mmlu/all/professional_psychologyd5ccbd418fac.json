                    "text": "Let's see what this scenario is about. Dr. Carl Carlson is a licensed psychologist and a professor in the psychology department at a large university. So, he's in a position of authority and has professional responsibilities. Marla M., a graduate student, asks him to attend a baseball game on Friday night. Dr. Carlson is divorced and finds Marla attractive. Now, the question is, if he accepts her invitation, would he be acting ethically according to professional guidelines?\n\nFirst, I need to recall the ethical guidelines for psychologists, especially regarding relationships with students. I remember that there are rules about boundaries to prevent exploitation or harm, particularly because of the power differential between professors and students.\n\nOption A says that accepting the invitation would clearly violate ethical guidelines. That seems plausible because engaging in social activities with students can sometimes blur professional boundaries.\n\nOption B suggests that he's acting ethically since he didn't initiate the invitation. But ethics are not just about who initiates; they're about maintaining appropriate professional boundaries regardless of who makes the first move.\n\nOption C mentions that it's okay as long as Marla is not in the psychology department and won't take any classes there. But even if she's not directly in his department, she's still affiliated with the university, and the power dynamics might still apply.\n\nOption D says it's ethical as long as there's no sexual involvement until she's no longer affiliated with the university. This seems too lenient. Ethical guidelines usually aim to prevent any kind of dual relationships that could impair judgment or lead to conflicts of interest.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the potential for exploitation or bias. Even a social invitation like a baseball game could be seen as inappropriate because it might make Marla feel obligated or influence her in ways that could affect her academic or professional opportunities.\n\nMoreover, professional ethics in psychology emphasize the importance of avoiding dual relationships that could impair objectivity or increase the risk of harm. Accepting a social invitation from a student could be seen as a dual relationship, especially given the power imbalance.\n\nAlso, Dr. Carlson finding Marla attractive adds another layer of complexity. If there's an attraction, it might be harder for him to maintain professional boundaries, which could lead to ethical breaches in the future.\n\nI recall that the American Psychological Association's Ethics Code has specific standards regarding boundaries with clients and students. Standard 3.05 on Multiple Relationships states that psychologists avoid multiple relationships that could reasonably be expected to impair their objectivity, competence, or effectiveness in performing their functions as psychologists, or which otherwise risks exploitation or harm to the person with whom the primary relationship exists.\n\nIn this case, accepting a social invitation from a student could be seen as a multiple relationship that might impair objectivity or put Marla at risk of exploitation.\n\nTherefore, the most ethical choice would be to decline the invitation or to handle it in a way that maintains strict professional boundaries.\n\nLooking back at the options, A says \"clearly violating ethical guidelines.\" That seems to be the most accurate answer because accepting the invitation could indeed violate the ethical standards related to multiple relationships and boundary issues.\n\nOption B is incorrect because even if he didn't initiate the invitation, accepting it could still be problematic.\n\nOption C is too specific and doesn't address the fundamental issue of professional boundaries within the university context.\n\nOption D is flawed because it suggests that sexual involvement is acceptable as long as it happens after she's no longer affiliated with the university. However, ethical guidelines generally discourage any romantic or sexual relationships with current students due to the power differential, regardless of when the relationship might develop.\n\nIn conclusion, accepting the invitation would likely be considered a violation of ethical guidelines, making option A the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
