Attention to handwashing and hygiene\n\nC. Quarantine\n\nD. New antiviral drugs\n\nFirst, I need to understand what norovirus is and how it spreads. Norovirus is a highly contagious virus that causes gastroenteritis, which is often referred to as the \"stomach flu.\" It's known for causing symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea. It spreads primarily through fecal-oral transmission, which means it can be spread by ingesting something contaminated with the virus, such as food, water, or surfaces.\n\nGiven that, let's look at each option:\n\nA. A norovirus vaccine: Vaccines are important for preventing diseases by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight off specific pathogens. However, as of now, there isn't a widely available vaccine for norovirus. There have been some developments, but it's not yet a standard preventive measure. So, while a vaccine could be very effective, it's not currently the most important control measure.\n\nB. Attention to handwashing and hygiene: Since norovirus spreads through contaminated hands, surfaces, and objects, maintaining good hand hygiene is crucial. Washing hands thoroughly with soap and water can remove the virus from hands, preventing its spread. This is a simple but highly effective measure that can be practiced by everyone.\n\nC. Quarantine: Quarantine involves separating and restricting the movement of people who may have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become ill. While quarantine can be useful in controlling the spread of some diseases, norovirus is highly contagious and can spread very quickly, especially in closed environments like cruise ships or nursing homes. Quarantine might help in some situations, but it's not as practical or effective as other measures for norovirus.\n\nD. New antiviral drugs: Antiviral drugs are medications that treat viral infections. However, for norovirus, there are no specific antiviral drugs available. Treatment usually focuses on managing symptoms and preventing dehydration. Developing new antiviral drugs could be beneficial, but it's not currently a primary control measure.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that attention to handwashing and hygiene is the most important and practical measure for controlling norovirus disease right now. It's something that can be easily implemented and has a significant impact on preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Attention to handwashing and hygiene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
