                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about the opposition to Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court in 2006. The groups that opposed him were the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL), and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). The question is asking what this opposition is an example of, and the options are realignment, coalition building, impeachment, or a recall election.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nRealignment: This usually refers to a shift in the political landscape, where the traditional divisions between political parties change. It's like when new issues or new parties emerge and change who supports what.\n\nCoalition building: This is when different groups come together to work towards a common goal, even if they usually don't agree on everything. It's like forming a team for a specific purpose.\n\nImpeachment: This is a formal process where a legislative body levels charges against a government official. It's like bringing someone to trial for misconduct while in office.\n\nA recall election: This is when voters decide whether to remove an official from office before their term is up. It's like having a mid-term vote to see if the person should keep their job.\n\nNow, the question is about the opposition to Alito's nomination. Nomination to the Supreme Court is part of the appointment process, not something that happens after someone is already in office. So, impeachment and recall election don't seem to fit here because they're about removing someone who is already in office, and in this case, Alito was being considered for appointment.\n\nThat leaves realignment and coalition building. Realignment seems more about long-term shifts in political parties and their bases, whereas coalition building is about different groups coming together for a specific purpose.\n\nIn this case, the ACLU, NAWL, and AFL-CIO are all distinct organizations with their own agendas, but they came together to oppose Alito's nomination. This sounds like they are forming a coalition for this particular issue.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B. coalition building.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about realignment. Realignment would suggest a permanent shift in how these groups align politically, which isn't necessarily what's happening here. They might have ongoing alignments, but their opposition to Alito's nomination seems specific to that event.\n\nTherefore, coalition building makes more sense as they are coming together for this particular purpose.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
