He's getting new clients with issues he doesn't have much training or experience in. He needs to decide what to do.\n\nOption A is to refuse to see the clients. Well, since he's the only game in town, that might not be the best choice because these people need help and have no one else to go to. It's a small town, and maybe there aren't many psychologists to begin with.\n\nOption B suggests that he should see them but only use interventions he's experienced with. That might not be sufficient because the clients have specific problems that require different approaches. If he only uses what he knows, he might not be addressing their actual needs effectively.\n\nOption C is to see the clients and get supervision or consultation by phone. This seems like a good idea because he can still help the clients while seeking guidance from more experienced professionals. It's a way to learn and grow in his practice while providing necessary care.\n\nOption D is to agree to see these clients only in a crisis. But what about their regular needs? Should he only handle emergencies and not their ongoing issues? That doesn't seem fully responsible.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems the most appropriate. He can provide care while improving his skills through consultation. It's important for him to recognize his limitations and seek help when needed, especially in a remote area where access to mental health services is limited.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
