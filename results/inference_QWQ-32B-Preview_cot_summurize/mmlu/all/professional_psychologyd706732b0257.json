Dr. Ja-Hoon Jang is doing a research study with junior high school students, and he's already gotten permission from both the parents and the students themselves. Now, one student decides he doesn't want to finish the interview. The question is, what should Dr. Jang do?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Tell the student he can't withdraw because his parent consented.\n\nB. Tell the student he can't withdraw because he agreed at the start.\n\nC. Contact the student's parents to encourage him to complete the interview.\n\nD. Allow the student to withdraw from the study.\n\nFirst, I need to think about research ethics, especially regarding participants' rights, especially since these are minors.\n\nIn research involving human subjects, one fundamental principle is the right to withdraw at any time. This is crucial, especially when dealing with sensitive topics like peer relationships, which might make students uncomfortable.\n\nSince the students are minors, obtaining informed consent from their parents and assent from the students themselves is standard procedure. Assent means that the students agree to participate, but they might still change their mind.\n\nNow, if a student decides mid-interview that they don't want to continue, it seems respectful and ethically sound to allow them to withdraw.\n\nOption A suggests telling the student he can't withdraw because the parent consented. But even if the parent agreed, the student's own willingness to participate is important, especially since they are direct participants.\n\nOption B says to tell the student he can't withdraw because he agreed at the beginning. While the student did assent initially, people, especially minors, can change their minds. It's important to respect their current feelings and allow them to withdraw if they're uncomfortable.\n\nOption C is to contact the parents to encourage the student to complete the interview. While involving parents might seem like a way to get the student to participate, it could also put pressure on the student and potentially undermine their autonomy.\n\nOption D is to allow the student to withdraw from the study. This seems to be the most respectful and ethical choice, as it prioritizes the student's comfort and consent.\n\nMoreover, in research ethics, participant well-being is paramount. Forcing someone to continue participating against their will, especially in sensitive research, could lead to harm or distress.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best course of action is to allow the student to withdraw from the study.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
