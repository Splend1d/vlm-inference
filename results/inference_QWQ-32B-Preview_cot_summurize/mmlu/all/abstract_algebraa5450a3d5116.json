                    "text": "So I have these two statements about abelian groups, and I need to determine which one is true and which one is false. The statements are:\n\n1. Every free abelian group is torsion-free.\n\n2. Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nOkay, let's start by understanding what these terms mean.\n\nFirst, an abelian group is a set with an addition operation that is commutative, has an identity element, and every element has an inverse.\n\nA free abelian group is one that has a basis, meaning a set of elements such that every element in the group can be written uniquely as a linear combination of these basis elements with integer coefficients.\n\nA torsion-free abelian group is one where the only element with finite order is the identity. In other words, if you have an element g in the group and an integer n such that n*g = 0 (the identity), then g must be 0 unless n is zero.\n\nSo, for Statement 1: \"Every free abelian group is torsion-free.\"\n\nLet me think about this. If a group is free abelian, it has a basis, and elements are combinations of these basis elements with integer coefficients. If there was a torsion element, that would mean there's some non-identity element g such that n*g = 0 for some non-zero integer n. But in a free abelian group, g would be a non-zero linear combination of basis elements, and n*g would just be n times each coefficient. Since we're dealing with integers, n*g = 0 implies that each coefficient is zero, which would mean g is the identity. So, there are no torsion elements in a free abelian group. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, Statement 2: \"Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\"\n\nThis one seems a bit trickier. A finitely generated abelian group is one that has a finite set of generators. Torsion-free means it has no torsion elements other than the identity.\n\nI recall that for finitely generated abelian groups, there's a structure theorem that says any such group is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups. Specifically, it's isomorphic to Z^r \u2295 Z_{k1} \u2295 Z_{k2} \u2295 ... \u2295 Z_{kt}, where r is the rank, and Z_{ki} are finite cyclic groups.\n\nBut since the group is torsion-free, that means all the Z_{ki} are trivial, so the group is just Z^r, which is a free abelian group of rank r.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? Let me think of an example.\n\nTake the group Z \u2295 Z, which is free abelian of rank 2. It's finitely generated and torsion-free.\n\nAnother example: Z \u2295 Z \u2295 Z, free abelian of rank 3.\n\nWhat about a group like Z \u2295 (Z \u2295 Z)/H, where H is a subgroup. Hmm, but if I make H non-trivial, might introduce torsion.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to recall the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups.\n\nAccording to the structure theorem, any finitely generated abelian group G can be expressed as:\n\nG \u2245 Z^r \u2295 Z_{k1} \u2295 Z_{k2} \u2295 ... \u2295 Z_{kt},\n\nwhere r \u2265 0, t \u2265 0, and k1 divides k2, which divides k3, and so on up to kt.\n\nNow, if G is torsion-free, that means that all the Z_{ki} are trivial, because Z_{ki} is the torsion part. So, G \u2245 Z^r, which is a free abelian group of rank r.\n\nTherefore, every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is free abelian.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard that in some cases, torsion-free doesn't necessarily imply free, but that seems to contradict what I just said.\n\nLet me think of an example of a torsion-free abelian group that is not free.\n\nConsider the group Q, the rational numbers under addition. This is torsion-free because if n*(p/q) = 0 for some integer n, then p/q must be 0. But Q is not a free abelian group because it doesn't have a basis. Any would-be basis elements would be rationally related, which contradicts the linear independence required for a basis.\n\nHowever, Q is not finitely generated. In fact, it's not finitely generated as a Z-module because you need all fractions with denominator not divisible by some prime to generate it, which requires infinitely many generators.\n\nSo, in the case of finitely generated torsion-free abelian groups, they are indeed free abelian, as per the structure theorem.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, and the answer is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
