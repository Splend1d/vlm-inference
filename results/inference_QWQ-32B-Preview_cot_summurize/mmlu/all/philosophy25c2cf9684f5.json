Jean-Paul Sartre, one of the key figures in existentialism, famously stated that \"existence precedes essence.\" This means that, unlike in traditional philosophy where essence (the nature or definition of something) comes before existence, in existentialism, individuals first exist and then define their own essence through their actions and choices. This idea underscores the importance of personal responsibility and the uniqueness of each individual's experience."
