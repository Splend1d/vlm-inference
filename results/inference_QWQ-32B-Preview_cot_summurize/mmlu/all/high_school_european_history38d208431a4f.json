Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nThe free flow of plants and animals, as well as trade goods, between Europe and the Americas is referred to by historians as the Columbian Exchange, and affected the natives in which of the following ways?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the Columbian Exchange and its impact on the natives, based on the excerpts from Columbus and de las Casas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Columbian Exchange is. It's the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World after Columbus's voyages in 1492. So, it's not just about trade goods, but also about biological and cultural exchanges.\n\nNow, the question is asking about how this exchange affected the natives, and we have to choose the best answer from the options provided.\n\nLet's look at the excerpts to get some context.\n\nIn Source 1, Columbus is writing about his interactions with the natives. He mentions that they bartered their valuable items for trivial European goods, and he tried to regulate this exchange to prevent exploitation. He also talks about wanting to convert them to Christianity and make them loyal to the Spanish crown.\n\nIn Source 2, de las Casas paints a much darker picture. He describes the Spaniards as brutal and greedy, killing and persecuting the natives to acquire gold. He provides a stark statistic: the population of Hispaniola dropped from three million to two hundred, which is absolutely devastating.\n\nSo, based on these sources, it seems like the impact on the natives was largely negative.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Economic opportunities were reduced.\n\nB. They were subjugated and destroyed.\n\nC. Economic opportunities were created.\n\nD. They were enriched through trade in agricultural goods.\n\nOption A suggests that economic opportunities decreased. While this might be partially true, it doesn't capture the full severity of what happened, as described by de las Casas.\n\nOption B says they were subjugated and destroyed. This aligns closely with de las Casas's account of mass killings and the near-extermination of the native population.\n\nOption C suggests that economic opportunities were created. This might be true from the European perspective, but from the native perspective, it's hard to see how their situation improved economically.\n\nOption D says they were enriched through trade in agricultural goods. Again, while there was an exchange of plants and animals, it's not clear that the natives benefited economically from this exchange, especially given the exploitation described by de las Casas.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems to be the most accurate description of the impact of the Columbian Exchange on the natives, based on the provided sources.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Columbian Exchange also had some positive aspects, like the introduction of new crops and animals to both hemispheres, which eventually benefited agriculture and diets. But in the context of these sources, which emphasize exploitation and violence, option B appears to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
