The options are:\n\nA. its use would be unsafe.\n\nB. its use would be unfair.\n\nC. both of the above.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nI remember that Sandel has some ethical concerns about genetic enhancement, but I need to recall his specific arguments.\n\nFirst, option A says that genetic enhancement is unsafe. I think Sandel does mention safety concerns, but I'm not sure if that's his main point. Maybe it's a part of his argument, but perhaps not the central issue.\n\nOption B says that its use would be unfair. That sounds familiar. Sandel might argue that genetic enhancement could lead to inequalities, where only the wealthy can afford enhancements, creating a divide between the enhanced and non-enhanced people.\n\nOption C combines both, suggesting that Sandel believes both safety and fairness are issues with genetic enhancement.\n\nOption D says none of the above, which would mean that Sandel's objections are based on different reasons altogether.\n\nLet me think about this. Sandel is known for his work in political philosophy and ethics. In his book \"What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets,\" he discusses the ethical implications of allowing markets to govern certain aspects of society. Similarly, when it comes to genetic enhancement, he might be concerned about the moral implications beyond just safety and fairness.\n\nI recall that Sandel argues that genetic enhancement undermines the humility of accepting children as gifts, meaning that it interferes with the idea that children should be accepted for who they are, rather than being designed according to parents' specifications.\n\nAdditionally, he might argue that genetic enhancement goes against the notion of equality, as it allows some individuals to gain advantages through artificial means, which could lead to a form of genetic elitism.\n\nBut in the context of this question, the options are specifically about safety and fairness.\n\nConsidering that, option B seems most directly aligned with Sandel's likely concerns, as he might focus more on the ethical and social implications rather than just the safety aspects.\n\nHowever, safety is also a valid concern, and perhaps Sandel acknowledges that as well.\n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is C, both of the above, because Sandel could have multiple objections, including both safety and fairness.\n\nBut I need to recall specifically what Sandel's main argument is.\n\nLet me try to remember some quotes or key points from his work on this topic.\n\nI seem to recall that Sandel emphasizes the ethical and moral dimensions of genetic enhancement, particularly how it affects our understanding of nature and nurture, and our responsibilities towards future generations.\n\nHe might argue that genetic enhancement represents a form of hubris, where humans try to exert too much control over nature and the essence of human life.\n\nFurthermore, he could be concerned about the unintended consequences of genetic manipulation, which ties back to safety issues.\n\nSo, perhaps both safety and fairness are concerns for Sandel.\n\nAlternatively, maybe safety is more of a practical concern, while fairness is more ethical.\n\nGiven that, option C seems comprehensive, as it covers both aspects.\n\nBut I need to be careful, because the question might be testing whether Sandel's opposition is based on moral principles rather than just practical considerations like safety and fairness.\n\nWait, perhaps there's more to Sandel's view.\n\nLet me consider option D, none of the above.\n\nIf Sandel's objections are based on moral or philosophical grounds that aren't directly captured by safety and fairness, then maybe D is the correct answer.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as safety and fairness are significant concerns in debates about genetic enhancement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Sandel believes that genetic enhancement is inherently wrong regardless of whether it's safe or fair.\n\nBut that also seems unlikely; ethical arguments often consider the context and consequences.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose Sandel argues that genetic enhancement is wrong because it violates the integrity of human nature, or because it represents a form of \"playing God.\"\n\nIn that case, his objection might not directly map to safety or fairness, which would suggest that D is the correct answer.\n\nHowever, even in such arguments, issues of safety and fairness could be derivative concerns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Sandel does base his opposition primarily on safety and fairness, making C the correct answer.\n\nTo make a more informed decision, perhaps I should look up Sandel's specific statements on genetic enhancement.\n\nUnfortunately, since I'm recalling from memory, I have to make do with what I know.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is C, both of the above, because Sandel likely has concerns about both the safety and the fairness implications of genetic enhancement.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure, as his primary objections might be more philosophical in nature.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simplifying Sandel's position, and his actual views are more complex.\n\nIn that case, perhaps D is the better choice, indicating that his objections are based on reasons not listed here.\n\nHowever, given the options provided, I think C is the most comprehensive answer.\n\nSo, I'll go with C.both of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
