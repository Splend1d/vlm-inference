This seems like a harmless and affectionate gesture. It's common for parents to want to connect with their children during drop-off or pick-up times. As long as this action doesn't disrupt the school's operations or pose any safety risks, it's generally acceptable. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character lets their kids get ice cream as a special treat. Again, this appears to be a benign and positive action. Parents often reward their children with treats for good behavior or as a way to bond. Consuming ice cream in moderation is generally acceptable and doesn't harm anyone. Thus, this action also doesn't qualify as morally wrong under ordinary standards.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither action seems to violate any moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
