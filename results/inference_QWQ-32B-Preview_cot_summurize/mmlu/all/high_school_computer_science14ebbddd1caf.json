                    "text": "Let's see. So, if someone logs into a system using a stolen login and password, which pillar of cybersecurity is being compromised? The options are Authentication, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Nonrepudiation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these pillars means.\n\nAuthentication is about verifying the identity of a user. It's making sure that the person claiming to be someone is actually that person. So, if someone is logging in with a stolen login and password, they're impersonating someone else. That sounds like a problem with Authentication.\n\nConfidentiality is about keeping information secret and only accessible to authorized people. If someone is logging in with stolen credentials, they might be accessing information they shouldn't, which could violate confidentiality. But in this case, the main issue seems to be the login itself, not necessarily the access to sensitive information.\n\nIntegrity is about ensuring that data hasn't been tampered with and remains accurate. If someone logs in with stolen credentials and then modifies data, that could compromise integrity. But again, the question seems to be focusing on the login process itself.\n\nNonrepudiation is about preventing a user from denying their actions. So, if someone logs in with stolen credentials and does something bad, the real owner of the account could be held responsible because it was their credentials that were used. That could be a problem, but I'm not sure if that's the primary pillar being compromised here.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. If someone steals login credentials and uses them to log in, they're essentially bypassing the system's mechanism for verifying who they are. That sounds like a failure in Authentication.\n\nOn the other hand, if the system allows someone to log in with stolen credentials, it might also lead to confidentiality breaches, because the imposter could access sensitive information. But the question seems to be asking about which pillar is compromised by the act of logging in with stolen credentials, not necessarily what could happen after that.\n\nLet me look back at the options:\n\nA. Authentication \u2013 this seems directly related to the login process.\n\nB. Confidentiality \u2013 more about the protection of data.\n\nC. Integrity \u2013 about the accuracy and tamper-proofing of data.\n\nD. Nonrepudiation \u2013 about action attribution.\n\nGiven that, I think Authentication is the most directly compromised pillar in this scenario.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be overlap.\n\nIf someone logs in with stolen credentials, they're impersonating someone else, which is an authentication failure. Then, if they access confidential information, that's a confidentiality breach, but that's a secondary effect.\n\nSimilarly, if they modify data, that's an integrity issue, but again, that's after the initial login.\n\nNonrepudiation is about ensuring that someone can't deny their actions, but in this case, the real user might deny performing the actions taken by the imposter. So, nonrepudiation could be compromised because the imposter's actions are attributed to the real user.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be focusing on the act of logging in with stolen credentials, not on the subsequent actions.\n\nTherefore, I think the primary pillar being compromised here is Authentication.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Authentication.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
