Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and the patient takes no medications. Family history is significant for stable angina in her father and rheumatoid arthritis in her mother. The patient has a 102-year-old grandmother who resides in a nursing care facility and has Parkinson disease. The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. During the interview, her face is expressionless. She has a flexed posture and is unable to open her mouth wide. She is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 81 kg (179 lb); BMI is 27 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses thickening and hardening of the skin over the dorsum of the hands and forearms, as well as mild kyphosis. Strength testing shows no abnormalities; muscle tension is normal. Passive and active range of motion of the upper extremities is full. Gait is slow and deliberate. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Prior to surgery, further evaluation is indicated for which of the following conditions in this patient?\n\nA.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out what's going on with this patient. She's 57 years old and scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is surgery to remove her gallbladder. She seems otherwise healthy, no medications, no smoking, no drinking, and her vital signs are normal. But there are some interesting findings in her physical exam.\n\nFirst, her face is expressionless, she has a flexed posture, and can't open her mouth wide. Also, her skin on the backs of her hands and forearms is thickened and hardened, and she has mild kyphosis, which is curvature of the spine. Her strength is normal, muscle tension is normal, and her range of motion is full. Her gait is slow and deliberate, but otherwise no other abnormalities.\n\nSo, before she goes into surgery, the doctor wants to evaluate her for one of these conditions: Parkinson disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, sarcopenia, or systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Parkinson disease: This is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. It's characterized by tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slow movement), and postural instability. The patient has a flexed posture and slow, deliberate gait, which could be consistent with Parkinson's. Also, her expressionless face might suggest hypomimia, which is reduced facial expression seen in Parkinson's. However, she doesn't have tremors mentioned, but not all Parkinson's patients have tremors, especially in the early stages.\n\nB. Progressive supranuclear palsy: This is another neurodegenerative disease that affects movement and can cause stiffness, balance problems, and difficulties with eye movements. It's similar to Parkinson's but usually progresses faster and has more pronounced problems with eye movement and balance.\n\nC. Sarcopenia: This is the loss of muscle mass and function associated with aging. It can cause weakness and affect mobility, but in this patient, her strength is normal, and muscle tension is normal, so this seems less likely.\n\nD. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma): This is an autoimmune disease that causes hardening and thickening of the skin and can affect internal organs. The skin changes described\u2014thickening and hardening of the skin on the hands and forearms\u2014are consistent with scleroderma.\n\nNow, considering the context, the patient is going for surgery, and the doctor wants to evaluate her for one of these conditions before surgery. Likely, the condition could affect her surgical risk or anesthesia management.\n\nLet's think about it:\n\n- If it's Parkinson disease, that could impact her anesthesia management, as Parkinson's patients might have issues with certain medications used during anesthesia.\n\n- Progressive supranuclear palsy is rare and also could have implications for anesthesia, similar to Parkinson's.\n\n- Sarcopenia might affect her postoperative recovery, but given that her strength is normal, it's less of a concern.\n\n- Systemic sclerosis could affect her lungs or heart, which are important considerations for surgery, especially if it's a condition that could impact her ability to handle the stresses of surgery.\n\nGiven that her skin changes are consistent with scleroderma, and considering that scleroderma can affect internal organs like the lungs and heart, which are crucial for surgery, it makes sense that the doctor would want to evaluate her for systemic sclerosis before proceeding with surgery.\n\nAlso, the patient's family history includes Parkinson's on her father's side and rheumatoid arthritis on her mother's side, and her grandmother has Parkinson's. While there is a family history of Parkinson's, the physical findings seem more consistent with scleroderma.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
