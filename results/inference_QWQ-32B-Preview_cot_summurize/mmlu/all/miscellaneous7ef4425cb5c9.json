When geese are in flight, they are often called a \"skein\" or a \"formation.\" The other options you provided\u2014gang, gander, and grist\u2014do not refer to groups of geese. \"Gander\" actually refers to an adult male goose, while \"gang\" is a general term for a group of people or animals but isn't specifically used for geese. \"Grist\" typically refers to grain that is to be ground into flour and has no relation to geese."
