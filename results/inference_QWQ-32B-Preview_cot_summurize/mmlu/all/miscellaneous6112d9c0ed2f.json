                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Cheese is a necessary ingredient in which of these dishes? A. sushi B. french fries C. veal parmigiano D. chicken pot pie.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, sushi. I know that sushi usually has rice and raw fish, maybe some vegetables, but I don't recall cheese being a traditional ingredient in sushi. I think sushi is more associated with Japanese cuisine, where cheese isn't commonly used in their traditional dishes. So, probably not A.\n\nNext, french fries. French fries are just potatoes that are cut and fried, right? Sometimes you might have cheese sauce or parmesan on top, but I don't think cheese is a necessary ingredient for french fries. I mean, you can have plain fries without any cheese, and they're still fries. So, maybe B isn't the best answer.\n\nNow, veal parmigiano. I've heard of chicken parmigiano, where you have breaded chicken topped with tomato sauce and melted cheese, usually mozzarella. Veal is similar to chicken in this context, just using veal cutlets instead. So, it makes sense that veal parmigiano would also involve cheese. In fact, the \"parmigiano\" in the name might refer to Parmesan cheese, but I think mozzarella is more commonly used in these dishes. Either way, cheese seems essential here.\n\nLastly, chicken pot pie. Pot pies are savory pies filled with a mixture of chicken, vegetables, and a gravy or cream sauce. I don't remember cheese being a standard ingredient in chicken pot pie. It's more about the meat, vegetables, and the creamy filling. Maybe some recipes call for a pinch of cheese, but it's not something that defines the dish.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems like veal parmigiano is the dish where cheese is a necessary ingredient. Sushi doesn't typically use cheese, french fries can be without it, and chicken pot pie doesn't require cheese to be called a pot pie.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should double-check. Let me think about each one again.\n\nSushi: traditional Japanese dish with rice and raw fish. No cheese involved.\n\nFrench fries: just fried potatoes. Cheese is optional as a topping.\n\nVeal parmigiano: similar to chicken parm, which always has cheese.\n\nChicken pot pie: savory pie with chicken and vegetables in a creamy sauce. Cheese isn't a main component.\n\nYeah, I think C. veal parmigiano is the correct answer here. Cheese is a key part of that dish.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
