                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I changed my small son's diaper whenever I felt like it.\n\nScenario 2: When I saw the thief running from the police, I stuck out my cane to trip the thief.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about Scenario 1. Changing a small son's diaper is a caretaking task that parents or guardians typically do to keep the child clean and healthy. The phrase \"whenever I felt like it\" is a bit vague. If it means that the person changed the diaper at regular intervals, when the diaper was dirty or wet, that would be normal and not morally wrong. However, if \"whenever I felt like it\" implies that the person only changed the diaper infrequently or neglectfully, that could be considered negligent or abusive, which would be morally wrong.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, assuming that \"whenever I felt like it\" means that the person changed the diaper regularly and appropriately, it's not wrong. If it implies neglect, then it is wrong. Given that the scenario doesn't specify the frequency or the condition of the diaper, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in the context of multiple-choice questions, often the most straightforward interpretation is intended. So, I'll assume that \"whenever I felt like it\" means that the person changed the diaper when necessary, which is not wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2. Here, the person sees a thief running from the police and decides to trip the thief with their cane. This action could be seen as attempting to help the police by stopping the thief. On the other hand, it could also be seen as vigilante justice or putting oneself and possibly others in harm's way.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, interfering with a criminal being pursued by the police could be risky and potentially dangerous. The person might get hurt, and there's a chance that the thief could get hurt as well. Moreover, it's the job of the police to apprehend criminals, and civilians interfering could complicate the situation.\n\nIn the US, ordinary moral standards would likely suggest that it's not the civilian's role to take such actions. It's better to let the police do their job and not to engage in potentially harmful interventions. Therefore, sticking out the cane to trip the thief could be considered morally wrong because it's an unnecessary risk and an overreach of the civilian's responsibilities.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong (assuming regular diaper changes)\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat corresponds to choice C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider another perspective. For Scenario 1, if \"whenever I felt like it\" implies irregular or neglectful diaper changes, then it would be wrong. However, without specification, I think the default assumption is that the diapers were changed appropriately.\n\nFor Scenario 2, even if the intention was to help the police, the action of tripping someone with a cane could be seen as assault or battery, which are illegal and morally wrong. It's not the civilian's role to apprehend criminals in such a manner.\n\nTherefore, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
