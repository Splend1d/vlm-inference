                    "text": "I think the answer is A. Khalsa. The Khalsa is a special community within Sikhism that was founded by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, in 1699. It's like a brotherhood or sisterhood of dedicated Sikhs who have undergone a special ceremony called Amrit Sanchar. They are known for their commitment to living by the high moral and spiritual standards set by the Gurus.\n\nOption B, Rahit, refers to the Sikh code of conduct and conventions. It's more about the rules and guidelines that Sikhs are expected to follow in their daily lives.\n\nOption C, Panj Kakke, also known as the Five Ks, are five articles of faith that Khalsa Sikhs wear at all times. These are Kesh (uncut hair), Kangha (a wooden comb), Kara (a steel bracelet), Kachera (cotton undergarments), and Kirpan (a ceremonial sword). So, while Panj Kakke are important symbols for Khalsa Sikhs, they aren't the term for the order itself.\n\nOption D, Shabad, refers to a hymn or verse from the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism. It's an essential part of Sikh worship and meditation.\n\nSo, among these options, Khalsa seems to be the most appropriate term for describing the \"pure\" as an order of loyal Sikhs bound together.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
