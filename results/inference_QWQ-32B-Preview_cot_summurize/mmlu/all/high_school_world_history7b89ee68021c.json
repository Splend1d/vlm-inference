                    "text": "So I've got this question about the Treaty of Tordesillas from 1494. It's a pretty interesting historical document that basically drew a line down the middle of the world and decided which parts belonged to Spain and which belonged to Portugal. The question is asking why the King of Portugal insisted on controlling the territory east of the demarcation line. There are four options: A, B, C, and D. Let's look at each one and see which makes the most sense.\n\nOption A says that Portuguese explorers thought the route to the New World was easier by going east. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. The New World is west of Europe, so going east would take you towards Asia, not the Americas. Maybe I'm missing something here, but this doesn't sound right to me.\n\nOption B mentions that the Portuguese wanted to continue the crusades against the Mamelukes who controlled the Holy Land. Now, the crusades were a series of religious wars between Christians and Muslims, mainly fought in the Holy Land. The Mamelukes were a Muslim dynasty that ruled Egypt and parts of Syria. Portugal was a Christian kingdom, and there was certainly interest in reclaiming the Holy Land, but does this relate directly to the Treaty of Tordesillas? It seems a bit tangential. Maybe not the best explanation.\n\nOption C says that the Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico. Wait a minute, Mexico is in the New World, to the west of the demarcation line, not east. According to the treaty, lands to the west would belong to Spain, not Portugal. So, if Portugal was insisting on controlling lands east of the line, and Mexico is west, this doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nOption D states that the Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa. Now, this rings a bell. Portuguese explorers, like Vasco da Gama, had been seeking a sea route to India, which was rich in spices and other valuable goods. If they could reach India by sailing around Africa, they could establish a trade route without having to go through land routes controlled by other powers, like the Ottoman Empire. So, if Portugal was interested in controlling the eastern territories, it might be because they wanted to secure their trade routes to India and other Asian markets.\n\nLet me think about this again. The treaty is about dividing the newly discovered lands between Spain and Portugal. Portugal was interested in the eastern territories because they were focused on reaching India and Asia via the sea route around Africa. Spain, on the other hand, was more interested in the Americas, which were to the west.\n\nSo, if Portugal insisted on controlling the territory east of the demarcation line, it's likely because they wanted to protect their interests in the Indian Ocean and their trade routes to Asia. Option D seems to align with this reasoning.\n\nOption A doesn't make much sense because going east wouldn't lead to the New World; it would lead towards Asia. Option B about crusades seems less directly related to the treaty's purpose, which was to divide newly discovered lands. Option C is incorrect because Mexico is west of the demarcation line, which was assigned to Spain.\n\nTherefore, the best inference is that the Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope, and they wanted to ensure that this route and the lands they could reach through it were under their control.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
