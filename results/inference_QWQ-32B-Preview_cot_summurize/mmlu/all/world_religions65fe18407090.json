                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about which tradition promotes \"gradual enlightenment.\" The options are Bushido, Shinto, Nichiren, and Soto Zen. I think I need to recall some information about these different traditions to figure out which one is associated with gradual enlightenment.\n\nFirst, let's consider Bushido. I know that Bushido is the code of conduct for samurai in Japan. It emphasizes virtues like loyalty, honor, and courage, but I don't recall it being directly related to enlightenment or spiritual practices. So, maybe Bushido isn't the right choice here.\n\nNext, Shinto. Shinto is the indigenous spirituality of Japan, focusing on rituals and worship of kami, which are sacred spirits or gods. It's more about rituals, nature worship, and community festivals rather than enlightenment in the way I think about it in Buddhist contexts. So, perhaps Shinto isn't the answer either.\n\nNow, Nichiren. I believe Nichiren was a Buddhist monk who founded a branch of Buddhism known as Nichiren Buddhism. His teachings emphasize the importance of the Lotus Sutra and chanting the phrase \"Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.\" I think Nichiren Buddhism has a focus on attaining enlightenment in one's current form and in this lifetime, but I'm not sure if it's specifically about gradual enlightenment.\n\nFinally, Soto Zen. Soto Zen is a school of Zen Buddhism that was introduced to Japan by Dogen Zenji. I recall that Zen Buddhism is known for its practice of meditation, particularly zazen, and for emphasizing direct experience and intuition over intellectual understanding. I think Soto Zen is known for its approach to enlightenment as a gradual process, achieved through continuous meditation and practice.\n\nComparing these options, it seems like Soto Zen is the tradition most associated with gradual enlightenment. Nichiren Buddhism might have its own approach to enlightenment, but I think its method is more about chanting and faith in the Lotus Sutra, rather than a gradual process of meditation and practice.\n\nTo confirm, I remember reading that in Zen Buddhism, there are two main schools: Rinzai and Soto. Rinzai Zen is known for its use of koans and sudden enlightenment experiences, while Soto Zen emphasizes shikantaza, which is a form of meditation that doesn't seek sudden enlightenment but rather cultivates a state of just sitting, allowing enlightenment to arise naturally over time.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is D. Soto Zen, as it is known for promoting gradual enlightenment through continuous meditation practice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
