                    "text": "So I'm trying to solve this problem about a photon creating an electron-positron pair. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I know that in particle physics, when a high-energy photon interacts with matter, it can create particle-antiparticle pairs, like an electron and a positron in this case. The photon is destroyed in the process, and the new particles are created.\n\nThe problem says that the electron is initially at rest, and after the interaction, the positron and the two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. Wait, two electrons and a positron? That seems a bit confusing. Let's clarify: there's one initial electron at rest, and then after the photon strikes it, an electron-positron pair is created, so now there are two electrons and one positron moving off at equal speeds in the same direction as the photon was traveling.\n\nI need to find the energy of the photon that made this happen.\n\nOkay, let's think about conservation laws here. In particle interactions, energy and momentum are always conserved.\n\nFirst, conservation of energy:\n\nThe total energy before the interaction is the energy of the photon plus the rest energy of the electron at rest.\n\nThe energy of a photon is given by E_photon = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency. But maybe it's easier to work in terms of momentum, since photons have momentum as well.\n\nWait, the momentum of a photon is p_photon = E_photon / c, where c is the speed of light.\n\nAfter the interaction, we have three particles: two electrons and one positron, each moving with the same speed in the same direction.\n\nThe rest mass of an electron is m, and the rest mass of a positron is also m.\n\nThe total energy after the interaction is the sum of the relativistic energies of the three particles.\n\nThe relativistic energy of a particle is E = \u03b3mc^2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, given by \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), and v is the speed of the particle.\n\nSince all three particles are moving at the same speed, they each have the same \u03b3.\n\nSo, total energy after the interaction is 3 * \u03b3mc^2.\n\nNow, by conservation of energy:\n\nE_photon + E_electron_initial = 3 * \u03b3mc^2\n\nThe initial electron is at rest, so its energy is just its rest energy, E_electron_initial = mc^2.\n\nTherefore:\n\nE_photon + mc^2 = 3 * \u03b3mc^2\n\nSo, E_photon = 3 * \u03b3mc^2 - mc^2 = mc^2 (3\u03b3 - 1)\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to match any of the answer choices directly. Maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nLet me think about conservation of momentum.\n\nBefore the interaction, the momentum is just that of the photon, since the electron is at rest.\n\nSo, p_initial = p_photon = E_photon / c\n\nAfter the interaction, each of the three particles has momentum p = \u03b3mv in the same direction, since they're all moving at the same speed v.\n\nSo, total momentum after the interaction is 3 * \u03b3mv.\n\nBy conservation of momentum:\n\np_photon = 3 * \u03b3mv\n\nBut I also know that E_photon = p_photon * c, since for photons, E = pc.\n\nSo, E_photon = 3 * \u03b3mv * c\n\nWait, but earlier I had E_photon = mc^2 (3\u03b3 - 1)\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\nmc^2 (3\u03b3 - 1) = 3 * \u03b3mv * c\n\nLet's solve for v in terms of \u03b3:\n\nFrom E_photon = 3 * \u03b3mv * c\n\nAnd E_photon = mc^2 (3\u03b3 - 1)\n\nSo, mc^2 (3\u03b3 - 1) = 3 * \u03b3mv * c\n\nLet's divide both sides by m:\n\nc^2 (3\u03b3 - 1) = 3 * \u03b3v * c\n\nDivide both sides by c:\n\nc (3\u03b3 - 1) = 3 * \u03b3v\n\nNow, solve for v:\n\nv = [c (3\u03b3 - 1)] / (3\u03b3)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I need to relate v and \u03b3.\n\nRecall that \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the center-of-mass frame or something like that, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that in particle physics, these kinds of processes are governed by the Mandelstam variables, but that might be too advanced for this level.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the threshold energy required for this process to occur.\n\nThe threshold energy would be the minimum energy the photon needs to create the electron-positron pair, in addition to the initial electron.\n\nSo, the photon needs to supply enough energy to create the positron (mass m) and to give kinetic energy to all three particles.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me try to consider the total energy and total momentum in terms of relativistic invariants.\n\nOne invariant is the square of the total four-momentum.\n\nBefore the interaction, the total four-momentum is (E_photon + mc^2, p_photon), since the electron is at rest.\n\nAfter the interaction, the total four-momentum is (3\u03b3mc^2, 3\u03b3mv).\n\nThe square of the four-momentum should be the same before and after the interaction.\n\nSo, (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2 is invariant.\n\nBefore: (E_photon + mc^2)^2 - (p_photon c)^2\n\nAfter: (3\u03b3mc^2)^2 - (3\u03b3mv c)^2\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(E_photon + mc^2)^2 - (p_photon c)^2 = (3\u03b3mc^2)^2 - (3\u03b3mv c)^2\n\nBut p_photon = E_photon / c, so p_photon c = E_photon\n\nSimilarly, 3\u03b3mv c = 3\u03b3m v c\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider that in the final state, all three particles are moving with the same velocity, so their momenta are aligned.\n\nPerhaps I can use the fact that the total energy and momentum can be added as vectors, but since they're all moving in the same direction, it's straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of the energy required to create the new particles.\n\nThe initial energy is E_photon + mc^2 (the rest energy of the initial electron).\n\nThe final energy is the rest energies of the three particles plus their kinetic energies.\n\nBut since they're all moving at the same speed, their kinetic energies are the same.\n\nWait, but their masses are the same, so their total energies are the same.\n\nWait, no, the positron has the same mass as the electron, so all three particles have the same mass and same speed, hence same \u03b3, hence same energy.\n\nSo, total final energy is 3 * \u03b3mc^2\n\nTotal initial energy is E_photon + mc^2\n\nSet them equal:\n\nE_photon + mc^2 = 3\u03b3mc^2\n\nTherefore, E_photon = 3\u03b3mc^2 - mc^2 = mc^2 (3\u03b3 - 1)\n\nNow, I need to find \u03b3 in terms of something else.\n\nMaybe I can use the conservation of momentum.\n\nInitial momentum: p_photon = E_photon / c\n\nFinal momentum: 3 * \u03b3mv\n\nSet them equal:\n\nE_photon / c = 3\u03b3mv\n\nTherefore, E_photon = 3\u03b3mv c\n\nBut from earlier, E_photon = mc^2 (3\u03b3 - 1)\n\nSo, set them equal:\n\nmc^2 (3\u03b3 - 1) = 3\u03b3mv c\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\nc^2 (3\u03b3 - 1) = 3\u03b3 v c\n\nDivide both sides by c:\n\nc (3\u03b3 - 1) = 3\u03b3 v\n\nNow, solve for v:\n\nv = [c (3\u03b3 - 1)] / (3\u03b3)\n\nNow, recall that \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nSubstitute v back in:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - [[c (3\u03b3 - 1)] / (3\u03b3)]^2 / c^2 )\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - [(3\u03b3 - 1)^2] / (9\u03b3^2))\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator inside the square root by 9\u03b3^2:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt( (9\u03b3^2 - (3\u03b3 - 1)^2) / (9\u03b3^2) )\n\n\u03b3 = sqrt(9\u03b3^2 / (9\u03b3^2 - (3\u03b3 - 1)^2))\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n9\u03b3^2 - (9\u03b3^2 - 6\u03b3 + 1) = 9\u03b3^2 - 9\u03b3^2 + 6\u03b3 - 1 = 6\u03b3 - 1\n\nSo, \u03b3 = sqrt(9\u03b3^2 / (6\u03b3 - 1))\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\u03b3^2 = 9\u03b3^2 / (6\u03b3 - 1)\n\nMultiply both sides by (6\u03b3 - 1):\n\n\u03b3^2 (6\u03b3 - 1) = 9\u03b3^2\n\nDivide both sides by \u03b3^2 (assuming \u03b3 \u2260 0):\n\n6\u03b3 - 1 = 9\n\nTherefore, 6\u03b3 = 10, so \u03b3 = 10/6 = 5/3\n\nNow that I have \u03b3 = 5/3, I can find E_photon.\n\nFrom earlier, E_photon = mc^2 (3\u03b3 - 1) = mc^2 (3*(5/3) - 1) = mc^2 (5 - 1) = 4mc^2\n\nSo, the energy of the photon was 4mc^2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 4mc^2\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
