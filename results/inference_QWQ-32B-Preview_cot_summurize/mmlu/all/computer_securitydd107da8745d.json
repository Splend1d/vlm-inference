I need to figure out which one isn't a security exploit. First, I should probably understand what a security exploit is. A security exploit is basically when someone finds a weakness or vulnerability in a system and uses it to gain unauthorized access or to cause some kind of harm.\n\nOption A is \"Eavesdropping.\" I've heard of that. Eavesdropping is like listening in on someone's conversation without them knowing. In the context of computer security, it might mean intercepting data being transmitted over a network to steal information. So, that sounds like a security exploit.\n\nOption B is \"Cross-site scripting.\" I think I've come across that before. Cross-site scripting, or XSS, is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to stealing cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information. Definitely sounds like an exploit.\n\nOption C is \"Authentication.\" Now, authentication is the process of verifying someone's identity. It's a security measure designed to ensure that only authorized individuals can access certain resources. So, unlike the previous options, authentication seems more like a security feature rather than an exploit. Wait, but maybe it's a trick question, and there's a way that authentication can be exploited. I should think about that.\n\nOption D is \"SQL Injection.\" I know that SQL injection is a type of attack where an attacker inserts malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution. This can allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to database information. So, again, that's clearly an exploit.\n\nComparing all these options, A, B, and D are all recognized security exploits, while C, authentication, is a security mechanism. So, logically, authentication is not a security exploit.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's a scenario where authentication can be exploited. For example, if there's a weakness in the authentication process, like weak password requirements or vulnerabilities in the authentication protocol, an attacker could exploit that. However, the term \"authentication\" itself refers to the security measure, not the exploit.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. Authentication.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
