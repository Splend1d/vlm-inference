                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this problem about Stark Co. and a lawsuit they're facing. The question is about what amount they should accrue and disclose in their December 31 financial statements. Their legal counsel thinks it's reasonably possible that there will be an unfavorable outcome, and if there is, the damages could be between $100,000 and $150,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between accruing a contingent liability and disclosing it. Accruing means recording an estimated liability in the financial statements, which affects the company's financial position and results. Disclosing, on the other hand, means providing information about the contingency in the notes to the financial statements without recording it in the books.\n\nAccording to accounting standards, specifically FASB ASC 450-20 for contingencies, a liability should be accrued if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\n\nIn this case, the legal counsel says it's \"reasonably possible\" that there will be an unfavorable outcome. The term \"reasonably possible\" is important here. In accounting, \"probable\" is higher than \"reasonably possible.\" Probable means likely to occur, whereas reasonably possible means possible but not likely.\n\nSo, since it's only reasonably possible, not probable, that there will be an unfavorable outcome, Stark Co. should not accrue a liability for this contingency. Accrual requires that it's probable that a liability has been incurred.\n\nHowever, they still need to disclose the contingency in the notes to the financial statements if the potential loss is material. The disclosure should include a description of the contingency and an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss, if possible.\n\nIn this case, the range of possible damages is from $100,000 to $150,000. Since this is a significant amount, it's likely material, and thus should be disclosed.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Accrue $100,000 and disclose $100,000 to $150,000\n\nB. Accrue $100,000 and disclose $150,000\n\nC. Accrue $0 and disclose $100,000 to $150,000\n\nD. Accrue $0 and disclose $150,000\n\nBased on my understanding, since it's only reasonably possible, not probable, they should not accrue any liability. So, accruing $100,000 would be incorrect. That eliminates options A and B.\n\nBetween options C and D, option C says to accrue $0 and disclose the range $100,000 to $150,000, which aligns with what I think should be done.\n\nOption D says to accrue $0 and disclose $150,000. But according to the information, the range is from $100,000 to $150,000, so disclosing only the higher end might not be sufficient. It's better to disclose the full range.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: Accrue $0 and disclose $100,000 to $150,000.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any reason to choose otherwise.\n\nIf the outcome was probable, then they would need to accrue the best estimate within the range, which might be the midpoint, $125,000, or the minimum, $100,000, depending on the guidance. But since it's only reasonably possible, accrual is not required.\n\nAlso, in terms of disclosure, providing a range gives more transparency to the financial statement users, which is better than just disclosing the highest possible amount.\n\nHence, I'm confident that option C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nc. $0 $100,000 - $150,000"
