To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe passages above are best understood in the context of which of the following practices?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got these two passages here, one from William Bentinck, who was the Governor-General of India in 1829, and the other from George Simpson, who was the Head of the Northern Department of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1826. I need to figure out which practice these passages best relate to, and the options are: A. Legalization of slavery in overseas colonies, B. Exercise of colonial administrative power over native peoples, C. Western missionary efforts in colonized territories, or D. Mobilization of military resources from colonial possessions.\n\nFirst, let's look at Bentinck's passage. He's talking about the practice of Sati, which was the custom where a widow would throw herself onto her husband's funeral pyre. Bentinck is discussing whether to continue allowing this practice or to prohibit it. He mentions that preventing it could save hundreds of innocent lives, but he's also concerned about the safety of the British Empire in India if they intervene. He ultimately favors an open and general prohibition, especially since Britain is now supreme in the region.\n\nThis seems to be about colonial administration and making decisions that affect the governed population. He's considering the moral implications of allowing a harmful practice to continue versus the potential political risks of banning it.\n\nNow, George Simpson's statement is from the Hudson's Bay Company, which was involved in the fur trade in North America. Simpson says that the Indians must be ruled with a rod of iron to keep them in subordination, and the best way to do this is by making them dependent on the foodstuffs and manufactured goods sold by the company.\n\nThis also seems to be about controlling and administering native populations, but in the context of trade and economic dependency rather than direct governance.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Legalization of slavery in overseas colonies - Neither passage mentions slavery, so this seems unlikely.\n\nB. Exercise of colonial administrative power over native peoples - Both passages deal with how colonial authorities manage and make decisions affecting native populations, whether through banning harmful practices or economically controlling them.\n\nC. Western missionary efforts in colonized territories - There's no mention of missionary work here.\n\nD. Mobilization of military resources from colonial possessions - Again, no mention of military resources.\n\nSo, it seems that option B, the exercise of colonial administrative power over native peoples, best fits the context of both passages. Bentinck is exercising administrative power by considering the prohibition of Sati, and Simpson is discussing how to maintain control over native peoples through economic means.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
