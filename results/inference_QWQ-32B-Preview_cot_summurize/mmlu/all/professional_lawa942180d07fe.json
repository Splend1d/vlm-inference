However, the seller agreed with his associate that they would obtain 800 pounds of white fish instead, and tint the white fish with food colors to give it the appearance of the exotic sushi. The real sushi is about 10 times the value of the whitefish. The buyer had signed a contract with the fish seller to purchase the sushi. The seller's associate purchased the white fish and brought it back to seller's fish store to perform the coloring process. When the two men were mixing the colors but before they added it to the fish, an undercover FBI agent who worked on the premises and had recorded some of their discussions, arrested them for conspiracy and attempted criminal fraud. The accused filed a motion to dismiss the attempted fraud charge, arguing that they had not gone far enough for an attempt under the general principles of criminal attempt. Considering those principles, is the trial court likly to grant the motion to dismiss the attempt charge?\n\nA. Yes, because the law of attempt requires more substantial action toward the completion of the crimes then the accused men accomplished under these facts.\nB. Yes, because the fish would have to be delivered to the buyer and payment received from him for there to be a completed attempt.\nC. No, because the act of purchasing the fish and taking it to seller's facility with the criminal intent to color it is sufficient proof of criminal attempt to allow the case to go to the jury.\nD. No, because the agreement to commit criminal fraud by the two co-conspirators, combined with the act of mixing the colors, constituted sufficient proof of an attempt to commit the crime.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario involving a fish seller and some shady dealings. So, there's this fish seller who agreed to sell 800 pounds of rare sushi to a wholesale buyer. But, he and his associate planned to substitute it with 800 pounds of white fish, dye it to look like the rare sushi, and sell it at a much higher price since the rare sushi is about 10 times more valuable.\n\nThey signed a contract, so it's a legal agreement. The associate bought the white fish and brought it to the seller's fish store to dye it. They were in the process of mixing the food colors when an undercover FBI agent, who had been recording their discussions, arrested them for conspiracy and attempted criminal fraud.\n\nNow, the accused are trying to get the attempted fraud charge dismissed, arguing that they hadn't gone far enough to constitute an attempt under general criminal attempt principles. I need to consider these principles to determine whether the trial court is likely to grant their motion to dismiss the attempt charge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes an attempt in criminal law. Generally, an attempt requires two main elements:\n\n1. **Specific Intent to Commit the Crime:** The defendant must have the intention to perform the act that constitutes the crime.\n\n2. **A Substantial Step Toward the Commission of the Crime:** The defendant must have taken a significant action that goes beyond mere preparation and demonstrates a commitment to committing the crime.\n\nSo, in this case, the specific intent is clear\u2014they intended to substitute white fish for rare sushi and sell it at a much higher price, which is fraud. But the question is whether their actions constituted a substantial step toward committing the fraud.\n\nLet's look at what they did:\n\n- They purchased the white fish.\n\n- They brought it to the seller's facility.\n\n- They were in the process of mixing the food colors to dye the fish.\n\nThey were arrested just before adding the dye to the fish.\n\nNow, option A says yes, the court should grant the motion because they didn't do enough under the general principles of attempt. Option B also says yes, but it suggests that the fish would have to be delivered and payment received for there to be a completed attempt. Option C says no, because purchasing the fish and taking it to the facility with the intent to dye it is enough for an attempt. Option D also says no, but it emphasizes the agreement to commit fraud and the act of mixing the colors as sufficient for an attempt.\n\nI need to think about how far their actions went toward completing the fraud.\n\nPurchasing the white fish and bringing it to the facility shows preparation, but maybe not a substantial step. However, mixing the colors to dye the fish seems like a more direct action toward committing the fraud. They were right before dyeing the fish when they were arrested.\n\nIn criminal law, the line between preparation and attempt can be blurry, but generally, actions that are overt and demonstrate a determination to commit the crime are considered attempts.\n\nIn this scenario, mixing the colors seems like a substantial step because it's a direct action toward transforming the white fish into something that resembles the rare sushi, which is the key to the fraud.\n\nMoreover, since they had the intent and were in the process of taking actions that would directly lead to the fraud, it's likely that a court would consider this sufficient for an attempt.\n\nTherefore, options C and D seem more plausible.\n\nOption C says that purchasing the fish and taking it to the facility with the intent to dye it is sufficient for an attempt. While purchasing and transporting the fish show intent and preparation, mixing the colors might be a better indicator of a substantial step.\n\nOption D says that the agreement to commit fraud and the act of mixing the colors constitute sufficient proof of an attempt. This seems strong because the agreement shows intent, and mixing the colors is a direct action toward committing the fraud.\n\nComparing options C and D, option D seems slightly more accurate because it includes both the agreement and the act of mixing the colors, which together provide stronger evidence of an attempt.\n\nOption A suggests that more substantial action is required, but given that they were in the process of dyeing the fish, which is a direct act toward the fraud, this seems insufficient.\n\nOption B is even more extreme, suggesting that the fish would have to be delivered and payment received for there to be an attempt, which is too far; attempt doesn't require completion of the crime, just a substantial step toward it.\n\nTherefore, the trial court is unlikely to grant the motion to dismiss the attempt charge, and option D seems to be the most accurate reflection of the principles of criminal attempt in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
