                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this problem about inventory valuation methods. Mast Co. switched from FIFO to LIFO during a period of inflation, and I need to determine how this affects their ending inventory and income tax payable.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what FIFO and LIFO stand for and how they work. FIFO means First-In, First-Out, which assumes that the oldest inventory items are sold first. LIFO, on the other hand, stands for Last-In, First-Out, meaning that the most recently purchased items are sold first.\n\nNow, during a period of inflation, prices are rising. So, the most recent purchases are more expensive than the older ones.\n\nLet's think about ending inventory under FIFO. Since FIFO sells the oldest items first, the ending inventory would consist of the most recently purchased items, which are more expensive in inflationary times. Therefore, ending inventory under FIFO would be higher in value during inflation.\n\nUnder LIFO, since it sells the most recent items first, the ending inventory would consist of the older, less expensive items. So, ending inventory under LIFO would be lower in value during inflation.\n\nNow, let's consider the income tax payable. The cost of goods sold (COGS) affects the net income, which in turn affects the income tax payable.\n\nUnder FIFO, with higher ending inventory, the COGS would be lower because the cost of older, cheaper items is recorded as sold. Lower COGS leads to higher net income and, consequently, higher income tax payable.\n\nUnder LIFO, with lower ending inventory, the COGS would be higher because the cost of newer, more expensive items is recorded as sold. Higher COGS leads to lower net income and, consequently, lower income tax payable.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Ending inventory under LIFO would be lower than under FIFO during inflation.\n\n- Income tax payable under LIFO would be lower than under FIFO during inflation.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Lower Lower\n\nB. Higher Higher\n\nC. Lower Higher\n\nD. Higher Lower\n\nIt seems that option A is correct: ending inventory is lower and income tax payable is lower under LIFO compared to FIFO during inflation.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. I might be mixing something up.\n\nUnder FIFO:\n\n- Ending inventory is higher (recent, expensive items).\n\n- COGS is lower.\n\n- Net income is higher.\n\n- Income tax payable is higher.\n\nUnder LIFO:\n\n- Ending inventory is lower (older, cheaper items).\n\n- COGS is higher.\n\n- Net income is lower.\n\n- Income tax payable is lower.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, ending inventory is lower and income tax payable is lower under LIFO compared to FIFO during inflation.\n\nBut looking back at the question:\n\n\"Mast's ending inventory and income tax payable using LIFO be higher or lower than FIFO?\"\n\nSo, it's asking how LIFO compares to FIFO.\n\nEnding inventory under LIFO: lower than FIFO.\n\nIncome tax payable under LIFO: lower than FIFO.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Lower Lower.\n\nBut wait, let me consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nInflation causes prices to rise, so LIFO would have higher COGS because the most recent, expensive items are sold first. This reduces net income and thus reduces income tax payable.\n\nFIFO would have lower COGS because the older, cheaper items are sold first, leading to higher net income and higher income tax payable.\n\nSo, again, LIFO results in lower ending inventory and lower income tax payable compared to FIFO during inflation.\n\nI think option A is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider a simple numerical example.\n\nSuppose Mast Co. had the following inventory purchases:\n\n- Beginning inventory: 100 units at $10 each.\n\n- Purchase 1: 200 units at $12 each.\n\n- Purchase 2: 150 units at $15 each.\n\nTotal units available: 100 + 200 + 150 = 450 units.\n\nLet's say they sold 300 units during the period.\n\nUnder FIFO:\n\n- COGS: 100 units at $10 + 200 units at $12 = $1000 + $2400 = $3400.\n\n- Ending inventory: 150 units at $15 = $2250.\n\nUnder LIFO:\n\n- COGS: 150 units at $15 + 150 units at $12 = $2250 + $1800 = $4050.\n\n- Ending inventory: 100 units at $10 + 50 units at $12 = $1000 + $600 = $1600.\n\nSo, indeed, ending inventory is lower under LIFO ($1600 vs. $2250 under FIFO).\n\nAssuming a constant selling price, higher COGS under LIFO would lead to lower net income and thus lower income tax payable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Lower Lower.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider another perspective.\n\nSome people might think that with LIFO, since COGS is higher, the income tax payable should be higher because higher COGS might lead to higher expenses and thus higher tax shield. But actually, higher COGS leads to lower taxable income, which results in lower income tax payable.\n\nSo, the initial reasoning holds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Lower Lower.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
