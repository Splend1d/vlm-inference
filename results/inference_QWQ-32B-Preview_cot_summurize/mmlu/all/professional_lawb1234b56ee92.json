                    "text": "This is a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. So, there's a man who owns land along the south side of a highway, and to the south of his land is a lot owned by a woman who lives in a house there. Five years ago, the man gave the woman a right-of-way easement over his land to make it easier for her to get to the highway. This easement was marked by a clear path and the document was recorded.\n\nThen, three years ago, the woman sold her house to the man. But the man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man sold the house to another person, called the purchaser, with a warranty deed. Two months after moving in, the purchaser learns about the easement from a neighbor and starts using the path. The original man then blocks the path with a barricade, and the purchaser sues, saying he has an easement over the land.\n\nThe question is, who is likely to prevail? Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The man, because the easement was extinguished.\n\nB. The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.\n\nC. The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.\n\nD. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n\nFirst, let's think about what happens when there's an easement and the properties are conveyed.\n\nAn easement is a non-possessory interest in land that allows the easement holder to use another's land for a specified purpose. In this case, it's a right-of-way easement, meaning the woman had the right to use a path on the man's land to access the highway.\n\nWhen the woman sold her house to the man, did the easement go away? Not necessarily. Easements can run with the land, meaning they transfer to subsequent owners unless explicitly extinguished.\n\nThen, when the man sold the house to the purchaser, what happened to the easement? Well, a warranty deed generally conveys all interests in the property, including easements appurtenant to the land, assuming they are known.\n\nBut here, the purchaser only learned about the easement two months after moving in. However, the easement was recorded five years ago, and the man sold the house two years ago. So, was the purchaser supposed to know about it?\n\nIn most jurisdictions, an easement that is properly recorded is considered to be of public record, and subsequent purchasers are presumed to have notice of it, even if they didn't actually know about it.\n\nSo, option D seems plausible: the purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n\nBut let's look at option B: the man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition. The purchaser didn't know about it until two months after moving in, so he didn't have actual notice at the time of purchase.\n\nHowever, in many legal systems, record notice is sufficient, meaning that if the easement is recorded, the purchaser is deemed to have notice of it, regardless of whether they actually knew about it.\n\nOption C says the purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed. A warranty deed does convey all interests in the property, but it doesn't necessarily preserve easements unless they are identified in the deed. In this case, the easement was already recorded, so it should be considered part of the property.\n\nOption A says the man, because the easement was extinguished. But there's no indication that the easement was formally extinguished or released. The man sold the house to the purchaser, but the easement was already in place.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that the purchaser should have the right to use the easement because it was part of public record at the time of purchase, even if he didn't actually know about it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely D: the purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
