                    "text": "Let's see. Pregnancy tests detect B-hCG in urine, right? So, B-hCG is human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone that's produced during pregnancy. The question is asking about the tissue that secretes this hormone and its function.\n\nOption A says corpus luteum and self-maintenance. I know that the corpus luteum is a structure in the ovary that forms after ovulation and it produces progesterone, which helps maintain the endometrium. But B-hCG isn't produced by the corpus luteum, as far as I know. So, maybe that's not the right answer.\n\nOption B is endometrium and cell division. The endometrium is the lining of the uterus, and it does undergo cell division during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. However, I think B-hCG is not primarily secreted by the endometrium.\n\nOption C is blastocyst, increase in blood flow. The blastocyst is the early stage of embryo development, and it does implant into the uterus. Maybe it secretes B-hCG to increase blood flow to the uterus or something like that.\n\nOption D is blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance. This seems similar to option C, but here it mentions corpus luteum maintenance.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that B-hCG is important for maintaining the corpus luteum during early pregnancy. The corpus luteum produces progesterone, which is essential for sustaining the pregnancy. So, if B-hCG helps maintain the corpus luteum, that sounds important.\n\nLet me think about this again. The blastocyst implants into the uterus, and during this process, it starts secreting B-hCG. This hormone then signals the corpus luteum to continue producing progesterone, which is necessary for maintaining the endometrium and supporting the pregnancy.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I would say that B-hCG is secreted by the blastocyst, and its function is to maintain the corpus luteum. That would make option D the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should double-check. What does the blastocyst do exactly? It's the early embryo after fertilization, before implantation. After implantation, it develops into the chorion, which is part of the placenta.\n\nActually, B-hCG is produced by the trophoblast cells, which are part of the developing placenta. The trophoblasts invade the uterine lining during implantation and secrete B-hCG.\n\nSo, perhaps it's more accurate to say that B-hCG is secreted by the tissue that develops from the blastocyst, specifically the trophoblast cells.\n\nBut among the given options, option D says blastocyst and corpus luteum maintenance, which seems to capture the essence of it.\n\nI think I'll go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
