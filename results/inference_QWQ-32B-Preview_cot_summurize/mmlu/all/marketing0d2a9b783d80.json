The options are Late Majority, Early Adopter, Early Majority, and Laggards. I need to figure out which one fits the description.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these terms means in the context of diffusion of innovations. Let me think:\n\n1. **Early Adopters**: These are the folks who are the first to try out new products. They are usually well-informed, have a high social status, and are seen as influencers in their communities. They are not the first to try something new like the Innovators, but they are quick to follow.\n\n2. **Early Majority**: This group consists of people who adopt new products after a varying degree of time, but before the average member of the society. They are typically deliberate in their adoption decisions and look to the early adopters for validation.\n\n3. **Late Majority**: These are the more skeptical adopters who need a lot of proof that the innovation is worthwhile before they adopt it. They often adopt new products after the average member of society has already done so.\n\n4. **Laggards**: This group is the last to adopt new products. They are often traditionalists and are resistant to change. They only adopt innovations after a long period, often when the new product has become a standard or when the old way is no longer available.\n\nNow, the question is describing a group that enjoys being at the leading edge of innovation and buys into new products at an early stage. That sounds a lot like the Early Adopters to me. They are the ones who are eager to try new things and are at the forefront of adopting innovations.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\n- **Late Majority**: They adopt after the average, which isn't early stage.\n\n- **Early Majority**: They adopt before the average, but not as early as the early adopters.\n\n- **Laggards**: They are the last to adopt, which is the opposite of being at the leading edge.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems clear that the correct answer is Early Adopter.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"who enjoy being at the leading edge of innovation and buy into new products at an early stage.\" Is there any group that might be even earlier than early adopters?\n\nI think about Innovators, but they are not listed in the options. Innovators are the first to come up with new ideas and products, whereas early adopters are the first customers who embrace these innovations.\n\nGiven that Innovators are not an option, and considering the description, Early Adopter seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap between these groups. For example, is there a subgroup within early majority that might be similar to early adopters?\n\nI don't think so. The Rogers' diffusion of innovations theory pretty clearly delineates these groups based on when they adopt new products relative to the overall population.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the answer should be B. Early Adopter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
