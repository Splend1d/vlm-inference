                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the characteristic that's unique to angiosperms from this list. Angiosperms are flowering plants, right? So, they have some features that set them apart from other plants like gymnosperms, bryophytes, and so on.\n\nOption A is \"wind-borne pollen.\" I know that many plants, including some gymnosperms, disperse their pollen via wind. So, wind-borne pollen isn't unique to angiosperms.\n\nOption B says \"dominant sporophyte life cycle.\" I think most plants, except maybe for some algae and bryophytes, have a dominant sporophyte stage. So, that probably isn't unique to angiosperms.\n\nOption C is \"alteration of generations.\" That's a fundamental feature of plants, where they alternate between haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte generations. Again, not unique to angiosperms.\n\nOption D is \"double fertilization.\" Hmm, I think this is something specific to angiosperms. In angiosperms, when pollen reaches the stigma, it germinates and grows a pollen tube down to the ovule. Then, two sperm cells are released into the ovule. One sperm fertilizes the egg to form the embryo, and the other fertilizes the polar nuclei to form the endosperm, which provides nourishment for the developing embryo. This double fertilization is a key feature of angiosperms and isn't found in other plant groups.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is D, double fertilization, because it's a characteristic unique to angiosperms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
