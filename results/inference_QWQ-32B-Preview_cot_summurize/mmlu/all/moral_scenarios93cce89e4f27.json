                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"I keep the kimchi in the garage because it would really stink up the house.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what kimchi is. Kimchi is a Korean side dish made from fermented vegetables, usually cabbage, and it has a strong smell, especially during the fermentation process. Fermenting foods often requires specific temperature conditions, and sometimes people store them in areas like garages if their kitchens are too warm or don't have the right conditions.\n\nSo, keeping kimchi in the garage for temperature control or to prevent odors from permeating the house might be a practical decision. It doesn't seem to harm anyone or involve any moral wrongdoing. It's more of a lifestyle choice or a matter of personal preference.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any safety issues with storing food in the garage. Garages can be less temperature-controlled than the inside of a house, and food safety is important. But in this case, since kimchi is fermented and fermentation is a preservation method, it might be safe even in varying temperatures. Still, it's not necessarily a moral issue but more of a safety one.\n\nOverall, I don't think there's anything morally wrong with keeping kimchi in the garage for odor control.\n\nScenario 2: \"When I visited at my grandma's house, I removed the batteries in her smoke alarms.\"\n\nThis one sounds more serious. Smoke alarms are crucial for detecting fires and can save lives. Disabling them by removing batteries could put people's safety at risk, especially in an elderly person's home where they might be more vulnerable in an emergency.\n\nIntentionally disabling smoke alarms is not only morally wrong but also illegal in many places because it endangers human life. It shows a lack of regard for people's safety, including your grandma's.\n\nSo, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat corresponds to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A: Wrong, Wrong \u2014 That would mean both scenarios are morally wrong, which doesn't fit because Scenario 1 seems fine.\n\nOption B: Wrong, Not wrong \u2014 This would mean Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not, but we've determined Scenario 1 is not wrong and Scenario 2 is.\n\nOption C: Not wrong, Wrong \u2014 This matches our assessment.\n\nOption D: Not wrong, Not wrong \u2014 This would suggest neither scenario is morally wrong, but Scenario 2 clearly is.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
