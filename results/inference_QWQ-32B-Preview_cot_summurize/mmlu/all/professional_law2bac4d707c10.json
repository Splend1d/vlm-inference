                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex with many layers involving property law, covenants, and interests in land. I need to carefully analyze the situation and determine the best argument for the son.\n\nFirst, let's understand the background:\n\n- There's a housing corporation that owns a tract of land and plans to divide it into 100 lots for a residential community.\n\n- They create a Declaration of Covenants, which sets up a community association and includes various regulations and restrictions.\n\n- One specific restriction is that no structure designed for or used as a saloon or for the sale or manufacture of alcoholic beverages can be erected on any part of the property.\n\n- This Declaration is recorded, and it's included in the deed when a psychologist purchases lot 24.\n\n- The psychologist then gives the lot to his son with a deed that says the premises are conveyed to the son, his heirs, and assigns, as long as they are used for residential purposes only.\n\n- The son doesn't record this deed and was unaware of the Declaration of Covenants.\n\n- The son starts selling imported wine from his home, and the neighbor (the geologist) brings an action of ejectment against him.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which argument is best for the son among the options provided.\n\nOption A: The deed to the son created a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, giving the psychologist, but not the geologist, the right to sue the son.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- A fee simple determinable is an estate that lasts forever unless a specific condition occurs, at which point it reverts to the grantor.\n\n- In this case, the deed says \"as long as they are used for residential purposes only.\"\n\n- So, if the son uses the property for a non-residential purpose, the estate could revert to the psychologist.\n\n- However, the question is whether the geologist can bring an action of ejectment.\n\n- Typically, only the grantor or the holder of the reversionary interest can enforce the condition and seek ejectment.\n\n- So, if it's a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter in the psychologist, then only the psychologist could bring such an action, not the geologist.\n\nTherefore, this could be a strong argument for the son, suggesting that the geologist doesn't have the standing to bring the action.\n\nOption B: Not having been recorded, the condition cannot be enforced against the son.\n\nThis seems relevant because recording deeds is important for providing notice to subsequent purchasers.\n\n- The Declaration of Covenants was recorded, and it was included in the psychologist's deed.\n\n- The psychologist gave the deed to his son, but the son didn't record it.\n\n- Generally, recording statutes ensure that recorded documents provide constructive notice to subsequent purchasers.\n\n- However, since the son received the deed directly from his father, and it's his own property, recording might not be as critical.\n\n- But perhaps the son could argue that because his deed wasn't recorded, the geologist couldn't have known about the restrictions, and thus can't enforce them.\n\nThis might not be the strongest argument because the Declaration was already recorded, and the restriction is part of the chain of title.\n\nOption C: The geologist is entitled only to an injunction against the son.\n\nThis suggests that while the geologist might have some remedy, it's limited to injunction and not ejectment.\n\n- In property law, injunctions are often used to prevent a breach of covenant.\n\n- Ejectment, on the other hand, is a legal action to remove someone from property.\n\n- So, perhaps the geologist can seek an injunction to stop the son from using the property in violation of the covenant but not necessarily seek ejectment.\n\n- However, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific terms of the Declaration, ejectment might be an available remedy.\n\nThis is a possible argument, but it might not necessarily defeat the action entirely.\n\nOption D: The law prohibits a fee simple determinable.\n\nThis seems like a weak argument because fee simple determinable is a recognized form of estate in property law.\n\n- It's commonly used in real estate transactions with conditions attached.\n\n- So, arguing that the law prohibits it doesn't seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, this isn't a strong argument for the son.\n\nConsidering all options, Option A seems the strongest for the son.\n\n- It asserts that only the psychologist, as the grantor with the possibility of reverter, has the right to bring an action of ejectment based on the condition in the deed.\n\n- The geologist, being a neighboring property owner, might not have the standing to enforce this particular condition.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether the Declaration of Covenants creates a different set of rights.\n\n- The Declaration established a community association to enforce the covenants.\n\n- The restriction on saloons and liquor sales is part of this Declaration.\n\n- Typically, in a residential development, the covenants run with the land and bind all lot owners.\n\n- Therefore, the geologist, as a lot owner, might have the right to enforce the covenants against other lot owners.\n\n- This could override the specific language in the son's deed from his father.\n\nMoreover, the son received the property subject to the Declaration of Covenants, even if his deed didn't mention it explicitly.\n\n- When a Declaration of Covenants is recorded and affects the property, subsequent owners are bound by it, regardless of whether it's mentioned in their deed.\n\n- So, the son, as the owner of lot 24, is likely bound by the covenants, including the restriction on selling alcoholic beverages.\n\nGiven this, the son's best argument might not be Option A, because the geologist could have standing to enforce the covenants as a lot owner.\n\nOption B is weaker because the Declaration was recorded, providing notice to all subsequent owners.\n\nOption C might have some merit, suggesting that the remedy should be an injunction rather than ejectment.\n\n- However, the action is for ejectment, and if the geologist can prove a violation of the covenants, they might be entitled to that remedy.\n\nOption D is clearly weak.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the son's best argument is that the geologist is entitled only to an injunction, not ejectment.\n\n- This acknowledges that there may be a violation of the covenants but limits the remedy.\n\n- It's possible that ejectment is too severe a remedy for a covenant violation, and injunction is more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, the son could argue that his use of the property doesn't violate the covenant.\n\n- The covenant prohibits structures designed for or used as saloons or for the sale or manufacture of liquor.\n\n- If the son is simply selling wine from his home without altering the structure or operating a saloon, he might argue that he's not in violation.\n\n- However, this depends on the specific facts and how the court interprets \"place for the sale...of spirituous liquors.\"\n\nGiven the options provided, though, I need to choose the best argument from those listed.\n\nBetween Options A, B, C, and D, Option A seems initially strong but may not hold up considering the broader context of the Declaration of Covenants.\n\nOption C is more plausible, as it accepts that there might be a violation but limits the remedy.\n\nTherefore, I would say that Option C is the best argument for the son: \"The geologist is entitled only to an injunction against the son.\"\n\nThis acknowledges potential liability but resists the more drastic remedy of ejectment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
