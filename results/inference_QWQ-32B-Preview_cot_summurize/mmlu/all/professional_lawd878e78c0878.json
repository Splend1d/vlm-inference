                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. So, there's a woman who had an affair and didn't know her paramour had a venereal disease. She had sex with her husband afterward, and he got the disease. Now, her husband is suing the paramour for not telling the woman about his disease, and the trial court dismissed the case. We need to decide what the appellate court will decide.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA says there's a cause of action because anyone who transmits a sexually communicable disease is strictly liable to everyone who contracts it. Strict liability means you're responsible without having to prove negligence. But I think in most jurisdictions, for sexually transmitted infections, it's not strict liability; you usually have to show some level of negligence or intent.\n\nB says there's no cause of action because the wife assumed the risk that the paramour had a sexually transmittable disease. Assumption of risk is when someone knowingly and voluntarily takes on a known risk. Maybe, but in many places, there's a duty to disclose known STDs to sexual partners.\n\nC says there is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others. That sounds plausible. If you know you have an STD, you should tell your sexual partners so they can make informed decisions and take precautions.\n\nD says there's no cause of action because the paramour's negligence was cut off by the wife's intervening negligence, which became a superseding cause. Intervening negligence can sometimes break the chain of causation.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, does the paramour have a duty to disclose his STD to the woman? In many jurisdictions, yes, if he knows he has an STD, he has a duty to tell his sexual partner. Failure to disclose can be negligence.\n\nSecond, did the paramour's failure to disclose lead to the husband getting the disease? Well, the woman had sex with her husband soon after, and he got the disease within a few days. It seems plausible that the disease was transmitted from the paramour to the woman and then to the husband.\n\nThird, is the paramour liable to the husband? That's interesting. Usually, liability is between the person who had the duty and the person who was directly affected by the breach of that duty. Here, the paramour had a duty to the woman, but the husband was indirectly affected.\n\nFourth, perhaps the husband can sue the paramour based on negligence that indirectly caused his infection. But negligence generally requires a direct relationship and foreseeability. It might be stretching it.\n\nOption A seems too broad with \"strict liability to all who contract it.\" Strict liability is usually reserved for very dangerous activities, and even in STD cases, it's typically negligence-based.\n\nOption B says the wife assumed the risk. But assuming the risk usually means knowing about the risk and voluntarily taking it. Did the wife know about the risk of STDs with her affair? Maybe, but the paramour's failure to disclose his specific condition might mean she didn't know about that particular risk.\n\nOption C aligns with the idea that someone with an STD has a duty to be careful not to infect others. That seems correct.\n\nOption D suggests that the wife's intervening negligence broke the chain. What was the wife's negligence? Maybe having sex with her husband without telling him about her affair. But was that a superseding cause? It's complicated.\n\nI think the key here is whether the paramour owed a duty to the husband. Typically, duties are owed directly to those with whom you have a relationship. The paramour had a relationship with the woman, not directly with the husband.\n\nHowever, some jurisdictions might recognize that the paramour should have foreseen that the woman could have sex with her husband and transmit the disease, thus potentially owing a duty to the husband as well.\n\nBut this seems a bit of a stretch. More likely, the duty was to the woman, and the husband's infection is too remote a consequence for the paramour to be directly liable.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the trial court was correct in dismissing the complaint, and the appellate court will affirm that decision.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA: Probably not, because strict liability isn't typically applied here.\n\nB: Maybe, but assumption of risk might not apply if the paramour didn't disclose his specific condition.\n\nC: This seems correct in terms of the paramour's duty to the woman, but perhaps not directly to the husband.\n\nD: This could be a reason to dismiss the complaint, as the wife's actions intervened.\n\nI'm leaning towards D: there's no cause of action because the paramour's negligence was cut off by the wife's intervening negligence, which became a superseding cause.\n\nThe paramour was negligent for not disclosing his STD to the woman, but the wife then had sex with her husband without telling him about her potential exposure, which intervened and led to the husband's infection.\n\nThus, the paramour's initial negligence was superseded by the wife's actions, breaking the chain of causation.\n\nTherefore, the appellate court is likely to affirm the trial court's decision to dismiss the complaint.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) There is no cause of action because the paramour's negligence was cut off by the wife's intervening negligence which became a superseding cause."
