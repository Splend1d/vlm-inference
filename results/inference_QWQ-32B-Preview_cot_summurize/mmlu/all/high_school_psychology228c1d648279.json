His therapist helped him by teaching him relaxation exercises and gradually exposing him to airplanes in a step-by-step manner. Let's see what this process is called.\n\nFirst, he looked at pictures of airplanes. Then, he went to see planes taking off at the airport. After that, he got into an empty plane that wasn't going to take off. Finally, he took a short flight. This sounds like he was gradually facing his fear in increasing levels of difficulty.\n\nI remember that there are different types of therapy, and one of them involves changing behaviors and facing fears step by step. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Psychoanalysis - That's the one where you lie on a couch and talk about your dreams and past experiences, right? Doesn't seem like that's what Justin did.\n\nB. Behavior therapy - This sounds promising. Behavior therapy focuses on changing behaviors through techniques like exposure and reinforcement.\n\nC. Humanistic therapy - This is more about self-exploration and personal growth, like Carl Rogers' client-centered therapy.\n\nD. Existential therapy - This one deals with existential issues like freedom, meaning, and mortality.\n\nGiven that Justin was learning relaxation exercises and gradually facing his fear of flying, it seems like he was undergoing a type of behavior therapy. Specifically, this sounds like systematic desensitization, which is a behavior therapy technique used to help people overcome phobias.\n\nIn systematic desensitization, the person is taught relaxation techniques and then exposed to the feared object or situation in a hierarchical manner, starting from the least frightening to the most frightening. That matches what Justin did: starting with pictures, then being at the airport, then sitting in an empty plane, and finally taking a short flight.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. behavior therapy.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. Was he talking about his feelings and past experiences? Not mentioned. Was he focusing on self-actualization and personal growth? Doesn't seem like it. Was he discussing the meaning of life and existence? No. He was specifically working on overcoming a fear through gradual exposure and relaxation.\n\nTherefore, behavior therapy is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
