                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which type of advertising is being used when a retail store shares advertising costs with a national distributor. The options are trade advertising, industrial advertising, national advertising, and cooperative advertising. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each type of advertising means:\n\n1. **Trade Advertising**: This usually refers to advertising aimed at trade professionals, like retailers or wholesalers, to encourage them to carry or promote certain products. It's more about promoting to other businesses rather than directly to consumers.\n\n2. **Industrial Advertising**: This is advertising targeted at industries or businesses, often B2B, to promote industrial products or services.\n\n3. **National Advertising**: This typically involves advertising campaigns that are run nationally, often by large companies to promote their brands or products across the entire country.\n\n4. **Cooperative Advertising**: This is when two or more entities, usually a manufacturer and a retailer, share the cost of advertising. It's a collaborative effort to promote a product or service.\n\nNow, in the scenario given, a retail store is agreeing to share advertising costs with a national distributor for a consumer product. So, it's a situation where both the retailer and the distributor are contributing to the advertising expenses.\n\nLooking at the definitions:\n\n- Trade advertising seems to be more about promoting to trade professionals, not necessarily about cost-sharing.\n\n- Industrial advertising is geared towards industries, which might not directly apply here since it's about a consumer product.\n\n- National advertising is broad and national in scope, but it doesn't necessarily involve cost-sharing between different entities.\n\n- Cooperative advertising specifically involves sharing advertising costs between, say, a manufacturer and a retailer.\n\nGiven that, cooperative advertising seems to fit the scenario described. The retail store and the national distributor are sharing the costs of advertising the product, which aligns with the definition of cooperative advertising.\n\nTo double-check, I'll consider if there's any other type that could apply. For instance, national advertising might involve broad campaigns, but the key here is the cost-sharing aspect between the retailer and the distributor. Cooperative advertising explicitly addresses this cost-sharing partnership.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is D. Cooperative advertising.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
