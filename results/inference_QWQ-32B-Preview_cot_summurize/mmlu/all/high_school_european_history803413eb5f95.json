Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\nA.

                    "text": "I'm looking at these two sources, one from Christopher Columbus and the other from Bartholomew de las Casas, both describing interactions between Spaniards and natives in the Americas. There are some pretty big differences in their accounts, and I need to figure out which option best explains why that is.\n\nFirst, let's look at Columbus's letter from 1493. He seems to be describing a somewhat positive exchange where natives are trading willingly, even if he thinks they're giving too much for small trinkets. He also mentions that he gave them gifts without expecting anything in return to win their favor and to encourage them to become Christians and allies to the Spanish crown. It sounds like he's trying to portray the interactions in a favorable light, perhaps to justify his voyage or to encourage further support.\n\nNow, de las Casas's account from 1542 paints a very different picture. He describes the Spaniards as brutal and cruel, comparing them to ravening wolves and savage lions. He accuses them of murdering natives, torturing them, and causing immense suffering, all for the sake of acquiring gold quickly. He provides a stark statistic about the population decline on Hispaniola, from three million to just two hundred, which is an incredibly alarming decrease and suggests massive loss of life.\n\nSo, there's a huge discrepancy between these two accounts. Columbus seems relatively benign, while de las Casas depicts utter devastation and cruelty.\n\nOption A suggests that de las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery. Hmm, that's interesting. De las Casas is actually known for advocating against the enslavement of natives and later for the use of African slaves as a less harmful alternative. But was he exaggerating the natives' plight to push for African slavery? I need to think about that.\n\nOption B says that Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings. That seems plausible. People often present themselves in a better light, especially in official communications or letters meant to garner support. So, maybe Columbus is downplaying any negative aspects of his interactions with the natives.\n\nOption C proposes that Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than later expeditions. Given that de las Casas's account is from 1542, nearly fifty years after Columbus's first voyage in 1492, it's possible that the treatment of natives worsened over time. Maybe Columbus's initial interactions were more peaceful, but subsequent expeditions were more violent and exploitative.\n\nOption D suggests that de las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas. De las Casas was a staunch advocate for the rights of natives and was critical of Spanish colonization, but I don't know if he wanted them to leave entirely. He might have wanted reforms to how the natives were treated, but not necessarily for the Spanish to abandon the Americas altogether.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to pick the option that best accounts for the differences in the two accounts.\n\nOption A seems a bit far-fetched. While de las Casas did advocate for the use of African slaves later on, it's not clear that he was exaggerating the natives' suffering purely to promote African slavery. His primary concern seemed to be the welfare of the natives, and he was appalled by the mistreatment he witnessed.\n\nOption B is plausible. Columbus likely had reasons to portray his interactions positively, to maintain support back home and to present himself favorably.\n\nOption C also makes sense. It's possible that Columbus's initial encounters were less violent, but as more Spaniards arrived and the colonization effort intensified, the treatment of natives deteriorated.\n\nOption D might be partially true, but it doesn't directly explain the differences between the two accounts.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is a combination of options B and C. Columbus was biased in his writings, presenting a more favorable view of his own actions, and his men's behavior may have been relatively better compared to later expeditions, which de las Casas is criticizing for their extreme violence and exploitation.\n\nBut since I have to choose one option, I'll go with C: Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions. This accounts for the difference in tone and content between the two sources, with Columbus describing somewhat positive interactions, while de las Casas depicts extreme cruelty and devastation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
