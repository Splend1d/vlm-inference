                    "text": "So I've got this question here about inelastic demand, and I need to choose the correct statement from these options. Let me read them again to make sure I understand each one.\n\nOption A says: \"the quantity demanded changes a great deal as prices fluctuate.\" Hmm, that sounds like when prices go up or down, people buy a lot more or a lot less of something. I think that might be elastic demand, not inelastic. Elastic demand is when quantity demanded is very responsive to price changes.\n\nOption B: \"the quantity demanded barely changes with a change in price.\" Okay, this seems opposite to option A. If quantity demanded doesn't change much when prices change, that should be inelastic demand. So, this might be the right answer.\n\nOption C: \"the change in quantity demanded is in the same proportion as the change in price.\" This sounds like unit elastic demand, where the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price. So, not necessarily inelastic.\n\nOption D: \"the demand curve and the supply curve intersect at a given price point.\" This is talking about the equilibrium price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. It's not directly about the elasticity of demand.\n\nSo, based on my initial thoughts, option B seems to be the correct definition of inelastic demand. But let me double-check what inelastic demand really means.\n\nInelastic demand refers to a situation where the quantity demanded of a good does not change much when the price changes. In other words, the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price. So, if price goes up by 10% and quantity demanded only goes down by 5%, that's inelastic demand.\n\nElastic demand, on the other hand, is when the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price. So, if price increases by 10% and quantity demanded decreases by 20%, that's elastic.\n\nUnit elastic is when the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price.\n\nSo, going back to the options, option A describes elastic demand, not inelastic. Option B correctly describes inelastic demand, as it says the quantity demanded barely changes with a change in price. Option C describes unit elastic demand, and option D is about equilibrium, not elasticity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any scenario where inelastic demand might fit another option. For example, if price changes a lot, but quantity demanded doesn't change much, that's still inelastic demand. So, option B seems to capture that idea.\n\nI think I'm confident with option B as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n"
