I know dill is often used in pickling, like for making pickles, but I also recall that it's used as a seasoning in various dishes. So, I think dill is a spice.\n\nNext, aniseed. Aniseed has a licorice-like flavor and is used in baking and cooking. It's definitely a spice.\n\nNow, cucumber. Cucumber is a vegetable that's commonly eaten fresh in salads or used in drinks like cucumber water. It doesn't seem like a spice; it's more of an ingredient in its own right.\n\nLastly, cayenne. Cayenne is a type of chili pepper, and it's often used as a spice to add heat to dishes. So, that's definitely a spice.\n\nComparing all of these, cucumber seems to be the odd one out. It's a vegetable, not a spice.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. cucumber.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
