                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about when the gender of a fetus becomes clear based on the development of external genitals. The options are 2, 4, 6, or 8 months after conception.\n\nFirst, I need to recall when during pregnancy the external genitalia develop differently for males and females. I remember that in the early stages of embryonic development, the genitalia are undifferentiated and have the potential to develop into either male or female structures. This is known as the indifferent stage.\n\nThen, around week 7 or 8 of pregnancy, which is about 2 months after conception, the genitalia start to differentiate based on the genetic sex of the fetus. For males, the presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome triggers the development of testes, and for females, in the absence of the SRY gene, the genitalia develop along the female pathway.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if at 2 months after conception, the external genitals are already distinctly male or female. I think it might take a bit longer for the external features to become clearly discernible.\n\nLet me see, pregnancy is typically divided into trimesters, each lasting about 3 months. So, 2 months would be towards the end of the first trimester, 4 months would be at the end of the second trimester, and so on.\n\nI recall that during the first trimester, the major organs and body systems are forming, but perhaps the external genitalia aren't fully differentiated until later.\n\nMaybe I should look up when the external genitalia become distinctively male or female.\n\nHmm, I don't have access to external resources right now, so I need to rely on my memory.\n\nI think that by around 12 weeks, which is about 3 months after conception, the genitalia have started to differentiate, but perhaps they are not yet fully developed.\n\nWait, the question is about when the gender is clear from the appearance of external genitals. So, it's not just about the start of differentiation, but when it's\u660e\u663e enough to determine the sex.\n\nI think ultrasound can sometimes determine the sex of the fetus around 18-20 weeks, which is about 4.5 to 5 months after conception. But I'm not sure if that's when the external genitals are fully developed.\n\nLet me think differently. If conception is considered to be at week 0, then 2 months would be around week 8, 4 months would be around week 16, 6 months would be around week 24, and 8 months would be around week 32.\n\nI know that by week 16, which is 4 months, a lot of the fetal development is evident, and detailed ultrasounds can show the genitalia more clearly.\n\nBut I also recall that the external genitalia undergo a process called virilization in males, where the presence of testosterone causes the development of the penis and scrotum, while in females, in the absence of this hormone, the clitoris, labia minora, and labia majora develop.\n\nI think that by around 20 weeks, the external genitalia are developed enough to be identifiable on ultrasound, but again, that's about 5 months after conception.\n\nWait, the options given are 2, 4, 6, and 8 months after conception. I need to pick one of these.\n\nIf I had to choose, I would say 4 months, which is option B. This seems reasonable because by 4 months, a lot of the fetal structures are developed enough to be visible and identifiable.\n\nMoreover, I remember that during the second trimester, which is from month 4 to month 6, the fetus undergoes significant growth and development, including the maturation of external features.\n\nTherefore, I will go with option B, 4 months after conception, as the time when the gender of the fetus is clear from the appearance of external genitals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
