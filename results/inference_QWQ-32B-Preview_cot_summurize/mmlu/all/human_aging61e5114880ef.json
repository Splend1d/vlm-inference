                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these options represents a discontinuous change over adult years. The options are personality, working memory, female hormone levels, and male sexuality. I need to understand what discontinuous change means in this context.\n\nSo, discontinuous change probably refers to changes that happen suddenly or in distinct stages rather than gradually over time. Continuous change, on the other hand, would be gradual and steady. In psychology and human development, some traits or abilities change continuously as we age, while others might change in abrupt ways or at specific points in life.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Personality: Generally, personality traits are thought to be relatively stable over time, but there is some change that occurs gradually. For example, people tend to become more conscientious and agreeable as they age, but these changes are incremental, not sudden. So, personality seems like it changes continuously rather than discontinuously.\n\nB. Working memory: Working memory capacity tends to decline gradually with age, starting from young adulthood. There aren't typically sudden drops in working memory; it's a slow, continuous decline. So, this also seems like a continuous change.\n\nC. Female hormone levels: In women, hormone levels can change dramatically at menopause. Menopause is a phase where estrogen and progesterone levels drop significantly, leading to various physical and psychological changes. This seems like a discontinuous change because it happens relatively suddenly compared to the gradual changes before and after menopause.\n\nD. Male sexuality: Male sexuality encompasses a broad range of aspects, including sexual desire, function, and behavior. While there are changes in male sexuality over time, such as a gradual decline in testosterone levels, these changes are typically gradual rather than sudden. So, this seems like a continuous change.\n\nComparing these options, female hormone levels during menopause stand out as a discontinuous change because of the sudden drop in hormone levels compared to the gradual changes seen in the other options.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Female hormone levels.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
