                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, Farmer Fred is giving away parts of his farm to his children, and he's using a specific description in his conveyance instrument. The description is: \"one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County, the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property is hereby given to all my children per capita.\" Now, we need to figure out if this description is sufficient or not, and why.\n\nFirst, let's break down the description:\n\n1. \"One-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County\": This seems to be referring to a fractional part of the property's ownership. So, he's giving away 1/30th of his ownership to his children.\n\n2. \"The eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property\": This seems to be describing a specific portion of the property itself, not just the ownership interest.\n\n3. \"Is hereby given to all my children per capita\": This means that the gift is to be divided equally among his children.\n\nNow, the question is about whether this description is sufficient for conveying the property. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Insufficient, because it is too vague.\n\nB. Sufficient, because it satisfies the title of seisin.\n\nC. Sufficient, because the property can be identified.\n\nD. Insufficient, because the gifts to the children lacked consideration.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Insufficient, because it is too vague.\n\nIs the description vague? Well, \"one-thirtieth of my ownership interest\" is clear in terms of the share being given. However, \"the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property\" might be a bit unclear. What exactly is the \"western corner\"? Is it clearly defined somewhere? If not, this part might be vague. But overall, the ownership fraction is specified, and the property is identified as Grapeview Farm.\n\nOption B: Sufficient, because it satisfies the title of seisin.\n\nTitle of seisin refers to the legal right to possess the property. In conveyance instruments, it's important to show that the grantor has the right to convey the property. However, in this case, the description seems to be more about the portion being conveyed rather than establishing the grantor's title. So, I'm not sure if this is the right answer.\n\nOption C: Sufficient, because the property can be identified.\n\nIs the property identifiable? Grapeview Farm is specified, which is good. But the description also mentions \"the eastern one tenth of the western corner,\" which might be problematic if \"western corner\" isn't clearly defined. However, since it's a specific farm, and presumably has legal boundaries, perhaps this is sufficient.\n\nOption D: Insufficient, because the gifts to the children lacked consideration.\n\nConsideration is something of value exchanged in a contract. In gift transactions, consideration isn't required because it's a voluntary transfer without expectation of something in return. So, this seems irrelevant to the question of description sufficiency.\n\nNow, thinking more deeply, in property law, for a conveyance to be effective, the description of the property must be definite enough to identify what is being conveyed. This is often referred to as the certainty required in descriptions.\n\nIn this case, \"one-thirtieth of my ownership interest\" is clear in terms of the share, but \"the eastern one tenth of the western corner\" might be unclear unless \"western corner\" is a defined term in a legal document or map related to the property.\n\nHowever, since Grapeview Farm is a known property, and presumably has surveyed boundaries, it might be possible to identify what constitutes the \"western corner\" and then determine the \"eastern one tenth\" of that area.\n\nMoreover, in conveyancing, it's common to refer to legal descriptions that are precise, but sometimes metes and bounds or lot numbers are used for clarity.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the description is sufficient because it can be identified with reference to the property's legal boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, if \"western corner\" isn't a defined term, it might be too vague.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that Grapeview Farm is a large farm with defined boundaries, so perhaps the description is sufficient.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Insufficient, because it is too vague.\n\nB. Sufficient, because it satisfies the title of seisin.\n\nC. Sufficient, because the property can be identified.\n\nD. Insufficient, because the gifts to the children lacked consideration.\n\nI think option C is the best answer. The property can be identified as Grapeview Farm, and the portions being conveyed, although potentially somewhat vague, are specified in a way that can be determined with reference to the property's boundaries.\n\nOption A might be tempting, but if the property is known and has legal descriptions, then the portions can likely be identified.\n\nOption B seems less relevant to the description's sufficiency.\n\nOption D is incorrect because gifts don't require consideration.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option C: Sufficient, because the property can be identified.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
