So, I need to understand what each of these terms means and then compare them based on the options given.\n\nFirst, issues management: This is about identifying, monitoring, and influencing public policies, social trends, and other issues that could affect an organization. It's proactive; you're trying to stay ahead of potential problems by understanding what's happening in the environment and how it might impact your organization.\n\nCrisis management, on the other hand, is about dealing with sudden, unexpected events that can harm an organization's reputation or operations. It's reactive; you're responding to something that has already happened.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. They both require research monitoring.\n\nFor issues management, monitoring is key. You need to keep an eye on trends, public opinion, and policy changes that could affect your organization.\n\nFor crisis management, monitoring is also important, but it's more about detecting early signs of a potential crisis so you can act quickly. So, yes, both require research monitoring.\n\nB. They both deal with acute risks.\n\nIssues management deals with ongoing, long-term issues, not necessarily acute risks. Acute risks are more sudden and immediate, which aligns more with crisis management.\n\nSo, this statement might not be true for both.\n\nC. New organizational practices are developed as a result of each.\n\nIn issues management, you might develop new practices to address emerging trends or to influence policy. In crisis management, you certainly develop new practices or improve existing ones based on what you've learned from a crisis.\n\nSo, this seems true for both.\n\nD. Both have the potential to damage an organization's reputation.\n\nAbsolutely. Issues, if not managed properly, can lead to reputational damage over time. Crises can cause immediate and severe reputational harm.\n\nSo, which one is NOT true of both? Option B seems to be the one. Issues management deals with longer-term issues, not necessarily acute risks, whereas crisis management is all about acute risks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. They both deal with acute risks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
