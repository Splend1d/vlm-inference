                    "text": "So Sapphire has 179 balloons and she needs to make bouquets with 7 balloons in each. She wants to know how many bouquets she can make. The options are 32, 23, 25, or 26 bouquets.\n\nFirst, I think I need to divide the total number of balloons by the number of balloons per bouquet. So, that's 179 divided by 7.\n\nLet me do that division. 7 times 20 is 140, right? Because 7 times 20 is 140. Then, 179 minus 140 is 39. Now, 7 times 5 is 35, so 39 minus 35 is 4. So, 7 goes into 179 twenty-five times with a remainder of 4.\n\nWait, but that would mean she can make 25 full bouquets and have 4 balloons left over. But let's check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nMaybe I should try multiplying 7 by each of the options and see which one equals or is closest to 179 without exceeding it.\n\nLet's try 23 first. 7 times 23 is 161. Because 7 times 20 is 140, and 7 times 3 is 21, so 140 plus 21 is 161.\n\nNow, 179 minus 161 is 18, which means there would be 18 balloons left over, but 18 is more than enough to make another bouquet since each bouquet needs 7 balloons.\n\nWait, but 161 plus 7 is 168, which is still less than 179. So, 7 times 24 would be 168. 179 minus 168 is 11, which is still more than 7, so she can make another bouquet.\n\nWait, maybe I need to keep going.\n\n7 times 25 is 175. Because 7 times 20 is 140, and 7 times 5 is 35, so 140 plus 35 is 175.\n\n179 minus 175 is 4, which is not enough for another bouquet since each needs 7.\n\nSo, she can make 25 bouquets with 175 balloons, and have 4 balloons left over.\n\nBut let's check if 26 bouquets would work. 7 times 26 is 182, which is more than 179. So, she doesn't have enough balloons for 26 bouquets.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 25 bouquets.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many groups of 7 are there in 179.\n\nUsing division: 179 divided by 7.\n\n7 times 20 is 140.\n\n179 minus 140 is 39.\n\n7 times 5 is 35.\n\n39 minus 35 is 4.\n\nSo, 20 plus 5 is 25, with a remainder of 4.\n\nYes, that confirms it. She can make 25 bouquets with 4 balloons left over.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 25 bouquets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
