Losing 5-7% of body weight through a hypocaloric low-fat diet and 30 minutes of daily activity.\n\nThis option is based on the findings from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a large-scale clinical trial that aimed to find ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in people at high risk. The DPP showed that lifestyle changes, specifically modest weight loss through diet and exercise, can significantly reduce the risk of developing diabetes.\n\nLet's break down why this is the most appropriate answer and why the others might not be as effective or are less supported by evidence.\n\n**Option A: Eating a very low carbohydrate diet**\n\nWhile low-carbohydrate diets can lead to short-term weight loss and improvements in blood glucose control, their long-term effectiveness and safety for diabetes prevention are not as well-established as lifestyle modifications involving moderate calorie restriction and increased physical activity. Moreover, very low carbohydrate diets can be difficult to sustain over the long term and may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with certain health conditions.\n\n**Option B: Consuming a diet high in monounsaturated fats**\n\nMonounsaturated fats are considered heart-healthy and can have beneficial effects on lipid profiles. However, the DPP did not specifically focus on the type of fat consumed but rather on total calorie intake and weight loss. While incorporating more monounsaturated fats might be part of a healthy diet, it is not the primary factor in preventing diabetes according to the trial's findings.\n\n**Option C: Losing 5-7% of body weight through a hypocaloric low-fat diet and 30 minutes of daily activity**\n\nThis is the correct answer based on the DPP. The study found that participants who lost 5-7% of their body weight and maintained moderate physical activity (like brisk walking for 30 minutes a day) reduced their risk of developing diabetes by 58%. This approach is sustainable and has been shown to have significant health benefits beyond just diabetes prevention, including improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and overall quality of life.\n\n**Option D: Initiating metformin 850 mg BID and practicing daily vigorous exercise**\n\nThe DPP also included a group that took metformin, a medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. This group saw a 31% reduction in diabetes incidence, which was less effective than the lifestyle intervention group. Additionally, the recommendation for daily vigorous exercise might not be as accessible or sustainable for all high-risk individuals compared to moderate daily activity.\n\nIn summary, while various approaches can help in diabetes prevention, the DPP clearly demonstrated that modest weight loss through a hypocaloric diet and regular physical activity is the most effective strategy for high-risk individuals to reduce their risk of developing diabetes.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nDiabetes Prevention Program Research Group.
