                    "text": "I'm going to need to think about this one. So, the question is about what Pence thinks is an appropriate standard for the safety of SCNT before it should be allowed. SCNT is somatic cell nuclear transfer, which is a technique used in cloning. I remember that Pence is known for his views on bioethics, particularly concerning issues like cloning and embryo research.\n\nOption A says there should be no standards for safety. That seems unlikely for Pence, given his conservative views and concern for ethical standards in science. He's probably in favor of some level of regulation or safety measures.\n\nOption B says SCNT should not be allowed unless a healthy baby could be guaranteed. That sounds very cautious. Guaranteeing a healthy baby seems impractical because there are always risks involved in any reproductive technology. It might be too stringent a standard.\n\nOption C suggests that SCNT should be allowed when it falls within the range of risks that is accepted by ordinary people in sexual reproduction. This seems more plausible. In sexual reproduction, there are inherent risks, and people accept those risks. So, if SCNT risks are comparable to those, maybe it could be considered acceptable.\n\nOption D is none of the above, which I'll consider if none of the other options seem to fit.\n\nI need to recall Pence's stance on this. I know that Mike Pence, during his time as Governor of Indiana and later as Vice President, has been vocal about bioethical issues. He's generally pro-life and opposes embryonic stem cell research and cloning.\n\nIn 2005, there was a national debate on cloning in the United States, and Pence took a stance on therapeutic cloning, which involves SCNT. He supported a ban on all forms of human cloning, including therapeutic cloning, arguing that it devalues human life.\n\nHowever, in more recent years, his position might have evolved, or there might be nuances I'm missing. I should look for specific statements or policies he's advocated for regarding SCNT and safety standards.\n\nI recall that in 2016, during the vice presidential debate, Pence discussed bioethics and mentioned that he supported legislation that would prohibit human cloning and the creation of embryos solely for research purposes. He emphasized the importance of protecting human dignity and the value of human life from the moment of conception.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Pence is strongly against any form of human cloning, including SCNT for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, option B, which says SCNT should not be allowed unless a healthy baby could be guaranteed, might align with his cautious approach. However, guaranteeing a healthy baby is practically impossible, so this standard would effectively ban SCNT.\n\nBut option C also seems plausible because it refers to accepting risks comparable to those in sexual reproduction. Maybe Pence would argue that as long as the risks are similar to those naturally occurring in reproduction, it could be acceptable. But given his conservative views, I suspect he might still oppose SCNT due to ethical concerns beyond just safety.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Pence believes that there should be no standards for safety because SCNT should simply not be allowed under any circumstances due to its ethical implications. That would correspond to option A.\n\nWait, but option A says \"there should be no standards for safety,\" which could be interpreted as allowing SCNT without any safety precautions, but that doesn't seem consistent with Pence's views. He's more likely to advocate for no SCNT at all.\n\nOption D, \"none of the above,\" might be the correct answer if Pence's position doesn't fit any of the other options.\n\nI need to think differently. Maybe Pence doesn't have a specific stance on safety standards for SCNT, but given his opposition to cloning, perhaps the question is hypothetical or based on a specific statement I need to recall.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referencing a specific speech or article where Pence outlined his thoughts on this matter. Without that context, it's challenging to determine the exact answer.\n\nConsidering Pence's general stance on bioethics and cloning, I think he would oppose SCNT regardless of safety standards due to ethical concerns related to the sanctity of human life. Therefore, option A, \"there should be no standards for safety,\" doesn't make sense because he would likely want to ban SCNT entirely.\n\nOption B, \"SCNT should not be allowed unless a healthy baby could be guaranteed,\" seems consistent with a very cautious approach, effectively banning SCNT since guarantees cannot be made.\n\nOption C suggests accepting risks comparable to sexual reproduction, which might be more permissive, but given Pence's views, he might still oppose SCNT on ethical grounds unrelated to safety.\n\nPerhaps, then, the answer is D, \"none of the above,\" because Pence's opposition to SCNT is based on ethical principles beyond just safety concerns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Pence supports strict safety standards that are practically impossible to meet, thus effectively banning SCNT. In that case, option B might be the closest fit.\n\nI need to make a decision. Given Pence's strong opposition to cloning, I think he would support a standard that is so high\u2014like guaranteeing a healthy baby\u2014that it's impossible to meet, thereby preventing SCNT from being allowed. So, option B seems the most appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
