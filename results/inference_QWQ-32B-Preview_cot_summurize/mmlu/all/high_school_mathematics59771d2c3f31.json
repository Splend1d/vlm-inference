                    "text": "So Juan has an octahedral die with numbers 1 through 8, and Amal has a regular six-sided die with numbers 1 through 6. We need to find the probability that the product of their rolls is a multiple of 3.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the product to be a multiple of 3. A product is a multiple of 3 if at least one of the numbers rolled is a multiple of 3. That makes sense because if either Juan or Amal rolls a number that's a multiple of 3, their product will be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Juan rolls a multiple of 3 or Amal rolls a multiple of 3, or both.\n\nI recall that the probability of either event A or event B happening is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). So, in this case, it would be P(Juan rolls multiple of 3) + P(Amal rolls multiple of 3) - P(both roll multiples of 3).\n\nLet me find each of these probabilities separately.\n\nFirst, P(Juan rolls multiple of 3). Juan's die has numbers 1 through 8. The multiples of 3 in that range are 3, 6, and maybe 9, but since it's an octahedral die marked 1 through 8, only 3 and 6 are multiples of 3. So, there are 2 multiples of 3 out of 8 possible outcomes. Therefore, P(Juan rolls multiple of 3) = 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nNext, P(Amal rolls multiple of 3). Amal's die has numbers 1 through 6. The multiples of 3 are 3 and 6. So, there are 2 multiples of 3 out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, P(Amal rolls multiple of 3) = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nNow, P(both roll multiples of 3). Since the rolls are independent events, I can multiply their individual probabilities. So, P(both) = P(Juan) * P(Amal) = (1/4) * (1/3) = 1/12.\n\nNow, plugging back into the formula:\n\nP(either or both) = P(Juan) + P(Amal) - P(both) = 1/4 + 1/3 - 1/12.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 3, and 12 is 12.\n\nSo, 1/4 = 3/12, 1/3 = 4/12, and 1/12 remains 1/12.\n\nTherefore, P(either or both) = 3/12 + 4/12 - 1/12 = (3 + 4 - 1)/12 = 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nJuan's die has 8 faces, Amal's has 6 faces, so total possible outcomes are 8 * 6 = 48.\n\nNow, favorable outcomes are those where the product is a multiple of 3, which happens if at least one of the numbers is a multiple of 3.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is neither rolls a multiple of 3, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, P(neither rolls a multiple of 3).\n\nP(Juan does not roll a multiple of 3) = 1 - P(Juan rolls multiple of 3) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nP(Amal does not roll a multiple of 3) = 1 - P(Amal rolls multiple of 3) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\n\nSince the rolls are independent, P(neither) = (3/4) * (2/3) = 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, P(at least one rolls a multiple of 3) = 1 - P(neither) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, the probability is indeed 1/2.\n\nLet me just make sure there aren't any tricky aspects I'm missing. The question is about the product being a multiple of 3, and I've considered that it happens if at least one die shows a multiple of 3.\n\nIs there any scenario where the product is a multiple of 3 even if neither die shows a multiple of 3? I don't think so, because if neither die is a multiple of 3, their product won't be a multiple of 3 either.\n\nFor example, if Juan rolls a 2 and Amal rolls a 4, product is 8, which is not a multiple of 3.\n\nSimilarly, if Juan rolls a 5 and Amal rolls a 1, product is 5, not a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, yes, the only way to get a product that's a multiple of 3 is if at least one die shows a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 1/2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1/2\n\nB. 1/4\n\nC. 1/144\n\nD. 1/288\n\nOption A is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
