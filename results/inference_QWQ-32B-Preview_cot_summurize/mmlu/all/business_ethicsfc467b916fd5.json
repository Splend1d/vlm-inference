It's about organizations implementing environmental goals, policies, and responsibilities, and making sure they have regular auditing and reporting that goes beyond just following the law. The question is asking which options correctly identify the processes used for this purpose.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Environmental management systems, SA8000, EMAS\n\nB. Social accountability standards, ISO14001, SA8000\n\nC. Environmental management systems, ISO14001, EMAS\n\nD. Social accountability standards, EMAS, SA8000\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with \"Environmental management systems.\" I know that an environmental management system, or EMS, is a set of processes and practices that an organization uses to identify, manage, monitor, and control its environmental impacts. The goal is to reduce negative impacts and improve environmental performance.\n\nSA8000 is something I've heard of, but I'm not entirely sure what it is. I think it's a standard related to social accountability. It stands for Social Accountability 8000, and it's a standard that specifies principles and practices in areas such as child labor, forced labor, health and safety, working hours, compensation, freedom of association, and management systems.\n\nISO14001 is an international standard for environmental management systems. It's developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and provides a framework for organizations to develop and implement their own EMS.\n\nEMAS stands for Eco-Management and Audit Scheme. It's a management tool for companies and other organizations that sets requirements for an environmental management system and environmental auditing.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it's about implementing environmental goals, policies, and responsibilities, with regular auditing and reporting beyond legal compliance.\n\nOption A mentions environmental management systems, SA8000, and EMAS. Environmental management systems and EMAS are directly related to environmental management, but SA8000 is about social accountability, which is more related to social responsibilities rather than environmental ones.\n\nOption B has social accountability standards, ISO14001, and SA8000. Social accountability standards and SA8000 are both related to social responsibilities, while ISO14001 is about environmental management. So, this option mixes environmental and social aspects.\n\nOption C lists environmental management systems, ISO14001, and EMAS. All of these are directly related to environmental management and auditing.\n\nOption D has social accountability standards, EMAS, and SA8000. Again, this mixes social and environmental aspects.\n\nGiven that the question is specifically about environmental goals, policies, and responsibilities, the most appropriate answer would be the one that focuses solely on environmental management systems and standards.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct choice: Environmental management systems, ISO14001, and EMAS.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption A includes SA8000, which is more about social accountability, not environmental management.\n\nOption B includes social accountability standards and SA8000, which are social, and ISO14001, which is environmental. But since the question is about environmental goals, having social standards in the list seems irrelevant.\n\nOption D includes social accountability standards and SA8000 again, along with EMAS. While EMAS is environmental, including social standards in the list doesn't make sense for a question focused on environmental management.\n\nSo, yes, option C is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
