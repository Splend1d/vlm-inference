                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about chi-square (\u03c7\u00b2) procedures. I need to determine which of the statements are true. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nStatement I says: \"In order to use a \u03c7\u00b2 procedure, the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5.\"\n\nI remember that in chi-square tests, especially the chi-square test of independence for contingency tables, there's a assumption about the expected cell counts. The rule of thumb is that no more than 20% of the cells should have expected counts less than 5, and all cells should have expected counts of at least 1. So, statement I is not entirely accurate because it's okay to have some cells with expected counts less than 5, as long as it's not too many.\n\nWait, but I think there are different guidelines. Some sources suggest that for the chi-square approximation to be valid, expected counts should be at least 5 in each cell. But I recall that with simulations and studies, it's been found that as long as no more than 20% of the cells have expected counts less than 5, and no cell has an expected count less than 1, the chi-square test is still acceptable.\n\nSo, statement I is too absolute. It's not necessary for every cell to have an expected value of at least 5, although it's a common rule of thumb. Therefore, statement I is false.\n\nMoving on to statement II: \"In order to use \u03c7\u00b2 procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom.\"\n\nI need to think about the degrees of freedom in chi-square tests. Degrees of freedom depend on the type of chi-square test being performed.\n\nFor a chi-square goodness-of-fit test, the degrees of freedom are k - 1, where k is the number of categories.\n\nFor a chi-square test of independence in a two-way table, the degrees of freedom are (r - 1)(c - 1), where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns.\n\nSo, it's possible to have tests with degrees of freedom less than 2. For example, in a goodness-of-fit test with three categories, df = 3 - 1 = 2, which is fine. With two categories, df = 1, which is still acceptable.\n\nI recall that even with df = 1, the chi-square test is valid. In fact, df can be as low as 1.\n\nTherefore, statement II is false because you can use chi-square procedures with degrees of freedom as low as 1.\n\nNow, statement III: \"In a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table, the number of degrees of freedom is 3.\"\n\nLet's calculate the degrees of freedom for a 4 \u00d7 2 table. Using the formula (r - 1)(c - 1), where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns.\n\nHere, r = 4 and c = 2.\n\nSo, df = (4 - 1)(2 - 1) = (3)(1) = 3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, statement III is true.\n\nSummarizing:\n\n- Statement I is false.\n\n- Statement II is false.\n\n- Statement III is true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. I and III only\n\nC. I and II only\n\nD. III only\n\nThe correct choice should be D. III only, since only statement III is true.\n\nWait a minute, option B is \"I and III only,\" but I determined that I is false and III is true. So, technically, only III is true.\n\nBut option D is \"III only,\" which matches my conclusion.\n\nHowever, the question is multiple choice, and I need to select the correct option.\n\nGiven that only statement III is true, the answer should be D. III only.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nStatement I is false because it's not required that every cell has an expected value of at least 5.\n\nStatement II is false because you can have df as low as 1 in chi-square procedures.\n\nStatement III is true because for a 4 \u00d7 2 table, df = 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
