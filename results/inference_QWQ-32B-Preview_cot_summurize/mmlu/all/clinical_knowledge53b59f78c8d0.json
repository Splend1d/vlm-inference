                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the most likely cause of acute urinary retention is among these options: haematuria, bladder outflow obstruction, drinking alcohol, and kidney stones. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what acute urinary retention is. It's when someone suddenly can't pass urine, and their bladder becomes full and painful. It's a serious condition that needs immediate attention.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Haematuria is blood in the urine. While it can be a symptom of various urinary tract issues, I'm not sure if it directly causes urinary retention.\n\nB. Bladder outflow obstruction sounds like something that would block the urine from leaving the bladder, which seems directly related to urinary retention.\n\nC. Drinking alcohol \u2013 while alcohol can affect urine production and maybe make you have to urinate more, I don't know if it directly causes acute retention.\n\nD. Kidney stones can block the urinary tract, potentially leading to retention, but I need to compare it with the other options.\n\nLet me consider each one in more detail.\n\nStarting with haematuria: having blood in the urine might be a sign of an underlying problem like infection, kidney disease, or prostate issues, but it's not necessarily causing the blockage that leads to retention.\n\nBladder outflow obstruction, on the other hand, specifically implies that there's something blocking the urine from flowing out of the bladder. This seems like a direct cause of urinary retention because if the urine can't flow out, the bladder will fill up and lead to retention.\n\nDrinking alcohol \u2013 while alcohol is a diuretic and can increase urine production, I don't think it causes acute retention. In fact, people might urinate more after drinking alcohol. Maybe in some cases of extreme intoxication, there could be some impact on bladder function, but it doesn't seem like the most likely cause.\n\nKidney stones can cause urinary retention if they block the ureter or the bladder neck, preventing urine from flowing out. So, this is another possible cause, but I need to compare it with bladder outflow obstruction.\n\nComparing bladder outflow obstruction and kidney stones: both can cause blockages in the urinary tract, but bladder outflow obstruction seems more directly related to the bladder's ability to empty. Kidney stones can cause obstruction elsewhere in the urinary tract, but not necessarily at the bladder outlet.\n\nAlso, bladder outflow obstruction is a common cause of urinary retention, especially in men with enlarged prostates.\n\nHaematuria, as I thought earlier, is more of a symptom than a direct cause of retention.\n\nDrinking alcohol doesn't seem to be a direct cause of acute urinary retention, although it can affect urine production and maybe bladder function in other ways.\n\nSo, between bladder outflow obstruction and kidney stones, I think bladder outflow obstruction is more directly related to the inability to empty the bladder, which is what urinary retention is.\n\nTherefore, I think the most likely cause is bladder outflow obstruction.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if there are any other causes I should consider. Neurological conditions can also cause urinary retention by affecting the nerves that control bladder function, but that's not listed here.\n\nSo, among the given options, bladder outflow obstruction seems to be the most likely cause of acute urinary retention.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
