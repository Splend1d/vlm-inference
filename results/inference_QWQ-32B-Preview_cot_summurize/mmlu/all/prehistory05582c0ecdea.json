The options are A. hang-t'u, B. sarsen divination, C. scapulimancy, and D. cylinder seal prophecy. I think I've heard of scapulimancy before, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what scapulimancy is. I believe it involves heating up bones and interpreting the cracks that form on them to foretell the future. That sounds pretty similar to what the question is describing. So, option C might be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nOption A is hang-t'u. I'm not familiar with this term in the context of divination. It doesn't ring any bells, so perhaps it's not the right answer.\n\nOption B is sarsen divination. I think sarsen stones are those large stones found in places like Stonehenge in England. If that's the case, then this seems more related to British history and less to Chinese divination practices. So, probably not the correct answer.\n\nOption D is cylinder seal prophecy. I know that cylinder seals were used in ancient Mesopotamia for impressing designs onto clay. They were used for signing documents and other administrative purposes. I don't recall them being directly associated with divination, especially not in Chinese culture. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that, it seems like scapulimancy is the most plausible answer. To be thorough, I should confirm what scapulimancy exactly is. Scapulimancy, also known as shoulder\u80db\u9aa8\u5360\u535c, is indeed the practice of divining the future by observing the cracks that appear on the scapulae (shoulder blades) of animals after they have been heated. This practice was common in ancient China, particularly during the Shang Dynasty.\n\nSo, it aligns perfectly with the description in the question. Therefore, I can confidently say that the correct answer is C. scapulimancy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
