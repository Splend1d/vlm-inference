                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about Pogge's view on how affluent citizens harm the poor. The options are:\n\nA. imposing on them the lasting effects of historical crimes.\n\nB. keeping them below welfare in the state-of-nature.\n\nC. both A and B\n\nD. None of the above\n\nI need to recall what Pogge's view is here. I remember that Pogge is a philosopher who talks about global justice and how wealthy nations and individuals have responsibilities towards poorer ones. He criticizes the way the current global order perpetuates poverty and inequality.\n\nOption A mentions \"imposing on them the lasting effects of historical crimes.\" I think this refers to how past actions, like colonialism and exploitation, have had long-term negative impacts on poor countries. Pogge likely argues that affluent citizens benefit from these historical injustices, and thus are indirectly harming the poor by maintaining a system that doesn't redress these injustices.\n\nOption B says \"keeping them below welfare in the state-of-nature.\" This seems a bit vague. \"State-of-nature\" is a term from social contract theory, referring to a hypothetical condition before the establishment of society and government. I'm not sure how this directly applies to Pogge's view. Maybe it's about how affluent citizens contribute to a global order where poor people remain in a state similar to the state-of-nature, without basic protections and welfare.\n\nOption C is a combination of both, and Option D is none of the above.\n\nI need to think about Pogge's arguments more carefully. In his work, Pogge often discusses how the current global institutional order is designed by and for wealthy nations, which maintains inequalities and prevents poor countries from improving their situation. He talks about how affluent nations set up trade rules, intellectual property laws, and other international regulations that benefit themselves at the expense of poorer nations.\n\nSo, in terms of historical crimes, yes, Pogge does argue that the legacies of colonialism and other forms of exploitation continue to affect poor countries negatively. Affluent citizens benefit from these histories, and by maintaining the status quo, they are, in a sense, imposing the lasting effects of these crimes on the poor.\n\nRegarding the \"state-of-nature,\" I'm not sure if Pogge uses this exact term, but he does discuss how poor people in the global South live in conditions that resemble a state of nature, without basic human rights and welfare protections. So, in that sense, affluent citizens are contributing to keeping them in such conditions by supporting a global order that doesn't adequately address their needs.\n\nGiven this, it seems that both A and B are aspects of Pogge's view. Therefore, option C might be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I should double-check because I might be misremembering some details. Let me try to recall specific points from Pogge's arguments.\n\nFirst, Pogge emphasizes the role of global institutions and how they are structured to favor wealthy nations. This includes unfair trade practices, debt burdens, and restrictions on development policies in poor countries. So, in this sense, affluent citizens are harming the poor by supporting and benefiting from these institutions.\n\nSecond, Pogge discusses the concept of \"global apartheid,\" where wealthy nations essentially wall themselves off from the problems of the poor, not just physically but also through economic and political mechanisms. This perpetuates poverty and inequality.\n\nMoreover, Pogge introduces the idea of \"institutional violence,\" where the very structures of global politics and economics cause harm to the poor, even if individual affluent citizens do not intend to harm anyone. So, by participating in and supporting these institutions, affluent citizens are contributing to the harm.\n\nIn terms of historical crimes, Pogge likely sees the current inequalities as partly rooted in past injustices, such as colonial exploitation, slavery, and the extraction of resources from poor countries. The benefits accrued from these actions have been passed down to affluent citizens, while the harms continue to affect poor populations.\n\nTherefore, option A seems accurate.\n\nRegarding option B, the \"state-of-nature\" reference might be a bit off. Pogge probably doesn't use this exact phrase, but he does discuss how poor people lack basic protections and live in precarious conditions, similar to what one might imagine in a state of nature, where life is \"nasty, brutish, and short,\" as Hobbes described.\n\nSo, in that sense, affluent citizens are contributing to keeping poor people in such undesirable conditions by supporting a global order that doesn't provide adequate assistance or fair opportunities.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that both A and B are part of Pogge's view, making option C the correct answer.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider whether there might be more to Pogge's view that isn't captured by these options or if perhaps he only focuses on one aspect.\n\nUpon reflection, Pogge's work extensively covers both the historical dimensions of global inequality and the current institutional arrangements that maintain it. He argues that affluent citizens have a moral responsibility to reform these institutions to make them more just and equitable.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to conclude that both A and B are accurate descriptions of Pogge's view on how affluent citizens harm the poor.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. both A and B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
