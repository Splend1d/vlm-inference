                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Buddhism. It's asking about ordained women and what they're called. The options are Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, The Sangha, and Arhats. I think I've heard about Bhikshus before, but I'm not sure about the others.\n\nLet me start by recalling what I know about Buddhism. Buddhism is a religion founded by Siddhartha Gautama, who is known as the Buddha. It has various sects or schools, like Theravada and Mahayana, but I think the term for ordained women is common across these traditions.\n\nI remember that in Buddhism, there are monastic orders for both men and women. The community of monks is called the Sangha, right? So, maybe \"The Sangha\" is the answer, but I think that refers to the entire monastic community, including both monks and nuns.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Bhikshus - I think this is the term for monks. Bhikshu means \"beggar\" in Sanskrit, and it refers to a fully ordained monk.\n\nB. Bhikshunis - This sounds similar to Bhikshu, but with an \"ni\" at the end, which might indicate it's for women. I think this is the term for fully ordained nuns.\n\nC. The Sangha - As I recall, this is the broader term for the monastic community, encompassing both monks and nuns.\n\nD. Arhats - I think Arhats are enlightened beings in Buddhism, those who have achieved a high level of spiritual realization, but not necessarily monastics.\n\nSo, if I have to choose, I would go with B. Bhikshunis, because that seems to be the specific term for ordained women in Buddhism.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I should look up the terms to make sure I'm correct.\n\nFirst, Bhikshu: yes, it's a Buddhist monk who has taken vows and lives a monastic life.\n\nBhikshuni: that should be the female equivalent, a fully ordained nun.\n\nThe Sangha: indeed, it's the monastic community as a whole.\n\nArhats: these are highly realized beings, but not exclusively monastics.\n\nSo, it makes sense that ordained women would be called Bhikshunis.\n\nWait a minute, I've heard that in some Buddhist traditions, there might be different terms or levels of ordination for women. For example, in some schools, there might not be full ordination for women.\n\nBut according to the question, it's about ordained women in Buddhism in general, not specific traditions.\n\nMoreover, the question is phrased as \"what are ordained women known as?\" So, it's asking for the term used for them.\n\nGiven that, Bhikshuni seems to be the correct term.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other terms that might be applicable.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, for instance, there are Siladhara, which are female disciples who observe eight precepts, but they are not fully ordained nuns.\n\nIn East Asian Buddhism, the term Bhikshuni is used for fully ordained nuns.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, the term is getso or angetso for nuns, but again, Bhikshuni might be used in some contexts.\n\nHowever, given that Bhikshuni is the Sanskrit term for fully ordained Buddhist nuns, and the question is likely referring to this level of ordination, I think B. Bhikshunis is the correct answer.\n\nTo summarize, my reasoning is:\n\n- Bhikshu is for monks.\n\n- Bhikshuni is for nuns.\n\n- The Sangha is the entire monastic community.\n\n- Arhats are enlightened beings, not necessarily monastics.\n\nTherefore, ordained women in Buddhism are known as Bhikshunis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
