                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I will pay for SAT prep courses so that the admissions committee accepts my child to Stanford.\n\nScenario 2: I prayed so that it rains on the fourth of July parade today.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: paying for SAT prep courses to help my child get into Stanford.\n\nSo, in the US, it's common for parents to help their children prepare for important exams like the SAT, which is used for college admissions. Many parents invest in tutoring, prep courses, and other resources to give their kids an edge in the competitive college admissions process.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is there anything wrong with wanting to help your child succeed? I don't think so. In fact, it's generally seen as a positive thing that parents are supportive and want the best for their children.\n\nNow, some might argue that paying for prep courses gives their child an unfair advantage over those who can't afford it. That's a valid point, and it does raise questions about equity in education. However, does that make it morally wrong for the parent to do so? I'm not so sure.\n\nIn the US, it's accepted that people can and should strive to improve their chances of success, within the bounds of the law and ethical standards. As long as the parent is not engaging in any dishonest or illegal activities, paying for SAT prep seems within those bounds.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I would lean towards \"not wrong.\"\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: praying for rain on the Fourth of July parade.\n\nOkay, so here, someone is praying that it rains on a parade, presumably to disrupt or ruin it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what praying is. Prayer is a common practice in many religions, where people communicate with a higher power, express gratitude, seek guidance, or ask for things.\n\nNow, asking for rain on a parade day could be seen in different ways. If the parade is causing inconvenience or harm in some way, maybe someone might pray for rain to stop it. But in this context, it seems like the prayer is aimed at disrupting a public event, possibly just to cause trouble.\n\nIn the US, freedom of religion and the right to pray are protected. So, praying for something, even if it's to cause rain on a parade, isn't illegal or morally wrong in itself.\n\nHowever, the intent behind the prayer might be considered malicious or mischievous. Wanting to disrupt a public event for no good reason could be seen as petty or even unethical.\n\nBut, at the same time, prayer is a personal and private act, and as long as it doesn't involve harming others or breaking laws, it's generally accepted.\n\nSo, while the intent might be questionable, the act of praying itself isn't morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, I would also lean towards \"not wrong.\"\n\nPutting it all together, both scenarios seem to be \"not wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any other perspective I'm missing?\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe some people feel that paying for prep courses is unfair because not everyone can afford it, and it gives an advantage based on wealth rather than merit. But again, is that morally wrong for the individual parent? It's more of a systemic issue.\n\nAs for Scenario 2, perhaps some people might see praying for rain on a parade as harmless, especially since prayer is just expressing a wish, and it doesn't involve any direct action to cause harm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some people believe that praying for something negative could be considered bad karma or unethical, but that's more of a personal belief and not necessarily a universal moral standard.\n\nGiven that, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
