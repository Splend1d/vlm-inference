                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a real vector space \\( V \\) of finite dimension \\( n \\), and \\( M(V) \\) is the set of matrices from \\( V \\) into itself. So, \\( M(V) \\) is essentially the set of all \\( n \\times n \\) real matrices, since \\( V \\) is \\( n \\)-dimensional.\n\nWe're given a linear operator \\( T \\in M(V) \\), and we need to consider two subspaces of \\( M(V) \\):\n\n1. \\( U = \\{ X \\in M(V) : TX = XT \\} \\), which is the set of matrices that commute with \\( T \\).\n\n2. \\( W = \\{ TX - XT : X \\in M(V) \\} \\), which is the set of commutators of \\( T \\) with matrices in \\( M(V) \\).\n\nWe need to determine which of the following statements must be true:\n\nI. If \\( V \\) has a basis containing only eigenvectors of \\( T \\), then \\( U = M(V) \\).\n\nII. \\( \\dim(U) + \\dim(W) = n^2 \\).\n\nIII. \\( \\dim(U) < n \\).\n\nLet's analyze each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement I: If \\( V \\) has a basis containing only eigenvectors of \\( T \\), then \\( U = M(V) \\).**\n\nIf \\( V \\) has a basis consisting entirely of eigenvectors of \\( T \\), then \\( T \\) is diagonalizable. In this case, \\( T \\) can be represented by a diagonal matrix in that basis. Let's denote this basis as \\( \\mathcal{B} = \\{ v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n \\} \\), where each \\( v_i \\) is an eigenvector of \\( T \\) with eigenvalue \\( \\lambda_i \\).\n\nIn this basis, \\( T \\) is diagonal with entries \\( \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_n \\). Now, any matrix \\( X \\) in \\( M(V) \\) can be represented by an \\( n \\times n \\) matrix in this basis. The condition \\( TX = XT \\) means that \\( X \\) commutes with \\( T \\).\n\nFor \\( T \\) diagonal, the matrices that commute with \\( T \\) are precisely those that are diagonal in the same basis. This is because if \\( T = \\text{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_n) \\), then \\( TX = XT \\) implies that \\( X \\) must be diagonal if all \\( \\lambda_i \\) are distinct.\n\nHowever, if some eigenvalues are repeated, then \\( X \\) can have non-zero entries in positions corresponding to eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue.\n\nBut in general, unless all eigenvalues are distinct, \\( U \\) is not equal to \\( M(V) \\). In fact, only diagonal matrices (in the eigenbasis) commute with \\( T \\), which is a proper subset of \\( M(V) \\), unless \\( T \\) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.\n\nTherefore, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement II: \\( \\dim(U) + \\dim(W) = n^2 \\).**\n\nThis statement suggests that the dimensions of \\( U \\) and \\( W \\) add up to \\( n^2 \\), which is the dimension of \\( M(V) \\).\n\nTo analyze this, consider the linear map \\( \\phi: M(V) \\to M(V) \\) defined by \\( \\phi(X) = TX - XT \\). Then, \\( W = \\text{im}(\\phi) \\), and \\( U = \\ker(\\phi) \\).\n\nBy the rank-nullity theorem, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\dim(\\ker(\\phi)) + \\dim(\\text{im}(\\phi)) = \\dim(M(V)) = n^2\n\\]\n\nwhich translates to:\n\n\\[\n\\dim(U) + \\dim(W) = n^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, statement II is always true.\n\n**Statement III: \\( \\dim(U) < n \\).**\n\nThis statement claims that the dimension of \\( U \\) is less than \\( n \\).\n\nHowever, \\( U \\) is a subspace of \\( M(V) \\), which has dimension \\( n^2 \\). So, \\( \\dim(U) \\leq n^2 \\).\n\nBut more specifically, \\( U \\) consists of matrices that commute with \\( T \\). The dimension of \\( U \\) depends on the properties of \\( T \\).\n\nFor example, if \\( T \\) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, say \\( T = cI \\), then every matrix \\( X \\) commutes with \\( T \\), because \\( cI X = X cI \\) for any \\( X \\). In this case, \\( U = M(V) \\), so \\( \\dim(U) = n^2 \\), which is greater than or equal to \\( n \\) for \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly statement II must be true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
