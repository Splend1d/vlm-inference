                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about accounts receivable confirmation. So, the auditor is using the blank form of positive confirmation. I need to figure out why this method might be ineffective, and the options are about selection bias, uncollectible accounts, response rates, and representativeness.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what positive accounts receivable confirmation is. Positive confirmation means that the auditor asks the customer to reply only if they disagree with the amount stated in the confirmation request. The blank form likely means that the auditor is sending a request without specifying the amount, and the customer has to fill in the amount they believe is correct.\n\nOption A says that all accounts don't have an equal opportunity to be selected for confirmation. I think this might relate to the sampling method the auditor uses to choose which accounts to confirm. If the sampling isn't random, some accounts might be overrepresented or underrepresented. But is this specifically a problem with the blank form?\n\nOption B mentions that accounts unconfirmed may have already been written off as uncollectible. So, if an account is written off as uncollectible, the customer might not respond because they don't owe anything or they dispute the debt. But again, is this a direct issue with using the blank form?\n\nOption C says that few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients. This seems plausible because if the customer has to fill in the amount themselves, it might be more work for them, and they might be less likely to respond. This could lead to a lower response rate, which would make the confirmation less effective.\n\nOption D suggests that accounts actually confirmed may not be representative of the population. This could happen if certain types of accounts are more likely to respond than others. For example, customers with small balances or no balances might be more likely to respond, while those with larger balances or disputes might be less likely to reply.\n\nComparing these options, Option C seems directly related to the use of the blank form, as it requires more effort from the recipient, which could lead to fewer responses. Option D could also be a consequence, but it seems more like a secondary effect.\n\nI think the best answer is C: Few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients. This directly relates to the blank form approach, as it places more burden on the customer to provide the information, which could result in a lower response rate and thus make the confirmation less effective.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if any of the other options are also possible reasons.\n\nOption A about unequal selection opportunity seems more related to the sampling method rather than the type of confirmation form used. So, it might not be directly related to using a blank form.\n\nOption B about written-off accounts is also a possible issue, but it's more about the status of the account rather than the confirmation method. If an account is written off, the customer might not respond because they don't recognize the debt, but this isn't specifically tied to the blank form.\n\nOption D about representativeness is a valid concern in any confirmation procedure. If the responses aren't representative of the overall population of accounts, the auditor might draw incorrect conclusions. However, this seems like a broader issue in auditing rather than being specific to the blank form method.\n\nTherefore, I believe Option C is the most appropriate answer because it directly addresses a potential weakness of using the blank form for positive confirmation, which is the increased effort required from recipients leading to fewer responses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
