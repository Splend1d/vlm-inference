Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that there's a identity involving binomial coefficients that might be useful here. Specifically, I think it's the one that says \\( \\binom{n}{k} + \\binom{n}{k+1} = \\binom{n+1}{k+1} \\). Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, if I look at the left side of the equation, \\( \\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5} \\), it matches the form of that identity where \\( n = 23 \\) and \\( k = 4 \\). Applying the identity, this should equal \\( \\binom{24}{5} \\).\n\nWait a minute, but the problem has \\( \\binom{23}{5} \\), which is \\( \\binom{23}{5} = \\binom{23}{23-5} = \\binom{23}{18} \\), but that doesn't seem directly helpful here. Actually, no, maybe I'm getting confused. The identity I mentioned should still apply as is.\n\nSo, according to the identity: \\( \\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5} = \\binom{24}{5} \\). Therefore, \\( \\binom{24}{5} = \\binom{24}{k} \\). Now, I need to find all integers \\( k \\) for which this is true.\n\nI know that binomial coefficients are symmetric, meaning \\( \\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k} \\). So, for \\( \\binom{24}{5} = \\binom{24}{k} \\), it must be that \\( k = 5 \\) or \\( k = 24 - 5 = 19 \\). Therefore, the possible values of \\( k \\) are 5 and 19.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of all such integers \\( k \\). So, summing 5 and 19 gives 24. Looking back at the options, 24 is one of them.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there are any other possible values of \\( k \\) that I might have missed. The binomial coefficients are defined for integers \\( k \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq 24 \\), and due to the symmetry, those are the only two values that satisfy \\( \\binom{24}{5} = \\binom{24}{k} \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all such \\( k \\) is indeed 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
