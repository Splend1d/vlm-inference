                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option has reduced the power of political parties. Let's look at each one:\n\nA. An increase in the number of direct primary elections.\n\nPrimary elections are when parties select their candidates for the general election. If there are more direct primaries, that might give more power to the voters within the party, but I'm not sure if that reduces the party's power overall. Maybe it just changes how candidates are chosen.\n\nB. A surge in soft-money campaign contributions.\n\nSoft money is money donated to political parties for activities that are supposed to support parties generally, not specific candidates. This was allowed until the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002, which restricted soft money contributions. So, if there's a surge in soft money, that would probably increase the power of political parties, not reduce it. So this seems opposite to what the question is asking.\n\nC. Stricter voter registration requirements.\n\nIf voter registration requirements are made stricter, that could make it harder for some people to vote. That might reduce the number of people who can vote, but I'm not sure how that directly affects the power of political parties. Maybe it could advantage one party over another, but not necessarily reduce the power of parties overall.\n\nD. A decline in the number of political action committees.\n\nPolitical action committees, or PACs, are groups that support candidates or causes with campaign contributions. If there are fewer PACs, that might reduce the amount of money flowing outside of the party structure. That could potentially increase the power of political parties, because parties would have less competition for funding candidates. But the question is asking which option has reduced the power of political parties, so this seems contrary to what we're looking for.\n\nWait a minute, option D says \"a decline in the number of political action committees,\" which would mean fewer PACs. If there are fewer PACs, that might reduce the amount of money going around outside of the party structure, which could make political parties more powerful because they have more control over candidate funding. So, again, that would increase their power, not reduce it.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider each option again.\n\nOption A: An increase in direct primary elections. Direct primaries allow more voters within the party to have a say in who the party nominates. This could make the party more responsive to its base, but it might also limit the party elite's control over candidate selection. So, in a way, it could reduce the power of the party establishment.\n\nOption B: A surge in soft-money contributions. As I thought before, soft money used to be a big source of funding for parties, so an increase in soft money would probably increase their power.\n\nOption C: Stricter voter registration requirements. This might reduce voter turnout, but I don't see a direct link to the power of political parties. Parties might have to work harder to get out the vote, but their overall power might not change.\n\nOption D: A decline in the number of political action committees. As I thought earlier, fewer PACs could mean less competition for candidate funding, which could increase party power.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, option A seems to be the one that could reduce the power of political parties, because it empowers more rank-and-file party members in the candidate selection process, potentially limiting the influence of party elites.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I should consider that an increase in direct primary elections could actually strengthen parties by making them more representative and thus more appealing to voters. But on the other hand, it could also mean that the party leadership has less control over who represents the party.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option B is actually reducing party power because soft money used to be a big part of party funding, but now there are restrictions on soft money, which has reduced party power. But the option says \"a surge in soft-money contributions,\" which would probably increase party power.\n\nUnless, maybe, the surge in soft money has led to more super PACs or other external spending, which could bypass the parties and reduce their influence. But I think soft money was supposed to go to parties, not necessarily to outside groups.\n\nOption C: Stricter voter registration requirements could reduce voter turnout, which might make it harder for parties to mobilize their bases, thus reducing their power.\n\nOption D: A decline in the number of political action committees could reduce the flow of money outside of the party structure, which might increase party power.\n\nSo, if I'm thinking about which option has reduced party power, maybe option C, stricter voter registration requirements, because it could lead to lower voter turnout and make it harder for parties to operate effectively.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I need to consider the overall impact on party operations and influence.\n\nOption A: More direct primaries might make parties more democratic, but could also lead to more extremist candidates being nominated, which might not be in the best interest of the party establishment.\n\nOption B: More soft money would typically benefit parties, so a surge in soft money would increase their power.\n\nOption C: Stricter voter registration could reduce voter turnout, which might weaken parties if they have fewer voters to mobilize.\n\nOption D: Fewer PACs could mean less money going to candidates outside of the party structure, which might increase party control over candidates.\n\nGiven that, options C and A could potentially reduce party power, but I think option C is more directly related to reducing party power because of the potential decrease in voter participation.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards C. Stricter voter registration requirements have reduced the power of political parties.\n\nBut now I'm remembering that stricter voter registration requirements are often criticized for disenfranchising certain groups of voters, which could indeed weaken political parties if those groups are part of their base.\n\nAlternatively, if both parties are affected equally, maybe it doesn't change their relative power. But overall, it could reduce their ability to mobilize voters and thus their power.\n\nComparing all the options, I think C is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
