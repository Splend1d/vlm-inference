So, the question is asking which state has particles that are closely packed, giving it a stable shape and a definite volume. Let's think about the options: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.\n\nFirst, solids are known for having a fixed shape and volume. The particles in a solid are tightly packed and have strong intermolecular forces between them. This causes them to vibrate in fixed positions rather than moving around freely. So, solids definitely have a stable shape and definite volume due to their closely packed particles.\n\nLiquids, on the other hand, have a definite volume but they take the shape of their container. Their particles are closer together than in gases but more spread out than in solids. They can flow and move around each other, which is why they don't have a fixed shape.\n\nGases have neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume. Their particles are widely spaced and move around freely, colliding with each other and the walls of their container. So, gases don't maintain a specific shape or volume.\n\nPlasma is often considered the fourth state of matter. It's like a gas, but its particles are ionized, meaning they have lost or gained electrons and have an electric charge. Plasmas can conduct electricity and are affected by magnetic fields. They don't have a fixed shape or volume.\n\nGiven this, the state that matches the description of having closely packed particles, a stable shape, and a definite volume is solid. So, the answer should be A. Solid.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's quickly recall the characteristics:\n\n- Solids: closely packed particles, fixed shape, fixed volume.\n\n- Liquids: somewhat packed particles, no fixed shape, fixed volume.\n\n- Gases: loosely packed particles, no fixed shape or volume.\n\n- Plasma: similar to gas but with ionized particles.\n\nYes, solids fit the description perfectly. So, I'm confident that A. Solid is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
