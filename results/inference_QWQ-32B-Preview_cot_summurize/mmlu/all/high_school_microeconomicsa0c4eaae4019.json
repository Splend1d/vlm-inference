                    "text": "So I've got this question here about oligopoly, and I need to figure out which characteristics are true for it. The options are:\n\nI. Formidable barriers to entry.\n\nII. Price (P) equals Marginal Revenue (MR).\n\nIII. Relatively few sellers.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. I only.\n\nB. II only.\n\nC. III only.\n\nD. I and III only.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what an oligopoly is. I think it's a market structure where there are only a few sellers, and there are high barriers to entry for new firms. So, that sounds like points I and III are correct.\n\nNow, about point II: Price equals Marginal Revenue. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. In perfect competition, P equals MR, but in other market structures like monopoly or monopolistic competition, that's not always the case.\n\nSo, in an oligopoly, which is somewhere between monopoly and perfect competition, I need to think about how firms set their prices and revenues.\n\nI recall that in oligopoly, firms are interdependent; that is, the actions of one firm affect the others, so they have to consider how their pricing and output decisions will influence their competitors.\n\nAlso, in oligopoly, there can be various models like Cournot, Bertrand, or Stackelberg, but I don't need to get into that level of detail right now.\n\nLet me focus on the characteristics.\n\nFirst, formidable barriers to entry: that sounds right for oligopoly. High startup costs, economies of scale, or government regulations can prevent new firms from entering the market easily. So, I think I is correct.\n\nSecond, relatively few sellers: yeah, that's a defining feature of oligopoly. So, III seems correct too.\n\nNow, P equals MR: I'm not so sure about that. In perfect competition, P = MR because firms are price takers, and the demand curve is horizontal. But in oligopoly, firms have some market power, so their demand curve is downward sloping, which means P > MR.\n\nWait, but I think in some oligopoly models, like when firms collude and act like a monopoly, P could be set higher than MR.\n\nAlternatively, in perfect competition, P = MR, but in monopoly, P > MR, and in oligopoly, it's somewhere in between.\n\nSo, I think in oligopoly, generally, P > MR, unless in some specific circumstances.\n\nTherefore, II is not a characteristic of oligopoly.\n\nSo, combining these thoughts, I think the correct answer is D. I and III only.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any scenario in oligopoly where P equals MR?\n\nMaybe if firms are price takers, but then it wouldn't be an oligopoly.\n\nOr perhaps in perfect competition, P equals MR, but again, that's not oligopoly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall the MR curve in oligopoly.\n\nIn oligopoly, since there are only a few sellers, each firm's output decision affects the market price, so the demand curve is downward sloping, and MR lies below the demand curve, meaning P > MR.\n\nSo, in general, in oligopoly, P does not equal MR.\n\nTherefore, II is not a characteristic of oligopoly.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. I and III only.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
