                    "text": "Let's see. I'm looking at this objection to Peter Singer's theory, and the options are:\n\nA. It doesn't do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own.\n\nB. It inappropriately makes proximity morally important.\n\nC. It doesn't account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\n\nD. Requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Singer's theory is about. I think it's his view on global ethics and our obligations to help those in need, especially in poorer countries. He argues that we have a moral obligation to help others as much as we can, especially when it's easy to do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance.\n\nOption A says his theory doesn't do enough to address suffering in other countries. But I think Singer is actually known for emphasizing the importance of helping people in other countries, especially through his work on effective altruism and charity. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption B says his theory inappropriately makes proximity morally important. Wait, Singer is known for arguing that geographic proximity doesn't affect moral obligations. He believes that suffering is suffering, whether it's next door or halfway around the world. So, he actually downplays the moral significance of proximity. Therefore, this objection seems counter to his\u89c2\u70b9.\n\nOption C says his theory doesn't account for stricter obligations to loved ones. Hmm, this is interesting. Singer does argue for a more impartial approach to ethics, where moral considerations are based on the consequences of our actions rather than personal relationships. But many people feel that we have stronger moral obligations to our family and friends than to strangers. So, this could be a valid objection: that Singer's theory doesn't adequately recognize these differential obligations.\n\nOption D says his theory requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme. Singer's ideas do challenge traditional moral intuitions, especially regarding our responsibilities to those far away and the extent to which we should sacrifice for others. So, this could also be a plausible objection.\n\nBetween C and D, I think C is more specific to the content of his theory, whereas D is more about the overall impact of accepting his theory. The question is asking about an objection that Singer considers, so perhaps C is more directly related to the substance of his ethical arguments.\n\nLet me think again. Singer does discuss the tension between partiality towards loved ones and impartial moral duties. In his book \"The Life You Can Save,\" he acknowledges that people have stronger feelings and obligations towards their family and friends, but argues that this shouldn't excuse us from helping those in greater need, even if they are strangers.\n\nSo, the objection that his theory doesn't account for stricter obligations to loved ones is one that he is aware of and addresses. He tries to reconcile these intuitions with his broader moral framework.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. His theory doesn't account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
