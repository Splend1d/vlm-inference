                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the amplitude of a free induction decay dropping to 25% of its initial intensity after 1 second. It says to assume exponential relaxation and that \u03a9 is zero, and I need to find the value of T2. The options are A) 0.721 s, B) 0.750 s, C) 1.386 s, and D) 1.661 s.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what free induction decay is. I think it's related to NMR or MRI, where after applying a radiofrequency pulse, the spins in the material relax back to their equilibrium state, and this relaxation is measured as a decaying signal over time.\n\nGiven that it's exponential relaxation, the amplitude should decay exponentially with time, right? So, the general form of the equation for the amplitude as a function of time would be something like:\n\nM(t) = M0 * e^(-t/T2)\n\nWhere:\n\n- M(t) is the amplitude at time t\n\n- M0 is the initial amplitude\n\n- t is time\n\n- T2 is the transverse relaxation time, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nThe problem says that after 1.0 second, the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial value. So, at t = 1.0 s, M(t) = 0.25 * M0.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\n0.25 * M0 = M0 * e^(-1.0 / T2)\n\nI can divide both sides by M0 (assuming M0 is not zero):\n\n0.25 = e^(-1.0 / T2)\n\nNow, to solve for T2, I need to take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.25) = ln(e^(-1.0 / T2))\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nln(0.25) = -1.0 / T2\n\nBecause ln(e^x) = x.\n\nNow, ln(0.25) is ln(1/4) = ln(1) - ln(4) = 0 - ln(4) = -ln(4).\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(4) = -1.0 / T2\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nln(4) = 1.0 / T2\n\nNow, solve for T2:\n\nT2 = 1.0 / ln(4)\n\nLet me calculate ln(4). I know that ln(4) is approximately 1.386.\n\nSo, T2 = 1.0 / 1.386 \u2248 0.721 s\n\nWait, but that's option A. But let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting from:\n\n0.25 = e^(-1.0 / T2)\n\nTake natural log:\n\nln(0.25) = -1.0 / T2\n\nln(0.25) is -1.386 (since ln(4) \u2248 1.386, and ln(0.25) = ln(1/4) = -ln(4))\n\nSo:\n\n-1.386 = -1.0 / T2\n\nThus:\n\n1.386 = 1.0 / T2\n\nTherefore:\n\nT2 = 1.0 / 1.386 \u2248 0.721 s\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the value of T2 is approximately 0.721 seconds.\n\nBut wait, option B is 0.750 s, which is close, but option A is 0.721 s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the equation for M(t). Let me see.\n\nIn NMR, the free induction decay (FID) signal amplitude decays exponentially with time constant T2 when \u03a9 (the Rabi frequency) is zero. So, the equation I used seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a different form of the equation, like M(t) = M0 * e^(-t/(2*T2)) or something like that. But no, the standard equation is M(t) = M0 * e^(-t/T2).\n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nPerhaps using the relationship between the decay rate and T2.\n\nThe decay rate, often denoted by R, is related to T2 by R = 1/T2.\n\nGiven that the amplitude decays exponentially: M(t) = M0 * e^(-R*t)\n\nGiven M(t) = 0.25 * M0 at t = 1.0 s:\n\n0.25 * M0 = M0 * e^(-R*1.0)\n\nAgain, divide both sides by M0:\n\n0.25 = e^(-R)\n\nTake natural log:\n\nln(0.25) = -R\n\nSo, R = -ln(0.25) = ln(4) \u2248 1.386 s^-1\n\nThen, T2 = 1/R \u2248 1/1.386 \u2248 0.721 s\n\nStill the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're considering multiple exponential decays or something, but the problem states to assume exponential relaxation and \u03a9 = 0, so it should be a single exponential decay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a phase factor or something, but given that \u03a9 = 0, there should be no oscillation, just pure exponential decay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a different definition of T2, but according to standard NMR physics, T2 is the transverse relaxation time that determines the exponential decay of the transverse magnetization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nWait, let me see if there's another way to express T2.\n\nSometimes, in NMR, the decay is expressed in terms of the Fourier transform, but that shouldn't affect the time domain expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the full FID signal, which includes a decaying cosine or sine term, but again, with \u03a9 = 0, it should just be a pure exponential decay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of ln(4). Let me check that.\n\nln(4) = ln(2^2) = 2*ln(2) \u2248 2*0.693 \u2248 1.386, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, T2 = 1.0 / 1.386 \u2248 0.721 s.\n\nSo, the answer should be A) 0.721 s.\n\nBut why are there other options? Maybe there's a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering something else, like T1 relaxation or something, but it specifically says T2 and \u03a9 = 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they're expecting the answer in milliseconds or some other unit, but the options are in seconds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're considering a different initial condition or something, but I think the approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they're using a different model for the decay, but given the assumptions, exponential relaxation with \u03a9 = 0 should lead to M(t) = M0 * e^(-t/T2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the energy units or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in what 25% of the initial intensity means. Maybe it's the energy that drops to 25%, not the amplitude.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. In NMR, the signal amplitude is related to the transverse magnetization, and the energy might be proportional to the square of the amplitude.\n\nSo, if the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial value, that would mean the energy drops to (0.25)^2 = 0.0625 or 6.25% of its initial value.\n\nBut the problem says \"the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial intensity.\" Intensity is usually related to energy or power, which is proportional to the square of the amplitude.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's clearly \"amplitude\" that drops to 25% of its initial \"intensity.\" Maybe \"intensity\" here is used interchangeably with \"amplitude,\" which would be a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"initial intensity\" refers to the initial amplitude, and \"drops to 25% of its initial intensity\" means that amplitude decreases to 25% of its initial value.\n\nGiven that, my original approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude, so if the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial value, the intensity drops to (0.25)^2 = 6.25% of its initial value.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial intensity,\" so I think it's referring to the amplitude being 0.25 times its initial value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's confusion in the terminology.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the area under the curve or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they're considering a different equation that includes both T1 and T2 relaxations, but the problem specifies \u03a9 = 0 and exponential relaxation, which should be only T2 relaxation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem itself or the options provided.\n\nGiven all that, I think the correct answer is A) 0.721 s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
