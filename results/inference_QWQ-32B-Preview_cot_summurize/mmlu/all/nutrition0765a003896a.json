                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here: a 20-year-old student from Sudan has just arrived in Britain and he's complaining about abdominal cramps and diarrhea after drinking milk. He went to the university health center for help. And there are four options to choose from about what might be causing his problem. Let's see:\n\nOption A: Bacterial and yeast overgrowth in the small intestine.\n\nOption B: Lack of pancreatic amylase.\n\nOption C: Lack of small intestinal lactase.\n\nOption D: Lack of small intestinal sucrase-isomaltase.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what could be causing his symptoms after drinking milk. So, abdominal cramps and diarrhea are typical signs of food intolerance or maybe an infection.\n\nLet's consider the context: he's from Sudan and has recently arrived in Britain. Maybe there's something about the change in environment or diet that's affecting him.\n\nStarting with Option A: bacterial and yeast overgrowth in the small intestine. This is something called Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth, or SIBO. It can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. But is it the most likely cause in this specific situation? Maybe, but I need to see if there's a more likely explanation given the details provided.\n\nOption B: lack of pancreatic amylase. Pancreatic amylase is an enzyme that helps break down carbohydrates, specifically starches. If someone lacks this enzyme, they might have trouble digesting starches, leading to symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain. But in this case, the issue is after drinking milk, which is more related to lactose, not starches.\n\nOption C: lack of small intestinal lactase. Lactase is the enzyme that breaks down lactose, which is the sugar found in milk and dairy products. If someone doesn't have enough lactase, they can't properly digest lactose, leading to symptoms like abdominal cramps and diarrhea. This condition is known as lactose intolerance.\n\nOption D: lack of small intestinal sucrase-isomaltase. Sucrase-isomaltase is another enzyme that helps break down sugars, specifically sucrose and some types of starches. Deficiency in this enzyme can lead to symptoms similar to lactose intolerance, but again, the trigger here is milk, which suggests lactose might be the issue.\n\nGiven that the symptoms occur after drinking milk, lactose intolerance seems like a plausible cause. But let's think deeper. The student is from Sudan. I recall that lactose intolerance is more common in certain populations, particularly in regions where lactose intolerance is genetically more prevalent.\n\nSudan is in Africa, and from what I know, many African populations have a high prevalence of lactose intolerance, especially among those who are not from pastoralist backgrounds. So, if this student is from a part of Sudan where lactose intolerance is common, it makes sense that he might not tolerate milk well.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that he's recently arrived in Britain might suggest that the milk in Britain is different in some way, but actually, milk is milk regardless of the country, so that probably doesn't make a difference. Unless there's something about the milk processing that's different, but that seems unlikely.\n\nSo, comparing the options:\n\n- Option A: SIBO could cause general digestive issues, but it's not specifically linked to milk consumption.\n\n- Option B: Pancreatic amylase deficiency relates to starch digestion, not lactose.\n\n- Option C: Lactase deficiency directly relates to lactose in milk, which aligns with the symptoms described.\n\n- Option D: Sucrase-isomaltase deficiency relates to sucrose and some starches, not lactose.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of his problem is lack of small intestinal lactase, which is Option C.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other possibilities. For example, maybe he has a milk protein allergy, but that's different from lactose intolerance, and the symptoms might present differently, often with skin rash, itching, or respiratory symptoms in addition to gastrointestinal issues.\n\nBut based on the information provided, abdominal cramps and diarrhea after drinking milk point most directly to lactose intolerance due to lack of lactase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
