It's like buying a burger and getting fries with it, I guess. Now, I need to choose the right term from the options given: Product pricing, Price differentiation, Pure price bundling, or Odd-number pricing.\n\nFirst, let's think about what each of these terms means.\n\nProduct pricing sounds pretty general. It could refer to how products are priced individually, but the question is about offering them together, so maybe not the best fit.\n\nPrice differentiation seems like it's about charging different prices to different customers or for different products, but again, the focus here is on offering them together.\n\nPure price bundling\u2014now, this sounds promising. Bundling typically means putting two or more products or services together and offering them as a package, often at a combined price that\u2019s less than if you bought them separately. That seems to match the description in the question.\n\nOdd-number pricing is a marketing strategy where prices are set at amounts like $9.99 instead of $10.00, to make the price seem lower. That\u2019s not really about offering products together, so I can rule that out.\n\nSo, between the options given, pure price bundling seems to be the most appropriate term for when a product or service is offered together with another, typically complementary one.\n\nTo make sure, let me double-check. Bundling is indeed when multiple items are sold as a single unit, often at a discounted price. This is common in many industries, like software packages, meal deals at restaurants, or subscription services that include multiple benefits.\n\nPrice differentiation, on the other hand, is more about varying prices based on factors like customer segment, time, or version of the product. It\u2019s not specifically about offering products together.\n\nProduct pricing is too broad, as it could encompass any pricing strategy for individual products.\n\nAnd odd-number pricing is a specific pricing tactic to make prices seem cheaper, not about combining products.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Pure price bundling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
