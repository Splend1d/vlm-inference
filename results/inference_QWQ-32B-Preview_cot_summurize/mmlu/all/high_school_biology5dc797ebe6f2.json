                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about when crossing-over happens in meiosis. I know it's something that occurs between chromosomes, but I'm not sure exactly when during the process. Let's see, meiosis has two main divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II, and each has its own phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.\n\nSo, crossing-over is when parts of chromosomes swap places, right? That's how new combinations of genes are formed. I think this happens between homologous chromosomes. Now, homologous chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes, one from each parent.\n\nLet me recall what happens in each phase of meiosis I.\n\nIn prophase I, the chromosomes condense and become visible. This is also when homologous chromosomes pair up in a process called synapsis. I think crossing-over might happen during this stage because the homologous chromosomes are closely aligned.\n\nThen, there's something called the synaptonemal complex that forms between the homologous chromosomes during prophase I. I believe crossing-over physically occurs through structures called chiasmata, which are the sites where the chromosomes exchange genetic material.\n\nSo, if crossing-over happens during prophase I, does that mean the answer is A? Prophase I?\n\nBut let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nMetaphase I: In this phase, the homologous chromosomes are aligned at the cell's equatorial plate. The chromosomes are held together by the centromeres, and the spindle fibers attach to them. I don't think crossing-over occurs at this stage; it seems like the chromosomes are just getting positioned for separation.\n\nAnaphase I: Here, the homologous chromosomes are separated and pulled to opposite poles of the cell. Again, this seems like a separation phase rather than a phase where genetic material is exchanged.\n\nProphase II: This is part of meiosis II, which is more similar to mitosis. In prophase II, the chromosomes condense again in the daughter cells, but crossing-over doesn't occur here because the homologous chromosomes have already been separated in meiosis I.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like crossing-over happens during prophase I.\n\nWait, but I've also heard about chiasmata being visible in metaphase I. Does that mean crossing-over is still occurring in metaphase I?\n\nLet me think about that. If chiasmata are the physical manifestations of crossing-over, and they can be seen in metaphase I, maybe crossing-over is still happening or at least the process is not yet complete by the time metaphase I begins.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look up more details about the timing of crossing-over.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps crossing-over occurs earlier in prophase I, and the chiasmata are just the remnants or the points where the exchange has already taken place.\n\nI think it's more accurate to say that crossing-over occurs during prophase I, specifically during the stage called pachytene, which is part of prophase I.\n\nDuring pachytene, the homologous chromosomes are fully synapsed, and crossing-over and chiasma formation occur.\n\nAfter that, in diplotene, the homologous chromosomes start to separate, but they remain connected at the chiasmata until they are finally resolved.\n\nSo, by metaphase I, the chiasmata are still present, but the actual exchange of genetic material has already occurred earlier in prophase I.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Prophase I.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should make sure that none of the other phases involve crossing-over.\n\nMetaphase I: Alignment of homologous chromosomes, no crossing-over.\n\nAnaphase I: Separation of homologous chromosomes, no crossing-over.\n\nProphase II: Condensation of chromosomes in meiosis II, no homologous chromosomes present, so no crossing-over.\n\nSo, yes, it seems definite that crossing-over occurs during prophase I.\n\nI think I've got it now. Crossing-over is a key event in prophase I of meiosis, leading to genetic variation in the resulting gametes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
