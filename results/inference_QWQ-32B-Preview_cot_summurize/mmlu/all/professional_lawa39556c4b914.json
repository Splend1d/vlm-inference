                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a caterer who owns a summer cottage on a lake, and it's located on a knoll above the lake, which probably means it's a bit elevated or maybe on a hill. To get to this cottage, the caterer needed a way to access it, so he made an agreement with a neighbor, who is also a landowner, adjacent to his property.\n\nThey had a written agreement where the neighbor granted the caterer a right-of-way over a strip of land that's 30 feet wide and a quarter of a mile long, along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. So, basically, the neighbor is allowing the caterer to use this path on his land to access the cottage.\n\nNow, without notifying the neighbor, the caterer went ahead and improved the roadbed by asphalting it to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. So, he upgraded the path to an asphalt road to make it easier for cars or other vehicles to use.\n\nA few years down the line, the neighbor started a sand business, which requires heavy hauling. This hauling activity ended up destroying the asphalted surface of the road. So, the neighbor's heavy trucks or whatever vehicles he's using for the sand business have damaged the road.\n\nNow, the caterer is suing to enjoin the neighbor from using the road to transport sand. So, he wants the court to stop the neighbor from using the road for this purpose.\n\nWe need to figure out what the court will most likely do. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Issue an injunction against the neighbor to prevent further use of the road to haul sand.\n\nB. Refuse to grant the caterer's prayer for relief because the servient owner continues to have the right to use his own land.\n\nC. Issue an injunction against the neighbor unless it can be shown that the neighbor's use did not unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access.\n\nD. Dismiss the cause of action because the caterer's only remedy would be monetary damages.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the nature of the right-of-way that was granted. It's a right of way over the neighbor's land to access the caterer's cottage. In property law, a right of way is an easement, which is a nonpossessory interest in land that allows the holder to use another's land for a specific purpose.\n\nSo, the caterer has an easement over the neighbor's land for the purpose of accessing his cottage.\n\nNow, when the caterer improved the road by asphalting it, he did so without notifying the neighbor. This could be seen as altering the nature of the easement, but legally, the easement holder (the caterer) generally has the right to maintain and improve the easement in a way that facilitates the purpose for which it was granted, as long as it doesn't unreasonably burden the servient land (the neighbor's land).\n\nThe neighbor started a sand business and is using the road for heavy hauling, which has destroyed the asphalt surface. So, the caterer is now seeking to stop the neighbor from using the road for this purpose.\n\nLet's consider the legal principles here.\n\nFirst, an easement typically allows the holder to use the land for a specified purpose, and the servient owner (the neighbor) retains the right to use his land in any way that doesn't interfere with the easement holder's rights.\n\nIn this case, the easement is for a right of way to access the cottage. The neighbor has the right to use his land for other purposes, including starting a sand business, but his use must not interfere unreasonably with the caterer's right of way.\n\nThe neighbor's heavy hauling has destroyed the asphalt surface, which the caterer had installed to facilitate vehicle access to the cottage.\n\nSo, the question is whether the neighbor's use of the road for his sand business unreasonably interferes with the caterer's right of way.\n\nOption A suggests issuing an injunction against the neighbor to prevent further use of the road to haul sand. This would stop the neighbor from using the road for this purpose.\n\nOption B says the court will refuse to grant relief because the servient owner has the right to use his own land. While the servient owner does have rights, those rights are limited by the easement. So, if his use unreasonably interferes with the easement, he could be restrained.\n\nOption C proposes issuing an injunction unless the neighbor can show that his use didn't unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access. This seems balanced, as it puts the burden on the neighbor to prove that his use isn't causing unreasonable interference.\n\nOption D suggests dismissing the case because the caterer's only remedy is monetary damages. But injunctions are often granted in easement cases to prevent ongoing interference with the easement.\n\nConsidering these, option C seems the most appropriate. The court would likely consider whether the neighbor's use of the road for heavy hauling unreasonably interferes with the caterer's right of way.\n\nIn easement law, the servient owner (neighbor) must not use his land in a way that substantially interferes with the easement holder's (caterer's) use of the easement. Here, the heavy hauling has destroyed the road surface, which the caterer had improved for vehicle access.\n\nSo, the caterer would argue that the neighbor's use is interfering with his right of way, and he seeks an injunction to stop it.\n\nThe neighbor might argue that he has the right to use his land for his business, but his use is interfering with the caterer's easement.\n\nIn such cases, courts often balance the interests of both parties. If the neighbor's use is causing significant damage to the easement, the court may grant an injunction to prevent further damage.\n\nHowever, if the neighbor can show that his use doesn't unreasonably interfere or that there are other means for the caterer to access his cottage, the court might deny the injunction.\n\nTherefore, option C seems the most likely outcome: the court would issue an injunction against the neighbor unless it can be shown that the neighbor's use did not unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access.\n\nOption A is too absolute; it doesn't consider the possibility that the neighbor's use might be reasonable under certain circumstances.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the servient owner's rights are limited by the easement; he can't use his land in a way that interferes with the easement.\n\nOption D is also not ideal because injunctions are a common remedy in easement disputes to prevent ongoing interference.\n\nHence, the best answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
