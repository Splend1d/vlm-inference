The question is: \"The most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of:\n\nA. a deletion.\n\nB. a duplication.\n\nC. a substitution.\n\nD. an insertion.\"\n\nOkay, so cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder, and it's caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The CFTR gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. When there's a mutation in this gene, it can lead to the thick mucus seen in cystic fibrosis, which affects the lungs and other organs.\n\nNow, mutations can be of different types: deletions, where a part of the DNA is missing; duplications, where a part is copied extra; substitutions, where one DNA base is replaced by another; and insertions, where an extra base or bases are added into the DNA sequence.\n\nI need to figure out which of these is the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis.\n\nI remember that the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis is called \u0394F508. Let me see what that stands for.\n\n\u0394F508 means there's a deletion of three bases in the CFTR gene, which results in the absence of a phenylalanine amino acid at position 508 in the protein.\n\nSo, that sounds like a deletion mutation.\n\nLet me confirm that. If it's a deletion of three bases, that would remove one amino acid from the protein sequence.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, option A, a deletion, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut, to be thorough, I should consider if there are other types of mutations that are more common in cystic fibrosis.\n\nI know that there are many different mutations that can cause cystic fibrosis, but \u0394F508 is by far the most common one, especially in Caucasian populations.\n\nLet me check if there are any duplications, substitutions, or insertions that are more common than deletions.\n\nI don't recall any specific duplication or insertion being more common than \u0394F508.\n\nSubstitutions also occur, but again, \u0394F508 is the most prevalent.\n\nSo, it seems safe to say that the most common cystic fibrosis mutation is a deletion.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. a deletion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
