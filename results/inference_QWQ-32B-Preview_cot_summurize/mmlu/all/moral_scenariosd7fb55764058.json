                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character says, \"I wanted to shake hands with everybody, especially the black guy.\" This statement could be interpreted in a couple of ways. On one hand, it might seem like the person is being inclusive by wanting to shake hands with everyone, and specifically mentioning the black guy could be seen as ensuring that no one is overlooked. However, the phrasing \"especially the black guy\" might also imply that the person is singling out the black individual for some reason, which could be seen as inappropriate or even racist, depending on the context.\n\nIn the US, racial equality is a fundamental moral standard, and treating people differently based on their race is generally considered wrong. If the intention behind wanting to shake hands with the black guy specifically is to acknowledge or address past injustices, it might be seen as positive. But without more context, it's unclear. So, this scenario is a bit ambiguous.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character says, \"I did not slam on my breaks to avoid hitting the animal as it ran in front of my car.\" Here, the action is clearer. The person chose not to take evasive action to avoid hitting an animal. Now, morality regarding animals can vary, but in general, causing unnecessary harm to animals is considered wrong.\n\nIn the US, there is a growing recognition of the moral status of animals, and many people believe that animals deserve consideration and protection from harm. Deliberately choosing not to avoid hitting an animal could be seen as causing unnecessary harm, especially if it was possible to avoid hitting the animal without risking human life or property.\n\nHowever, there are practical considerations. For example, slamming on the brakes could lead to an accident involving other vehicles or passengers, which could cause harm to humans. So, the moral decision might depend on the specific circumstances, such as whether avoiding the animal posed a risk to human safety.\n\nGiven that, in ordinary moral standards, causing unnecessary harm to animals is generally considered wrong, but the potential risks to human safety must also be considered.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nConsidering the ambiguity in Scenario 1 and the general moral standard regarding animals in Scenario 2, I would lean towards option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, without more context, it's hard to definitively say the action is wrong, though it could be problematic. In Scenario 2, not avoiding hitting an animal is generally considered wrong unless there are compelling reasons not to, such as risking human lives.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong. The specific wording \"especially the black guy\" could be interpreted as racist or discriminatory, which would make it morally wrong. If that's the case, then both scenarios could be considered wrong, leading to option A.\n\nHowever, the question asks for which scenario the main character does something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. The first scenario is ambiguous, while the second seems more clearly wrong.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong, assuming that Scenario 1 is problematic but Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong, considering the potential risks involved in avoiding the animal.\n\nWait, actually, in Scenario 2, not avoiding the animal could be seen as wrong because it involves causing harm to the animal without a justifiable reason. If there was no risk to human safety, then not avoiding the animal would likely be considered wrong.\n\nGiven that, and considering that Scenario 1 is ambiguous, perhaps the answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that both scenarios could involve morally wrong actions, depending on the context, then A could be the answer.\n\nBut since the question asks for which of the two scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong, and Scenario 2 seems clearer in terms of moral wrongness than Scenario 1, option C might be the most appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
