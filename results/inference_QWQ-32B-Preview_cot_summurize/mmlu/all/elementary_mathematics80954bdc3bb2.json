                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"Find the number that makes the statement 12 over 18 equals question mark over 9 true.\" And there are options: A. 4, B. 6, C. 8, D. 12. Okay, so it's a proportion problem. I need to find the value of '?' that makes this equation true: 12/18 = ?/9.\n\nFirst, I should probably simplify the fraction on the left side. 12 over 18, both numbers are divisible by 6. So, 12 divided by 6 is 2, and 18 divided by 6 is 3. So, 12/18 simplifies to 2/3. Now, the equation looks like 2/3 = ?/9.\n\nI need to find the number that, when placed over 9, is equal to 2/3. One way to approach this is to set up a proportion and solve for the unknown. So, let's call the unknown number 'x'. Therefore, 2/3 = x/9.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply. That means 2 multiplied by 9 equals 3 multiplied by x. So, 2 * 9 = 3 * x, which simplifies to 18 = 3x.\n\nNow, to find x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. So, 18 divided by 3 equals x, which is 6. Therefore, the number that makes the statement true is 6.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. If I plug x = 6 back into the original equation, 12/18 = 6/9. Simplifying both sides, 12/18 reduces to 2/3, and 6/9 also reduces to 2/3. So, yes, both sides are equal.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see what the other options would give me.\n\nOption A: 4. So, 12/18 = 4/9. Simplifying 12/18 to 2/3 and 4/9 doesn't equal 2/3, because 4 divided by 9 is approximately 0.444, and 2 divided by 3 is approximately 0.666. So, not equal.\n\nOption C: 8. 12/18 = 8/9. Simplifying, 12/18 is 2/3, and 8/9 is approximately 0.888, which is not equal to 2/3.\n\nOption D: 12. 12/18 = 12/9. Simplifying, 12/18 is 2/3, and 12/9 is 4/3, which is not equal to 2/3.\n\nSo, only option B, which is 6, makes the statement true.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to see that 18 divided by 9 is 2, meaning that the denominator is halved. So, to keep the fractions equal, the numerator should also be halved. 12 divided by 2 is 6. So again, that points to 6 being the correct answer.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it enough. The answer is 6, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
