It is used for prediction.\n\nC. It may be used for interpretation.\n\nD. It discovers causal relationships.\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what regression is. Regression analysis is a statistical method that helps us understand the relationship between a dependent variable (output) and one or more independent variables (inputs). So, option A says it relates inputs to outputs, which sounds correct.\n\nOption B says it's used for prediction. Yeah, that makes sense too. We can use regression models to predict the value of the output based on the input variables.\n\nOption C says it may be used for interpretation. Interpretation in regression usually means understanding the relationship between variables, like how a change in an input variable affects the output. So, that seems accurate as well.\n\nNow, option D says it discovers causal relationships. Hmm, this is where I need to be careful. Regression can show us that there is a relationship between variables, but does that mean it shows causation?\n\nI remember hearing something about correlation and causation. Correlation doesn't imply causation, right? So, just because two variables are related doesn't mean that one causes the other.\n\nIn regression, we can see that as one variable increases, another variable tends to increase or decrease, but that doesn't necessarily mean that there's a causal link.\n\nTo be sure, maybe I should look up what regression actually does in terms of causality.\n\nLet me think about this. In experimental studies, where treatments are randomly assigned, regression can be used to estimate causal effects. But in observational studies, where variables are not randomly assigned, regression can only show associations, not necessarily causation.\n\nSo, it seems like regression can suggest possible causal relationships, but it doesn't definitively discover them, especially in observational data.\n\nTherefore, option D might be the false statement.\n\nBut wait, maybe in some cases regression can discover causal relationships, like in controlled experiments.\n\nYet, the question is asking for which statement is FALSE regarding regression.\n\nGiven that regression can suggest causation under certain conditions, but not always, maybe the statement is too absolute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is considering the general use of regression and acknowledging that it often doesn't discover causal relationships on its own.\n\nI think the key here is to understand that regression alone doesn't establish causation; it requires additional assumptions or experimental design.\n\nSo, in general, it would be misleading to say that regression discovers causal relationships, without qualifying it.\n\nTherefore, I believe option D is the false statement.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nA. It relates inputs to outputs. \u2013 True.\n\nB. It is used for prediction. \u2013 True.\n\nC. It may be used for interpretation. \u2013 True.\n\nD. It discovers causal relationships. \u2013 False, generally speaking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
