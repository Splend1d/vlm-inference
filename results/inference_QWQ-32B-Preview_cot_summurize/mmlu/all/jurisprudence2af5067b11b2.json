Let's analyze each option to determine which purpose it serves.\n\nOption A: It distinguishes social rules from mere group habits.\n\nHart emphasizes the difference between social rules and mere group habits by introducing the concept of the internal point of view. People who accept and follow social rules do so not just because they are habitual but because they recognize the rules as standards that guide behavior and have normative force. This internal acceptance and adherence distinguish rules from mere habits, which may be followed without any sense of obligation or normative guidance.\n\nOption B: It defines the judicial function.\n\nWhile the internal point of view is crucial for understanding how legal rules are applied and followed, it is not specifically defined as the defining feature of the judicial function. Judges, from the internal point of view, apply legal rules as valid and binding, but the internal point of view is broader and applies to all participants in the legal system, not just judges.\n\nOption C: It illustrates the authority of the legislature.\n\nThe internal point of view involves accepting the legal rules as authoritative and feeling obligated to follow them. This includes recognizing the authority of the legislature to make laws. However, saying that the internal point of view illustrates the authority of the legislature might be too narrow, as it also encompasses the acceptance of other legal rules and institutions beyond just the legislature.\n\nOption D: It stresses the relationship between law and justice.\n\nHart's concept of law, including the internal point of view, is primarily concerned with the structure and functioning of legal systems, rather than their moral justifications or connections to justice. While law and justice may intersect, Hart's focus is on the positivist approach, which separates law's validity from its moral merits. Therefore, stressing the relationship between law and justice is not the primary purpose of the internal point of view in Hart's theory.\n\nGiven this analysis, option A seems to be the most accurate. The internal point of view helps distinguish social rules from mere group habits by highlighting the normative acceptance and guidance that rules provide, which habits lack.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
