                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Butler's view on what causes injustice. The options are:\n\nA. desires for external goods.\n\nB. love of injustice.\n\nC. ill-will toward others.\n\nD. self-hatred.\n\nI need to remember what Butler said about injustice. I think he was a moral philosopher, right? I recall that he talked about conscience and moral principles. So, maybe he would say that injustice comes from something related to moral failings.\n\nLet me think about option A: desires for external goods. That seems plausible because often people fight over possessions and advantages, which can lead to injustice. But I'm not sure if that's Butler's specific view.\n\nOption B: love of injustice. That seems extreme. It's hard to imagine that people actively love injustice for its own sake. Maybe in some cases, but generally, people don't seek to be unjust for the sake of it.\n\nOption C: ill-will toward others. This seems likely. If someone has ill-will toward others, they might act unjustly towards them. That makes sense.\n\nOption D: self-hatred. Hmm, that's interesting. I'm not sure how self-hatred directly leads to injustice towards others. Maybe if someone hates themselves, they project that hatred onto others, but that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nLet me try to recall specific points from Butler's writings. I remember that Butler emphasized the importance of conscience and that it's a guide to moral behavior. He also talked about self-love and benevolence as two separate principles in human nature.\n\nMaybe he saw injustice as arising from an imbalance between self-love and benevolence. If someone prioritizes their own desires too much, at the expense of others' welfare, that could lead to injustice. So, in that case, it might be related to desires for external goods, which aligns with option A.\n\nBut another perspective is that injustice comes from a lack of concern for others, which could be related to ill-will, option C. Alternatively, maybe he saw injustice as a result of misdirected affections or erroneous judgments about what is truly good.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at some key quotes from Butler to get a better sense of his view.\n\nButler famously said, \"There is no passion in the human heart more universally dominant, or more strongly eager and impatient, than the desire of being conspicuous and distinguished.\" Maybe this desire for distinction could lead to seeking external goods, which in turn could cause injustice if not controlled.\n\nAlso, he discussed that conscience has a unique authority and that it's distinct from other principles like self-love. So, perhaps he saw injustice as a failure to follow conscience properly.\n\nIn his Sermon Five, \"Upon the Nature of Virtue,\" Butler explains that virtue is about acting in accordance with conscience and that injustice violates this.\n\nGiven that, maybe he wouldn't attribute injustice primarily to desires for external goods, but rather to a failure to act according to conscience, which could be influenced by various factors, including ill-will toward others.\n\nOption C, ill-will toward others, seems relevant here because if someone has ill-will, they might be more likely to act against conscience and commit injustices.\n\nOn the other hand, option A, desires for external goods, could also lead to injustice if someone is so focused on acquiring possessions that they're willing to treat others unjustly to get them.\n\nI need to decide which one Butler would consider as the cause of injustice.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Butler is known for his notion of self-love and benevolence as concurrent principles in human nature. Self-love can be directed towards external goods, but it's also about one's own happiness and well-being.\n\nIf someone's self-love outweighs their benevolence, they might pursue their own interests at the expense of others, leading to injustice.\n\nIn that case, it's the desire for external goods, driven by self-love, that could cause injustice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he saw injustice as arising from a misalignment between one's affections and their true welfare, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at his concept of the \"analogies of nature.\" Butler often used analogies to argue for certain moral positions.\n\nIn his Sermon Eleven, \"On the Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature,\" he discusses how nature has certain regularities and that religion, both natural and revealed, should be understood in analogy to these natural processes.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that directly relates to the cause of injustice.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the answer is more straightforward.\n\nGiven the options, A, B, C, and D, and thinking about Butler's emphasis on conscience and the importance of moral principles, I think he would most likely attribute injustice to ill-will toward others, which is option C.\n\nIll-will directly opposes benevolence, which Butler saw as a fundamental principle of human nature. Therefore, if someone has ill-will toward others, they are acting against benevolence, which could lead to injustice.\n\nAdditionally, in his Sermon One, \"On the Nature of True Virtue,\" Butler discusses the principle of universal benevolence and how virtue involves promoting the general welfare.\n\nIf someone has ill-will toward others, they are clearly not promoting the general welfare, and thus their actions would be unjust.\n\nFurthermore, in Sermon Four, \"On the Characters of Men,\" Butler distinguishes between different character traits and how they influence moral behavior. Ill-will is certainly a negative character trait that could lead to injustice.\n\nWhile desires for external goods, option A, could lead to injustice, I think Butler would see the root cause as a moral failure, such as ill-will, rather than simply wanting material possessions.\n\nLove of injustice, option B, seems too strong and not in line with Butler's view that people generally have a conscience that guides them towards what is right.\n\nSelf-hatred, option D, doesn't seem directly related to causing injustice towards others. It's more inward-directed, whereas injustice affects others.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of Butler's moral philosophy, I believe the answer is C. ill-will toward others.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
