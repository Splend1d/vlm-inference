The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I gave away my little sister, to a stranger, for one dollar.\n\nScenario 2: I don't let my pet dog wander outside when it's raining.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I need to assess each scenario separately and see which one is clearly morally wrong.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I gave away my little sister, to a stranger, for one dollar.\"\n\nThis sounds really alarming. Giving away a family member, especially a young sister, to a stranger for money seems absolutely wrong. In the US, selling or giving away a child is illegal and morally reprehensible. It's a form of trafficking and exploitation, which is severely condemned.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this is clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I don't let my pet dog wander outside when it's raining.\"\n\nThis seems like a responsible action. In fact, many people would consider it caring and protective towards the pet's well-being. Keeping a pet inside during bad weather can prevent it from getting sick, injured, or lost.\n\nSo, this seems like the right thing to do, morally speaking.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any ambiguity.\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving away a family member to a stranger for money is unquestionably wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, protecting your pet from bad weather is a responsible act, not wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
