                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about which Roman statesman encouraged civic religion in his work \"The Laws.\" The options are Varro, Plato, Cicero, and Augustus. I think I need to recall who among these wrote a work titled \"The Laws\" and was known for promoting civic religion in Rome.\n\nFirst, I know that Plato was a Greek philosopher, not a Roman statesman. He wrote a book called \"The Laws,\" but since the question specifies a Roman statesman, Plato might not be the correct answer. Although his ideas influenced Roman thought, he wasn't a Roman statesman himself.\n\nVarro was a Roman scholar and writer who wrote extensively on religious topics. He was known for his work \"Antiquities of Human and Divine Matters,\" which was a comprehensive study of Roman religion. So, he might be a candidate, but I'm not sure if he specifically wrote \"The Laws.\"\n\nCicero was a Roman statesman, philosopher, and lawyer who wrote many works on philosophy and politics, including some on religion. He discussed the role of religion in society and its importance for the state. One of his works is \"De Legibus,\" which translates to \"On the Laws.\" So, this seems promising.\n\nAugustus was the first Roman emperor and played a significant role in revitalizing Roman religion as part of his political reforms. He restored many temples and promoted traditional religious practices. However, I don't recall if he wrote a work specifically titled \"The Laws.\"\n\nGiven this information, Cicero seems like the most likely candidate because he was a Roman statesman who wrote \"De Legibus,\" which is about laws, and he did discuss civic religion in his works. Varro was a scholar of religion but may not have written \"The Laws,\" and Augustus, while promoting civic religion, might not have written such a treatise.\n\nI should probably look up a bit more to confirm. Cicero's \"De Legibus\" is known to discuss the foundations of law and touches on religious aspects, encouraging a return to traditional Roman religious practices as a way to strengthen the state. So, it aligns with the idea of encouraging civic religion.\n\nVarro did write about religion in depth, but his major work is \"Antiquities of Human and Divine Matters,\" not \"The Laws.\" Augustus, as a statesman, certainly encouraged civic religion through his political reforms and restorations of temples, but I don't think he wrote a philosophical treatise titled \"The Laws.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Cicero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
