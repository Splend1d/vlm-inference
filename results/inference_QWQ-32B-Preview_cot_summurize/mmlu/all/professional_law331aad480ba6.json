The large man followed the businessman for several blocks of unending, unlit alleys. The businessman was in great fear. The large man was just a few feet behind, singing songs about how he was going to have a \"big meal tonight\" and it looked like he \"had struck it rich,\" and other words indicating possible violence and robbery. Finally, the businessman threw his wallet in one direction and ran the other way, as he yelled, \"You can have my money, just leave me my life!\" The large man picked up the wallet and ran in the opposite direction, but when he came to the end of the alley he was arrested and charged with robbery. He appealed his conviction, arguing that he had no intent to steal and was trying to return the wallet to the victim. Will the appellate court likely affirm the robbery conviction?\n\nA. No, the large man's songs could have been coincidental or unthinking, he made no threats, and later could have been trying to return the wallet.\nB. Yes, because the large man followed too closely for too long, he sang menacing songs that placed the businessman in fear, and then he took the wallet and ran in the other direction.\nC. Yes, because one should never pick up someone else's wallet laying on the ground for any reason.\nD. No, because the wallet was not in the immediate presence of the victim when the large man picked it up.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. So, there's this big, tattooed guy following a businessman through some dark alleys, and he's singing these songs about having a big meal and striking it rich, which sounds pretty menacing. The businessman gets scared and throws his wallet away, yelling that the guy can have his money if he leaves him alone. The tattooed guy picks up the wallet and runs off, but gets arrested for robbery. He's appealing his conviction, saying he didn't intend to steal and was actually trying to return the wallet.\n\nSo, the question is, will the appellate court likely affirm the robbery conviction? And we have options A, B, C, and D to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what robbery is in legal terms. Robbery is usually defined as taking someone's property against their will, using force or intimidation. So, it's not just taking something; it's taking it in a way that scares or forces the person to give it up.\n\nIn this case, the tattooed guy was following the businessman closely, singing these songs that sound like he's planning to have a big meal and has struck it rich. The businessman interprets this as a threat and throws his wallet away, fearing for his life. The tattooed guy then picks up the wallet and runs off.\n\nOption A says no, the large man's songs could have been coincidental or unthinking, he made no direct threats, and later could have been trying to return the wallet. Hmm, that's possible. Maybe he was just singing to himself, and the businessman overreacted. And then, maybe he picked up the wallet to return it, but got arrested.\n\nOption B says yes, because the large man followed too closely for too long, sang menacing songs that placed the businessman in fear, and then took the wallet and ran in the opposite direction. This seems to align with the robbery definition, where the guy's actions intimidated the businessman into giving up his wallet.\n\nOption C says yes, because one should never pick up someone else's wallet laying on the ground for any reason. That seems too general. There might be situations where picking up a wallet isn't stealing, like if you find it and try to return it. So, this option seems too broad.\n\nOption D says no, because the wallet was not in the immediate presence of the victim when the large man picked it up. The businessman had thrown it away, so maybe the wallet was no longer under his control. Maybe the tattooed guy didn't take it directly from him, so it's not robbery.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these options is most likely to be affirmed by the appellate court.\n\nFirst, considering option A, that the songs were coincidental and the guy was trying to return the wallet. But the problem is, the businessman was clearly frightened by the guy's presence and his songs, to the point where he threw his wallet away. So, even if the guy didn't intend to threaten him, his actions had that effect.\n\nOption B seems strong because the guy's actions and songs created fear in the businessman, who then handed over his wallet by throwing it away. The guy then took the wallet and ran off, which sounds like robbery.\n\nOption C is too broad, as picking up a wallet isn't always stealing. It depends on the context.\n\nOption D raises an interesting point. The wallet was thrown away by the businessman, so was it still in his immediate possession? In law, possession can be immediate or constructive, meaning you have control over it, even if not directly holding it.\n\nI think the key here is whether the tattooed guy took the wallet through the use of force or intimidation. If the businessman threw it away out of fear induced by the guy's actions, then arguably, the guy is guilty of robbery.\n\nBut the guy is arguing that he had no intent to steal and was trying to return the wallet. If that's true, then maybe he shouldn't be convicted of robbery.\n\nHowever, intent can be inferred from actions. If someone acts in a way that reasonably causes fear in another person, leading to the surrender of property, that can be robbery, even if the actor didn't explicitly intend to rob them.\n\nIn this case, the guy was following closely, singing about a big meal and striking it rich, which could be interpreted as threats of violence to get money.\n\nThe businessman threw his wallet away, fearing for his life, which shows that the guy's actions had the effect of instilling fear.\n\nThen, the guy picked up the wallet and ran off. This looks a lot like robbery.\n\nBut the guy is saying he was trying to return the wallet. Is there any evidence to support that? Well, he picked it up and ran off, which doesn't really suggest an intention to return it.\n\nMaybe if he had picked it up and then tried to catch up to the businessman to return it, that would be different. But here, he picked it up and ran in the opposite direction.\n\nSo, it seems more likely that he was intending to keep the wallet.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most plausible: yes, the appellate court will likely affirm the robbery conviction because the large man followed too closely for too long, sang menacing songs that placed the businessman in fear, and then took the wallet and ran in the opposite direction.\n\nOption A is possible, but given the circumstances, it's less likely.\n\nOption C is too general and not directly relevant to the specific circumstances.\n\nOption D raises a point about possession, but even if the wallet was no longer in the businessman's immediate possession, if the taking was influenced by the earlier intimidation, it could still be considered robbery.\n\nSo, I think B is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
