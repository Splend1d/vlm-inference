                    "text": "So I walked my dog 7/9 of a mile in the morning and 5/12 of a mile in the afternoon. I need to find out how much farther I walked in the morning compared to the afternoon. The options are A) 13/36, B) 12/21, C) 2/3, and D) 35/108.\n\nFirst, I need to subtract the afternoon walk from the morning walk to find the difference. So, it's 7/9 minus 5/12. To subtract fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's find the least common denominator (LCD) for 9 and 12.\n\nThe denominators are 9 and 12. The prime factors of 9 are 3 times 3, and for 12, it's 2 times 2 times 3. The LCD should include each prime factor the greatest number of times it occurs in any one of the denominators. So, for 2, it's twice, and for 3, it's twice. So, 2 squared is 4, and 3 squared is 9, but 4 times 9 is 36. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, the LCD of 9 and 12 is 36, because 9 times 4 is 36, and 12 times 3 is 36. Okay, so I'll convert both fractions to have a denominator of 36.\n\nFirst, 7/9. To get from 9 to 36, I multiply the denominator by 4. So, I also multiply the numerator by 4: 7 times 4 is 28. So, 7/9 is equal to 28/36.\n\nNext, 5/12. To get from 12 to 36, I multiply the denominator by 3. So, I multiply the numerator by 3: 5 times 3 is 15. So, 5/12 is equal to 15/36.\n\nNow, subtract the afternoon walk from the morning walk: 28/36 minus 15/36. Since the denominators are the same, I can just subtract the numerators: 28 minus 15 is 13. So, the difference is 13/36.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 13/36, which matches what I just calculated. But let's double-check if there's a way to simplify 13/36. The numerator is 13, which is a prime number, and 36 is not divisible by 13, so it can't be simplified further.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if I did the subtraction correctly. Let's see: 7/9 minus 5/12. Converting to 28/36 and 15/36, yes, 28 minus 15 is indeed 13, so 13/36 is correct.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe find the difference directly without finding a common denominator. But that's more complicated, and I think using a common denominator is the standard and reliable method.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert both fractions to decimals and subtract them. Let's try that to verify.\n\n7/9 is approximately 0.777..., and 5/12 is approximately 0.4167. Subtracting, 0.7777... minus 0.4167 is about 0.361. Now, 13/36 as a decimal is 0.3611..., which matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, it seems confirm that 13/36 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to see why they're wrong.\n\nOption B is 12/21. Simplifying 12/21, divide numerator and denominator by 3, gets 4/7, which is approximately 0.571, which doesn't match our earlier decimal of 0.361.\n\nOption C is 2/3, which is approximately 0.666..., again doesn't match.\n\nOption D is 35/108. Converting to a decimal, 35 divided by 108 is approximately 0.324, which is less than 0.361.\n\nSo, none of the other options match our calculated difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 13/36 can be simplified further. 13 is a prime number, and 36 isn't divisible by 13, so it's already in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should add the two distances instead of subtracting. But the question asks how much farther was the morning walk compared to the afternoon, so subtraction is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the fractions. Let's double-check the original fractions.\n\nMorning: 7 over 9 mile, afternoon: 5 over 12 mile. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in finding the common denominator. Let's try finding another common denominator, not necessarily the least one.\n\nMultiples of 9 are 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, etc.\n\nMultiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36, 48, etc.\n\nSo, 36 is indeed the least common denominator.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used 108, which is 9 times 12, but 36 is smaller and easier to work with.\n\nSo, I think 36 is the best choice for the common denominator.\n\nConverting 7/9 to 28/36 and 5/12 to 15/36 is correct.\n\nSubtracting, 28/36 minus 15/36 is 13/36.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 13/36.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the question.\n\n\"how much farther did you walk your dog in the morning than in the afternoon?\"\n\nThis clearly asks for the difference between the morning and afternoon walks.\n\nSo, subtracting the smaller distance from the larger one is the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, if it was worded differently, maybe addition would be needed, but not in this case.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that A) 13/36 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
