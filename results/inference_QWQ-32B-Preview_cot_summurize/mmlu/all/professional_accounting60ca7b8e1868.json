                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem about Dawn Corp. and their standard cost system. They had unfavorable labor rate and efficiency variances, and they wrote these variances off directly to cost of goods sold. The question is asking what would have happened if instead they had allocated these variances to work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold. Specifically, it wants to know the effects on the current ratio and net income.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these variances are and how they affect the financial statements.\n\nLabor rate variance is the difference between the actual cost of labor and the standard cost based on the actual hours worked. If it's unfavorable, it means the company paid more for labor than expected.\n\nLabor efficiency variance is the difference between the actual hours worked and the standard hours that should have been worked for the output achieved, multiplied by the standard rate. An unfavorable efficiency variance means that more hours were worked than expected for the output.\n\nNormally, variances can be handled in a few ways: they can be written off to cost of goods sold, accumulated and written off in a separate account, or allocated to work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold based on the stage of production.\n\nIn this case, Dawn wrote them off directly to cost of goods sold, but the question is about what would happen if they allocated them instead to WIP, FG, and COGS.\n\nFirst, let's think about the current ratio. The current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities. So, any change in current assets or current liabilities will affect the current ratio.\n\nNow, if variances are allocated to WIP and FG, which are both current assets (assuming FG is held for sale in the normal course of business), and to COGS, which is an expense, then:\n\n- Allocating to WIP and FG would increase these asset accounts, assuming the variances are unfavorable and thus added to these accounts.\n\n- Allocating to COGS would increase the COGS, which would decrease net income.\n\nBut wait, unfavorable variances are usually added to the cost, meaning they increase the cost.\n\nSo, if they allocate the unfavorable variances to WIP and FG, these accounts would increase, which would increase current assets.\n\nAt the same time, allocating to COGS would increase COGS, which would decrease net income.\n\nBut, I need to think about how this affects the current ratio.\n\nIf current assets increase and current liabilities stay the same, the current ratio would increase.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider if there's any effect on current liabilities. If the variances are allocated and increase inventory (WIP and FG), but no change in current liabilities, then current ratio increases.\n\nBut, I should also consider if there's any offsetting effect.\n\nNow, regarding net income, if COGS increases due to the allocation of unfavorable variances, net income would decrease.\n\nWait, but the question says that Dawn wrote off the variances directly to COGS, and now we're considering allocating them to WIP, FG, and COGS instead.\n\nSo, in the original scenario, the variances were fully written off to COGS, which increased COGS and decreased net income.\n\nIf, instead, they allocate them to WIP, FG, and COGS, then only a portion of the variances would go to COGS, with the rest going to WIP and FG.\n\nThis means that COGS would not increase as much as in the original scenario, which would lead to a higher net income compared to writing off the entire variance to COGS.\n\nAdditionally, WIP and FG would increase, which increases current assets.\n\nTherefore, compared to the original scenario where variances were fully written off to COGS:\n\n- Current ratio would increase because current assets increase (WIP and FG up).\n\n- Net income would increase because COGS doesn't increase as much.\n\nBut wait, the question is a bit tricky because it's asking about the effects of allocating the variances instead of writing them off directly to COGS.\n\nIn other words, if they allocate the variances to WIP, FG, and COGS instead of writing them off directly to COGS, what happens to current ratio and net income.\n\nFrom above, it seems that current ratio increases and net income increases.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOriginal scenario:\n\n- Variances written off to COGS: COGS increases by the full amount of variances, decreasing net income.\n\n- No allocation to WIP or FG.\n\nAlternative scenario:\n\n- Variances allocated to WIP, FG, and COGS.\n\n- WIP and FG increase, increasing current assets.\n\n- COGS increases, but presumably by less than the total variance, since some variance is allocated to WIP and FG.\n\nTherefore, compared to the original scenario:\n\n- Current ratio increases because current assets increase.\n\n- Net income increases because COGS increases by less than in the original scenario.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A: Current ratio increases, net income increases.\n\nBut wait, the options include decreases as well, so maybe I need to consider another perspective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the allocation doesn't change the total cost, it just defers the recognition of the variance.\n\nIn that case, the total cost remains the same, but the timing of when the cost is recognized might change.\n\nHowever, in standard costing, unfavorable variances are often seen as additions to the cost, so allocating them to inventory accounts would mean that part of the variance is deferred to future periods when the inventory is sold.\n\nTherefore, in the period when the variances are allocated, COGS would increase by less than if the variances were fully written off to COGS, leading to higher net income in that period.\n\nAt the same time, current assets would increase due to higher WIP and FG.\n\nThus, current ratio increases and net income increases.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor I'm missing.\n\nPerhaps if the variances are material, allocating them might have a different effect, but the question doesn't specify materiality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some industries, FG is not a current asset, but in most cases, finished goods are considered current assets.\n\nTherefore, I think A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
