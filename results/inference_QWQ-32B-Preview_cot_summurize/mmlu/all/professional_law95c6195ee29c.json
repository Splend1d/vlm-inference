Along this narrow stretch and on opposite sides of the street are located two businesses. Situated on the east side of the street is a bar and grill; directly across the street on the west side is a lounge. In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking. As a consequence, the owner of the lounge brought suit for declarative relief against the city alleging that the parking ban on his side of the street was unconstitutional.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a situation where a state highway runs through a city's business district, and there's a stretch that's too narrow to meet safety standards. There are two businesses on opposite sides of the street: a bar and grill on the east side and a lounge on the west side. The state highway department ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway to comply with safety standards.\n\nThe city council had a special meeting to decide which side to prohibit parking on but couldn't reach a decision. Finally, the city council president decided to flip a coin to decide, and as a result, parking was prohibited on the west side, which is in front of the lounge. This caused the lounge to lose business because of the lack of parking, so the owner sued the city, claiming that the parking ban on his side of the street is unconstitutional.\n\nWe need to determine which of the four options is most likely to be correct:\n\nA. No, because as a governmental entity, the city enjoys immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nB. No, because the city's action was reasonable.\n\nC. Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nD. Yes, because responsible government officials cannot conduct or formulate their decision-making processes by means of coin flips.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: Eleventh Amendment immunity. The Eleventh Amendment generally provides states and their agencies with immunity from suits in federal court, but there are exceptions. In this case, the suit is brought by a private party against a city, which is a municipal corporation, not necessarily a state entity. Additionally, if the suit is based on federal law, there might be an exception to immunity. However, this seems a bit tangential to the main issue here, which is the method used to make the decision and its constitutional implications.\n\nOption B says no, because the city's action was reasonable. This suggests that the city had a legitimate reason for prohibiting parking on one side of the street to meet safety standards, and choosing one side over the other was a reasonable exercise of their discretion. However, the way the decision was made\u2014that is, by flipping a coin\u2014might call into question whether the decision was actually reasonable or arbitrary.\n\nOption C claims yes, because the action violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The equal protection clause requires that similar situations be treated equally and prohibits intentional discrimination without a legitimate government interest. In this case, the city prohibited parking on one side but not the other, which affects one business more than the other. However, the decision was made by a coin flip, which seems arbitrary rather than based on any discriminatory intent or legitimate government interest related to equal protection.\n\nOption D states yes, because government officials cannot make decisions by coin flips. This suggests that there is a due process or general principle of law that requires government decisions to be based on rational considerations rather than random chance.\n\nLet's think about this more deeply. The city was faced with a dilemma: it had to prohibit parking on one side of the street to comply with state safety regulations. Both sides likely had similar characteristics, and the city council couldn't decide which one to choose. So, they resorted to a coin flip.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, government decisions, especially those that affect private property rights and businesses, need to be based on rational grounds. Flipping a coin is the epitome of arbitrariness and lacks any rational basis. This could potentially violate the due process clause, which requires that government actions be fair and rational.\n\nThe plaintiff is arguing that the parking ban on his side of the street is unconstitutional. If the decision was made through a coin flip, it's hard to see how that decision was based on any rational consideration relevant to the purpose of prohibiting parking to meet safety standards.\n\nNow, regarding the equal protection clause, while the lounge and the bar and grill are similarly situated, the city's decision affected one more than the other. However, equal protection is usually concerned with intentional discrimination based on certain classifications like race, religion, etc. Here, the decision wasn't based on any such classification but rather on randomness.\n\nTherefore, option C might not be the strongest argument, whereas option D seems more directly applicable because the decision-making process was arbitrary and lacked any rational basis.\n\nOption A, regarding Eleventh Amendment immunity, might not apply here because the suit is against the city, not necessarily the state, and the circumstances might allow for an exception to immunity.\n\nOption B, that the action was reasonable, is questionable because the method of decision-making was a coin flip, which is inherently unreasonable.\n\nSo, in all likelihood, the plaintiff might have a case that the city's decision-making process was unconstitutional due to its arbitrariness, which could be seen as a violation of due process.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Yes, because responsible government officials cannot conduct or formulate their decision-making processes by means of coin flips.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
