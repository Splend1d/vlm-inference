Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should remember the rules for adding positive and negative numbers. When I add a negative number, it's the same as subtracting the positive version of that number. So, \u221216 + 13 + (\u221233) is the same as \u221216 + 13 - 33.\n\nLet me try adding these step by step. Starting with \u221216 + 13.\n\n\u221216 + 13... okay, so I'm adding a positive 13 to a negative 16. That's like moving 16 steps back and then 13 steps forward. So, I'll be at \u22123. Because \u221216 + 13 = \u22123.\n\nNow, I have \u22123 + (\u221233), which is the same as \u22123 - 33.\n\nSo, \u22123 minus 33... that's like moving 3 steps back and then another 33 steps back, which totals 36 steps back. So, \u22123 - 33 = \u221236.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is \u221236.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting again: \u221216 + 13 + (\u221233).\n\nFirst, \u221216 + 13: that's \u22123.\n\nThen, \u22123 + (\u221233): that's \u221236.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLooking at the options, D. \u221236 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-36} \\]"
