Practitioners recite his name and aspire to be reborn in his pure land, where they can more easily achieve enlightenment. So, it seems like the only hope for salvation is in Amida's grace in this tradition.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nB. Tendai Buddhism is more about the potential for enlightenment in all phenomena and the study of Mahayana sutras. It's not specifically about relying on Amida's grace.\n\nC. Shingon Buddhism is a esoteric tradition that focuses on mantras, mudras, and visualizations to realize one's own Buddha nature. It's not about salvation through Amida's grace.\n\nD. Soto Zen emphasizes seated meditation and the realization of one's true nature through zazen. Again, it's not about relying on Amida for salvation.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's A. Pure Land.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
