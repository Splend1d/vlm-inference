The registrar contended that Article I, Section 2 of the U. S. Constitution specifically required a candidate for the House of Representatives \"be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. \" As a consequence, the candidate filed suit in state court against the registrar of elections seeking to have her name placed on the ballot. The state court ruled in her favor and determined that the candidate did, in fact, qualify as a resident of the state. The registrar appealed the decision to the state supreme court which, in turn, affirmed the lower court ruling. Thereafter, the candidate's name was placed on the ballot. After a hotly contested election, the candidate narrowly defeated the incumbent. However, at the time that the candidate was to be seated as a House member, the House of Representatives held hearings on her qualifications and eligibility. By a two-thirds vote, the House determined that the candidate was not a resident of the state at the time of her election and refused to seat her. The candidate then brought suit in federal district court against the Speaker and other officers of the House, seeking back pay and an order that she be seated in the House of Representatives. The defendants demurred, claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer?\n\nA. There is no case or controversy between the candidate and the officers of the House of Representatives.\nB. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nC.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a candidate who was barred from having her name on the ballot because the state registrar thought she wasn't a resident of the state. She fought this in state court, won, and her name was put on the ballot. She won the election but when it came time to be seated in the House of Representatives, the House held hearings and decided she wasn't a resident, so they refused to seat her. Now, she's suing in federal district court against the House officers for back pay and to be seated.\n\nThe defendants are saying there's no subject matter jurisdiction, and they're demurring based on that. We need to find the strongest constitutional argument supporting their demurrer from the options given.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. There is no case or controversy between the candidate and the officers of the House of Representatives.\n\nHmm. She's suing the House officers because they won't seat her, and she wants back pay and to be seated. That seems like a clear case or controversy to me. She's claiming she's entitled to something, and they're denying it. So, this doesn't seem like a strong argument for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nB. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\n\nThis one is interesting. There's a doctrine in constitutional law called the \"political question doctrine,\" which holds that some issues are best left to the political branches of government to decide, and courts shouldn't get involved. This often comes up in cases involving separation of powers.\n\nIn this scenario, the House of Representatives has the authority under the Constitution to judge the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members. That's from Article I, Section 5, Clause 1: \"Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members...\" So, the House has the power to decide who gets seated, and their decision might be seen as final.\n\nIf that's the case, then the federal courts might stay out of it because it's a political question that the Constitution assigns to the House. This could be a strong argument for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nC. The suit should have been brought as an original action in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOriginal jurisdiction in the Supreme Court is pretty limited. It mostly handles disputes between states or cases involving ambassadors and other public ministers. This doesn't seem to fit into those categories, so this argument seems weak.\n\nD. Under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts are not empowered to render advisory opinions.\n\nAdvisory opinions are when courts give opinions on hypothetical or abstract questions without a real case or controversy. Here, there is a real dispute: she wants to be seated, and they won't seat her. So, this isn't an advisory opinion; it's a live case. Therefore, this argument doesn't hold much weight.\n\nComparing all these options, B seems to be the strongest. The political question doctrine is directly relevant here because the House has the constitutional authority to judge the qualifications and elections of its members. The courts might defer to that authority and refuse to hear the case, deeming it a political question not suitable for judicial review.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any precedent for this?\n\nWell, in Baker v. Carr (1962), the Supreme Court laid out factors to determine if a question is nonjusticiable political. One key factor is if the Constitution textually commits the issue to another branch. Here, Article I, Section 5 clearly gives the House the power to judge elections and qualifications of its members.\n\nAdditionally, in Powell v. McCormack (1969), the Supreme Court held that even though the House has the power to judge qualifications, it cannot exclude a member who meets the Constitution's requirements for membership (age, citizenship, residence). But in that case, the issue was about the House trying to exclude someone who clearly met the constitutional requirements.\n\nIn our scenario, the House is deciding that she doesn't meet the residence requirement. So, it's different from Powell, where the Court intervened because the House was excluding someone who clearly met the requirements.\n\nHere, there's a dispute over whether she meets the residence requirement. The state courts said yes, the House says no. This could be seen as the House exercising its constitutional authority to judge qualifications, which might make it a political question.\n\nTherefore, the strongest argument is likely B, the political question doctrine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
