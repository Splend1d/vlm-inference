                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Jennifer is running a marathon, which is 26.2 miles long. She runs the first half at 8 mph and the second half at 6 mph. We need to find out how long it takes her to finish the race.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The question is about time, specifically how many hours it takes Jennifer to complete the marathon given her speeds for each half.\n\nI know that time is calculated by dividing distance by speed. So, for each half of the race, I can calculate the time separately and then add them together to get the total time.\n\nLet's start by finding the distance of each half. The marathon is 26.2 miles, so each half is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Half distance} = \\frac{26.2 \\text{ miles}}{2} = 13.1 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNow, for the first half, she runs at 8 mph. So, the time for the first half is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_1 = \\frac{13.1 \\text{ miles}}{8 \\text{ mph}}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the second half at 6 mph:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_2 = \\frac{13.1 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ mph}}\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll calculate each time separately.\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\text{Time}_1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_1 = \\frac{13.1}{8} = 1.6375 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThen, calculate \\(\\text{Time}_2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_2 = \\frac{13.1}{6} \\approx 2.1833 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, add both times to get the total time:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time}_1 + \\text{Time}_2 = 1.6375 + 2.1833 \\approx 3.8208 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 2.62\n\nB. 3.74\n\nC. 3.82\n\nD. 4.12\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 3.8208 hours, which matches option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, half the marathon distance:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{26.2}{2} = 13.1 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThat's correct.\n\nThen, time for the first half:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13.1}{8} = 1.6375 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThat seems right.\n\nTime for the second half:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13.1}{6} \\approx 2.1833 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\n1.6375 + 2.1833 = 3.8208 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the average speed for the entire race, but since the speeds are different for each half and the distances are equal, the average speed is not simply the arithmetic mean of the two speeds.\n\nActually, the average speed for the entire trip is given by the total distance divided by the total time. But since we already have the total time from adding the times for each half, and it matches one of the options, I think C. 3.82 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the formula for average speed when distances are equal:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{speed}_1 \\times \\text{speed}_2}{\\text{speed}_1 + \\text{speed}_2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times 8 \\times 6}{8 + 6} = \\frac{96}{14} \\approx 6.857 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nThen, total time would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{average speed}} = \\frac{26.2}{6.857} \\approx 3.82 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 3.82.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 3.82} \\]"
