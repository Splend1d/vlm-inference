                    "text": "So I have this equation to solve: x + 71 = -22. I need to find the value of x. Let me see how to do this.\n\nFirst, I remember that to solve for x, I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. Right now, x is being added to 71. So, to isolate x, I should do the opposite operation, which is subtracting 71 from both sides of the equation. That way, the +71 and -71 will cancel each other out on the left side.\n\nSo, if I subtract 71 from both sides, it looks like this:\n\nx + 71 - 71 = -22 - 71\n\nOn the left side, +71 and -71 cancel out, leaving just x. On the right side, -22 minus 71 is... let's see, -22 minus 71.\n\nWell, minus 22 minus 71 is like moving further to the left on the number line. So, -22 minus 71 would be -22 - 71 = -93.\n\nTherefore, x = -93.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If I plug x = -93 back into the original equation:\n\n-93 + 71 = -22\n\nLet's do the math: -93 + 71. That's like starting at -93 and moving 71 steps to the right. So, -93 + 71 equals -22, which matches the right side of the equation. So, it checks out.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. \u221293\n\nB. \u221249\n\nC. 49\n\nD. 93\n\nThe correct answer is A. \u221293.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-93} \\]"
