So, i is a candidate for the inverse of -i.\n\nD. -i\n\n\\[\n(-i) \\times (-i) = i^2 = -1 \\neq 1\n\\]\n\nSo, -i is not its own inverse.\n\nWait a minute, option C gives us the correct product, but let's make sure there isn't another element that also satisfies this condition.\n\nWe've checked all options, and only C satisfies the condition.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the properties of complex numbers. The inverse of a complex number \\( z \\) in the multiplicative group is \\( \\frac{1}{z} \\), provided \\( z \\neq 0 \\).\n\nSo, the inverse of -i would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{-i}\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this, multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{-i} \\times \\frac{i}{i} = \\frac{i}{-i^2} = \\frac{i}{-(-1)} = \\frac{i}{1} = i\n\\]\n\nSo, again, we find that the inverse of -i is i.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. i\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
