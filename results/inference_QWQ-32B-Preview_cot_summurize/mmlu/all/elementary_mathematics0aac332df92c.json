                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Kim and Eric riding their bicycles different distances over different periods of time, and I need to compare how many miles per week each of them rode. The question is asking which statement correctly compares their weekly mileage.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many miles per week each of them rode. Since it's said that both rode the same distance each week, I can just divide the total miles by the number of weeks to find the weekly mileage.\n\nLet's start with Kim. She rode 135 miles in 9 weeks. So, miles per week for Kim would be:\n\n135 miles \u00f7 9 weeks = 15 miles per week.\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, Eric rode 102 miles in 6 weeks. So, his weekly mileage would be:\n\n102 miles \u00f7 6 weeks = 17 miles per week.\n\nAlright, now I have Kim at 15 miles per week and Eric at 17 miles per week.\n\nThe question is asking for a comparison between their weekly miles. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Eric rode 2 more miles per week than Kim rode.\n\nB. Kim rode 3 more miles per week than Eric rode.\n\nC. Kim rode 11 more miles per week than Eric rode.\n\nD. Eric rode 17 more miles per week than Kim rode.\n\nHmm, so let's see. Eric rode 17 miles per week, and Kim rode 15 miles per week. So, Eric rode more than Kim each week.\n\nTo find out how many more miles per week Eric rode than Kim, I can subtract Kim's weekly mileage from Eric's:\n\n17 miles per week - 15 miles per week = 2 miles per week.\n\nSo, Eric rode 2 more miles per week than Kim.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A says exactly that: \"Eric rode 2 more miles per week than Kim rode.\"\n\nOption B says \"Kim rode 3 more miles per week than Eric rode,\" but that's not true because Eric rode more.\n\nOption C says \"Kim rode 11 more miles per week than Eric rode,\" which is also incorrect.\n\nOption D says \"Eric rode 17 more miles per week than Kim rode.\" Wait, that's not right. Eric rode 17 miles per week, and Kim rode 15, so it's only 2 more, not 17 more.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nKim: 135 miles in 9 weeks.\n\n135 \u00f7 9 = 15 miles per week. That seems correct.\n\nEric: 102 miles in 6 weeks.\n\n102 \u00f7 6 = 17 miles per week. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 17 - 15 = 2 miles per week.\n\nYes, so Eric rode 2 more miles per week than Kim.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is option A.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
