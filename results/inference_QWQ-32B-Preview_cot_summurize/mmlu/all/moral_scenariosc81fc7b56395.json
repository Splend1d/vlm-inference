Let's look at each one separately.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person only had five dollars to buy a present for their mom, but instead, they spent that money on candy for themselves. Now, morally, it's generally considered right to honor and care for one's parents, and buying a gift is a way to show appreciation and love. By not buying the gift and spending the money on themselves, they're prioritizing their own desires over their mother's feelings. This could be seen as selfish and disrespectful. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person voted for a candidate because the candidate paid them money to do so. Voting is a fundamental right in democracy, and it's expected that people vote based on their genuine beliefs and the candidates' policies, not for monetary gain. Selling one's vote is not only unethical but also illegal in many places. It undermines the integrity of the electoral process and democracy itself. So, this action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. So, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
