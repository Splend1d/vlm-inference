I think she's known for her work in ethics, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of her views on moral rules.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Always must be applied to everyone alike.\n\nThis sounds like a principle of impartiality or equality in ethics. It suggests that moral rules are universal and should be applied uniformly to all people without exception.\n\nB. Must be applied to everyone alike in the absence of morally relevant differences.\n\nThis seems similar to A but with a crucial caveat. It allows for differences in treatment based on relevant moral differences between individuals. So, it's equitable but not strictly equal in all cases.\n\nC. Only apply to some members of a group.\n\nThis suggests that moral rules are not universal and are instead limited to certain groups. This could be seen in partialist ethical theories that give moral weight to particular relationships or communities.\n\nD. Are the same in every society.\n\nThis implies that moral rules are universal across all cultures and societies, which is a strong claim about moral universality.\n\nNow, considering Baier's work, I recall that she emphasizes the importance of relationships and particular connections in morality. She is critical of strict impersonal moral theories that treat all individuals equally, regardless of their relationships.\n\nIn her book \"Moral Prejudices,\" Baier argues for a more nuanced approach to morality that takes into account the particular relationships and contexts in which moral decisions are made. She suggests that moral rules should consider the specific roles and relationships people have, which could mean that moral rules aren't applied uniformly to everyone in all situations.\n\nGiven this, option B seems the most aligned with Baier's view. It allows for moral rules to be applied equally unless there are morally relevant differences that justify different treatment. This aligns with her emphasis on considering particular relationships and contexts.\n\nOption A is too rigid, as it doesn't allow for any exceptions based on personal relationships or other morally relevant factors.\n\nOption C seems too restrictive, as it suggests that moral rules only apply to some members of a group, which might not accurately reflect Baier's view that moral considerations extend beyond immediate groups but with varying degrees of strength.\n\nOption D is about the universality of moral rules across societies, which is a different issue from how moral rules are applied within a society. Baier's focus seems more on the internal application within a moral community rather than cross-cultural universality.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: moral rules must be applied to everyone alike in the absence of morally relevant differences.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
