                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Rolando has a bunch of soup cans in his cupboard, and among them, half are tomato soup and two-fifths are chicken noodle soup. We need to find out what fraction of the total cans are either tomato or chicken noodle.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have two types of soup: tomato and chicken noodle. The fractions given are 1/2 for tomato and 2/5 for chicken noodle. We need to find the combined fraction of these two types.\n\nSince these are parts of the whole, and they are different types, I can add their fractions together to get the total fraction that is either tomato or chicken noodle. But before I do that, I need to make sure that the fractions have the same denominator so that addition is straightforward.\n\nThe denominators here are 2 and 5. The least common denominator (LCD) for 2 and 5 is 10. So, I'll convert both fractions to have a denominator of 10.\n\nStarting with 1/2:\n\n1/2 = (1*5)/(2*5) = 5/10\n\nAnd 2/5:\n\n2/5 = (2*2)/(5*2) = 4/10\n\nNow, I can add these two fractions together:\n\n5/10 + 4/10 = 9/10\n\nSo, 9/10 of the cans are either tomato or chicken noodle soup.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using decimals would help confirm the answer.\n\nConverting 1/2 to a decimal:\n\n1/2 = 0.5\n\nAnd 2/5:\n\n2/5 = 0.4\n\nAdding them together:\n\n0.5 + 0.4 = 0.9\n\nConverting 0.9 back to a fraction:\n\n0.9 = 9/10\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result. So, 9/10 seems to be correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of cans. Let's assume Rolando has 10 cans in total, since 10 is a common multiple of 2 and 5.\n\nIf he has 10 cans:\n\nTomato soup: 1/2 of 10 = 5 cans\n\nChicken noodle soup: 2/5 of 10 = 4 cans\n\nTotal cans that are either tomato or chicken noodle: 5 + 4 = 9 cans\n\nSo, 9 out of 10 cans are either tomato or chicken noodle, which is 9/10.\n\nThis confirms my previous calculations.\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices:\n\nA. 7-Mar\n\nB. 5-Mar\n\nC. 10-Jul\n\nD. 10-Sep\n\nHmm, these don't look like fraction answers. It seems there might be a mistake in the answer choices provided. Perhaps there's a typo, and they intended to list fractions like 7/10, 5/10, 10/7, and 10/9, but instead wrote them as dates.\n\nGiven that, let's see which of these might correspond to 9/10.\n\nOption A: 7-Mar could represent 7/10\n\nOption B: 5-Mar could represent 5/10\n\nOption C: 10-Jul could represent 10/7\n\nOption D: 10-Sep could represent 10/9\n\nNone of these directly match 9/10, but perhaps there's a misinterpretation here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer choices are supposed to be numerical values, and \"Mar\" stands for something else. Without clear answer choices that match the expected fraction, it's a bit confusing.\n\nHowever, based on my calculations, the correct fraction should be 9/10. If I had to choose from the given options, none directly match, but if I had to pick the closest, perhaps Option A: 7-Mar, if it's intended to be 7/10, but that's not correct based on my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is not among the choices, or there's a mistake in the question or answer choices provided.\n\nIn any case, based on the problem and my step-by-step reasoning, the fraction of cans that are either tomato or chicken noodle is 9/10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{10}} \\]"
