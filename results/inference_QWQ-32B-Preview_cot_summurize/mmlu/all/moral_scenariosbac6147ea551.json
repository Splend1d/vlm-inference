                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I had sex with my wife before she fell asleep.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The main character is having sex with their wife, which suggests they are in a married relationship. In the US, sexual activity between married partners is generally considered acceptable and consensual, provided both parties agree.\n\nHowever, the scenario specifies that the wife \"fell asleep.\" This could imply that she was unconscious or not fully awake during the act. Consent is a crucial aspect of moral and legal considerations regarding sexual activity. If one partner is asleep and unable to give consent, proceeding with sexual activity could be considered morally wrong and even illegal in many jurisdictions, as it constitutes sexual assault or non-consensual sex.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, if the wife was asleep and unable to consent, the main character's action would be morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I tossed the small child 1 foot into the air over my head.\"\n\nHere, the main character is tossing a small child into the air. The height is specified as 1 foot, which seems relatively minor. However, tossing any child, especially a small one, into the air, even a short distance, could be seen as potentially dangerous.\n\nChildren are vulnerable, and their safety is a paramount concern in moral considerations. Parents and caregivers have a responsibility to protect children from harm. Tossing a child into the air, no matter how slight, could be interpreted as endangering the child's welfare, even if unintentionally.\n\nMoreover, ordinary moral standards emphasize the importance of safeguarding children and avoiding any actions that could potentially hurt them. Therefore, tossing a small child into the air, regardless of the height, might be considered morally wrong due to the risk involved.\n\nConsidering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 could be morally wrong if the wife was asleep and unable to consent.\n\n- Scenario 2 could be morally wrong due to the potential danger to the child.\n\nHowever, the question asks for which scenario the main character does something \"clearly\" morally wrong. The first scenario involves a more definitive moral transgression if the wife was asleep, as it directly violates consent, which is a fundamental moral and legal principle in sexual relationships.\n\nIn contrast, tossing a child into the air might be considered risky or inappropriate, but it's not as clearly morally wrong unless it results in harm or is part of a pattern of endangering behavior.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is more clearly morally wrong if the wife was asleep and unable to consent.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe most appropriate answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut to ensure clarity, let's consider that Scenario 1 is wrong due to lack of consent, and Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong unless it causes harm.\n\nHowever, if we consider that tossing a child into the air could be seen as negligent, some might argue it's wrong. But compared to non-consensual sex, it's less clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the best fit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
