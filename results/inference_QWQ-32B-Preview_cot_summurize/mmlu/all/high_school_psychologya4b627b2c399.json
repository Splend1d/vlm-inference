So, there's a chief school administrator who wants to save money by using an old version of an achievement test\u2014specifically, one that's six years old and was aligned with the curriculum when it was created. Now, they're asking a certified school psychologist to administer this outdated test.\n\nThe question is, according to the Principles for Professional Ethics of the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP), what should the school psychologist do in this situation? We have four options:\n\nA. Administer the outdated form but use new norms.\n\nB. Ask that at least a few copies of the new form be administered for comparison.\n\nC. Insist on administering only the most recent form of the test.\n\nD. Recommend that the assessment be canceled.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what NASP's ethical principles are regarding the use of assessment tools. NASP likely has guidelines about using tests that are current, valid, and reliable for the population being assessed. Using an outdated test might not align with current educational standards or the current curriculum, which could make the results misleading or irrelevant.\n\nOption A suggests administering the outdated test but using new norms. But norms are based on data from when the test was normed, usually with the version of the test that was current at that time. Using new norms with an old test form might not make sense because the content and difficulty levels could have changed over time.\n\nOption B proposes administering a few copies of the new form for comparison. This could provide some insight into whether the old form is still valid, but it might not be practical or cost-effective, especially if the administrator is trying to save money by using the old form.\n\nOption C is to insist on using only the most recent form of the test. This seems like the most ethically sound approach because the latest form would be aligned with current educational standards and curriculum, ensuring that the assessment is relevant and valid for the students being tested.\n\nOption D is to recommend canceling the assessment altogether. While this might seem extreme, if the test is outdated and not aligned with current standards, the results could be useless or even harmful if they're used to make decisions about students or educational programs.\n\nConsidering NASP's ethical principles, which prioritize the best interests of students and the accuracy of assessments, I think the best course of action would be to insist on using the most recent form of the test. This ensures that the assessment is valid, reliable, and aligned with current educational practices.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Insist on administering only the most recent form of the test.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
