Langar.\n\nTo provide some context, Langar is a free meal served in the Guru's kitchen, which is an integral part of the Gurdwara, the Sikh place of worship. It is open to people of all religions, castes, and genders, emphasizing the principles of equality and community service that are central to Sikh teachings. The term \"Sangat\" refers to the congregation or community of Sikhs, \"Gurdwara\" is the name for the Sikh place of worship, and \"Panth\" refers to the entire Sikh community or the Sikh nation."
