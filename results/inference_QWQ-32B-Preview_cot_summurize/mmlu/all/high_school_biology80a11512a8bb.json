                    "text": "I think I know this one. So, there's this population of giraffes, and something in their environment changes in a way that being taller becomes really advantageous. Maybe the trees they eat from grew taller or something like that. So, the taller giraffes can reach the leaves better, get more to eat, and therefore, they're more likely to survive and have offspring.\n\nNow, the question is asking what kind of selection this is. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Directional selection.\n\nB. Stabilizing selection.\n\nC. Sexual selection.\n\nD. Disruptive selection.\n\nOkay, so directional selection is when there's a consistent advantage to one extreme of a trait. So, in this case, being taller is better, so over time, you'd expect the average height of the giraffes to increase because the taller ones are passing on their genes more.\n\nStabilizing selection, on the other hand, is when the average trait is favored, and extremes are selected against. So, if being medium-height was best for giraffes, and too tall or too short was bad, that would be stabilizing selection. But that's not what's happening here.\n\nSexual selection is when certain traits help an individual attract mates or compete for them. So, maybe taller giraffes are more attractive to females or can fight off other males better. But in this scenario, it's specifically about getting more nutrients and surviving, not about mating advantages.\n\nDisruptive selection is when both extremes of a trait are favored over the average. So, both very tall and very short giraffes do well, but medium-height ones don't. That doesn't seem to be the case here either.\n\nSo, going back to directional selection, it seems to fit because the environment is favoring one extreme of the trait\u2014taller giraffes\u2014are better off and can pass on their genes more successfully.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it another way. If being taller is advantageous for accessing food, then over generations, you'd expect the giraffe population to become taller overall as the genes for height become more common in the gene pool.\n\nAlso, I recall that directional selection can lead to a shift in the average phenotype of a population in one direction. So, in this case, the average height should increase over time.\n\nIn contrast, stabilizing selection would keep the population around a certain optimal trait value, rejecting variations that are too high or too low.\n\nSexual selection is more about reproductive success, not necessarily survival.\n\nAnd disruptive selection would lead to a bimodal distribution, with individuals at both extremes doing well.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is A, directional selection.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there could be other types of selection happening here as well. For example, could there be sexual selection involved if taller giraffes are also more attractive mates? Maybe, but the question specifically mentions that the environmental change favors taller individuals for obtaining nutrients and surviving, not for mating advantages. So, while sexual selection might be present, it's not the primary force described in this scenario.\n\nSimilarly, maybe in the long run, if everyone becomes taller, there could be disadvantages, but the question is focusing on the initial change where taller is better for survival.\n\nTherefore, I believe directional selection is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
