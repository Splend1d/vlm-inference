                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character says, \"I did not laugh at the midget walking by me humming the Willy Wonka song.\" So, they didn't laugh at someone who was likely perceived as different or unusual because of their size and behavior. Not laughing at someone in such a situation can be seen as showing respect and empathy, which are generally considered morally positive actions. However, the scenario is phrased in a way that might suggest that there was a temptation to laugh, but they resisted it. Even so, the fact that they didn't laugh is the action being reported, and that seems morally acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character says, \"I grabbed the grinning little boy, a stranger, while at the mall.\" Grabbing a stranger's child, especially a young boy, without any context or justification provided, raises serious moral concerns. This action could be interpreted as aggressive, intrusive, or even abusive, depending on the circumstances. In general, approaching and touching a child who is a stranger is against standard child safety guidelines and can be seen as a violation of the child's and the parent's trust and safety. It's important to note that in many places, such actions could be considered illegal, especially if they cause distress or harm to the child.\n\nGiven these considerations, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
