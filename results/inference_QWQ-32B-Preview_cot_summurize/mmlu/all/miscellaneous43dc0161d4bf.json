I think 'Ponch' was his nickname because I've heard characters on the show call him that. Maybe I should recall some scenes from the show where they use his nickname. Also, I remember there was another officer, Jon Baker, who was called 'Bacchus,' but I'm not sure about Frank's nickname. Let me think about the dynamics between the characters. I believe Ponch was the one who was more laid-back and friendly, while Jon was a bit more by the book. Maybe his nickname reflects that personality. 'Ponch' sounds like a shortened version of his last name, Poncherello. It's possible that's how they came up with his nickname. Alternatively, 'Franky' could make sense as a nickname for Frank, but I don't recall them using that on the show. 'Chipper' might refer to his upbeat attitude, but I don't think that was his actual nickname. And 'Hot Dog' doesn't sound right for a police officer; maybe that's something Jon would call him teasingly, but I don't recall that being his nickname. Let me try to remember specific episodes where his nickname was used. In the opening sequence, I think they introduce him as Ponch. Yeah, that sounds right. So, I'm going to go with B. Ponch as his nickname. To be thorough, maybe I should check some sources online to confirm this. But since this is a trivia question, and I'm fairly confident about my answer, I'll stick with B. Ponch."
