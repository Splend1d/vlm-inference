                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about a layer of sandstone just above a layer of shale in bedrock, and I need to figure out which sequence of events makes sense. There are four options: A, B, C, and D. I'll go through each one and see which one aligns with how these rock layers could form.\n\nOption A says: \"A volcano erupted, sending lava out over a layer of shale. The lava cooled and hardened into sandstone.\"\n\nHmm, volcanoes do erupt and deposit lava, which can cool and form igneous rocks like basalt, but sandstone is a sedimentary rock made from sand-sized particles that are cemented together. So, lava cooling into sandstone doesn't sound right. Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like this isn't the correct sequence.\n\nOption B: \"The water level of a large lake lowered. A beach then formed where previously there had been lake bottom.\"\n\nThis one sounds interesting. If the water level of a lake lowers, the area that was previously underwater would be exposed, and a beach could form. Beaches are made of sand, which could eventually turn into sandstone over time through lithification. Meanwhile, the layer below, which was the lake bottom, could have fine sediments that turn into shale. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C: \"One-celled organisms developed a colony on the seafloor. Shells made by these organisms accumulated and lithified, forming the sandstone.\"\n\nThis option talks about microorganisms forming a colony and their shells accumulating to form sandstone. While it's true that biological activity can contribute to sediment formation, sandstone typically forms from quartz sand grains, not necessarily from shells of one-celled organisms. Also, shale can form from fine sediments in marine environments, so this could be possible, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit.\n\nOption D: \"Mud was deposited and lithified. Subsequent contact metamorphism resulted in localized recrystallization of the shale into sandstone.\"\n\nThis one is a bit confusing. Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock that forms from compacted clay or mud. If there's contact metamorphism, which is when heat from a nearby igneous intrusion changes the mineral composition of surrounding rocks, shale could be metamorphosed into slate, which is a metamorphic rock. But sandstone is a sedimentary rock, not a metamorphic one. So, it doesn't make sense that shale would turn into sandstone through metamorphism.\n\nConsidering all these options, option B seems the most logical. A lowering of the water level in a large lake exposing the lake bottom, which could turn into shale, and then a beach forming on top, which could turn into sandstone. This sequence aligns with the typical processes of sediment deposition and lithification in a changing water environment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
