                    "text": "So I've got this equation: (x - p)(x - q) = (r - p)(r - q), and I know that one solution is x = r. That makes sense because if you plug in x = r, both sides become the same. But there should be another solution, and I need to find that in terms of p, q, and r. The options are A) pqr, B) pq - r, C) p - q - r, and D) p + q - r.\n\nFirst, I think I should expand both sides to see what's going on. Let's expand the left side: (x - p)(x - q) = x^2 - qx - px + pq = x^2 - (p + q)x + pq.\n\nNow, the right side: (r - p)(r - q) = r^2 - qr - pr + pq.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx^2 - (p + q)x + pq = r^2 - qr - pr + pq.\n\nI can subtract pq from both sides to simplify:\n\nx^2 - (p + q)x = r^2 - qr - pr.\n\nHmm, maybe I should bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\nx^2 - (p + q)x - r^2 + qr + pr = 0.\n\nThis looks a bit messy. Is there a better way to approach this?\n\nWait a minute, I recall that if I have an equation like (x - p)(x - q) = (r - p)(r - q), and one solution is x = r, then maybe I can think of it as (x - r) being a factor.\n\nLet me try to rearrange the equation:\n\n(x - p)(x - q) - (r - p)(r - q) = 0.\n\nNow, this looks like a difference of products. Maybe I can factor this somehow.\n\nLet me denote a = x - r. Then x = a + r.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n(a + r - p)(a + r - q) - (r - p)(r - q) = 0.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n(a + (r - p))(a + (r - q)) - (r - p)(r - q) = a^2 + a(r - q) + a(r - p) + (r - p)(r - q) - (r - p)(r - q) = a^2 + a(2r - p - q) = 0.\n\nSo, a^2 + a(2r - p - q) = 0.\n\nFactor out a:\n\na(a + 2r - p - q) = 0.\n\nSo, a = 0 or a = - (2r - p - q).\n\nBut a = x - r, so:\n\nx - r = 0 => x = r (which we already know),\n\nor\n\nx - r = - (2r - p - q) => x = r - 2r + p + q = -r + p + q.\n\nSo, x = p + q - r.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option D.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to see this.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a quadratic equation, and one root is x = r, perhaps I can use the sum and product of roots.\n\nFirst, let's write the equation in standard quadratic form.\n\nWe have (x - p)(x - q) = (r - p)(r - q).\n\nExpanding left side: x^2 - (p + q)x + pq.\n\nRight side: (r - p)(r - q) = r^2 - qr - pr + pq.\n\nSo, x^2 - (p + q)x + pq - (r^2 - qr - pr + pq) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^2 - (p + q)x - r^2 + qr + pr = 0.\n\nWait, pq cancels out.\n\nNow, in a quadratic equation x^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b, and the product is c.\n\nHere, sum of roots is p + q, and product is -r^2 + qr + pr.\n\nBut I know one root is r, let the other be s.\n\nThen, r + s = p + q,\n\nand r * s = -r^2 + qr + pr.\n\nFrom r + s = p + q, we get s = p + q - r.\n\nWhich matches what I found earlier.\n\nAnd looking at the product of roots:\n\nr * s = -r^2 + qr + pr.\n\nSubstituting s = p + q - r:\n\nr(p + q - r) = -r^2 + qr + pr.\n\nLet's expand the left side:\n\nr p + r q - r^2 = -r^2 + q r + p r.\n\nYes, it matches.\n\nSo, the other solution is indeed p + q - r.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. p + q - r.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{p + q - r} \\]"
