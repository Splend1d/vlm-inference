                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about what should be included in a practitioner's report on the application of agreed-upon procedures. So, first things first, we need to understand what agreed-upon procedures (AUP) engagement is. In an AUP engagement, a practitioner is engaged to perform specific procedures on a subject matter, and the users of the report agree on what those procedures will be. It's different from an audit or a review because the practitioner isn't providing an opinion or assurance; they're just reporting on the procedures they performed and the facts discovered.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. A statement that the practitioner performed an examination of prospective financial statements.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit off. Prospective financial statements are future-oriented, like forecasts or projections. In an AUP engagement, the procedures can be applied to various types of information, not just prospective financial statements. So, this seems too specific and maybe not necessarily relevant to all AUP engagements.\n\nB. A statement of scope limitation that will qualify the practitioner\u2019s opinion.\n\nWait a minute, in an AUP engagement, the practitioner doesn't provide an opinion. That's a key difference from audit or review engagements. So, if there's no opinion, there's nothing to qualify. Therefore, this option doesn't make sense in the context of an AUP report.\n\nC. A statement referring to standards established by the AICPA.\n\nThis seems promising. The AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) has standards and guidelines for AUP engagements. It's important for the report to refer to these standards to ensure that the procedures were performed in accordance with professional standards. This would provide credibility to the report and inform the users about the nature of the engagement.\n\nD. A statement of negative assurance based on procedures performed.\n\nNegative assurance is a term used in review engagements, where the practitioner expresses limited assurance that nothing has come to their attention to indicate that the financial statements are not presented fairly in all material respects. However, in an AUP engagement, the practitioner doesn't provide any assurance, positive or negative. They simply report on the procedures performed and the facts found. So, this option doesn't align with the nature of an AUP report.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C seems to be the most appropriate. The report should refer to the standards established by the AICPA to ensure that it complies with professional guidelines and to inform the users about the standards followed in performing the procedures.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's more to it. Maybe there are other elements that should be included in an AUP report. According to the AICPA's Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE), an AUP report should include:\n\n1. A title that includes the term \"Agreed-Upon Procedures.\"\n\n2. Identification of the entity and the subject matter.\n\n3. A statement that the report is only for the parties that agreed to the procedures and is not intended for use by any other parties.\n\n4. A description of the procedures performed.\n\n5. The results of the procedures.\n\n6. A statement that the report does not provide assurance.\n\n7. Reference to the standards followed, which would be the AICPA standards for AUP engagements.\n\nSo, referring back to the options, option C aligns with point 7 above. Therefore, it's indeed a necessary component of the report.\n\nOption D is close because it mentions procedures performed, but as we saw, it refers to negative assurance, which is not provided in an AUP engagement.\n\nOption A is too narrow, as AUP engagements can cover various types of information, not just prospective financial statements.\n\nOption B is misplaced because there's no opinion to qualify in an AUP report.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C: A statement referring to standards established by the AICPA.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nc. a statement referring to standards established by the AICPA."
