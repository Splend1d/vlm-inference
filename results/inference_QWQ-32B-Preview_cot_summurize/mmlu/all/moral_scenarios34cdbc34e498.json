The scenarios are:\n\n1. I told a lie when questioned under oath.\n\n2. I knowingly rented out a fantastic apartment building at better than market rates.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if it's morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: telling a lie when questioned under oath.\n\nBeing under oath usually happens in court or in legal proceedings, where people swear to tell the truth. Lying under oath is not only morally wrong but also illegal; it's called perjury. In the US, perjury is a serious offense because it undermines the justice system. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this is clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: knowingly renting out a fantastic apartment building at better than market rates.\n\nThis seems like charging higher rent for a really nice apartment. Is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, in a free market economy like the US, setting prices based on supply and demand is generally accepted. If the apartment is indeed fantastic and in high demand, charging a higher rent might be just reflecting its value. As long as it's not price gouging in a crisis or taking advantage of people's desperation, it's probably not considered morally wrong.\n\nSome might argue that charging higher rates is exploitation, but in general, if the apartment is superior and the rent is commensurate with its quality, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\n- Scenario 1: Clearly wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Not clearly wrong\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any argument that Scenario 2 could be morally wrong?\n\nWell, if the landlord knows the apartment is fantastic but is charging way above what it's worth, that might be seen as unfair. However, in a competitive market, prices are determined by what people are willing to pay.\n\nAlso, if the landlord is providing a high-quality apartment and maintaining it well, then charging a higher rent could be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, lying under oath is always wrong because it's deceitful and undermines the legal system.\n\nSo, yes, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
