It contains the observed values of the dependent variable for each observation. If there are \\( T \\) observations, then \\( y \\) is a \\( T \\times 1 \\) vector.\n\n2. **\\( X \\)**: This is the design matrix, which includes the independent variables and typically a constant term. If there are \\( k \\) independent variables (including the constant), and \\( T \\) observations, then \\( X \\) is a \\( T \\times k \\) matrix.\n\n3. **\\( \\beta \\)**: This is the vector of regression coefficients. There are \\( k \\) coefficients corresponding to the \\( k \\) independent variables. Therefore, \\( \\beta \\) is a \\( k \\times 1 \\) vector.\n\n4. **\\( u \\)**: This is the error vector, representing the difference between the observed dependent variable and the predicted values from the model. It has the same number of elements as \\( y \\), which is \\( T \\).\n\nGiven this setup, the dimensions must align properly for the matrix operations to be valid.\n\nSpecifically, the product \\( X\\beta \\) must result in a vector with the same dimensions as \\( y \\). Since \\( X \\) is \\( T \\times k \\) and \\( \\beta \\) is \\( k \\times 1 \\), their product \\( X\\beta \\) is indeed \\( T \\times 1 \\), matching the dimensions of \\( y \\).\n\nSimilarly, the error term \\( u \\) must also be \\( T \\times 1 \\) to allow the addition \\( X\\beta + u \\) to make sense.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of \\( u \\) are \\( T \\times 1 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. \\( T \\times k \\)\n\nB. \\( T \\times 1 \\)\n\nC. \\( k \\times 1 \\)\n\nD. \\( 1 \\times 1 \\)\n\nThe correct choice is B. \\( T \\times 1 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
