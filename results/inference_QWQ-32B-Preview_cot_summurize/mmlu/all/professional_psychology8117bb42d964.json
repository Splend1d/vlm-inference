So, ethical obligations are guidelines about what's right and wrong in professional behavior, while legal requirements are laws that must be followed. When these two don't agree, it can be tricky.\n\nOption A says to always choose ethical obligations. But sometimes, laws are in place for a reason, and breaking them could have serious consequences.\n\nOption B suggests following legal requirements no matter what. But ethics are important too; ignoring ethics could harm clients or others.\n\nOption C is about trying to resolve the conflict but falling back on legal requirements if you can't find another way. This seems balanced because it acknowledges both ethics and the law, prioritizing the law when there's no other option.\n\nOption D is similar but prioritizes ethical obligations when the conflict can't be resolved. This might put the psychologist at legal risk.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to find a way that satisfies both ethics and law. If that's not possible, perhaps prioritizing one over the other depending on the situation. But in general, legal requirements are mandatory, and breaking the law can have severe consequences, including losing your license or facing criminal charges.\n\nSo, option C seems reasonable because it tries to reconcile both but defaults to legal requirements when necessary. Ethics are important, but psychologists also have to operate within the law.\n\nBut maybe there's more to consider. Perhaps there are situations where ethical obligations are so paramount that they should be followed even if it means breaking the law. For example, if a law is unjust or if following it would cause harm.\n\nHowever, in professional psychology, legality is crucial because psychologists have to maintain their professional standing and ensure they don't harm their clients or others.\n\nMaybe the answer is to consult with colleagues or ethics boards when such conflicts arise. But the question is asking about what should ordinarily be done.\n\nI think the key here is understanding that while ethics guide behavior, legal requirements are mandatory. So, attempting to resolve the conflict but adhering to legal requirements when it's not possible seems like the most appropriate course of action.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
