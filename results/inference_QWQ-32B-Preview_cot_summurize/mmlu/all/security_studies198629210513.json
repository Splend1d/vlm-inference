Let me explain why I think that.\n\nFirst, option A says that both Historical Materialism (HM) and realism are based on the notion that there exist within society certain discernable realities. I think this is true because realism in international relations focuses on objective realities like power balances and state interests, while HM looks at the material conditions and class relations as objective realities shaping history and society.\n\nOption B mentions that HM shares some aspects with realism, liberalism, and social constructivism but has a distinctive focus on class conflict within capitalism. This seems accurate because HM, as a Marxist framework, emphasizes class struggle as the driving force of historical development, which sets it apart from other theories.\n\nOption C states that while HM recognizes the state's importance, it also claims that states prioritize the interests of the ruling-class elite. This aligns with Marxist thought, which argues that the state is an instrument of the ruling class to maintain its power and interests.\n\nSo, since all three options seem correct, I think D, \"All of the above,\" is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
