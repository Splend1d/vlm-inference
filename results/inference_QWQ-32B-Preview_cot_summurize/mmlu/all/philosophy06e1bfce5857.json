                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question about Anscombe's views on moral philosophy. So, Anscombe is a philosopher, right? I think she's associated with some pretty heavy stuff in ethics and meta-ethics. The question is asking what she thinks needs to be in place before moral philosophy can be profitable\u2014that is, before it can be fruitful or useful in some way.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. religion.\n\nB. physics.\n\nC. psychology.\n\nD. art.\n\nHmm. Anscombe was a Christian philosopher, and she did write about ethics in a religious context. So, maybe religion is important to her framework. But I also remember that she was critical of certain aspects of traditional moral philosophy, especially those influenced by Kant and modern theories that she thought were flawed.\n\nLet me think about her work \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" which is pretty famous. In that paper, she argues that contemporary moral philosophy is flawed because it tries to\u5236\u5b9aa system of ethics without the theological framework that traditionally supported it, particularly the concept of divine law. So, perhaps she would say that an adequate philosophy of religion is necessary for moral philosophy to make sense.\n\nOn the other hand, she was also influenced by Aristotle, and Aristotelian ethics is heavily tied to psychology, understanding human nature and virtues. So, maybe psychology is also crucial.\n\nPhysics seems less relevant to moral philosophy, unless perhaps one is considering the nature of reality and how that impacts ethical decisions, but that seems more tangential.\n\nArt might influence ethics through aesthetics or the way we perceive beauty and goodness, but again, that seems less directly connected.\n\nGiven that, I think the most straightforward answer is religion, because of Anscombe's emphasis on the importance of divine law and the collapse of the Aristotelian concept of virtue in the modern world without a religious foundation.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Religion: Anscombe was critical of the secularization of moral philosophy and argued that the concept of obligation in modern ethics makes sense only in the context of divine law. So, an adequate philosophy of religion might be necessary to ground moral obligations.\n\nB. Physics: While understanding the natural world is important in many philosophical disciplines, it's not immediately clear how an adequate philosophy of physics is prerequisite for moral philosophy.\n\nC. Psychology: Given that ethics often deals with human behavior and decision-making, a understanding of psychology could be important. Anscombe's emphasis on intention and action in her work \"Intention\" suggests that she saw psychology as relevant to ethics.\n\nD. Art: While art can influence ethics and vice versa, it doesn't seem to be directly foundational in the way that religion or psychology might be.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is A. religion, because Anscombe's critique in \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" centers on the loss of the religious underpinnings of moral obligation in contemporary ethics.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that psychology also plays a significant role in her thought, particularly in relation to action theory and intention. So, perhaps both religion and psychology are important, but given the options and the specific context of the question, religion seems to be the primary focus of her concern in that essay.\n\nI should probably double-check this with some references, but based on my memory of Anscombe's work, I'm going with religion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
