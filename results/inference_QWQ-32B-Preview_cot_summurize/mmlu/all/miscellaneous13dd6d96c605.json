                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these college football programs has produced the most Heisman Trophy winners. The options are Notre Dame, USC, Oklahoma, and Michigan. I don't remember exactly how many each has, but I know all of them have a good history in football.\n\nFirst, I recall that Notre Dame has a rich tradition in college football and has produced several Heisman winners. Names like Tim Brown and Paul Hornung come to mind. I think Notre Dame has around five Heisman winners, but I'm not sure.\n\nUSC, the University of Southern California, is another powerhouse program. They have had great players like O.J. Simpson and Matt Leinart win the Heisman. I think USC also has around five Heismans, maybe more?\n\nOklahoma is a strong program as well, with a history of producing Heisman winners like Billy Vessels and Sam Bradford. I believe Oklahoma has around four Heismans, but I might be wrong.\n\nThen there's Michigan, which is one of the oldest programs in the country. I think they have at least one Heisman winner, but I'm not sure about the exact number.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up the number of Heisman winners for each school to be accurate. Let's see:\n\n- Notre Dame: I think they have five Heisman winners. Let me list them:\n\n1. Johnny Lujack (1947)\n\n2. Leon Hart (1955)\n\n3. Paul Hornung (1956)\n\n4. Alan Page (1967)\n\n5. Tim Brown (1987)\n\nSo that's five from Notre Dame.\n\n- USC: Let's see, I know O.J. Simpson won in 1968, and Matt Leinart in 2004. Are there others?\n\nActually, there's also Charles White in 1979 and Marcus Allen in 1981. So that's four from USC.\n\nWait, is there more? Let me check again.\n\n- O.J. Simpson (1968)\n\n- Charles White (1979)\n\n- Marcus Allen (1981)\n\n- Matt Leinart (2004)\n\nSo four from USC.\n\n- Oklahoma: Billy Vessels in 1963, Steve Owens in 1971, Billy Sims in 1978, and Sam Bradford in 2008. That's four from Oklahoma.\n\n- Michigan: Is there any Heisman winner from Michigan? I think Charles Woodson won in 1997. Is that the only one?\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\n- Charles Woodson (1997)\n\nI think that's the only Heisman winner from Michigan.\n\nSo, based on this, Notre Dame has five, while USC and Oklahoma have four each, and Michigan has one.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Notre Dame.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some Heisman winners from these schools. Let's double-check.\n\nStarting with Notre Dame:\n\n- 1947: Johnny Lujack\n\n- 1955: Leon Hart\n\n- 1956: Paul Hornung\n\n- 1967: Alan Page\n\n- 1987: Tim Brown\n\nThat's five, and I don't think there are more.\n\nUSC:\n\n- 1968: O.J. Simpson\n\n- 1979: Charles White\n\n- 1981: Marcus Allen\n\n- 2004: Matt Leinart\n\nFour in total.\n\nOklahoma:\n\n- 1963: Billy Vessels\n\n- 1971: Steve Owens\n\n- 1978: Billy Sims\n\n- 2008: Sam Bradford\n\nAlso four.\n\nMichigan:\n\n- 1997: Charles Woodson\n\nOnly one.\n\nSo, clearly, Notre Dame has the most with five Heisman Trophy winners.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there are more from these schools that I'm not remembering.\n\nLet me check if there are any other players from these schools who won the Heisman.\n\nFor Notre Dame, I can't think of anyone else besides those five.\n\nFor USC, again, the four I mentioned seem to be the only ones.\n\nOklahoma, same thing\u2014four Heisman winners.\n\nMichigan only has Charles Woodson.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Notre Dame with five Heisman Trophy winners.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
