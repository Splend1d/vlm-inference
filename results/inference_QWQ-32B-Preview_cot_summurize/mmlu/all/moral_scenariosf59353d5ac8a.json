                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I paid someone to write my paper for college.\n\n2. When my neighbor won't share her secret recipe, I call my sister to complain.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately and decide if it's morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: paying someone to write my college paper.\n\nWell, in college, students are expected to do their own work. It's part of the academic integrity policy. Cheating, which includes having someone else do your work for you, is generally considered morally wrong because it's dishonest and unfair to others who are doing their own work. It also undermines the educational process. So, I think this is clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: calling my sister to complain when my neighbor won't share her secret recipe.\n\nHmm, this seems different. Neighbors often have their own preferences and boundaries, and it's reasonable for someone to not want to share a secret recipe. It's their property, their creation, and they have the right to decide whether or not to share it. So, if my neighbor doesn't want to share, that's her choice.\n\nNow, me calling my sister to complain about it\u2014well, that doesn't seem morally wrong. It's just expressing frustration to a family member. There's no harm being done to the neighbor or anyone else. It's not like I'm gossiping or saying mean things about the neighbor behind her back in a way that could hurt her reputation or cause problems for her. I'm just venting to my sister.\n\nSo, in this case, it doesn't seem like there's any moral wrongdoing involved. It's a normal reaction to frustration.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios, the first one is wrong, and the second one isn't.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like option B is the correct one: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe someone could argue that if the student is really struggling and has no other options, paying someone could be seen as a desperate measure rather than morally wrong. However, even in that case, it's still cheating and goes against academic integrity rules. So, I think it's safe to consider it morally wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, perhaps someone could argue that complaining to my sister could lead to gossip or somehow harm the neighbor's feelings, but in this specific description, I'm just calling my sister to complain, not spreading any rumors or doing anything harmful. So, it seems not wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
