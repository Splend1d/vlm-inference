                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these is the earliest example of a complex society. So, I have Jericho in Israel, Caral in Peru, Stonehenge in England, and the Olmec along the Gulf Coast. I need to think about when each of these developed and what makes a society \"complex.\"\n\nFirst, what defines a complex society? I think it usually involves things like a hierarchical structure, specialized labor, monumental architecture, and possibly some form of record-keeping or writing. So, I need to look at each of these options and see which one shows these characteristics earliest in time.\n\nStarting with Jericho in Israel. I know that Jericho is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. There are archaeological sites there that date back to around 10,000 BCE. That's pretty early. And there are some pretty impressive structures there, like the stone walls and towers, which suggest some level of organization and hierarchy. So, that sounds pretty complex.\n\nNext, Caral in Peru. Caral is an ancient city in the Supe Valley, near Lima. It's one of the oldest cities in the Americas and dates back to around 3,000 BCE. Caral has several pyramids and monumental architecture, which indicates a complex society with organized labor and possibly a ruling class.\n\nThen, Stonehenge in England. Stonehenge is a famous prehistoric monument consisting of a circle of large stones. It was built in several stages, with the earliest constructions dating back to around 3,000 BCE. While it's an incredible feat of engineering, I'm not sure if it alone indicates a complex society. Maybe the society that built it was complex, but I need to look into that more.\n\nLastly, the Olmec along the Gulf Coast. The Olmec civilization flourished in ancient Mexico around 1,200 BCE to about 400 BCE. They are known for their colossal stone heads and their influence on later Mesoamerican cultures. So, compared to the others, this seems relatively late.\n\nNow, comparing the dates:\n\n- Jericho: around 10,000 BCE\n\n- Caral: around 3,000 BCE\n\n- Stonehenge: around 3,000 BCE\n\n- Olmec: around 1,200 BCE\n\nSo, Jericho is the earliest in terms of settlement, but was it a complex society? Caral and Stonehenge are around the same time, and Olmec is much later.\n\nBut I need to make sure that Jericho indeed had characteristics of a complex society. I recall that Jericho had defensive walls and towers as early as 8,000 BCE, which suggests some form of organization and possibly a ruling class to organize the construction and maintenance of such structures.\n\nCaral, on the other hand, has pyramids and other monumental architecture, which also indicates a complex society. Stonehenge has the massive stones arranged in a precise manner, which would require a significant amount of labor and organization.\n\nHowever, in terms of overall social complexity, including aspects like trade, religion, and social stratification, Jericho might have an edge due to its longer history and continuous occupation.\n\nI should also consider that the development of complex societies might have occurred independently in different parts of the world at various times. So, while Jericho might be the earliest known example, there could be others that predate it or developed around the same time.\n\nPerhaps I should look up some more information to confirm the dates and the level of social complexity in each of these societies.\n\nFirst, checking Jericho:\n\nJericho is located in the West Bank, near the Jordan River. Archaeological evidence shows that it was inhabited as early as 10,000 BCE. Around 8,300 BCE, a settlement developed with mudbrick houses and a sophisticated water system. The walls and towers suggest some form of centralized authority for defense and organization.\n\nNext, Caral:\n\nCaral is in the Supe Valley of Peru and dates back to around 3,000 BCE. It's considered the oldest city in the Americas. The city has six large pyramidal structures, solar observatories, and evidence of complex societal functions.\n\nStonehenge:\n\nStonehenge was built in several phases, with the first constructions around 3,000 BCE. It's believed to have had religious or ceremonial purposes. The society that built it likely had some level of organization, but the overall complexity of the society is harder to ascertain from the monument alone.\n\nOlmec:\n\nThe Olmec civilization emerged much later, around 1,200 BCE, in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico. They are known for their colossal stone heads and their influence on subsequent Mesoamerican cultures.\n\nGiven this information, Jericho seems to be the earliest example of a complex society among the options provided. Its long history of continuous occupation, early development of urban features like walls and towers, and evidence of social organization suggest that it was indeed a complex society at a very early date.\n\nCaral and Stonehenge are both from around 3,000 BCE, which is significantly later than the early settlement at Jericho. While they are both impressive examples of early complex societies in their respective regions, they are not as early as Jericho.\n\nThe Olmec civilization is even later, emerging around 1,200 BCE.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Jericho in Israel.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any other sites that might predate Jericho and represent even earlier complex societies. For example, I've heard of the Neolithic site of G\u00f6bekli Tepe in Turkey, which dates back to around 9,000 BCE. It has massive stone pillars with carvings, suggesting some form of religious or ceremonial complex. This might indicate a level of social organization preceding Jericho.\n\nBut since G\u00f6bekli Tepe is not one of the options, I should stick with the choices given.\n\nAnother consideration is that the development of complex societies might have varied across different regions, and some areas might have developed complexity independently and at different times.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the options provided and the available information, Jericho in Israel is the earliest example of a complex society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
