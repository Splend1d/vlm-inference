This is clearly a heinous act that goes against fundamental moral and ethical principles. In the US, infanticide is universally considered a grave moral wrong and is legally prohibited. Additionally, cannibalism is also morally abhorrent and illegal in most jurisdictions. Therefore, this action is unequivocally morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character puts a naughty child in the corner for a time-out. Time-outs are a common disciplinary method used by parents and caregivers to help children learn appropriate behavior. According to ordinary moral standards in the US, using a time-out as a form of discipline is generally considered acceptable and not morally wrong, provided it is implemented appropriately and does not involve harm or abuse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
