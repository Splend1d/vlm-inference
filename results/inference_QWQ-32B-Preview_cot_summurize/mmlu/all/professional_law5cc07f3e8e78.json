                    "text": "I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the equity court is likely to grant specific performance for the buyer who wants to exercise an option to buy property. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a seller who listed the property for $500,000, and the lease was set to expire on August 1. The lessee, who had made substantial improvements, wanted to buy at the full list price but needed more time. So, he paid $10,000 for an option to buy the property on or before September 1.\n\nNow, the option states that notices required under it \"shall be deemed given if given in writing and delivered personally, delivered by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the party to receive the notice.\" And the notice was required by September 1.\n\nWhat happened is:\n\n- On August 25, the buyer called the seller and told her that he was exercising the option. But the seller didn't remember the exact words used.\n\n- On August 29, the buyer sent a written intent to exercise the option by first-class mail.\n\n- The seller testified that she didn't receive the written notice until September 3.\n\n- On September 10, the seller notified the buyer that the option had expired and the deal was off.\n\n- The buyer filed for specific performance to compel the transaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the equity court is likely to grant specific performance.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because time is not of the essence in option contracts, and options are liberally enforced to prevent the loss of the benefit of the bargain.\n\nB. Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the notice requirement didn't absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.\n\nC. No, because the seller would be prejudiced by having to sell after the option date.\n\nD. No, because option contracts are strictly enforced, and even a one-day delay cannot be allowed for commercial predictability.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what specific performance is. Specific performance is an equitable remedy that requires a party to perform their contractual obligations as specified. It's usually granted when monetary damages aren't adequate, which is often the case with unique properties.\n\nIn this scenario, the buyer is seeking specific performance to enforce the option contract.\n\nNow, option contracts are typically strictly construed because they give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a contract within a specified time frame. The timing is crucial because the option expires if not exercised within the agreed period.\n\nLet's look at the notice requirement. The option states that notices shall be deemed given if delivered personally, by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail with return receipt requested. The buyer sent the notice by first-class mail on August 29, which the seller received on September 3.\n\nThe option required the notice by September 1, but the seller didn't receive it until September 3.\n\nFirst, I need to determine when the notice was considered given according to the contract.\n\nThe contract says \"shall be deemed given if given in writing and delivered personally, delivered by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail return receipt requested.\"\n\nThe buyer sent it by first-class mail, which isn't one of the specified methods. So, did the notice meet the requirement?\n\nOption B suggests that the notice requirement didn't absolutely require one of the stated forms, but I'm not sure about that. The contract specifically lists the methods, so using first-class mail might not satisfy the requirement.\n\nAdditionally, there's the phone call on August 25, but the seller didn't remember the exact words used. Was the option exercised effectively through that call?\n\nIn contract law, for an option to be exercised, there usually needs to be a clear and unequivocal indication by the option holder that they are exercising the option.\n\nThe phone call might have been an attempt to exercise the option, but if the seller didn't clearly understand it as such, it might not be sufficient.\n\nNow, considering that the buyer sent a written notice by first-class mail on August 29, which arrived on September 3, after the September 1 deadline.\n\nSo, the question is whether the notice is effective when sent or when received.\n\nIn contract law, particularly for notices, the general rule is that a notice is effective when received. However, the contract might specify a different rule.\n\nHere, the option says \"shall be deemed given if given in writing and delivered personally, delivered by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail return receipt requested.\"\n\nFor certified mail, the notice is typically deemed given when sent, as long as it's properly addressed and mailed.\n\nBut first-class mail doesn't have the same presumption; it's generally effective upon receipt.\n\nSince the buyer used first-class mail, which isn't one of the specified methods, it might not meet the contract's requirement.\n\nAlternatively, if the contract is interpreted to require one of the specified methods for the notice to be deemed given, then using first-class mail might not satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the notice might not have been effectively given by September 1.\n\nNow, considering that the buyer called on August 25, but the seller didn't remember the exact words, it's unclear whether that constituted a valid exercise of the option.\n\nIn contract law, oral communications might not be sufficient if the contract requires a written notice.\n\nMoreover, options are typically strictly construed, meaning that the terms must be complied with precisely.\n\nOption D states that option contracts are strictly enforced, and even a one-day delay cannot be allowed for commercial predictability.\n\nThis seems consistent with the general approach to option contracts, where time is of the essence.\n\nHowever, equity courts can consider the intent and fairness in granting specific performance.\n\nIn this case, the buyer paid $10,000 for the option and wanted to exercise it, but used the wrong method of notice and sent it a few days before the deadline, which was received a couple of days late.\n\nThe seller didn't suffer any apparent prejudice; she just stuck to the contract terms.\n\nBut in equity, the court might consider that the buyer acted in good faith, attempted to exercise the option timely, and that denying specific performance might result in a hardship for the buyer, especially since he made substantial improvements to the property.\n\nOption B mentions that the delay was minimal, and the lessee would suffer hardship.\n\nOption A suggests that time is not of the essence in option contracts, but that seems contrary to the general principle that options have strict time requirements.\n\nOption C says no, because the seller would be prejudiced by having to sell after the option date. But it's not clear how the seller is prejudiced beyond just the timing.\n\nGiven that, I think the most balanced approach is option B: yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the notice requirement didn't absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.\n\nThe court might interpret the notice requirement as providing preferred methods but not exclusively mandatory ones, especially since the buyer attempted to give notice in writing before the deadline.\n\nTherefore, the equity court is likely to grant specific performance in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
