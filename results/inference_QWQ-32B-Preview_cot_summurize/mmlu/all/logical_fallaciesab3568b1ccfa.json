Appeal to ignorance\n\nD. Extension\n\nI think I need to recall what a complex question fallacy is first. It's when a question is asked in such a way that it presupposes something that hasn't been established yet. Like, \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" That question assumes that you were beating your wife in the first place, which might not be true.\n\nSo, another name for this fallacy might be something related to questioning or interrogation. Let's look at option A: Fallacy of interrogation. That seems plausible because it involves a question that's tricky or leading.\n\nOption B is compound proposition. I think a compound proposition is when you combine multiple propositions using logical connectives like \"and\" or \"or.\" That doesn't seem directly related to the complex question fallacy.\n\nOption C is appeal to ignorance. That's different; it's when someone argues that something must be true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. Not related to questioning.\n\nOption D is extension. I'm not sure what that means in this context. It doesn't sound related to questioning or fallacies.\n\nSo, between these options, A. Fallacy of interrogation seems like the most appropriate alternative name for the complex question fallacy. Maybe I should check if there's any other name for it.\n\nI recall that the complex question fallacy is also known as the loaded question fallacy because the question comes preloaded with assumptions. But that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's called the fallacy of presupposition because it presumes something that may not be true. But again, that's not in the list.\n\nGiven the options, I think A. Fallacy of interrogation is the best answer. Maybe \"interrogation\" here refers to the questioning method used in the fallacy.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if \"fallacy of interrogation\" is indeed another name for the complex question fallacy. I think it makes sense because complex question fallacies often involve tricky or leading questions, which are characteristic of interrogations.\n\nSo, I'll go with A. Fallacy of interrogation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
