                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two traveling waves that are superimposing in a single medium. Both waves have the same frequency, but different amplitudes: one is 4 cm and the other is 6 cm. I need to figure out what the displacement of the resultant wave would be.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens when two waves superimpose. Superposition is basically when two or more waves combine and the resultant displacement is the sum of the individual displacements at any point in time and space.\n\nSince both waves have the same frequency, their superposition will result in a wave that has the same frequency, but the amplitude will depend on the phase difference between the two waves.\n\nI remember that when two waves are in phase, meaning their crests and troughs align, they constructively interfere, and the resultant amplitude is the sum of the individual amplitudes. So, in this case, 4 cm + 6 cm = 10 cm.\n\nOn the other hand, if the waves are completely out of phase, meaning one is at crest while the other is at trough, they destructively interfere, and the resultant amplitude is the difference between the individual amplitudes. So, 6 cm - 4 cm = 2 cm.\n\nBut, in reality, the phase difference between the two waves can be anything between 0 and 2\u03c0 radians, which means the resultant amplitude can be anywhere between these two extremes: 2 cm and 10 cm.\n\nSo, the displacement D of the resultant wave can range from 2 cm to 10 cm, depending on the phase difference.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 2 cm \u2264 D \u2264 10 cm\n\nB. D = 5 cm\n\nC. D = 10 cm\n\nD. 10 cm \u2264 D \u2264 12 cm\n\nOption A seems to match what I've just reasoned. It says that D can be anywhere from 2 cm to 10 cm.\n\nOption B suggests a specific value of 5 cm, which is the average of 2 cm and 10 cm, but the displacement isn't necessarily always the average; it depends on the phase difference.\n\nOption C says D = 10 cm, which would only be true if the waves are completely in phase.\n\nOption D suggests D is between 10 cm and 12 cm, which seems higher than what I expect based on my earlier calculation.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility for D to be greater than 10 cm? Let's think about that.\n\nThe maximum amplitude is when the waves are in phase, adding up to 10 cm, and the minimum is when they are out of phase, resulting in 2 cm. But is there any scenario where the displacement could be greater than 10 cm?\n\nI don't think so, because amplitudes are positive values representing the maximum displacement from the rest position. So, the largest possible displacement would be when both waves are peaking at the same time, giving 10 cm.\n\nUnless... unless there's some phase difference that could cause a higher displacement, but I don't think that's possible with these amplitudes.\n\nMoreover, the problem is about displacement, not amplitude. Displacement can be instantaneous, whereas amplitude is the maximum displacement.\n\nBut in the context of wave superposition, when we talk about the 'displacement of the resultant wave,' I believe we're referring to the amplitude of the resultant wave.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the possible interference patterns more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the general formula for the resultant amplitude when two waves superimpose.\n\nIf we have two waves with amplitudes A and B, and a phase difference \u03c6 between them, the resultant amplitude D is given by:\n\nD = \u221a(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + 2AB cos\u03c6)\n\nIn this case, A = 4 cm, B = 6 cm.\n\nSo, D = \u221a(16 + 36 + 48 cos\u03c6) = \u221a(52 + 48 cos\u03c6)\n\nNow, cos\u03c6 ranges from -1 to 1.\n\nTherefore, the minimum D is when cos\u03c6 = -1:\n\nD_min = \u221a(52 - 48) = \u221a4 = 2 cm\n\nAnd the maximum D is when cos\u03c6 = 1:\n\nD_max = \u221a(52 + 48) = \u221a100 = 10 cm\n\nSo, D ranges from 2 cm to 10 cm, which confirms my initial thought.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: 2 cm \u2264 D \u2264 10 cm.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any possibility for D to exceed 10 cm.\n\nGiven the formula D = \u221a(52 + 48 cos\u03c6), and cos\u03c6 \u2264 1, the maximum D is indeed 10 cm.\n\nSo, options C and D are incorrect.\n\nOption B suggests D = 5 cm, which is within the range but doesn't account for the variation based on phase difference.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
