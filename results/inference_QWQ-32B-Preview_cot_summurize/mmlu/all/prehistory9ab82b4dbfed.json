                    "text": "Let's see what John Frere discovered in 1797. I remember that he was an English antiquarian and that his discovery was significant for understanding human prehistory. So, let's look at each option:\n\nOption A says \"animal remains scattered on the surface of the ground.\" While Frere might have come across animal remains, I think his discovery was more specific than that.\n\nOption B mentions \"the earliest written documents.\" That doesn't sound right because written documents would be from a much later period in human history, not necessarily related to his discovery.\n\nOption C is \"primitive stone tools excavated at great depth.\" I recall that Frere found stone tools along with animal bones, and he realized that these tools were made by humans who lived in prehistoric times. He even suggested that these tools were older than the Bronze Age.\n\nOption D says \"human skulls with ape-like features.\" That sounds more related to paleoanthropology and the study of human evolution, which came to prominence later with discoveries like Neanderthal skulls.\n\nGiven this, I think Option C is the correct answer. Frere discovered primitive stone tools that were buried deep in the ground, which indicated that they were very old. This was important because it provided evidence for the existence of humans in ancient times, before the Bronze Age.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should look up some information about John Frere's discovery. According to my knowledge, in 1797, John Frere wrote a letter to the Royal Society describing his findings of flint tools in Hoxne, Suffolk, England. These tools were found in a geological layer below deposits from the Bronze Age, suggesting that they were much older. Frere correctly inferred that these tools were made by humans who lived in a more ancient period, which he termed the \"Age of Flint.\"\n\nSo, indeed, he excavated primitive stone tools at a significant depth, which was a crucial discovery for recognizing the great antiquity of humans. Therefore, the correct answer is Option C: primitive stone tools excavated at great depth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
