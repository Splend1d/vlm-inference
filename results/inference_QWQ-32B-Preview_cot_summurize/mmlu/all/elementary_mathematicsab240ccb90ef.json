                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: write the ratio of 96 runners to 216 swimmers in its simplest form. The options are A) 96 over 216, B) 16 over 36, C) 4 over 9, and D) 9 over 4. I need to figure out which one is the simplest form of that ratio.\n\nFirst, I understand that a ratio compares two quantities. Here, it's comparing the number of runners to the number of swimmers, so it's 96 to 216. In fraction form, that's 96 over 216, which matches option A. But the question asks for the simplest form, so I need to reduce this fraction.\n\nTo simplify a fraction, I need to divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). So, I'll find the GCD of 96 and 216.\n\nLet's list the factors of each number:\n\nFactors of 96: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96.\n\nFactors of 216: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 27, 36, 54, 72, 108, 216.\n\nThe common factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. So, the greatest common factor is 24.\n\nNow, I'll divide both the numerator and the denominator by 24.\n\n96 \u00f7 24 = 4\n\n216 \u00f7 24 = 9\n\nSo, 96 over 216 simplifies to 4 over 9.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 4 over 9, which matches what I got.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check option B, 16 over 36, to see if it's simpler than 4 over 9.\n\nIf I simplify 16 over 36, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n16 \u00f7 4 = 4\n\n36 \u00f7 4 = 9\n\nSo, 16 over 36 simplifies to 4 over 9. That means option B is equivalent to option C, but 4 over 9 is already in its simplest form.\n\nOption D is 9 over 4, which is the reciprocal of 4 over 9. That doesn't match our simplified fraction.\n\nTherefore, the simplest form of the ratio 96 runners to 216 swimmers is 4 over 9, which is option C.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is about the ratio of runners to swimmers, which is 96 to 216, simplifying to 4 to 9. But option D is 9 over 4, which would be swimmers to runners. So, it's important to note the order.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if there's a way to simplify it further beyond 4 over 9. Let's see: the factors of 4 are 1, 2, 4, and the factors of 9 are 1, 3, 9. The only common factor is 1, so it's already in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I could have divided both numbers by 2 repeatedly.\n\n96 \u00f7 2 = 48\n\n216 \u00f7 2 = 108\n\n48 \u00f7 2 = 24\n\n108 \u00f7 2 = 54\n\n24 \u00f7 2 = 12\n\n54 \u00f7 2 = 27\n\n12 \u00f7 3 = 4\n\n27 \u00f7 3 = 9\n\nSo, again, 4 over 9.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to divide both numbers by 24 directly, as we did earlier.\n\nIn any case, the simplest form is 4 over 9.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C) 4 over 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
