                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a police car moving towards a wall, and the driver hears an echo of the siren. I need to find out what frequency the driver hears, and choose the closest value from the options given. The car is moving at 3.5 m/s, the speed of sound is 350 m/s, and the siren frequency is 600 Hz. The options are A. 588 Hz, B. 594 Hz, C. 600 Hz, or D. 612 Hz.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. The car is moving towards a wall, so the siren sound is moving towards the wall and then reflecting back to the car. The driver is both the source of the sound and the observer of the echo. This sounds like a Doppler effect problem, where frequencies change due to relative motion between the source and the observer.\n\nIn Doppler effect problems, the formula for the observed frequency depends on whether the source and the observer are moving towards or away from each other. The general formula is:\n\n\\[ f' = f \\left( \\frac{v \\pm v_o}{v \\mp v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( f' \\) is the observed frequency,\n\n- \\( f \\) is the emitted frequency,\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound,\n\n- \\( v_o \\) is the velocity of the observer (positive if moving towards the source),\n\n- \\( v_s \\) is the velocity of the source (positive if moving towards the observer).\n\nIn this case, since the car is moving towards the wall, both the source (siren) and the observer (driver) are moving towards the wall. But wait, in the echo scenario, the sound reflects off the wall, which we can consider as a stationary reflector.\n\nMaybe I need to think of this in two parts: first, the sound traveling from the car to the wall, and second, the sound reflecting back to the car.\n\nLet me consider the sound traveling from the car to the wall. The source is the siren on the car, which is moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s. The wall is stationary, so it's like the sound is moving towards a stationary observer (the wall). The frequency heard by the wall (if it could hear) would be:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{wall}} = f \\left( \\frac{v}{v - v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nWhere \\( v_s \\) is the speed of the source (car) towards the wall.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{wall}} = 600 \\left( \\frac{350}{350 - 3.5} \\right) = 600 \\left( \\frac{350}{346.5} \\right) \\approx 600 \\times 1.0098 \\approx 605.9 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nNow, the wall reflects this sound back towards the car. The reflected sound has the same frequency as what the wall \"heard,\" which is approximately 605.9 Hz.\n\nNow, this reflected sound is moving back towards the car, which is still moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s. So, now the observer is the car (driver), moving towards the source (reflected sound) at 3.5 m/s.\n\nSo, the observed frequency by the driver is:\n\n\\[ f' = f_{\\text{wall}} \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v} \\right) \\]\n\nSince the observer is moving towards the source, we add \\( v_o \\) in the numerator.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ f' = 605.9 \\left( \\frac{350 + 3.5}{350} \\right) = 605.9 \\left( \\frac{353.5}{350} \\right) \\approx 605.9 \\times 1.0099 \\approx 611.9 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nSo, the driver hears the echo at approximately 611.9 Hz, which is closest to option D, 612 Hz.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if there's a better way to approach this. Maybe there's a single formula for echo scenarios.\n\nI recall that for a moving source and observer, reflecting off a stationary surface, the total Doppler shift is the product of the individual shifts.\n\nSo, the formula for the observed frequency in such a case is:\n\n\\[ f' = f \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\left( \\frac{v}{v - v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. Let me look it up.\n\nActually, for an echo off a stationary surface, the formula is:\n\n\\[ f' = f \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nWhere \\( v_o \\) is the velocity of the observer towards the source, and \\( v_s \\) is the velocity of the source towards the observer.\n\nIn this case, since the car is both the source and the observer, and it's moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s, both \\( v_o \\) and \\( v_s \\) are 3.5 m/s.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ f' = 600 \\left( \\frac{350 + 3.5}{350 - 3.5} \\right)^2 = 600 \\left( \\frac{353.5}{346.5} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nCalculating inside the parentheses first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{353.5}{346.5} \\approx 1.0199 \\]\n\nThen squaring it:\n\n\\[ (1.0199)^2 \\approx 1.0402 \\]\n\nNow, multiplying by the original frequency:\n\n\\[ f' = 600 \\times 1.0402 \\approx 624.12 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier. 624 Hz is higher than any of the options. Maybe I'm applying the formula wrong.\n\nLet me double-check the formula for the echo scenario. I think I might have misremembered it.\n\nActually, the correct formula for the echo when both the source and observer are moving towards the reflector is:\n\n\\[ f' = f \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\left( \\frac{v}{v - v_r} \\right) \\]\n\nWhere \\( v_r \\) is the velocity of the reflector. But the wall is stationary, so \\( v_r = 0 \\).\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ f' = f \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\left( \\frac{v}{v} \\right) = f \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nWait, that seems similar to what I did in the first approach.\n\nIn the first part, the sound travels from the car to the wall, and the frequency heard by the wall is:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{wall}} = f \\left( \\frac{v}{v - v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nThen, the echo travels back to the car, which is moving towards the wall, so the observed frequency is:\n\n\\[ f' = f_{\\text{wall}} \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v} \\right) \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( f_{\\text{wall}} \\):\n\n\\[ f' = f \\left( \\frac{v}{v - v_s} \\right) \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v} \\right) = f \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ f' = 600 \\left( \\frac{350 + 3.5}{350 - 3.5} \\right) = 600 \\left( \\frac{353.5}{346.5} \\right) \\approx 600 \\times 1.0199 \\approx 612 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nOkay, this matches my first calculation of approximately 611.9 Hz, which rounds to 612 Hz.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 612 Hz.\n\nBut earlier, when I used the formula \\( f' = f \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right)^2 \\), I got 624 Hz, which doesn't match. I must have misremembered the formula for the echo scenario.\n\nI think the correct approach is the first one I did, considering the two stages separately: the sound going from the car to the wall, and then the echo coming back to the car.\n\nTherefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to 612 Hz.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
