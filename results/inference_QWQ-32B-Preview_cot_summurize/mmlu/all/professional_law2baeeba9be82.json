                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the best defense for the pharmacist in this strict liability in tort action. Let's break down the scenario:\n\n- A pharmacist works at a drug store.\n\n- A regular customer comes in with a prescription for Clinoril, which is for arthritis.\n\n- The pharmacist is busy and misreads the prescription, giving the customer Clinitest instead, which is a caustic substance not meant for internal use.\n\n- The customer takes the Clinitest as instructed and gets severely injured.\n\nNow, the customer is bringing a strict liability in tort action against the pharmacist. Strict liability usually applies to defects in products, but in this case, it seems to be related to providing the wrong medication.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication.\n\n- This seems irrelevant. The issue is about providing the wrong medication, not who handled the money.\n\nB. He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.\n\n- Pharmacists dispense medications, which could be considered selling. Not sure if this is a valid defense.\n\nC. He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.\n\n- This sounds more like a negligence defense, not a strict liability one. Strict liability often doesn't consider the care taken, but rather the defect or misuse of the product.\n\nD. The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.\n\n- The drug store isn't the manufacturer; they're the dispensers. But in pharmaceutical cases, liability can fall on various parties, including the pharmacist.\n\nI need to think about strict liability in the context of pharmaceuticals. Typically, strict liability applies to defective products. In this case, the wrong medication was given, which can be seen as a defective product being provided.\n\nOption B says he was not a seller upon whom strict liability may be imposed. In some jurisdictions, pharmacists can be considered sellers of medications, especially since they dispense them for a fee.\n\nOption C mentions reasonable care, but in strict liability, the defendant's care in manufacturing or selling the product isn't usually a defense. So that might not work.\n\nOption D suggests that ultimate liability falls on the manufacturer, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the pharmacist from liability, especially since they directly provided the wrong medication to the customer.\n\nOption A is about who received the money, which seems unrelated to the liability for providing the wrong medication.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider if the pharmacist can be considered a seller in this context. In many places, pharmacists are considered sellers of medications, especially prescription drugs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pharmacist can argue that he was an employee acting within the scope of his employment, and thus the liability should fall on the drug store or the employer.\n\nBut that's not among the options. Let's look back.\n\nOption B says he was not a seller upon whom strict liability may be imposed. If being a seller is a prerequisite for strict liability in this jurisdiction, then maybe this could be a defense.\n\nBut I think in many places, pharmacists can be held strictly liable as sellers of medications.\n\nOption D says the drug store was not the manufacturer, but again, in pharmaceutical cases, liability can still fall on the dispenser even if the manufacturer is ultimately at fault.\n\nPerhaps the best defense here is that he exercised reasonable care, which is option C. But as I recall, in strict liability, the defendant's care isn't typically a defense.\n\nUnless, in this jurisdiction, strict liability is modified by the level of care taken.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a concept of contributory negligence or assumption of risk, but those aren't listed as options.\n\nWait, maybe the pharmacist can argue that the customer contributed to her own injury by failing to check the label or something. But again, that's not among the options.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication.\n\n- This seems irrelevant to the liability for providing the wrong medication.\n\nB. He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.\n\n- This could potentially be a defense if being a seller is necessary for strict liability.\n\nC. He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.\n\n- Strict liability often doesn't consider the care taken, but perhaps in this jurisdiction, it does.\n\nD. The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.\n\n- Doesn't absolve the pharmacist from liability.\n\nGiven these choices, I think option B is the best defense. If the pharmacist can argue that he is not a seller and therefore not subject to strict liability, that might hold up.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because in many places, pharmacists are considered sellers of medications.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a defense based on the fact that the medication was prescribed by a physician, so there's an argument about professional reliance or something like that.\n\nBut that's not among the options.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is D, that the drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.\n\nBut again, that might not necessarily protect the pharmacist from liability.\n\nI guess I need to choose the best option among the given choices.\n\nOption A seems clearly irrelevant.\n\nOption C might not be applicable in strict liability cases.\n\nOption D might not absolve the pharmacist.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the relatively better defense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
