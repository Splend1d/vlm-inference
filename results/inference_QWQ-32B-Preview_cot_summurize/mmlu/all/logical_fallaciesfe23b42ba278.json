Let me read each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"summarizing an opponent's position in a way that makes it seem silly.\" Hmm, that sounds like maybe a straw man fallacy, where you misrepresent someone's argument to make it easier to attack. But is that tu quoque?\n\nOption B says: \"attempting to gain agreement based only on the feelings aroused in the argument.\" That sounds like appealing to emotions, which is another type of fallacy. Not sure if that's tu quoque.\n\nOption C says: \"responding to charges of wrongdoing by saying the accuser does the same thing.\" Oh, this rings a bell. Tu quoque seems familiar, and I think it means something like \"you do it too.\" So, if someone accuses you of something, and instead of addressing the accusation, you point out that they do the same thing, that's tu quoque.\n\nOption D says: \"arguing against a position based only on negative personal feelings toward the position.\" That sounds like letting personal bias influence your argument, which is also a fallacy, but not tu quoque, I don't think.\n\nWait, let me double-check what tu quoque actually means. Tu quoque is a Latin phrase that translates to \"you also.\" It's a type of ad hominem fallacy where someone responds to a charge by accusing the accuser of the same thing, diverting attention from the original issue.\n\nSo, going back to the options, option C seems to match that description: \"responding to charges of wrongdoing by saying the accuser does the same thing.\" That sounds exactly like tu quoque.\n\nOption A, as I thought earlier, seems more like a straw man fallacy, where you misrepresent someone's argument to make it easier to attack.\n\nOption B is similar to appealing to emotion, where you try to persuade someone based on their feelings rather than logical reasoning.\n\nOption D is about letting personal biases affect your argument, which is another type of fallacy, perhaps related to bias or prejudice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C, as it directly describes the tu quoque fallacy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
