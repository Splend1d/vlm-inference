Costume parties are events where people dress up in costumes, often to represent characters, themes, or just for fun. Wearing a fake mustache in this context seems like a normal part of dressing up for the party. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with that. It's a common practice at such events, and it doesn't harm anyone or involve any deceit beyond the playful nature of the party.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I watered my neighbor's lawn once a week because he paid me for the whole summer he was away.\"\n\nHere, the main character watered their neighbor's lawn once a week while the neighbor was away, and they were paid for this service for the entire summer. This seems like a straightforward arrangement where one person provides a service (watering the lawn) in exchange for payment. It's a mutual agreement between the two parties, and it's a common practice for people to hire others to take care of their lawns when they're away.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's nothing wrong with this. It's a legitimate transaction, and both parties benefit from it. The neighbor gets their lawn watered while they're away, and the main character earns money for their time and effort.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them involves any clear moral wrongdoings according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
