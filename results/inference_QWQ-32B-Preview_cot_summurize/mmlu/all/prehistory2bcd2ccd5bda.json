                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about which crop from South America had the biggest impact on European agriculture. The options are rice, potatoes, squash, and beans. I think this is about the Columbian Exchange, where plants and animals were transferred between the New World and the Old World after Columbus's voyages.\n\nFirst, I need to recall which of these crops originated in South America. Rice isn't native to the Americas; it comes from Asia, so that probably isn't the answer. Potatoes, on the other hand, are native to South America, specifically the Andean region. Squash and beans are also New World crops, but I think squash comes from Mesoamerica and beans have multiple origins, including the Americas.\n\nSo, potatoes seem like a strong candidate. I remember learning that potatoes became a staple food in many European countries, especially in Ireland, where they were central to the diet. Potatoes provided a high yield per acre and were nutritious, which made them important for feeding growing populations.\n\nBut let me think about squash and beans. While they are important crops, I don't recall them having as significant an impact on European agriculture as the potato. Maybe squash was introduced, but it didn't revolutionize agriculture like the potato did.\n\nAlso, rice isn't native to South America, so it probably wasn't a major contribution from that region to Europe.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B, potatoes. They were a major agricultural contribution from South America to Europe, transforming farming and diets in many European countries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
