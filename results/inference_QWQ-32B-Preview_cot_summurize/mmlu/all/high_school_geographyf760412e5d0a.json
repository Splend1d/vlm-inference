These activities typically take place in factories or manufacturing plants. Let's look at each option to determine which one does not fall under secondary economic activities.\n\nOption A: Assembling automotive parts. This involves putting together components to create a vehicle, which is a manufacturing process. Therefore, this is a secondary economic activity.\n\nOption B: Sewing shirts. This is the process of making clothing, which is also a manufacturing activity. So, this is secondary economic activity.\n\nOption C: Mining copper. Mining is the extraction of minerals and metals from the earth. This is considered a primary economic activity because it involves the direct extraction of raw materials from nature, not their processing or manufacturing.\n\nOption D: Binding books. This involves assembling pages and covers to create a book, which is a manufacturing process. Hence, it is a secondary economic activity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the activity that is NOT a secondary economic activity is mining copper, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
