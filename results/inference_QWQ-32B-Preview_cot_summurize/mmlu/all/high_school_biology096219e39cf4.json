                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which type of selection is described in this scenario with the land snails. There are cream-colored ones and solid brown ones, and intermediate colors are rare. So, I need to choose between artificial selection, directional selection, stabilizing selection, or disruptive selection.\n\nFirst, I should remember what each of these selection types means.\n\nArtificial selection is when humans breed organisms for specific traits. But in this case, it's about natural colors in snails, not something humans are choosing, so probably not A.\n\nDirectional selection is when one extreme of a trait is favored over the others. For example, if darker snails survive better than lighter ones, over time, the population might become darker. But here, both cream and brown are present, and intermediates are rare, so it doesn't seem like one extreme is favored over the other.\n\nStabilizing selection is when the average traits are favored, and extremes are selected against. That would mean that intermediate colors should be more common, which isn't the case here since intermediates are rare.\n\nDisruptive selection is the opposite of stabilizing selection. It favors extremes and selects against the average. So, in this case, cream and brown are favored, while intermediates are less fit.\n\nLooking back at the snail scenario, cream and brown are common, and intermediates are rare, which suggests that the extremes are favored, and the intermediates are not. That sounds like disruptive selection.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any chance that this could be directional selection? Well, directional selection would imply that either cream or brown is favored over the other, leading to a shift in the population towards one color. But the question says that both colors exist, so it's not like one is being favored at the expense of the other.\n\nStabilizing selection doesn't fit because intermediates should be common, not rare.\n\nArtificial selection is unlikely because there's no mention of human influence.\n\nSo, disruptive selection seems to be the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
