                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which theorist is best known for the idea that most migration happens over short distances and in steps. The options are Rostow, Ravenstein, von Th\u00fcnen, and Burgess. I think I remember something about migration patterns, but I need to recall who specifically proposed this concept.\n\nFirst, let's consider Rostow. I know that W.W. Rostow is associated with the Stages of Economic Growth model, which outlines how economies develop over time. It's more about economic development than migration patterns, so I don't think he's the one.\n\nNext, Ravenstein. E.G. Ravenstein proposed some laws of migration in the late 19th century. One of his laws is that most migrations are over short distances. That sounds a lot like what the question is referring to. So, Ravenstein might be the correct answer.\n\nThen, von Th\u00fcnen. Johann Heinrich von Th\u00fcnen is known for his work on agricultural location theory, specifically the von Th\u00fcnen model, which explains how different types of agriculture are arranged around a central market based on transportation costs. This doesn't directly relate to migration patterns, so I don't think he's the one.\n\nLastly, Burgess. I believe Ernest W. Burgess is associated with the concentric zone model of urban structure, which describes how cities grow in concentric circles. Again, this is more about urban geography than migration patterns.\n\nSo, based on what I've recalled, Ravenstein seems to be the theorist who proposed that most migration occurs over short distances and in steps. I should probably double-check this to make sure I haven't confused any of the theories.\n\nLet me look up Ravenstein's laws of migration. According to my notes, Ravenstein proposed several laws, including:\n\n1. Most migrants only proceed a short distance.\n\n2. Large cities act as centers of attraction.\n\n3. There is a tendency for migration to be stepwise.\n\nThis matches perfectly with the description in the question. So, it's clear that Ravenstein is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly review what the other theorists are known for.\n\nRostow's Stages of Economic Growth are:\n\n1. Traditional society\n\n2. Preconditions for take-off\n\n3. Take-off\n\n4. Drive to maturity\n\n5. Age of high mass consumption\n\nThis is about economic development, not migration.\n\nVon Th\u00fcnen's model is about agricultural land use, based on transportation costs and market prices.\n\nBurgess's concentric zone model describes urban spatial structure, with the central business district surrounded by concentric zones of different land uses.\n\nNone of these directly address migration patterns in the way described in the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Ravenstein.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
