                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a technician trying to detect CMV DNA in a bone marrow transplant recipient's blood. The process described involves purifying DNA from the patient's leukocytes, reacting it with oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, using thermostable DNA polymerase and nucleotides, and then performing repetitive cycles of heating and cooling, followed by detecting the reaction product with gel electrophoresis. The question is asking which laboratory procedure the technician most likely used.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. Northern blotting - This is a technique used to detect specific RNA sequences in a sample. It involves separating RNA molecules by gel electrophoresis and then transferring them to a membrane, where they can be probed with a labeled DNA or RNA probe. But in this case, the technician is working with DNA purified from leukocytes and looking for CMV DNA, not RNA. So, Northern blotting seems unlikely.\n\nB. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - PCR is a method used to amplify specific DNA sequences. It involves using primers (which are similar to oligonucleotides), a DNA polymerase (in this case, thermostable), and nucleotides, and it requires cycles of heating and cooling to denature the DNA, anneal the primers, and extend the new DNA strands. The product is then often analyzed by gel electrophoresis. This sounds a lot like what's described in the question.\n\nC. Reverse transcription - This is a process where RNA is converted into DNA, often as a first step in reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), which is used to detect and quantify RNA molecules. However, again, the technician here is working with DNA, not RNA, so reverse transcription doesn't seem directly applicable.\n\nD. Southern blotting - This is a technique used to detect specific DNA sequences in a sample. It involves separating DNA fragments by gel electrophoresis and then transferring them to a membrane, where they can be probed with a labeled DNA probe. While this can be used to detect specific DNA sequences, the description in the question mentions repetitive cycles of heating and cooling, which is characteristic of PCR, not Southern blotting.\n\nGiven this, the procedure that most closely matches the description is polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The use of oligonucleotides (primers) specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, nucleotides, and cycles of heating and cooling are all hallmarks of PCR. The gel electrophoresis is a common method to visualize and confirm the amplification of the target DNA.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Polymerase chain reaction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
