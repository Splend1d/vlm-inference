Following the expansion of peace studies in the decline of the Cold War, the field has emerged as an independent and autonomous area of study that addresses issues surrounding conflict resolution, economic security and the cessation of violence at both an international and sub-national level. As a field of research, peace studies are best defined by their distinction from development studies and international relations.\nB. Peace studies are best defined by its research agenda that focuses on the search for non-violent measures by which to end conflict. Peace researchers adopt a 'top-down' approach to conflict resolution that prioritises the issues surrounding violence and the use of force, focusing on instigating agents in an attempt to secure that actor as the referent object to security.\nC. Peace studies cannot be defined as a specific academic approach due to the shifting nature of its research agenda and the diversity of interests addressed by peace researchers. However, following the Cold War the success of the field has been such that it boasts a number of research institutes and attracts global and interdisciplinary attention.\nD. Peace studies is defined by a concern with the underlying causes of phenomena in IR, a global outlook, an interdisciplinary approach, the search for non-violent transformations, an analytical and normative approach, and the adoption of multi-level analysis that links theory and practice within research.\n"

There are four options provided, and I need to figure out which one is the most accurate. Let's take a look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A says that after the Cold War, peace studies became an independent field focusing on conflict resolution, economic security, and stopping violence at both international and sub-national levels. It also mentions that peace studies are distinct from development studies and international relations. Hmm, that sounds pretty broad.

It mentions a 'top-down' approach that prioritizes issues around violence and force, focusing on key agents to secure them as the main concern for security. This sounds a bit limiting. Peace studies do emphasize non-violent solutions, but the 'top-down' approach might not cover the full spectrum of peace research, which also includes grassroots movements and bottom-up initiatives. Additionally, focusing solely on instigating agents might overlook structural causes of conflict.\n\nOption C suggests that peace studies can't be defined as a specific academic approach because its research agenda shifts and it covers a diverse range of interests. It does acknowledge that peace studies have been successful, with many research institutes and global, interdisciplinary attention. This seems to recognize the dynamic nature of peace studies, which is true. Peace studies is indeed interdisciplinary and evolves with global changes. However, saying it can't be defined as a specific approach might not be entirely accurate, as there are core principles and methods that characterize the field.\n\nOption D provides a list of defining characteristics of peace studies: concern with underlying causes in international relations, a global perspective, interdisciplinary approach, search for non-violent transformations, analytical and normative approach, and multi-level analysis that links theory and practice. This seems comprehensive and aligns well with how peace studies is generally understood. It touches on both the methodological and substantive aspects of the field.\n\nComparing all four options, Option D appears to be the most holistic and accurate definition of peace studies. It captures the essence of the field by highlighting its focus on causes, global outlook, interdisciplinary nature, emphasis on non-violence, and the integration of theory and practice. While the other options have some valid points, they either seem too broad, too narrow, or suggest that peace studies cannot be defined, which isn't entirely accurate.\n\nTherefore, I would say that Option D is the best definition of peace studies in the contemporary context.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
