                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Aquinas and his view on the end of every action. So, the question is: \"Aquinas argues that the end of every action is:\n\nA. some desire.\n\nB. some pleasure.\n\nC. some good.\n\nD. some emotional state.\"\n\nAlright, I need to recall what Aquinas says about the purpose or the end goal of human actions. I remember that in his philosophy, especially in his work \"Summa Theologica,\" Aquinas discusses a lot about ethics and the ultimate purpose of human life.\n\nSo, first off, what does he mean by \"the end of every action\"? I think he's referring to the final cause or the purpose for which an action is performed. In other words, why do we do what we do?\n\nAquinas was influenced by Aristotle's concept of telos, which is the idea that everything has a purpose or a goal. So, applying that to human actions, every action has an end or a purpose that it aims to achieve.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. some desire.\n\nB. some pleasure.\n\nC. some good.\n\nD. some emotional state.\n\nI need to think about which one of these best aligns with Aquinas's thought.\n\nFirst, desire: Desires can motivate actions, but I'm not sure if Aquinas would say that the end of every action is simply some desire. It seems a bit too vague.\n\nPleasure: While pleasure can be a motivator for some actions, Aquinas was a medieval philosopher and a theologian, and he had a more elevated view of human purpose beyond just seeking pleasure.\n\nSome good: This seems promising. Aquinas talks a lot about the concept of the common good and the ultimate good, which is God. He believed that human actions should aim at goodness and ultimately at union with God.\n\nEmotional state: This seems too subjective and doesn't align with Aquinas's more rational approach to ethics.\n\nLet me think deeper. In Aquinas's ethics, he talks about natural law and the idea that human beings have an inherent purpose, which is to seek the good and ultimately to know and love God.\n\nSo, in that context, every human action should be directed towards some good, with the ultimate good being God.\n\nBut maybe there are actions that are not directed towards a good? Like bad actions. But even bad actions, Aquinas might argue, are perverted attempts to achieve some good, even if it's a twisted or misguided notion of good.\n\nWait, I think he does say something like that. That is, even evil actions are somehow related to a good, but they are misdirected or deficient in some way.\n\nSo, in that case, even if an action is bad, its end is still somehow related to some good, albeit mistakenly or perversely.\n\nTherefore, it seems that option C, \"some good,\" is the most accurate representation of Aquinas's view.\n\nLet me double-check by considering what he says about the hierarchy of goods.\n\nAquinas posits that there is a hierarchy of goods, with God as the supreme good, and other goods being ordered towards him.\n\nSo, in that sense, every action, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, is directed towards some aspect of the good, whether the agent is conscious of it or not.\n\nFurthermore, in his treatment of the virtues and moral actions, Aquinas emphasizes the role of reason in ordering our actions towards the good.\n\nSo, it makes sense that he would argue that the end of every action is some good.\n\nNow, comparing this to the other options:\n\nDesire: While desires can be directed towards goods, they are not the end in themselves.\n\nPleasure: Similar to desires, pleasures can be goods, but Aquinas would likely see them as imperfect goods, not the ultimate good.\n\nEmotional state: This seems too narrow and doesn't capture the ethical dimension that Aquinas is concerned with.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. some good.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
