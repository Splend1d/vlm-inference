                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option best exemplifies American federalism. Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A talks about the system of checks and balances among the three branches of the national government. Now, federalism is about the division of power between the national government and the state governments. Checks and balances, on the other hand, is about how the different branches of the national government\u2014executive, legislative, and judicial\u2014check each other's powers to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. So, while it's an important part of the U.S. government, it's more about internal governance at the national level rather than the relationship between national and state governments.\n\nOption B mentions the process by which international treaties are completed. This seems more related to foreign policy and how the national government interacts with other countries. Federalism is about the division of powers between national and state governments, not about international relations. So, this doesn't seem like a direct example of federalism.\n\nOption C refers to the special constitutional status of Washington, D.C. Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States and has a unique status because it's not part of any state; it's directly under the jurisdiction of Congress. While this is an interesting aspect of the U.S. Constitution, it's more about the status of the capital than about the division of powers between national and state governments.\n\nOption D is the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment says that powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. This amendment clearly delineates which powers belong to the national government and which are left to the states or the people. It's a fundamental principle of American federalism because it specifies the limits of national power and affirms the sovereignty of the states in areas not explicitly granted to the federal government.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems that Option D, the Tenth Amendment, is the one that most clearly exemplifies American federalism. It directly addresses the division of powers between the national and state governments, which is the essence of federalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
