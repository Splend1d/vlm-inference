                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about archaeological ethics, especially regarding the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, also known as NAGPRA. It seems like the question is asking about potential problems that can arise in such research, and it presents four options. I need to figure out which one is the most accurate or relevant.\n\nFirst, I should probably have a basic understanding of what NAGPRA is. From what I recall, NAGPRA is a federal law in the United States that was passed in 1990. It addresses the rights of Native American tribes to control the remains of their ancestors and associated funerary objects. The law requires federal agencies and institutions that receive federal funding to inventory their collections of Native American human remains and culturally significant items and to provide for their repatriation to descendent tribes upon request.\n\nSo, the context here is about conducting archaeological research on sites that contain human remains of indigenous North American ancestors, and there are ethical considerations involved, which are governed by NAGPRA.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Both non-indigenous archaeologists and Native Americans are allowed onto the site at the same time.\n\nIs this a problem? Well, collaboration between archaeologists and Native Americans can actually be beneficial and is often encouraged under NAGPRA. The law promotes consultation and cooperation between researchers and Native American tribes. So, having both groups involved simultaneously might be seen as a positive step towards respectful research practices. Therefore, this doesn't seem like a problem; rather, it could be a solution.\n\nB. There are no Native Americans who have been trained as archaeologists and no archaeologists who are Native American.\n\nThis suggests a lack of representation or expertise from Native American perspectives in archaeological research. While this might be an issue in terms of diversity and inclusion in the field, it's not directly related to the ethical conduct of research on sites with human remains. It's more about the makeup of the archaeological community. However, having Native American archaeologists involved could certainly enhance the sensitivity and appropriateness of research approaches, but the absence of them isn't necessarily the primary problem addressed by NAGPRA.\n\nC. Neither archaeologists nor Native Americans can agree on the exact location of burials at the site.\n\nDisagreements over the location of burials could potentially lead to ethical dilemmas, as unintentional disturbance of human remains would be a serious issue. However, NAGPRA primarily deals with the treatment of known human remains and associated funerary objects. If the locations are unknown, it might be more of a logistical or methodological problem rather than an ethical one directly related to NAGPRA.\n\nD. Burials are so ancient that establishing historical or genealogical connections with modern, living groups of people is impossible.\n\nThis seems like a significant issue in the context of NAGPRA. The law requires that human remains and associated items be returned to descendent tribes, but if the burials are too ancient to establish such connections, it complicates the repatriation process. NAGPRA defines \"Native American\" as \"of, or relating to, a tribe, people, or culture that is indigenous to the United States,\" which can include remains that are thousands of years old. However, determining cultural affiliation for very ancient remains can be challenging, as cultural practices and populations have changed over time.\n\nIn such cases, it might be difficult to identify a direct lineal descendant or a culturally affiliated tribe, which is required for repatriation under NAGPRA. This could lead to legal and ethical dilemmas, such as whether to proceed with research on these remains or to rebury them without scientific study.\n\nGiven this, option D seems to be the most pertinent problem addressed by NAGPRA in the context of archaeological research on sites with ancient human remains.\n\nTo summarize, while all the options present certain challenges, only option D directly relates to the core issues that NAGPRA aims to address, particularly the repatriation of human remains to descendent tribes and the ethical considerations when dealing with ancient remains where such connections are unclear.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
