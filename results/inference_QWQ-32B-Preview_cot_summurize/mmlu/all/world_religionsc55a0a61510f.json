No-self\n\nAnatman, also known as anatta in Pali, is a fundamental concept in Buddhism that refers to the idea that there is no permanent, unchanging self or soul within an individual. This concept is closely related to the idea of impermanence, as it suggests that all phenomena, including the self, are constantly changing and evolving. The recognition of anatman is seen as a key step towards achieving enlightenment and liberation from suffering in Buddhist philosophy."
