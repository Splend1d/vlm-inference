I need to figure out whether each statement is true or false, and then see which option matches my conclusions.\n\n**Statement 1:** Every permutation is a one-to-one function.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a permutation is. A permutation is an arrangement of all the elements of a set in a particular order. In the context of functions, a permutation of a set is a bijective (one-to-one and onto) function from the set to itself.\n\nSo, if a permutation is a bijective function, that means it's definitely one-to-one. Because \"one-to-one\" means that each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain, with no duplicates.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 seems true.\n\n**Statement 2:** Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.\n\nThis statement is a bit more complex. It says that for a function to be a permutation, it must be one-to-one, and that's the only condition required.\n\nBut wait, from what I recall, a permutation is a bijective function. That means it has to be both one-to-one and onto.\n\nSo, if a function is one-to-one but not onto, it wouldn't be a permutation, right?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose I have a function f: N \u2192 N, where N is the set of natural numbers, defined by f(x) = 2x. This function is one-to-one because each input maps to a unique output, but it's not onto because not every natural number is reached (for example, 1 is not the image of any natural number under f).\n\nTherefore, f is one-to-one but not a permutation because it's not onto.\n\nThis contradicts Statement 2, which suggests that being one-to-one is both necessary and sufficient for a function to be a permutation.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Statement 1: True\n\n- Statement 2: False\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice seems to be C. True, False.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nIn Statement 2, it says \"Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.\"\n\nI believe the correct statement should be \"Every function is a permutation if and only if it is bijective,\" meaning both one-to-one and onto.\n\nSince the statement only mentions one-to-one, it's incomplete and therefore false.\n\nYes, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
