                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. The theater sold 500 tickets, and each ticket was $6. So, to find out how much money they collected, I can multiply 6 by 500, right? That makes sense. Now, the question is asking for another expression that would give me the same result.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. 30 \u00d7 10^1\n\nB. 30 \u00d7 10^3\n\nC. (6 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 10^2\n\nD. (6 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 10^3\n\nHmm, I need to see which one of these equals 6 times 500.\n\nFirst, let's calculate 6 times 500. 6 times 500 is 3,000 dollars. So, I'm looking for an expression that also equals 3,000.\n\nLet's look at option A: 30 \u00d7 10^1.\n\n10^1 is 10, so 30 times 10 is 300. That's not 3,000. So, A is not it.\n\nOption B: 30 \u00d7 10^3.\n\n10^3 is 1,000, so 30 times 1,000 is 30,000. That's way more than 3,000. So, B is too big.\n\nOption C: (6 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 10^2.\n\nFirst, 6 times 5 is 30, and 10^2 is 100. So, 30 times 100 is 3,000. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nOption D: (6 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 10^3.\n\nAgain, 6 times 5 is 30, and 10^3 is 1,000. So, 30 times 1,000 is 30,000. Again, that's too big.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nOption A was 30 \u00d7 10^1, which is 300.\n\nOption B is 30 \u00d7 10^3, which is 30,000.\n\nOption C is (6 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 10^2, which is 30 \u00d7 100 = 3,000.\n\nOption D is (6 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 10^3, which is 30 \u00d7 1,000 = 30,000.\n\nYes, definitely option C is the one that equals 3,000.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of breaking down the numbers.\n\n6 \u00d7 500 can be thought of as 6 \u00d7 (5 \u00d7 100), which is the same as (6 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 100, which is what option C shows: (6 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 10^2.\n\nBecause 10^2 is 100.\n\nSo, that makes sense.\n\nI don't see any other way to express it among the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
