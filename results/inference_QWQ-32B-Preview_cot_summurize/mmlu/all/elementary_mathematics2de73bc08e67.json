                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about eggs used in a restaurant last week. They used 231 eggs in total, and out of those, 46 were brown. The rest were white, and I need to find out which equation can help me solve for w, which represents the number of white eggs.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The total number of eggs is 231, and among them, 46 are brown. So, the white eggs would be the total minus the brown ones. That makes sense.\n\nSo, if I have to write an equation for w, the number of white eggs, it should be something like:\n\nw = total eggs - brown eggs\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nw = 231 - 46\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me see what the options are:\n\nA. 231 + 46w = 0\n\nB. 46 + w = 231\n\nC. w = 231 + 46\n\nD. 231 = 46w\n\nHmm, option C is w = 231 + 46, but that would mean w is 231 plus 46, which would be 277. But we know that total eggs are 231, so that can't be right. That doesn't make sense because we're adding more eggs to the total, which isn't what's happening.\n\nOption A is 231 + 46w = 0. This looks strange because it suggests that 231 plus 46 times w equals zero. Why would that be? It doesn't seem related to the problem.\n\nOption D is 231 = 46w, which means 231 is equal to 46 times w. So, w would be 231 divided by 46, which is about 5.02. But w is supposed to be the number of white eggs, and we know that total eggs are 231, with 46 brown, so white eggs should be more than that. So, this doesn't make sense either.\n\nOption B is 46 + w = 231. Hmm, this looks promising. It says that the sum of brown eggs and white eggs equals the total eggs. So, 46 (brown) plus w (white) equals 231 (total). That seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check. If I solve for w in option B:\n\n46 + w = 231\n\nSubtract 46 from both sides:\n\nw = 231 - 46\n\nw = 185\n\nOkay, so according to this, there are 185 white eggs. Let's see if that makes sense. Total eggs are 231, brown are 46, so 231 minus 46 should indeed give me the number of white eggs.\n\n231 - 46 = 185\n\nYes, that matches. So, option B seems to be the correct equation to use.\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't a better option here. Option C adds the numbers, which is incorrect. Option A has an addition with a variable exponent, which doesn't make sense in this context. Option D suggests that white eggs are a multiple of the total, which isn't the case.\n\nSo, definitely, option B is the right choice here. It correctly represents the relationship between the total number of eggs, the brown eggs, and the white eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
