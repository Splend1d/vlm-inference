So, they offered lower prices or some kind of savings to older people. Is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, in many places, giving discounts to the elderly is actually encouraged. It's a way to show respect and provide assistance to older adults who might have fixed incomes or other needs. So, this seems like a nice thing to do, not something morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: the neighbor's dog kept barking, so the main character stuffed a sock in its mouth. Hmm, this sounds problematic.\n\nFirst, barking dogs can be annoying, especially if they're loud and persistent. But dealing with the situation by stuffing a sock in the dog's mouth is extreme and potentially harmful.\n\nAnimals, including dogs, can suffer from injuries or health issues if something is forced into their mouths. It could cause choking, breathing problems, or other serious complications. Not to mention, it's cruel and doesn't address the root cause of the barking.\n\nA better approach would be to talk to the neighbor about the barking and see if they can find a solution, like training the dog or keeping it indoors. If the barking is excessive and disturbing, there might be local laws or regulations that can be invoked to address the issue more formally.\n\nSo, in this case, stuffing a sock in the dog's mouth is clearly morally wrong because it's harmful and cruel to the animal.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
