                    "text": "Let's tackle this division problem step by step. I have 2,314 divided by 4, and I need to find the quotient. The options are:\n\nA. 508\n\nB. 508 r2\n\nC. 578\n\nD. 578 r2\n\nFirst, I should probably do the division to see what I get. Let's try dividing 2,314 by 4.\n\nStarting with the first digit, 2, which is less than 4, so I can't divide that. So, I take the first two digits, 23.\n\n23 divided by 4 is 5, because 4 times 5 is 20, which is less than 23. Write down 5.\n\nSubtract 20 from 23, which leaves a remainder of 3.\n\nNow, bring down the next digit, which is 1, making it 31.\n\n31 divided by 4 is 7, because 4 times 7 is 28, which is less than 31. Write down 7.\n\nSubtract 28 from 31, which leaves a remainder of 3.\n\nBring down the last digit, 4, making it 34.\n\n34 divided by 4 is 8, because 4 times 8 is 32, which is less than 34. Write down 8.\n\nSubtract 32 from 34, which leaves a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, the quotient is 578 and the remainder is 2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 508 - that's not what I got.\n\nB. 508 r2 - that's not matching my result.\n\nC. 578 - that matches the quotient I have, but it doesn't show a remainder.\n\nD. 578 r2 - that matches both the quotient and the remainder I have.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 578 r2.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my division to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n2,314 divided by 4.\n\nFirst, 4 goes into 23 five times (20), subtract 20 from 23, gets 3.\n\nBring down 1, makes 31.\n\n4 goes into 31 seven times (28), subtract 28 from 31, gets 3.\n\nBring down 4, makes 34.\n\n4 goes into 34 eight times (32), subtract 32 from 34, gets 2.\n\nSo, quotient is 578, remainder 2.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check by multiplying the quotient by 4 and adding the remainder to see if I get back to 2,314.\n\n578 times 4 is 2,312.\n\n2,312 plus 2 is 2,314.\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 578 r2.\n\nBut why are there options like 508 and 578 without considering the remainder? Maybe some people forget about the remainder or maybe there's a mistake in division.\n\nBut based on my calculation, D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
