Let me think about the show. It's been a while since I've watched it.\n\nSo, in the show, Mike, Ernie, and Chip are the three sons of Steve Douglas, who is a widower. Robbie is another character, but I think he's more like a friend or maybe a neighbor. I need to recall the relationships between these characters.\n\nI remember that one of the boys was mentioned to be adopted, but I can't recall which one. Maybe I should look up some information about the show to refresh my memory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps none of them are adopted, and it's a trick question. But that doesn't seem right because I have a feeling that one of them is adopted.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Mike: I think Mike is the oldest son, and maybe he's the adopted one.\n\nB. Ernie: Ernie seems like a natural-born son, but I'm not sure.\n\nC. Chip: Chip is the youngest, and I think he's biological.\n\nD. Robbie: Robbie is not one of the sons; he's more like a friend or a colleague of Steve's.\n\nWait, maybe Robbie is the adopted one. But I don't recall him being a son.\n\nLet me think about the dynamics between the characters. Steve Douglas is a lawyer, and he has three sons. One of them is adopted, but I can't remember which one.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the actors who played these roles. Mike was played by Fred MacMurray, but wait, no, Fred MacMurray played Steve Douglas. Mike was played by Tim Considine, Ernie by Brian Backer, Chip by Larry Mathews, and Robbie by Don Grady.\n\nRobbie was more of a friend or a mentor figure to the boys, not a son. So, he's probably not the adopted one.\n\nThat leaves Mike, Ernie, and Chip. I think it's between Mike and Ernie.\n\nMaybe I should consider their personalities or storylines. Was there any episode that focused on one of them being adopted?\n\nI recall that Mike was sometimes portrayed as being a bit more rebellious, which might be a trait of an adopted child, but that's just a stereotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps none of them are adopted, and the question is misleading.\n\nWait, maybe the adopted son is Chip, since he's the youngest, and sometimes adopted children are younger.\n\nBut I feel like if there was an adopted child, it would have been mentioned more prominently in the show.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the show didn't focus on adoption, and all the sons are biological.\n\nI'm getting confused now. Maybe I should just guess.\n\nIf I had to choose, I would say Mike is the adopted one.\n\nSo, option A. Mike.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
