                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \\(\\frac{-\\frac{18}{7}}{-\\frac{6}{5}}\\). And I need to figure out which one of these options is correct: A) \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\), B) \\(\\frac{15}{7}\\), C) \\(\\frac{15}{8}\\), or D) \\(\\frac{15}{11}\\).\n\nFirst off, dealing with fractions within fractions can be a bit tricky, but I remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\div \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{d}{c}\\).\n\nIn this case, I have \\(\\frac{-\\frac{18}{7}}{-\\frac{6}{5}}\\), which means I can rewrite this as \\(-\\frac{18}{7}\\) multiplied by the reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{6}{5}\\), which is \\(-\\frac{5}{6}\\). But wait, actually, the reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{6}{5}\\) is \\(-\\frac{5}{6}\\), and since I'm dividing by a negative fraction, the negatives will cancel out.\n\nLet me write this step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{-\\frac{18}{7}}{-\\frac{6}{5}} = -\\frac{18}{7} \\times -\\frac{5}{6}\\)\n\n2. Multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result, so it's positive \\(\\frac{18}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\n3. Now, multiplying fractions is straightforward: multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. So, \\(\\frac{18 \\times 5}{7 \\times 6} = \\frac{90}{42}\\).\n\n4. Now, I need to simplify \\(\\frac{90}{42}\\). Both 90 and 42 are divisible by 6.\n\n5. 90 divided by 6 is 15, and 42 divided by 6 is 7, so \\(\\frac{90}{42} = \\frac{15}{7}\\).\n\nLooking back at the options, B) \\(\\frac{15}{7}\\) matches this.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to remember that when you divide two fractions, the negatives cancel out because negative divided by negative is positive. So, it's just \\(\\frac{18}{7} \\div \\frac{6}{5}\\).\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so again, \\(\\frac{18}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{18 \\times 5}{7 \\times 6} = \\frac{90}{42} = \\frac{15}{7}\\).\n\nAlternatively, I could simplify before multiplying. Let's see:\n\n\\(\\frac{18}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{6}\\)\n\nI can simplify the 18 and the 6. 18 divided by 6 is 3, and 6 divided by 6 is 1, so it becomes \\(\\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{1} = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{7 \\times 1} = \\frac{15}{7}\\).\n\nSame answer again.\n\nOr, thinking about it in terms of decimals, though that might not be as precise, but just to verify.\n\n-\\(\\frac{18}{7}\\) is approximately -2.571, and -\\(\\frac{6}{5}\\) is -1.2.\n\nDividing -2.571 by -1.2 should give a positive number because negatives cancel out.\n\n-2.571 \u00f7 -1.2 = 2.1425, which is roughly \\(\\frac{15}{7}\\), since 15 divided by 7 is approximately 2.142857.\n\nSo, that checks out too.\n\nAnother way is to consider the general rule for dividing fractions: \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\div \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{a \\times d}{b \\times c}\\).\n\nIn this case, a = -18, b = 7, c = -6, d = 5.\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{-18 \\times 5}{7 \\times -6} = \\frac{-90}{-42} = \\frac{90}{42} = \\frac{15}{7}\\).\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be \\(\\frac{15}{7}\\), which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{7}} \\]"
