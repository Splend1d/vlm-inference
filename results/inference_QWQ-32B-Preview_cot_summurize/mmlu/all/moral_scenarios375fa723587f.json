                    "text": "Let's see. I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I put the cat in the freezer one summer while my allergic niece came to visit.\" Hmm, putting a cat in the freezer sounds pretty extreme. Cats are living creatures and freezing them would probably harm or even kill them. That seems pretty wrong because it's abusive to the animal. In the US, there are laws and moral standards against animal cruelty. So, this one seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"After seeing a plastic bag floating on the previously majestic lake, I disposed my plastic bag in the lake too.\" Okay, so here the person sees a plastic bag in the lake and decides to throw their own plastic bag into the lake as well. That doesn't seem right. Littering, especially in bodies of water, is generally considered wrong because it pollutes the environment and can harm wildlife. There are laws against littering and it's not socially acceptable. So, this also seems morally wrong.\n\nBut the question is asking for which scenario the main character does something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Both scenarios seem wrong, but maybe there's a difference in severity or type of wrongness.\n\nIn scenario 1, it's about animal welfare, which is a significant moral issue. In scenario 2, it's about environmental responsibility. Both are important, but in terms of ordinary moral standards, perhaps animal cruelty is seen as more\u4e25\u91cd. But actually, both are serious in their own ways.\n\nWait, maybe the tricky part is the phrase \"clearly morally wrong.\" Maybe one of them is more open to interpretation. But in this case, both seem pretty clear-cut as wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether people recognize that both actions are wrong, or if they think one is acceptable. Given that, the answer would be that both are wrong.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems that A is the correct choice because both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there might be any justification for either action.\n\nIn scenario 1, maybe someone thinks that putting the cat in the freezer is for the cat's own good to prevent the niece from having an allergic reaction. But that doesn't justify harming the cat. Freezing a cat is not a acceptable way to manage allergies; there are other ways to keep the cat away from the niece, like keeping it in a separate room or making the house allergen-free.\n\nIn scenario 2, disposing of plastic in the lake is clearly littering, which is against the law and harmful to the environment. There's no real justification for that action.\n\nTherefore, both actions are clearly morally wrong, and the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
