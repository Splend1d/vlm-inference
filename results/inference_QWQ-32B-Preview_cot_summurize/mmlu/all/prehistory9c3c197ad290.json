                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which option here is archaeological evidence of social stratification and inequality. Let's see what each option is saying.\n\nOption A: \"Burials without exotic grave goods also contain bones indicating that they engaged in less strenuous labor.\" Hmm, so these are burials that don't have fancy stuff buried with them, but the bones show that these people didn't do hard labor. So, they weren't poor laborers, but they also didn't have exotic goods. Maybe they were a middle class or something? But I'm not sure if this directly shows social stratification and inequality.\n\nOption B: \"Burials with exotic grave goods also contain bones indicating that they engaged in less strenuous labor.\" This seems more like it. So, people who had fancy items buried with them also had bones that show they didn't do hard work. Maybe they were rulers or priests who didn't need to work as much because others worked for them. That sounds like higher social status and less need for physical labor, which could indicate inequality.\n\nOption C: \"Burials all contain equal amounts of exotic grave goods, but some are more impressive than others.\" Wait, equal amounts but some are more impressive? That's a bit confusing. If they all have the same amount, but some goods are more prestigious, does that mean there's still some level of inequality based on the type of goods? Maybe, but it's not as straightforward as option B.\n\nOption D: \"Burials contain bones indicating that people were segregated based on gender, stature, and personal capabilities, including artistic abilities.\" So, burial placement is based on gender, height, and skills. This suggests that society valued certain traits over others, which could indicate social stratification. But it doesn't directly talk about labor or possessions, which are often indicators of social status.\n\nComparing all these, option B seems to directly link higher status (exotic grave goods) with less physical labor, which suggests that some people had positions of power or privilege that allowed them to avoid strenuous work. This is a clear indicator of social stratification and inequality.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
