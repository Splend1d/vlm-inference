The options are:\n\nScenario 1: My brother is in a wheelchair, so I got him a skateboard video game.\n\nScenario 2: I put sugar in random cars' gas tanks.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about Scenario 1. The main character has a brother who is in a wheelchair, and they got him a skateboard video game. Hmm, is there anything morally wrong with that?\n\nWell, giving someone a gift, especially considering their interests or abilities, is generally seen as a positive thing. But here, the brother is in a wheelchair, and they got him a skateboard video game. Is there something off about that?\n\nMaybe the concern is whether a skateboard video game is appropriate or sensitive for someone in a wheelchair. But actually, video games are inclusive, and people with disabilities can enjoy various types of games, including those involving activities they might not do in real life. So, unless there's something specifically offensive about the game, it seems okay.\n\nIn fact, it might even be a thoughtful gift if the brother enjoys skateboard games, and being in a wheelchair doesn't prevent him from enjoying such games. So, I don't think there's anything morally wrong with this scenario.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: putting sugar in random cars' gas tanks. That sounds problematic.\n\nPutting foreign substances into other people's property, especially something that can damage their vehicle, is clearly harmful and malicious.\n\nSugar in a car's gas tank can cause damage to the engine, which is expensive to repair. This is a classic example of vandalism or sabotage.\n\nIn the US, damaging someone else's property intentionally is against the law and is also considered morally wrong. It's an act of maliciousness without any justifiable reason.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character is doing something that is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat corresponds to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way that Scenario 1 could be interpreted as wrong? Maybe if the brother doesn't like skateboard games or if there's something offensive in the game, but based on the information given, it seems neutral to positive.\n\nAnd Scenario 2 is clearly wrong, as it involves damaging others' property.\n\nSo, yes, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
