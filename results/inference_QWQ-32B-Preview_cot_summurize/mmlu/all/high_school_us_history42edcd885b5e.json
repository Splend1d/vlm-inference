                    "text": "So I have this question here that's asking about a Supreme Court decision that contributed to the system of segregation that Martin Luther King and others were trying to fight against. The options are Dred Scott v. Sanford from 1857, Brown v. Board of Education from 1954, Worcester v. Georgia from 1831, and Plessy v. Ferguson from 1896. I need to figure out which one of these was the main contributor to segregation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each case was about.\n\nStarting with Dred Scott v. Sanford in 1857. I remember that this was a case about slavery where the Supreme Court decided that African American slaves were not citizens and had no rights that white people were bound to respect. Basically, it reinforced the idea that slaves were property, not people. This decision was really controversial and is often seen as one of the factors that led to the Civil War. So, while it's related to racial issues, I'm not sure if it directly contributed to the segregation system that existed in the 20th century.\n\nNext, Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. I know that this was a landmark case where the Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. It's famous for saying that \"separate but equal\" facilities are inherently unequal, especially in education. This decision was a major victory for the civil rights movement and helped to dismantle segregation laws across the country. So, this seems like it's working against segregation, not contributing to it.\n\nThen there's Worcester v. Georgia in 1831. From the quote provided, it seems like this is related to President Andrew Jackson's views on Native Americans and their relocation west of the Mississippi. Worcester v. Georgia was a case about the rights of Native Americans and the sovereignty of their lands. The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice John Marshall, ruled that Georgia didn't have the right to regulate activities in Cherokee territory, but President Jackson didn't enforce the ruling, leading to the Trail of Tears. So, this case is more about Native American rights and less about African American segregation.\n\nFinally, Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. I think this is the one that established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. Homer Plessy, who was of mixed race, deliberately sat in a white-only railway car in Louisiana and was arrested. The case went to the Supreme Court, which ruled that as long as the separate facilities for blacks and whites were equal, segregation was constitutional. This decision legalized segregation in public places and was used to justify discriminatory laws for decades until it was overturned by Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nSo, considering all this, Plessy v. Ferguson seems like the primary contributor to the system of segregation that Martin Luther King and others were trying to end. It provided legal justification for segregation policies and practices across the South and beyond.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll think about the time periods. Dred Scott was in 1857, before the Civil War, so before the period of Reconstruction and the Jim Crow laws that established segregation. Brown v. Board was in 1954, which was aimed at ending segregation. Worcester v. Georgia is about Native American rights and not directly related to segregation of African Americans. Plessy v. Ferguson was in 1896, right in the era when Jim Crow laws were being established, and its \"separate but equal\" doctrine was used to justify those laws.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Plessy v. Ferguson (1896).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
