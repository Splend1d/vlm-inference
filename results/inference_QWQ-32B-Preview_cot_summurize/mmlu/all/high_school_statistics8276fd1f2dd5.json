                    "text": "So I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to find out with what confidence we can say that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days. Here's what I know:\n\n- The variance of the building time is 386 days squared.\n\n- I have a sample of 40 new homes.\n\n- The average building time for this sample is 83 days.\n\n- I need to find the confidence level for the interval between 80 and 90 days.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how confidence intervals work. I know that a confidence interval for the mean is usually calculated using the sample mean, the standard error of the mean, and a critical value from either the t-distribution or the standard normal distribution, depending on certain conditions.\n\nSince the population variance is known (we have the variance, which is 386), and the sample size is 40, which is relatively large, I can probably use the z-distribution here. The central limit theorem tells me that for large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal, even if the population distribution isn't normal.\n\nSo, first things first, I need to find the standard deviation of the population. Since variance is given, I can take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation.\n\nStandard deviation, \u03c3 = \u221a386 \u2248 19.646 days.\n\nNext, I need to find the standard error of the mean, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nStandard error, SE = \u03c3 / \u221an = 19.646 / \u221a40 \u2248 19.646 / 6.3246 \u2248 3.106 days.\n\nNow, I have the sample mean (x\u0304 = 83 days), the standard error (SE \u2248 3.106 days), and I want to find the confidence level for the interval from 80 to 90 days.\n\nTo find the confidence level, I need to find the z-scores corresponding to 80 and 90 days, and then find the area under the standard normal curve between those two z-scores.\n\nFirst, let's find the z-score for 80 days.\n\nz1 = (80 - x\u0304) / SE = (80 - 83) / 3.106 \u2248 -3 / 3.106 \u2248 -0.966\n\nSimilarly, the z-score for 90 days is:\n\nz2 = (90 - x\u0304) / SE = (90 - 83) / 3.106 \u2248 7 / 3.106 \u2248 2.253\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that z is between -0.966 and 2.253.\n\nI can use a standard normal table or a calculator to find the area under the curve from z = -0.966 to z = 2.253.\n\nFirst, find the area to the left of z = 2.253.\n\nUsing a z-table, the area to the left of z = 2.25 is approximately 0.9878. For z = 2.253, it should be slightly more, maybe 0.9879.\n\nThen, find the area to the left of z = -0.966.\n\nThe area to the left of z = -0.96 is approximately 0.1675. For z = -0.966, it should be slightly less, maybe 0.1672.\n\nNow, the area between z = -0.966 and z = 2.253 is:\n\nP(-0.966 < z < 2.253) = P(z < 2.253) - P(z < -0.966) \u2248 0.9879 - 0.1672 \u2248 0.8207\n\nSo, the confidence level is approximately 82.07%.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 15.4%\n\nB. 17.8%\n\nC. 20.0%\n\nD. 82.1%\n\nIt seems that D. 82.1% is the closest to my calculation of 82.07%.\n\nTherefore, with approximately 82.1% confidence, we can assert that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
