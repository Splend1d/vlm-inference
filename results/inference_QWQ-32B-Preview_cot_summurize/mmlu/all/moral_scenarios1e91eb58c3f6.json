Now, disciplining children is a common practice among parents, and different methods are used depending on the situation and the family's values. Time-outs or room restrictions are often used to help children understand the consequences of their actions and to encourage better behavior. According to ordinary moral standards, this seems like a reasonable disciplinary measure, especially if it's proportional to the misbehavior. So, in this case, it doesn't appear that the main character is doing something morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character walked their dog for twenty minutes last night. Walking a dog is generally considered a responsible act, as it provides exercise and stimulation for the pet, which is important for its well-being. In fact, not walking a dog when it needs it could be seen as neglectful. Therefore, walking the dog is aligning with ordinary moral standards of pet care.\n\nGiven this analysis, neither scenario appears to involve the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
