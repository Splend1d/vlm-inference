This theory was developed by Halford Mackinder in the early 20th century. He believed that controlling the heartland, which includes areas like Russia and Eastern Europe, was crucial for world power because it provided strategic advantages and resources.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to this concept:\n\n- A. Devolution theory is related to the transfer of powers from a central authority to regional or local governments.\n\n- B. Domino theory was a Cold War concept suggesting that if one country fell to communism, neighboring countries would follow like dominoes.\n\n- D. Rimland theory, proposed by Nicholas Spykman, argues that control of the coastal fringes of Eurasia (the \"rimland\") is more important than the heartland for global power.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. heartland theory."
