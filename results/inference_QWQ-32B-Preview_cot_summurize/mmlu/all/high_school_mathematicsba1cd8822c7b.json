                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two positive integers, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), with \\( x < y \\), and their product is 56. So, that means:\n\n\\[ x \\times y = 56 \\]\n\nAlso, we're told that seven times the reciprocal of the smaller integer plus fourteen times the reciprocal of the larger integer equals 4. Since \\( x < y \\), \\( x \\) is the smaller integer and \\( y \\) is the larger one. So, the equation based on the reciprocals is:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times \\frac{1}{x} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{y} = 4 \\]\n\nOur goal is to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, let's list all possible pairs of positive integers \\( (x, y) \\) such that \\( x \\times y = 56 \\) and \\( x < y \\). The factor pairs of 56 are:\n\n1. \\( 1 \\times 56 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2 \\times 28 \\)\n\n3. \\( 4 \\times 14 \\)\n\n4. \\( 7 \\times 8 \\)\n\nThese are the only pairs where both numbers are positive integers and \\( x < y \\).\n\nNow, we need to plug these pairs into the second equation to see which one satisfies it.\n\nLet's start with the first pair: \\( x = 1 \\), \\( y = 56 \\).\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times \\frac{1}{1} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{56} = 7 \\times 1 + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{56} = 7 + \\frac{14}{56} = 7 + \\frac{1}{4} = 7.25 \\]\n\nBut the equation says this should equal 4, and 7.25 \u2260 4, so this pair doesn't work.\n\nNext, \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 28 \\):\n\n\\[ 7 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{28} = 7 \\times 0.5 + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{28} = 3.5 + \\frac{14}{28} = 3.5 + 0.5 = 4 \\]\n\nHey, this equals 4, which is what we want. So, \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 28 \\) satisfy both conditions.\n\nBut let's check the other pairs to make sure there isn't another solution.\n\nThird pair: \\( x = 4 \\), \\( y = 14 \\):\n\n\\[ 7 \\times \\frac{1}{4} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{14} = 7 \\times 0.25 + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{14} = 1.75 + 1 = 2.75 \\]\n\n2.75 \u2260 4, so this doesn't work.\n\nFourth pair: \\( x = 7 \\), \\( y = 8 \\):\n\n\\[ 7 \\times \\frac{1}{7} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 7 \\times \\frac{1}{7} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1 + 1.75 = 2.75 \\]\n\nAgain, 2.75 \u2260 4, so this doesn't satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, the only pair that works is \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 28 \\).\n\nBut looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 13\n\nB. 14\n\nC. 1\n\nD. 2\n\nOption D is 2, which matches our solution.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, let's see if there's any other way to interpret the problem or if we missed something.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"seven times the reciprocal of the smaller integer plus fourteen times the reciprocal of the larger integer equals 4.\" We interpreted the smaller integer as \\( x \\) and the larger as \\( y \\), with \\( x < y \\).\n\nBut let's consider if there might be a misinterpretation of \"smaller\" and \"larger.\" Maybe it's referring to the values after taking reciprocals, but that doesn't make sense because reciprocals invert the inequality for positive integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in one of the steps.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation for \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 28 \\):\n\n\\[ 7 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{28} = 7 \\times 0.5 + 14 \\times 0.0357... = 3.5 + 0.5 = 4 \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nLet me check \\( x = 1 \\), \\( y = 56 \\) again:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times 1 + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{56} = 7 + 0.25 = 7.25 \\neq 4 \\]\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAnd the other pairs don't work either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed \\( x = 2 \\), which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut the user seems to think that 14 is the answer, which is option B. Maybe there's confusion here.\n\nWait, in the pair where \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 28 \\), \\( y \\) is 28, which is larger than 14. But 14 is one of the options.\n\nLet me check the pair where \\( x = 4 \\), \\( y = 14 \\):\n\n\\[ 7 \\times \\frac{1}{4} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{14} = 1.75 + 1 = 2.75 \\neq 4 \\]\n\nSo, it doesn't satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, the only correct pair is \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 28 \\).\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) is 2, which is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
