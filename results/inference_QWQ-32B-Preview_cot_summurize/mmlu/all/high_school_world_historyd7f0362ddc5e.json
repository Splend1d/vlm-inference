Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nRodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here from Walter Rodney's book \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa,\" published in 1974. He's talking about who and what is responsible for African underdevelopment, and he points fingers at the imperialist system operated by European capitalists. Specifically, he says that this system drained African wealth and made it impossible for Africa to develop quickly.\n\nNow, the question is asking which development from the period between 1450 and 1750 C.E. this argument is most likely a response to. So, I need to think about what was happening in Africa during that time that relates to European involvement and its impact on African development.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers.\n\nB. The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World.\n\nC. The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nD. The importation of New World products into Africa.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what was happening in Africa during the period from 1450 to 1750.\n\nOption A mentions the colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers. Now, during the period from 1450 to 1750, European powers were indeed becoming more involved in Africa, but primarily along the coast. The interior was largely unexplored and not colonized until much later, like in the late 19th century during the Scramble for Africa. So, this might not be the best fit.\n\nOption B talks about the expansion of the African diaspora to the New World. This refers to the transatlantic slave trade, which was certainly a major development from 1450 to 1750. Millions of Africans were forcibly taken to the Americas to work on plantations, which had profound effects on African societies, including demographic loss, social disruption, and economic changes.\n\nOption C is about the spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa. While Christianity did spread during this period, especially along the coast and in certain areas, it wasn't as widespread or as impactful as other developments like the slave trade.\n\nOption D mentions the importation of New World products into Africa. After Columbus's voyages, there was certainly an exchange of goods between the Americas and Africa, including crops like maize and cassava, which were introduced to Africa and became important food sources.\n\nNow, considering Rodney's argument about European exploitation draining African wealth and preventing development, which of these options best aligns with that?\n\nOption A, colonization of the interior, doesn't fit well because, as I recall, the interior wasn't really colonized until later.\n\nOption B, the African diaspora and slave trade, definitely involved massive exploitation of African labor, which was a form of wealth drainage. The slave trade enriched European traders and American plantation owners at the expense of African societies, leading to underdevelopment.\n\nOption C, the spread of Christianity, while it had cultural and social impacts, isn't directly related to economic exploitation in the same way as the slave trade.\n\nOption D, the importation of New World products, actually had some positive effects on African agriculture and diet, so it's less likely to be the focus of Rodney's criticism.\n\nTherefore, it seems that Option B, the expansion of the African diaspora to the New World, is the development that Rodney's argument is most likely a response to. The transatlantic slave trade was a key aspect of European imperialism and had devastating effects on African economies and societies, aligning with his points about wealth drainage and hindering development.\n\nTo double-check, I should consider if there are any other developments during this period that might relate to Rodney's argument. For example, during the 15th to 18th centuries, European powers established trading posts and forts along the African coast, primarily for the purposes of trade, including the slave trade and the exchange of goods like gold, ivory, and spices.\n\nHowever, the slave trade was by far the most significant and exploitative aspect of European-African relations during this period, and its impact on African development was profound and negative. So, I think Option B is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
