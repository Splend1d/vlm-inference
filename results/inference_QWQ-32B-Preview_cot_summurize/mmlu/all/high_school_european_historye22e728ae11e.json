                    "text": "So I've got this question about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact from 1939. It's quoting parts of the agreement between Germany and the USSR. The question is asking which country both nations were allowed to freely invade based on this pact. The options are Denmark, Finland, France, and Poland.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was. I know it was a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which was surprising because they were ideologically opposed. But apparently, they agreed not to fight each other.\n\nLooking at the text provided:\n\n- Article I says both parties promise not to attack each other.\n\n- Article II says if one is attacked by a third power, the other won't support that third power.\n\n- Article III talks about maintaining contact for consultations.\n\n- Article IV seems to be about not joining groups that are against the other party.\n\n- Article V is about settling disputes through friendly discussion or arbitration.\n\nBut the question is about invading a country. The text provided doesn't explicitly mention any country. So maybe the answer is in the context of the pact.\n\nI recall that along with the non-aggression pact, there was a secret protocol that divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence for Germany and the USSR. This secret protocol is key to understanding why they invaded certain countries.\n\nSo, even though the quoted text doesn't mention any country, the pact included a secret agreement where Germany and the USSR agreed to divide Poland and other Baltic states.\n\nTherefore, the country they both agreed to invade freely would be Poland.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. Denmark - not directly related to this pact.\n\nB. Finland - Finland was invaded by the USSR, but not jointly with Germany.\n\nC. France - France was invaded by Germany, but not with the USSR involved.\n\nD. Poland - yes, both invaded Poland, with Germany and the USSR dividing it according to the secret protocol.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Poland.\n\nBut to make sure, let's think about it again. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact allowed Germany to invade Poland without fear of Soviet intervention, and the USSR could invade Eastern Poland and other Baltic states without worrying about Germany.\n\nTherefore, Poland is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
