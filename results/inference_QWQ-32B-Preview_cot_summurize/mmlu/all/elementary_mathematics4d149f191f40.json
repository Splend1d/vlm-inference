                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Bella's photos. It says that all of her photos are in 8 photo books, and each photo book has 25 photos. I need to find out which expression shows how to find the total number of photos Bella has. The options are:\n\nA. 25 \u00f7 8\n\nB. 25 \u2013 8\n\nC. 25 + 8\n\nD. 25 \u00d7 8\n\nHmm, let's see. I need to find the total number of photos, and they're spread across 8 photo books with each book containing 25 photos. So, basically, I have 8 books, each with 25 photos. To find the total, I think I need to add up all the photos from each book.\n\nSo, if I have one book with 25 photos, two books would have 25 plus 25, which is 50, and so on, up to 8 books. That sounds like addition, but adding 25 eight times. Wait, but adding the same number multiple times is the same as multiplication. So, 25 multiplied by 8 should give me the total number of photos.\n\nLet me check the options again. Option D is 25 \u00d7 8, which matches what I'm thinking. But just to be sure, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A is 25 \u00f7 8. Division would be used if I were to split 25 photos into 8 books, but that's not the case here. Bella already has all her photos in 8 books, each with 25 photos. So, division doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B is 25 \u2013 8. Subtraction would be used if I were to take away 8 photos from 25, but again, that doesn't make sense in this context. We're not removing any photos; we're trying to find the total number of photos.\n\nOption C is 25 + 8. Addition would be used if I were to add 8 photos to 25, but that doesn't fit the scenario either. I have 8 books, each with 25 photos, so I need to find the total across all books.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression should be 25 multiplied by 8, which is option D.\n\nTo double-check, let's do a quick calculation. 25 times 8 is 200. So, if each of the 8 books has 25 photos, the total should be 200 photos. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 8 books, each containing 25 photos, so total photos are 8 times 25, which again is 200.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
