I need to find out how many 8-ounce servings are in that 28-pound bag. The options are A. 14, B. 56, C. 224, and D. 448.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the units involved. The dog eats 8 ounces per day, and the bag is 28 pounds. So, I have to convert pounds to ounces because the servings are in ounces.\n\nI know that 1 pound equals 16 ounces. So, to find out how many ounces are in 28 pounds, I can multiply 28 by 16.\n\nLet me do that: 28 times 16.\n\n28 x 16:\n\n20 x 16 = 320\n\n8 x 16 = 128\n\nAdding them up: 320 + 128 = 448 ounces.\n\nSo, the 28-pound bag contains 448 ounces of dog food.\n\nNow, each serving is 8 ounces. To find out how many 8-ounce servings are in 448 ounces, I need to divide 448 by 8.\n\n448 \u00f7 8.\n\nLet me do the division: 8 goes into 44 five times (40), subtract 40 from 44 gets 4. Bring down the 8, makes 48. 8 goes into 48 six times exactly (48). So, 56 servings.\n\nSo, the answer should be 56.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 56 is the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, conversion from pounds to ounces: 28 pounds times 16 ounces per pound is indeed 448 ounces.\n\nThen, dividing 448 ounces by 8 ounces per serving gives 56 servings.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think B. 56 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
