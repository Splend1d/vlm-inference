                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic translation step by step. The proposition we're dealing with is:\n\n(\u2200x)(Ax \u2283 (\u2200y)[(Hy \u2022 Ly) \u2283 \u223cBxy])\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this symbolic statement is saying. Let's break it down using the translation key provided:\n\n- Ax: x is an apartment\n\n- Hx: x is a house\n\n- Lx: x is large\n\n- Bxy: x is bigger than y\n\nSo, the statement is:\n\nFor all x, if x is an apartment, then for all y, if y is a house and y is large, then it is not the case that x is bigger than y.\n\nIn other words:\n\nFor every apartment x, and for every large house y, x is not bigger than y.\n\nNow, I need to choose the best English interpretation from the options given:\n\nA. All apartments are not bigger than some large house.\n\nB. No apartment is bigger than any large house.\n\nC. All large houses are not bigger than some apartment.\n\nD. No large house is bigger than all apartments.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"All apartments are not bigger than some large house.\"\n\nThis suggests that for every apartment, there exists at least one large house that it is not bigger than. But our original statement is about every large house, not just some.\n\nB. \"No apartment is bigger than any large house.\"\n\nThis means that there is no apartment that is bigger than even one large house. This aligns closely with our interpretation that for every apartment and every large house, the apartment is not bigger than the large house.\n\nC. \"All large houses are not bigger than some apartment.\"\n\nThis suggests that for every large house, there is at least one apartment that it is not bigger than. This seems to reverse the relationship and doesn't match our original statement.\n\nD. \"No large house is bigger than all apartments.\"\n\nThis means that there is no large house that is bigger than every apartment. This is different from our original statement, which is about apartments not being bigger than large houses.\n\nComparing these, option B seems to be the closest match to our interpretation. To confirm, let's try to rephrase the original statement in English.\n\nOriginal statement:\n\nFor all x, if x is an apartment, then for all y, if y is a house and y is large, then x is not bigger than y.\n\nIn English: Every apartment is not bigger than any large house.\n\nThis is equivalent to: No apartment is bigger than any large house.\n\nTherefore, the best interpretation is option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are less suitable.\n\nOption A: \"All apartments are not bigger than some large house.\"\n\nThis could be misinterpreted as \"for all apartments, there exists at least one large house that they are not bigger than.\" This is weaker than the original statement, which says that apartments are not bigger than every large house.\n\nOption C: \"All large houses are not bigger than some apartment.\"\n\nThis flips the relationship and suggests that each large house is not bigger than at least one apartment, which is not what the original statement says.\n\nOption D: \"No large house is bigger than all apartments.\"\n\nThis says that there is no large house that is bigger than every apartment, which is different from the original statement about apartments not being bigger than large houses.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B: No apartment is bigger than any large house.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
