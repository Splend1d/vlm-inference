Let me look at each option to see which one best fits the definition.\n\nOption A says it's about techniques to manage and present appropriate emotions in public. That sounds familiar. I think Hochschild talked about how people regulate their emotions to meet the expectations of their jobs or social situations. For example, a flight attendant might have to smile and be friendly even if they're not feeling happy inside. That seems like emotion work.\n\nOption B mentions work done by psychologists and therapists. While they do help with emotions, I don't think that's what Hochschild was referring to. Her work is more about everyday people managing their emotions in their jobs and social lives, not specifically about mental health professionals.\n\nOption C talks about experiences like grieving and falling in love requiring a lot of emotional energy. While those are certainly emotionally demanding, I don't think that's the focus of emotion work as defined by Hochschild. She seems to be more concerned with the conscious management of emotions in social interactions.\n\nOption D mentions increasing levels of risk and anxiety making us think more about our self-identities. That sounds more related to reflexive modernization or similar theories, not directly to emotion work.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, Option A seems to be the most accurate description of emotion work as introduced by Hochschild in 1983. It's about the strategies and efforts people use to control and display emotions that are considered appropriate in certain public or professional contexts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
