So, the original position is this hypothetical scenario he sets up to figure out principles of justice. In this scenario, people don't know certain things about themselves to make sure they're being fair and objective when choosing principles of justice.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n\nA. Knowledge of how one is talented compared to others.\n\nI think in the original position, people are supposed to be behind a \"veil of ignorance,\" meaning they don't know their own place in society or their own abilities. So, they wouldn't know how talented they are compared to others. That seems like something they wouldn't have.\n\nB. Knowledge of one's social status.\n\nAgain, behind the veil of ignorance, they shouldn't know their social status. That's to prevent biases based on whether they're rich or poor, high status or low status. So, probably not.\n\nC. Knowledge of one's abilities, such as intelligence, strength, and so on.\n\nSimilar to A, I think in the original position, people don't know their own abilities. The whole point is to have a fair starting point where no one knows their own strengths or weaknesses.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nWell, if A, B, and C are all things that people don't know in the original position, then D would be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. I have a copy of \"A Theory of Justice\" somewhere. Maybe I can look it up.\n\nOkay, I found it. In Chapter 2, Rawls describes the original position and the veil of ignorance.\n\nHe says that in the original position, the parties are to make decisions about the principles of justice without knowing specific details about their own personal circumstances, social status, abilities, etc.\n\nSo, they don't know their own intelligence, strength, wealth, social status, and so on.\n\nTherefore, none of the above options would be known to the occupants of the original position.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. None of the above.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\nA. Knowledge of how one is talented compared to others.\n\nNo, because they don't know their own talents or abilities.\n\nB. Knowledge of one's social status.\n\nAgain, no, because they're behind the veil of ignorance and don't know their social status.\n\nC. Knowledge of one's abilities, such as intelligence, strength, and so on.\n\nNo, they don't know their own abilities.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct answer.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
