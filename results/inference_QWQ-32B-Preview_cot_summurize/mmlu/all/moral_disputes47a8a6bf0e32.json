                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this statement by Sinnott-Armstrong. He says that the fact your government morally ought to do something doesn't necessarily mean that you, as an individual, ought to do it too. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, I need to distinguish between what the government should do and what I, as a citizen, should do. The government has a lot of responsibilities that individuals don't have, like maintaining law and order, providing public services, and representing the country internationally. So, there are things that only the government can do or should do.\n\nFor example, the government ought to enforce laws against theft. That's its role. But as an individual, I don't have the authority to arrest someone for stealing. So, in this case, the government ought to do something, but I don't necessarily ought to do it.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some moral duties that both the government and individuals share. For instance, promoting justice and fairness. The government should create laws that are just, but as an individual, I also have a moral obligation to be just in my dealings with others.\n\nBut Sinnott-Armstrong is saying that just because the government ought to do something, it doesn't automatically follow that I, as an individual, ought to do it too. So, maybe there are cases where the government should take action, but it wouldn't be morally required for me to take that same action as an individual.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose the government ought to provide healthcare to all its citizens. That's a moral obligation for the government. But does that mean that I, as an individual, ought to provide healthcare to all citizens? Well, probably not, because that's something that requires the resources and infrastructure that only the government can provide. So, in this case, the government's moral obligation doesn't translate to an individual moral obligation.\n\nAnother example could be national defense. The government ought to defend the country against threats. But as an individual, I don't necessarily ought to take up arms and defend the country myself. Again, that's a role assigned to the government.\n\nHowever, there might be some overlapping duties. For instance, if the government ought to promote education, then as an individual, I might also have a moral obligation to educate myself and support education in my community.\n\nSo, it seems that while there can be some overlap, there are also many cases where the government's moral obligations don't directly translate to individual moral obligations.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. does not prove that government officials ought to promote it.\n\nWait, the statement is about the government morally ought to do something, and whether that proves that you ought to do it. Option A is talking about government officials promoting it. That seems a bit off track. I think the focus is on the individual's obligation, not on government officials specifically.\n\nB. does not prove that you ought to do it.\n\nThis aligns with what Sinnott-Armstrong is saying. Just because the government ought to do something, it doesn't necessarily prove that you, as an individual, ought to do it.\n\nC. proves that you ought not to do it.\n\nThis seems too strong. Just because the government ought to do something doesn't mean that you ought not to do it. In some cases, you might still have a moral obligation to do it, even if the government is supposed to handle it.\n\nD. proves that you ought to do it, too.\n\nThis contradicts Sinnott-Armstrong's point. He's saying that the government's moral obligation doesn't automatically mean that you have the same obligation.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, the correct answer should be B: does not prove that you ought to do it.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where the government's moral obligation would indeed prove that you ought to do it too? Maybe in cases where the government can't act alone, and individual actions are necessary to achieve the moral goal.\n\nFor example, if the government ought to reduce poverty, and as an individual, I can contribute to charities that help reduce poverty, then in that sense, my actions can be part of achieving the government's moral obligation. But even then, it's not that the government's obligation proves that I ought to do it; rather, the moral goal itself (reducing poverty) creates an obligation for both the government and individuals.\n\nSo, I think Sinnott-Armstrong is emphasizing that the government's moral obligations are distinct from individual moral obligations, and one doesn't directly prove the other.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B: does not prove that you ought to do it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
