                    "text": "So I have this scenario here. I'm treating a teenage male, and I suspect he might have some neurological issues. I've already talked to his parents about my concerns and suggested they see a neurologist. Now, the neurologist has contacted me and wants to see my progress notes. I need to figure out what to do next.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Tell the neurologist that the parents need to request the records.\n\nB. Send the records as requested.\n\nC. Inform the neurologist that I need a release of information signed by the client\u2019s parents.\n\nD. Ask my client whether he wishes to have the records released to the neurologist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider who has the authority to request and release medical records, especially since the patient is a minor.\n\nIn most places, parents have the right to access their minor child's medical records. So, in this case, since I've already discussed my concerns with the parents and they've agreed to send their son to a neurologist, it seems reasonable that they would want the neurologist to have access to my progress notes to better understand the patient's condition.\n\nOption A suggests telling the neurologist that the parents need to request the records. This might be a way to ensure that the parents are aware and consent to the release of information. But, since I've already discussed my concerns with them and suggested seeing a neurologist, they might have expected that the neurologist would need to see my notes.\n\nOption B is to send the records as requested. This seems straightforward, but I need to make sure that I have the proper authorization to release the information. Given that the patient is a minor and the parents are involved, I should probably get some form of consent from the parents to release the records to the neurologist.\n\nOption C is to inform the neurologist that I need a release of information signed by the client\u2019s parents. This seems like the most appropriate step to ensure that I have the necessary permission to share the records. It also covers me legally, as I'm ensuring that I have consent from the appropriate parties before releasing sensitive medical information.\n\nOption D is to ask my client whether he wishes to have the records released to the neurologist. Now, the patient is a teenager, which might mean that he has some say in his medical decisions, but since he is a minor, his parents probably have the final say. Additionally, given that I've already involved the parents in the decision to see a neurologist, it might be more appropriate to get their consent rather than just asking the teenager.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems like the best choice. I should inform the neurologist that I need a release of information signed by the client\u2019s parents before I can provide the progress notes. This way, I'm ensuring that I have the proper authorization and that I'm respecting the privacy and consent rules regarding minor patients.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
