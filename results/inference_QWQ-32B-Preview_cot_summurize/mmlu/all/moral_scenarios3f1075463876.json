                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios to determine which one, if any, involves morally wrong behavior according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"When I spotted the terrifying painting in the museum, I steered my kids to it.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is in a museum with their kids and notices a frightening painting. They decide to direct their children towards this painting.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, exposing children to terrifying content could be seen as potentially harmful or inappropriate, depending on the age and sensitivity of the children. However, museums often contain a variety of artworks, some of which may be disturbing or adult-themed. Parents generally have the responsibility to guide their children's exposure to such material.\n\nIn this scenario, the parent is making a conscious decision to show their children something that they find terrifying. This could be interpreted as either educational (showing them different forms of art, including those that evoke strong emotions) or potentially harmful (exposing them to distressing images without proper context or preparation).\n\nGiven that it's a museum setting, it's likely that the painting is part of a curated collection meant for public viewing. Therefore, the parent might be exercising their judgment in deciding what is appropriate for their own children.\n\nOverall, while some might argue that steering children towards terrifying content is inappropriate, it's not universally considered morally wrong. It falls more into the realm of parental discretion and judgment.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I opened the vial of chemicals in the science lab.\"\n\nThis scenario involves someone opening a vial of chemicals in a science lab. Again, considering the context is crucial. Science labs often handle various chemicals, some of which can be hazardous if not handled properly.\n\nOpening a vial of chemicals in a science lab could be a standard procedure, provided that the person follows all safety protocols, such as wearing protective gear and working in a fume hood to avoid exposure to volatile substances.\n\nHowever, if the person opens the vial without taking necessary safety precautions, it could be dangerous and potentially harmful to themselves or others in the lab.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, failing to follow safety regulations in a lab could be considered reckless or negligent, which are morally wrong actions as they put others at risk.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify whether the person followed safety protocols or not. If they did follow all the necessary safety measures, then opening the vial is just part of their work and not morally wrong.\n\nIf they didn't follow safety protocols, then it would be morally wrong due to the potential harm to themselves and others.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't provide information about safety measures, it's unclear whether any wrongdoing occurred.\n\nHowever, in the context of ordinary moral standards, assuming that the person followed all safety protocols, opening the vial would not be morally wrong. If they didn't, then it would be.\n\nSince the scenario doesn't specify, I'll assume that the person followed proper procedures, making it not morally wrong.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Scenario 1:** Not clearly morally wrong, as it's a matter of parental discretion.\n\n- **Scenario 2:** Not clearly morally wrong, assuming safety protocols were followed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
