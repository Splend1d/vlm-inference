                    "text": "So I've got this problem about Joseph Priestley discovering oxygen by decomposing mercury(II) oxide. The question is: how many moles of oxygen gas will form when 4.32 grams of solid mercury(II) oxide decomposes? The formula mass of mercury(II) oxide is given as 216 grams per mole. The options are A. 0.100 mol, B. 0.0100 mol, C. 0.0200 mol, and D. 0.0150 mol.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the chemical reaction happening here. Mercury(II) oxide decomposes into oxygen gas and mercury metal. So, the balanced equation should be:\n\n2 HgO \u2192 2 Hg + O2\n\nWait, does that look right? Let me make sure. Mercury(II) oxide is HgO, and it decomposes to give mercury metal, Hg, and oxygen gas, O2. So, the balanced equation is:\n\n2 HgO \u2192 2 Hg + O2\n\nYes, that seems correct. Two moles of HgO produce two moles of Hg and one mole of O2.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many moles of O2 are produced when 4.32 grams of HgO decompose.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many moles of HgO I have. The formula mass of HgO is 216 grams per mole.\n\nSo, moles of HgO = mass / molar mass = 4.32 g / 216 g/mol.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n4.32 divided by 216. Let's see, 4.32 divided by 216.\n\nWell, 216 times 0.02 is 4.32. So, 216 * 0.02 = 4.32. So, moles of HgO is 0.0200 moles.\n\nNow, looking at the balanced equation:\n\n2 HgO \u2192 2 Hg + O2\n\nSo, 2 moles of HgO produce 1 mole of O2.\n\nTherefore, the mole ratio of HgO to O2 is 2:1.\n\nSo, if I have 0.0200 moles of HgO, the moles of O2 produced would be half of that, because it's a 2:1 ratio.\n\nSo, moles of O2 = 0.0200 moles HgO * (1 mole O2 / 2 moles HgO) = 0.0100 moles O2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n2 moles HgO produce 1 mole O2.\n\nSo, 1 mole HgO produces 0.5 moles O2.\n\nTherefore, 0.0200 moles HgO produce 0.0200 * 0.5 = 0.0100 moles O2.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the answer should be 0.0100 moles, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there aren't any calculation errors.\n\nMass of HgO = 4.32 g\n\nMolar mass of HgO = 216 g/mol\n\nMoles of HgO = 4.32 / 216 = 0.0200 mol\n\nFrom the balanced equation:\n\n2 HgO \u2192 O2\n\nSo, moles of O2 = moles of HgO / 2 = 0.0200 / 2 = 0.0100 mol\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use dimensional analysis:\n\n4.32 g HgO * (1 mol HgO / 216 g HgO) * (1 mol O2 / 2 mol HgO) = ?\n\nLet's calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 4.32 g HgO / 216 g/mol = 0.0200 mol HgO\n\nThen, 0.0200 mol HgO * (1 mol O2 / 2 mol HgO) = 0.0100 mol O2\n\nYes, same result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. 0.0100 mol.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
