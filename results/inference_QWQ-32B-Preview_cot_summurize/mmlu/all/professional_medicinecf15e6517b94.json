                    "text": "I've got this case here about a 51-year-old man with a lump on his tongue that's been causing problems with speech and eating. He's also lost quite a bit of weight, about 15 pounds over six months. He's a smoker, having a pack a day for a long time, and drinks quite a bit on weekends. His vitals are normal, but physically, there's this 1.5 cm mass on the tip of his tongue, and it's confirmed to be squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nSo, the question is, which lymph nodes should we check first for possible spread of this cancer? The options are:\n\nA. Inferior deep cervical\n\nB. Parotid\n\nC. Retropharyngeal\n\nD. Submental\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall where squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue tend to spread. Since it's a head and neck cancer, lymph node metastasis is a big concern.\n\nThe tongue is part of the oral cavity, and cancers in this area can spread to regional lymph nodes. I remember that the lymphatic drainage of the tongue is pretty extensive, but there are certain patterns.\n\nLet me think about the anatomy. The tongue is divided into an oral part and a base, and they drain differently. The oral part drains mostly to the submandibular and submental lymph nodes, while the base of the tongue drains to the deep cervical lymph nodes.\n\nIn this case, the mass is on the apex of the tongue, which I believe is the front part, so probably the oral part.\n\nBut wait, the base is the back part, near the pharynx, and the apex is the tip. So, yes, it's the oral part.\n\nSo, for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral part of the tongue, the first stations for lymph node metastasis would typically be the submandibular and submental lymph nodes.\n\nLooking at the options, submental is option D.\n\nBut let's see what the other options are.\n\nInferior deep cervical (option A) might be involved, but that's more for tumors originating from the base of the tongue or other areas that drain directly to the deep cervical nodes.\n\nParotid (option B) is a salivary gland, and while it's in the head and neck region, I don't think it's a common first-site for metastasis from tongue cancer.\n\nRetropharyngeal (option C) nodes are deeper in the neck, more related to pharyngeal cancers, I think.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the submental lymph nodes would be the first to check.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check the lymphatic drainage of the tongue.\n\nLet me recall: the tongue has afferent lymphatics that drain to the submandibular, deep cervical, and retropharyngeal nodes.\n\nBut for the oral part, it's primarily submandibular and submental.\n\nFor the base of the tongue, it's more the deep cervical and retropharyngeal nodes.\n\nGiven that, since this is on the apex, submental (D) seems correct.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because I recall that sometimes even oral tongue cancers can drain to the deep cervical nodes, but I think submental is more immediate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's both submental and deep cervical, but since we have to choose one, submental might be first.\n\nWait, but the question says \"first appropriate lymph node to evaluate,\" and among the options, submental is there.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better answer.\n\nLet me consider the N staging in head and neck cancers.\n\nIn the AJCC staging system, for oral cavity cancers, including the tongue, the regional lymph nodes include level I (submental and submandibular), level II (upper deep cervical), and so on.\n\nSo, for oral tongue cancer, level I nodes, which include submental and submandibular, are the first echelon of lymph nodes.\n\nTherefore, checking the submental nodes makes sense.\n\nInferior deep cervical might be level III or lower, which would be less immediate.\n\nParotid is not typically a lymph node, but a salivary gland, although it does have lymph nodes around it.\n\nRetropharyngeal nodes are more related to nasopharyngeal cancers.\n\nSo, again, submental seems the best choice.\n\nBut maybe I should think about the weight loss.\n\nHe's lost 15 pounds in six months, which is significant.\n\nDoes that change anything?\n\nWell, weight loss can indicate more advanced disease, possibly with metastasis.\n\nBut in terms of evaluating lymph nodes, I think the primary consideration is the anatomical drainage.\n\nAlso, his smoking and alcohol history puts him at higher risk for head and neck cancers, which is consistent with the diagnosis.\n\nSo, in summary, for a squamous cell carcinoma of the apex of the tongue, the first lymph nodes to evaluate for metastasis would be the submental lymph nodes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Submental.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
