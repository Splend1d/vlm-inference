This means we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 10 to form an edge.\n\nThis is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter. The formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\), since we are choosing 2 vertices out of 10.\n\nSo, the number of edges \\( e \\) is:\n\n\\[\ne = C(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\cdot 8!}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 8! \\) in the numerator and the denominator, since \\( 10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8! \\):\n\n\\[\ne = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{2! \\times 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2!} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of edges in a complete graph with 10 vertices is 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
