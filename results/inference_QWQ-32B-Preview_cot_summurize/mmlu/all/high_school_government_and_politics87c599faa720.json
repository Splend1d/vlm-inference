                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about voting behavior, and I need to identify which statement is NOT true among the options provided. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"When there is a strong front-runner in a state, people in that state are less likely to vote.\" Hmm, that makes sense. If one candidate is way ahead, people might feel like their vote doesn't matter as much, so they might be less motivated to turn out on election day. So, I think this one is probably true.\n\nOption B: \"White-collar workers are more likely to vote than are blue-collar workers, with the exception of blue-collar workers who belong to unions.\" Okay, I know that socio-economic status and occupation can influence voting behavior. Generally, higher-educated and higher-income individuals tend to vote more. White-collar workers often have higher education and income levels compared to blue-collar workers. However, blue-collar workers who are union members might have a stronger incentive to vote, especially in elections where labor rights are at stake. So, this seems plausible, and I believe it's true.\n\nOption C: \"Voters who are registered as independent are less likely to vote than those who are registered Democrats or Republicans.\" Interesting. Independents are not affiliated with any political party. Maybe they're less engaged or feel less committed to voting because they don't identify strongly with a particular party. On the other hand, party affiliates might be more motivated to vote for their party's candidates. So, this also seems likely to be true.\n\nOption D: \"There is no difference in the likelihood of voting among those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees.\" Now, this one catches my attention. Education level is often correlated with voting behavior. Generally, more educated people tend to vote more. So, if someone has an undergraduate degree, they might be more likely to vote than someone without one. But what about those with postgraduate degrees? Would they be even more likely to vote?\n\nI need to think about this. Maybe the increase in education level beyond an undergraduate degree doesn't significantly affect voting likelihood. Or perhaps people with postgraduate degrees are just as likely to vote as those with undergraduate degrees. But is that really the case?\n\nLet me consider some facts. Higher education is often associated with greater political awareness and engagement. So, people with postgraduate degrees might be even more likely to vote than those with just undergraduate degrees. But Option D says there's no difference. Is that accurate?\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe in some studies, the difference between undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in terms of voting likelihood is negligible. Or perhaps the difference only exists when comparing college-educated people to those without college degrees, but not between undergraduate and postgraduate levels.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is no significant difference because once someone has a college degree, their voting habits are already established, and further education doesn't change that much.\n\nBut I recall from some political science courses that there is a positive correlation between education and voting behavior, and that higher education levels are associated with higher voting rates. So, perhaps there is a difference, meaning that Option D is not true.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the statement is that there is no difference, but in reality, there is a difference, meaning that Option D is the exception, the one that's not true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the research shows that once someone has a college degree, additional education doesn't significantly impact their voting likelihood, making Option D true.\n\nI need to be careful here. The question is asking for the statement that is NOT true, so if Option D is actually true, then it would be the correct answer. But if Option D is false, meaning that there is a difference in voting likelihood between undergraduate and postgraduate degree holders, then Option D would be the exception.\n\nTo make this clearer, let's consider what the other options are saying:\n\n- Option A: True\n\n- Option B: True\n\n- Option C: True\n\n- Option D: True (no difference between undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in voting likelihood)\n\nIf Option D is true, then it's not the exception. But if Option D is false, meaning there is a difference, then it would be the exception.\n\nGiven that, I need to determine whether Option D is true or false.\n\nFrom what I know, education level positively correlates with voting behavior, and higher education levels are associated with higher voting rates. Therefore, it's possible that people with postgraduate degrees are more likely to vote than those with only undergraduate degrees.\n\nIf that's the case, then stating there is no difference would be incorrect, making Option D the false statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference only exists up to the undergraduate level, and beyond that, there's no significant change in voting likelihood.\n\nI need to think carefully.\n\nPerhaps the answer is Option D, because in reality, there is a difference in voting likelihood between those with undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Option C, but that seems less likely because independents do tend to vote less than party affiliates.\n\nWait, no. Option C says independents are less likely to vote than Democrats or Republicans, which seems accurate.\n\nSo, if I have to choose the one that's NOT true, it might be Option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's Option A. But that seems counterintuitive. If there's a strong front-runner, people might be less motivated to vote because they think the outcome is already decided.\n\nWait, no, that makes sense, so Option A seems true.\n\nOption B also seems true, considering the dynamics between white-collar and blue-collar workers, with unionized blue-collar workers being an exception.\n\nOption C seems true as well.\n\nTherefore, perhaps Option D is the one that's not true, meaning that there is actually a difference in voting likelihood between those with undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.\n\nSo, my answer would be Option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
