                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this scenario from 1985 where a landowner leased an apartment building to a tenant for seven years. The rent was due monthly on the first day of each month. Then, in 1986, the landowner died without any heirs and left her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America in her will. The apartment building wasn't specifically mentioned in the will.\n\nSo, one month after the landowner died, the tenant found out about the death, decided to stay on the property but stopped paying rent. The Girl Scouts didn't know about the gift until 2009 when they did an inventory of their testamentary gifts and found out they had a claim to the apartment building.\n\nNow, the statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. So, if the Girl Scouts sue to eject the tenant, who would win?\n\nLet's break this down.\n\nFirst, the landowner leased the property to the tenant for seven years in 1985. So, the lease was set to end in 1992, right? Because seven years from 1985 is 1992.\n\nBut the landowner died in 1986, one year later, leaving the entire estate to the Girl Scouts, including the apartment building, even though it wasn't specifically mentioned.\n\nSo, at the time of the landowner's death, the lease was still in effect because it was a seven-year lease starting in 1985.\n\nNow, when the landowner died, her interest in the property passed to the Girl Scouts as per her will. So, the Girl Scouts became the new owners of the apartment building.\n\nThe tenant, after learning of the landowner's death, decided to stay but stopped paying rent in 1986.\n\nSo, from 1986 onwards, the tenant is occupying the property without paying rent, knowing that the original landowner has died.\n\nNow, the Girl Scouts didn't know about this property until 2009, when they did an inventory.\n\nSo, from 1986 to 2009 is more than 20 years.\n\nThe statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years.\n\nAdverse possession is when someone occupies someone else's land openly, notoriously, exclusively, and continuously for the statutory period, and at the end of that period, they can claim title to the property.\n\nSo, in this case, the tenant has been occupying the property without paying rent since 1986, which is more than 20 years before the Girl Scouts asserted their claim in 2009.\n\nSo, it seems like the tenant might have a claim to adverse possession.\n\nBut the question is, in an ejection action by the Girl Scouts against the tenant, will the Girl Scouts prevail?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\n\nWell, discontinuing rent might be relevant, but in adverse possession, non-payment of rent is one factor, but not the only one.\n\nB. If the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he was called into military service.\n\nThis introduces a new element. If the tenant sublet the property while he was in military service, that might affect the exclusivity of his possession, but it's not directly addressed in the main scenario.\n\nC. If the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.\n\nThis touches on the intent of the tenant. In adverse possession, the possession needs to be hostile, meaning without the owner's permission. If the tenant believed the lease was still in effect, maybe their possession wasn't hostile.\n\nD. Because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.\n\nPaying property taxes is one factor in adverse possession, but not always required.\n\nNow, in adverse possession, the possessor needs to possess the property openly, notoriously, exclusively, and continuously for the statutory period, and their possession should be hostile to the owner's interest.\n\nIn this case, the tenant stopped paying rent in 1986, knowing that the landowner had died, and continued to occupy the property until at least 2009.\n\nThe Girl Scouts, as the owners, didn't assert their rights until 2009, which is more than 20 years later.\n\nSo, it seems like the tenant could have established adverse possession.\n\nHowever, there are some nuances to consider.\n\nFirst, when the landowner died, the lease still had several years to go. The tenant could have argued that the lease continued under the new ownership, the Girl Scouts.\n\nBut the tenant stopped paying rent, indicating that they might be asserting some rights against the new owner.\n\nAlso, the tenant knew that the landowner had died, so they knew that the ownership had potentially changed.\n\nNow, regarding the options:\n\nOption A says \"because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\"\n\nWell, discontinuing rent might be a factor, but it's not the decisive factor in adverse possession. The key is the length of time and the nature of possession.\n\nOption B introduces a subletting situation, which might affect the exclusivity of the tenant's possession, but it's not directly addressed in the main scenario.\n\nOption C mentions that the tenant believed the lease was still in effect.\n\nThis is important because, in adverse possession, the possession needs to be hostile, meaning without the owner's permission.\n\nIf the tenant believed the lease was still in effect, their possession might not be considered hostile because they think they have a right to be there based on the lease.\n\nHowever, since the lease was with the original landowner, and the landowner died, the lease would typically pass to the heirs or successors in interest, which in this case are the Girl Scouts.\n\nSo, the tenant's belief might not make their possession hostile.\n\nOption D says \"because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.\"\n\nPaying property taxes is one factor in adverse possession, but it's not always required.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, paying property taxes is a significant factor, but in others, it's not necessary.\n\nGiven that, it's not the decisive factor here.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that the tenant's possession was continuous for more than 20 years, which is the statutory period.\n\nHowever, whether it was hostile depends on whether the tenant had a belief that they had a right to be there, which they did because of the ongoing lease.\n\nBut since the lease was with the original landowner, and the Girl Scouts inherited the property, the lease would run with the property.\n\nTherefore, the tenant should have been paying rent to the Girl Scouts, not just stopping payment.\n\nSo, the tenant's possession might not be considered hostile, which is a requirement for adverse possession.\n\nMoreover, the Girl Scouts, as the owners, could have terminated the tenant's tenancy after the original lease term expired in 1992, but they didn't know about the property until 2009.\n\nGiven that, it's complex.\n\nBut in terms of the options provided:\n\nA is about discontinuing rent, which is a factor but not decisive.\n\nB introduces subletting, which isn't directly addressed.\n\nC touches on the tenant's belief, which affects the hostility of possession.\n\nD is about not paying taxes, which is not necessarily required for adverse possession.\n\nGiven that, option C seems most relevant because if the tenant believed the lease was still in effect, their possession wasn't hostile, and thus, they didn't establish adverse possession.\n\nTherefore, the Girl Scouts would prevail in the ejection action.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
