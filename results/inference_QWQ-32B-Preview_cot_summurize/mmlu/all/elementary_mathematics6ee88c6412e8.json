                    "text": "So Tayshawn has 56 marbles and he's sorting them into equal groups with no marbles left over. That means he's dividing 56 marbles into groups where each group has the same number of marbles, and there's no remainder.\n\nI need to figure out which of these statements could be true based on that.\n\nLet's look at option A: There are 6 groups of marbles with 8 marbles in each group.\n\nSo, if there are 6 groups and each has 8 marbles, total marbles would be 6 times 8, which is 48. But Tayshawn has 56 marbles, not 48. So that doesn't match. Therefore, A can't be true.\n\nOption B: There are 7 groups of marbles with 7 marbles in each group.\n\n7 groups times 7 marbles per group is 49 marbles. But Tayshawn has 56 marbles. Again, that doesn't add up because 49 is not equal to 56. So B is also not true.\n\nOption C: There are 8 groups of marbles with 7 marbles in each group.\n\n8 groups times 7 marbles per group is 56 marbles. That matches exactly with the total number of marbles Tayshawn has. So this seems possible.\n\nOption D: There are 9 groups of marbles with 6 marbles in each group.\n\n9 groups times 6 marbles per group is 54 marbles. But Tayshawn has 56 marbles, so that would leave 2 marbles ungrouped, which contradicts the condition that there are no marbles left over. Therefore, D is not true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the only statement that could be true is option C.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the factors of 56. Since Tayshawn is sorting the marbles into equal groups with no leftovers, the number of groups must be a factor of 56, and the number of marbles in each group must also be a factor of 56, and the product of the number of groups and the number of marbles per group must equal 56.\n\nThe factors of 56 are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: 6 and 8 are both factors, but 6 is not a factor of 56. Wait, 56 divided by 8 is 7, so 8 is a factor, but 6 is not a factor of 56. Wait, no, 56 divided by 7 is 8, which we've already considered.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all possible pairs of factors that multiply to 56:\n\n1 and 56\n\n2 and 28\n\n4 and 14\n\n7 and 8\n\nThose are the pairs of positive integers that multiply to 56.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA: 6 and 8 \u2013 6 is not a factor of 56, but 8 is. But according to the list above, 7 and 8 are the correct pair.\n\nB: 7 and 7 \u2013 that would be 49, which is not 56, so that's incorrect.\n\nC: 8 and 7 \u2013 that's 56, which matches.\n\nD: 9 and 6 \u2013 9 is not a factor of 56, and 9 times 6 is 54, which is not 56.\n\nTherefore, again, only option C is correct.\n\nWait a minute, in option A, 6 and 8, 8 is a factor of 56, but 6 is not. And 6 times 8 is 48, which is less than 56, so that doesn't work.\n\nOption B has 7 and 7, which would be 49, which is also not 56.\n\nOption C has 8 and 7, which is 56, perfect.\n\nOption D has 9 and 6, which is 54, and 9 is not a factor of 56.\n\nSo, yes, C is the only correct statement.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about division. If Tayshawn has 56 marbles and he's sorting them into g groups with m marbles in each group, then g times m equals 56, and both g and m are positive integers.\n\nSo, g = 56 / m, and m = 56 / g.\n\nGiven that, in option A, g=6 and m=8, then 6 times 8 is 48, which is not 56. So incorrect.\n\nOption B: g=7 and m=7, 7 times 7 is 49, not 56. Incorrect.\n\nOption C: g=8 and m=7, 8 times 7 is 56. Correct.\n\nOption D: g=9 and m=6, 9 times 6 is 54, not 56. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
