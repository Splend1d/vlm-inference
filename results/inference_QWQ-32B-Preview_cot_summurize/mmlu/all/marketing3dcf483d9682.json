It says, \"The process of keeping a running account of merchandise on hand is referred to as...\" and then it gives four options: A. perpetual inventory, B. economic order quantity, C. book inventory, and D. physical inventory.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each of these terms means to determine which one refers to keeping a running account of merchandise.\n\nStarting with A, perpetual inventory: I think this has something to do with continuously updating inventory records every time a sale or purchase happens. So, it's like always keeping track of what you have in real-time.\n\nOption B, economic order quantity: I recall that this is a formula used to figure out the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs, including holding and ordering costs. It's more about deciding how much to order, not about keeping track of what you have.\n\nOption C, book inventory: This sounds like the inventory records kept in the books, maybe similar to accounting records. It might be related to the recorded value of inventory in the financial statements.\n\nOption D, physical inventory: This is probably the actual count of items on hand. Like, doing a stocktake where you physically count everything you have in stock.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the process of keeping a running account, which sounds like continuously updating records as transactions occur.\n\nSo, perpetual inventory seems to fit because it's about continuously updating inventory records. In contrast, physical inventory is more about periodically counting the items, not keeping a running account.\n\nBook inventory might be related, but it seems more focused on the recorded value for accounting purposes, not necessarily the ongoing tracking of quantities.\n\nEconomic order quantity is about ordering decisions, not about tracking what's on hand.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A, perpetual inventory.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider another perspective. Maybe book inventory is another term for perpetual inventory. I should check that.\n\nFrom what I remember, book inventory could refer to the inventory records as kept in the company's books, which could be updated either periodically or continuously.\n\nPerpetual inventory systems update the inventory records immediately after every transaction, whereas periodic inventory systems update the records only at specific intervals, like at the end of the accounting period.\n\nPhysical inventory is the actual count, which is used to verify the accuracy of the book inventory.\n\nGiven that, perpetual inventory is indeed the process of keeping a continuous, real-time account of merchandise on hand.\n\nSo, I'm confident that A, perpetual inventory, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
