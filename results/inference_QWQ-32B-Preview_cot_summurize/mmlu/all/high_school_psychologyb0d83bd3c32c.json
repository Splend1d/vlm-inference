First, I should probably remember what drive-reduction theories are all about.\n\nSo, drive-reduction theories suggest that organisms have internal states of tension or arousal, called drives, which motivate them to engage in behaviors that reduce these drives and restore a state of homeostasis. Basically, it's about balancing the body's needs and maintaining equilibrium.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Jerome grabs water during his race to quench his thirst. Thirst is a drive, and drinking water reduces that drive by quenching his thirst. That seems like a straightforward example of drive-reduction.\n\nOption B: Ernest eats cookies on his way to class because he didn't have time for lunch. Hunger is a drive, and eating cookies would reduce that drive by providing nourishment. Again, this aligns with drive-reduction theories.\n\nOption C: Tish skips lunch because she's still full from a big breakfast. Fullness is the opposite of hunger, so she doesn't have the drive to eat, and thus skips lunch. This also makes sense in the context of drive-reduction, as there's no drive to reduce.\n\nOption D: Kezia is very full after dinner but decides to order strawberry cheesecake anyway. Now, this seems a bit different. She's already full, which means her hunger drive is already reduced, and yet she's choosing to eat more. This doesn't seem to fit neatly with drive-reduction theories, because she's not eating to reduce a drive; in fact, she's eating despite already having reduced her hunger drive.\n\nSo, it seems like option D is the one that doesn't fit well with drive-reduction theories. Maybe she's eating for pleasure or some other reason, but not to reduce a physiological drive like hunger.\n\nWait a minute, could there be another drive at play here? Maybe she has a craving for dessert, which could be considered a separate drive. But even so, drive-reduction theories might struggle to explain why someone would eat beyond their hunger drive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she's eating due to environmental cues or emotional factors, which aren't directly related to internal physiological drives.\n\nIn any case, compared to the other options, option D seems to be the least aligned with drive-reduction theories.\n\nLet me double-check. In option A, Jerome is reducing thirst; in B, Ernest is reducing hunger; in C, Tish is responding to the absence of the hunger drive; and in D, Kezia is eating despite already having reduced her hunger drive.\n\nYes, option D appears to be the outlier here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
