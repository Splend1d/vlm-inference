                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about reflecting a pentagon across the line y = x. The pentagon P has vertices at (\u20132, \u20134), (\u20134, 1), (\u20131, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 0). After reflection, it becomes P\u2019, and I need to find one of its vertices from the given options: A. (0, \u20133), B. (4, 1), C. (2, 2), D. (\u20134, \u20132).\n\nFirst, I need to recall how reflection over the line y = x works. I remember that when you reflect a point (a, b) over y = x, it becomes (b, a). It's like swapping the x and y coordinates.\n\nSo, for each vertex of pentagon P, I'll swap the x and y coordinates to get the vertices of P\u2019.\n\nLet's do that for each point:\n\n1. (\u20132, \u20134) reflects to (\u20134, \u20132)\n\n2. (\u20134, 1) reflects to (1, \u20134)\n\n3. (\u20131, 4) reflects to (4, \u20131)\n\n4. (2, 4) reflects to (4, 2)\n\n5. (3, 0) reflects to (0, 3)\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. (0, \u20133) \u2013 This isn't one of the points I got.\n\nB. (4, 1) \u2013 Hmm, I have (1, \u20134), but not (4, 1).\n\nC. (2, 2) \u2013 I don't see this one.\n\nD. (\u20134, \u20132) \u2013 Oh, this is the reflection of (\u20132, \u20134).\n\nWait a minute, (\u20134, \u20132) is option D, and it matches one of the vertices I calculated.\n\nBut let's double-check if any other option matches.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- (\u20132, \u20134) \u2192 (\u20134, \u20132)\n\n- (\u20134, 1) \u2192 (1, \u20134)\n\n- (\u20131, 4) \u2192 (4, \u20131)\n\n- (2, 4) \u2192 (4, 2)\n\n- (3, 0) \u2192 (0, 3)\n\nNone of the other options match these points except for (\u20134, \u20132), which is option D.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. (\u20134, \u20132).\n\nBut wait, the question says \"one of the vertices of P\u2019 is\" and option D is indeed one of them.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, maybe I should check if any of the other options could be correct due to some mistake.\n\nLet me see:\n\nOption A: (0, \u20133)\n\nIs there any original point where x=\u20133 or y=\u20133?\n\nLooking at the original points:\n\n(\u20132, \u20134), (\u20134, 1), (\u20131, 4), (2, 4), (3, 0)\n\nNone have \u20133 in either coordinate, so reflecting them should not produce \u20133 in either coordinate, unless there's a calculation error.\n\nWait, unless there's a mistake in the reflection rule.\n\nWait, reflection over y = x is indeed swapping x and y coordinates.\n\nSo, no, (0, \u20133) shouldn't be a vertex of P\u2019.\n\nOption B: (4, 1)\n\nLooking at the reflected points, (4, 1) isn't among them.\n\nWait, (\u20134, 1) reflects to (1, \u20134), not (4, 1).\n\nSo, no.\n\nOption C: (2, 2)\n\nNone of the original points have both coordinates as 2, and swapping won't produce (2, 2).\n\nOption D: (\u20134, \u20132) is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reflection is over y = -x, but the problem says y = x.\n\nWait, the problem says \"reflected across the line y = x\", so it's correct to swap x and y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about reflection over y = x, but perhaps there's a different transformation.\n\nWait, no, it's reflection over y = x, so swapping is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original points are misread.\n\nWait, let's read the original points again:\n\n(\u20132, \u20134), (\u20134, 1), (\u20131, 4), (2, 4), (3, 0)\n\nReflecting:\n\n(\u20132, \u20134) \u2192 (\u20134, \u20132)\n\n(\u20134, 1) \u2192 (1, \u20134)\n\n(\u20131, 4) \u2192 (4, \u20131)\n\n(2, 4) \u2192 (4, 2)\n\n(3, 0) \u2192 (0, 3)\n\nNone of these match options A, B, or C, but option D is (\u20134, \u20132), which matches the reflection of (\u20132, \u20134).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. (\u20134, \u20132)\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe there's a different interpretation of \"reflection across y = x\".\n\nWait, perhaps considering the general reflection formula.\n\nThe formula for reflecting a point (x, y) over y = x is indeed (y, x).\n\nSo, (x, y) \u2192 (y, x).\n\nSo, applying that:\n\n(\u20132, \u20134) \u2192 (\u20134, \u20132)\n\n(\u20134, 1) \u2192 (1, \u20134)\n\n(\u20131, 4) \u2192 (4, \u20131)\n\n(2, 4) \u2192 (4, 2)\n\n(3, 0) \u2192 (0, 3)\n\nStill, the same results.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (0, \u20133) \u2013 Not matching any reflected points.\n\nB. (4, 1) \u2013 Not matching.\n\nC. (2, 2) \u2013 Not matching.\n\nD. (\u20134, \u20132) \u2013 Matches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. (\u20134, \u20132)\n\nBut, to consider all possibilities, maybe there's a typo in the problem or the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reflection is over y = x, but maybe the question is about translation or another transformation.\n\nWait, no, it specifically says reflection across y = x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coordinates are being read differently.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe after reflection, there is a translation or another transformation.\n\nBut the problem states only reflection across y = x, so no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the pentagon as a shape, and one of its vertices after reflection matches one of these points.\n\nBut, based on the reflection, only (\u20134, \u20132) matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that reflection might involve changing the signs, but no, over y = x, it's just swapping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the line y = x differently, but no, the standard reflection is swapping coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the graph to see if any points coincide.\n\nBut, without graphing, based on the coordinates, only (\u20134, \u20132) matches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. (\u20134, \u20132)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
