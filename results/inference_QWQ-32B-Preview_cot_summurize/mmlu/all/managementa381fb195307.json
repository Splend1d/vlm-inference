Corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is about companies being accountable for their actions and contributing to economic, social, and environmental sustainability. So, characteristics of CSR would include things like ensuring product safety, respecting consumer rights, and implementing environmental policies. But price-fixing sounds different. Isn't that something related to setting prices illegally?\n\nI think price-fixing is when companies collude to set prices at a certain level, which is against antitrust laws. That doesn't sound like social responsibility; it seems more like unethical business practice. So, among the options given, price-fixing probably isn't a characteristic of CSR.\n\nLet me double-check. Product safety is definitely part of CSR because companies have a responsibility to ensure their products don't harm customers. Consumer rights are also important in CSR, as companies should respect and protect the rights of their consumers. Environmental policies are a big part of CSR, as companies are expected to minimize their environmental impact.\n\nSo, if price-fixing is about illegally setting prices, that would be unethical and against the law, which goes against the principles of CSR. Therefore, the answer should be D. Price-fixing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
