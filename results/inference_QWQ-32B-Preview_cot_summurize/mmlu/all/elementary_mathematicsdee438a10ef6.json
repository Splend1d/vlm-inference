I need to check each option to see if the two expressions are equal when the variables are positive.\n\nStarting with option A: 3(x + 2) and 3x + 2.\n\nI can distribute the 3 in the first expression: 3*x + 3*2 = 3x + 6.\n\nSo, 3(x + 2) = 3x + 6, which is not the same as 3x + 2.\n\nTherefore, option A is not equivalent.\n\nNext, option B: 4d + 2e and 8d + e.\n\nI need to see if 4d + 2e equals 8d + e for all positive d and e.\n\nWell, if I subtract 4d from both sides, I get 2e = 4d + e.\n\nThen, subtract e from both sides: e = 4d.\n\nSo, unless e is equal to 4d, these expressions are not equal.\n\nTherefore, option B is not equivalent for any variable value greater than zero.\n\nOption C: f + f + f + g and 3fg.\n\nFirst, f + f + f + g = 3f + g.\n\nNow, 3f + g is not the same as 3fg, which would be 3*f*g.\n\nSo, these are different expressions.\n\nTherefore, option C is not equivalent.\n\nFinally, option D: b + b + 3c and 2b + 3c.\n\nb + b + 3c = 2b + 3c.\n\nThis matches the second expression exactly.\n\nSo, for any positive values of b and c, these expressions are equal.\n\nTherefore, option D is equivalent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
