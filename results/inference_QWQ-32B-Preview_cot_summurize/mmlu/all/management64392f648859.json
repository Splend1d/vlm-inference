Process improvement\n\nB. Techno-structural change model\n\nC. Job characteristics model\n\nD. Socio-technical systems\n\nI need to choose the one that focuses on these aspects. Let me think about each option.\n\nFirst, process improvement. I know that process improvement is about making processes more efficient and effective. It's about streamlining how work is done to eliminate waste and improve quality. But does it directly focus on job satisfaction and productivity? Maybe indirectly, but I'm not sure if it's the primary focus.\n\nNext, the techno-structural change model. This seems to be about changes in technology and structure within an organization. It probably looks at how new technologies affect the way work is organized and performed. Again, it might impact productivity, but I'm not sure about job satisfaction being a central aspect.\n\nNow, the job characteristics model. I recall that this model is specifically designed to enhance intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, and performance by modifying the nature of the job itself. It proposes that jobs should have certain core dimensions like skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback, which lead to higher job satisfaction and performance. This sounds very much aligned with the key characteristics mentioned in the question.\n\nLastly, socio-technical systems. This approach looks at the interaction between social and technical aspects of work. It aims to design work systems that consider both the social needs of employees and the technical requirements of the job. It seems to focus on integrating people and technology to improve overall system performance, which could include job satisfaction and productivity, but maybe not as directly as the job characteristics model.\n\nComparing all these, the job characteristics model seems to be the most directly concerned with enhancing job satisfaction and productivity through specific job design features. So, I think the answer is C. Job characteristics model.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check.\n\nProcess improvement is more about efficiency and quality, not necessarily about job satisfaction.\n\nTechno-structural change model is about adapting to technological and structural changes, which may affect productivity but isn't primarily focused on job satisfaction.\n\nSocio-technical systems consider both social and technical aspects, aiming for overall system improvement, which includes but may not exclusively focus on job satisfaction and productivity.\n\nTherefore, the job characteristics model is the most appropriate choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
