He does not think the symptoms are problematic, but his wife is concerned because he sometimes falls asleep on the sofa early in the evening when guests are present. He also once fell asleep while driving at night and drove off the road, narrowly avoiding injury. His wife says that he has always snored loudly, and over the past year, he has had episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 105 kg (231 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2 . His pulse is 76/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 150/76 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. 24-Hour ambulatory ECG monitoring\nB. Multiple sleep latency test\nC. Polysomnography\nD. CT scan of the head\n"

                    "text": "So this guy, 52 years old, is seeing the doctor because he's been really sleepy during the day for about a year. His wife is the one who's mostly worried because he falls asleep at awkward times, like when there are guests over, and even while driving at night, which is super dangerous. She's noticed he snores really loud and sometimes gasps for air while sleeping.\n\nHe's a bit overweight; he's 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 231 pounds, which gives him a BMI of 33, which is considered obese. His vital signs are mostly normal: heart rate 76, breathing 14 times a minute, blood pressure 150/76, which is a bit high on the systolic side.\n\nThe doctor needs to figure out what's causing his excessive daytime sleepiness. There are a few options provided: 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, multiple sleep latency test, polysomnography, or a CT scan of the head.\n\nFirst, let's think about what could be causing his sleepiness. Given his obesity, snoring, and gasping during sleep, it sounds like he might have sleep apnea, which is a condition where someone stops breathing for short periods during sleep, leading to poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness.\n\nOption A is a 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitor. That's used to check for heart rhythm problems over a day. While sleep apnea can affect heart rhythms, this doesn't directly diagnose sleep apnea.\n\nOption B is a multiple sleep latency test. This is used to measure how sleepy someone is by seeing how fast they fall asleep in a quiet environment during the day. It's useful for diagnosing conditions like narcolepsy, but it doesn't diagnose the cause of the sleepiness, like sleep apnea.\n\nOption C is polysomnography, which is a sleep study. It monitors various aspects of sleep, including brain activity, eye movements, muscle activity, heart rhythm, and breathing during sleep. This is the gold standard for diagnosing sleep apnea because it can detect pauses in breathing and drops in blood oxygen levels.\n\nOption D is a CT scan of the head. That's imaging of the brain and isn't typically used to diagnose sleep disorders unless there's a specific suspicion of a brain abnormality causing the symptoms.\n\nGiven all this, polysomnography (option C) is most likely to confirm the diagnosis of sleep apnea, which seems to be the most probable cause of his excessive daytime sleepiness based on his symptoms and obesity.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Polysomnography.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
