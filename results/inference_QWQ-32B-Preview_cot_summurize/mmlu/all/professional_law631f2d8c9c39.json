                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about joint tenancy and mortgages in a \"lien theory\" state. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key terms and concepts here. The woman and her partner own a property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. That means that both of them own equal shares in the property, and when one dies, their interest automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant. So, typically, the surviving joint tenant would end up owning the entire property.\n\nNow, the partner ran up some debts without telling her and used his interest in the property to get a mortgage from the bank. The crucial point here is that this mortgage was taken out secretly, without the woman's knowledge or consent.\n\nWhen the partner dies, the bank tries to execute on the mortgage. The question is whether the bank can do so, and the answer depends on how the law treats mortgages in joint tenancy situations, particularly in a \"lien theory\" state.\n\nI need to recall what \"lien theory\" means. In a lien theory state, when a mortgage is executed, it's considered a lien on the property rather than a conveyance of title. So, the mortgagor still holds legal title, and the mortgagee has a lien interest.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nB. No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.\n\nC. Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.\n\nD. Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.\n\nOkay, so options A and C are basically saying opposite things: A says the mortgage lien doesn't destroy joint tenancy, and C says it does and the bank can execute on the lien.\n\nOption B says the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, but the bank needs a deed of trust to execute on the property.\n\nOption D says the mortgage is like a deed of trust, severing the joint tenancy and giving the bank full authority to execute on the mortgage.\n\nI need to figure out which of these is correct under the majority view in lien theory states.\n\nFirst, in lien theory states, a mortgage creates a lien on the property without conveying legal title to the mortgagee. So, the mortgagor still owns the property, subject to the mortgage lien.\n\nNow, regarding joint tenancies, one key feature is the right of survivorship. When one joint tenant dies, their interest passes automatically to the surviving joint tenants.\n\nBut what happens if one joint tenant mortgages their interest? Does that sever the joint tenancy?\n\nI recall that certain acts by a joint tenant can sever the joint tenancy, such as mortgaging their interest. However, I need to confirm whether this is the majority view, especially in lien theory states.\n\nLet me think about this. If a joint tenant mortgages their interest, is that considered an act that severs the joint tenancy?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, yes, it does sever the joint tenancy, converting it into a tenancy in common. In others, maybe not.\n\nWait, but in a lien theory state, since the mortgage is just a lien and not a conveyance of title, perhaps it doesn't sever the joint tenancy.\n\nBut, if the mortgage is on the interest of one joint tenant, does that affect the right of survivorship?\n\nI need to consider how the mortgage affects the ownership interests.\n\nLet's consider that the partner mortgaged his interest in the property. If the joint tenancy isn't severed, then when he dies, his interest passes to the surviving joint tenant by survivorship.\n\nBut the bank has a mortgage lien on his interest. So, does the bank's lien attach to the interest that passes to the surviving joint tenant?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look at it from the perspective of the surviving joint tenant's rights.\n\nThe surviving joint tenant would claim that upon the death of the other joint tenant, she now owns the entire property, free of any liens that only attached to the deceased's interest.\n\nBut the bank would argue that their mortgage lien on the deceased's interest continues to burden the property.\n\nThis seems to be a conflict between the right of survivorship and the mortgage lien.\n\nI need to know which one takes precedence: the right of survivorship or the mortgage lien.\n\nIn lien theory states, typically, the mortgage lien is subordinate to the right of survivorship in a joint tenancy.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mortgage lien attaches to the interest of the mortgagor, and when that interest passes to the surviving joint tenant by survivorship, the lien passes with it.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider the majority view on this issue.\n\nAfter some research, I recall that in many jurisdictions, particularly in lien theory states, a mortgage by one joint tenant doesn't sever the joint tenancy unless certain conditions are met.\n\nIn some places, the mortgage may not sever the joint tenancy, meaning that the right of survivorship remains intact.\n\nHowever, the mortgage lien may still attach to the interest of the mortgagor, and when that joint tenant dies, the lien may pass to the surviving joint tenant's interest.\n\nBut this seems to vary by jurisdiction.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A says no, the mortgage lien couldn't destroy the joint tenancy, and the property passes to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nOption C says yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy.\n\nOption B says no, but the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, and the bank needs a deed of trust to execute on the property.\n\nOption D says yes, the mortgage is equivalent to a deed of trust and severs the joint tenancy, giving the bank unfettered authority to execute on the mortgage.\n\nGiven that, I need to determine which of these aligns with the majority view.\n\nI think the majority view is that in lien theory states, a mortgage by one joint tenant doesn't sever the joint tenancy, but the mortgage lien attaches to the mortgagor's interest.\n\nWhen the mortgagor dies, their interest passes to the surviving joint tenant by survivorship, and the lien passes with it.\n\nTherefore, the bank can execute on its lien against the surviving joint tenant's interest.\n\nSo, in effect, the bank can enforce its mortgage against the property, even though the joint tenancy wasn't severed.\n\nWait, but option A says no, the mortgage lien couldn't destroy the joint tenancy, and the property passes to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nBut it doesn't mention anything about the bank's ability to execute on the mortgage.\n\nOption C says yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.\n\nBut if the mortgage doesn't destroy the joint tenancy, as per the majority view, then option C might not be accurate.\n\nOption B says no, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust to execute on jointly owned property.\n\nBut if the mortgage doesn't destroy the joint tenancy, this might not be correct.\n\nOption D says yes, the mortgage was equivalent to a deed of trust and severed the joint tenancy, giving the bank unfettered authority to execute on the mortgage.\n\nAgain, if the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, this might not be accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the difference between lien theory and title theory states.\n\nIn title theory states, the mortgagee temporarily holds legal title to the property, and the mortgagor has equitable title.\n\nIn lien theory states, the mortgagor retains legal title, and the mortgagee has a lien.\n\nGiven that, in lien theory states, the mortgagor still owns the property, subject to the mortgage lien.\n\nSo, in the case of joint tenancy, if one joint tenant mortgages their interest, the mortgage lien attaches to their interest, but the joint tenancy isn't severed.\n\nWhen that joint tenant dies, their interest passes to the surviving joint tenant by survivorship, and the lien passes to the surviving joint tenant's interest.\n\nTherefore, the bank can enforce its lien against the surviving joint tenant's interest.\n\nSo, in effect, the bank can execute on its mortgage, even though the joint tenancy wasn't severed.\n\nTherefore, perhaps option A is closest, but it doesn't explicitly address the bank's ability to execute on the mortgage.\n\nWait, option A says no, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nBut it doesn't say anything about the bank's ability to execute on the mortgage.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, even though the joint tenancy isn't destroyed, the bank's lien still attaches to the property, and the bank can execute on it.\n\nSo, perhaps option A isn't entirely accurate because it doesn't account for the bank's rights.\n\nOption C says yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.\n\nBut in lien theory states, the bank doesn't get title to the property; it only has a lien.\n\nSo, that's not accurate.\n\nOption B says no, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust to execute on jointly owned property.\n\nBut in lien theory states, a mortgage is distinct from a deed of trust, although they can serve similar functions.\n\nOption D says yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.\n\nAgain, in lien theory states, a mortgage isn't equivalent to a deed of trust, and it may not sever the joint tenancy.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps none of the options perfectly capture the nuances of the situation.\n\nHowever, based on the majority view that a mortgage by one joint tenant in a lien theory state doesn't sever the joint tenancy but allows the mortgage lien to attach to the interest that passes by survivorship, the closest answer might be option A, with the understanding that the bank can still enforce its lien against the surviving joint tenant's interest.\n\nBut option A doesn't explicitly address the bank's ability to execute on the mortgage, so it's a bit misleading.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the bank can execute on its mortgage, but the joint tenancy isn't severed, which might not be directly stated in any of the options.\n\nGiven the options provided, I would choose option A, but with the caveat that the bank can still enforce its lien against the surviving joint tenant's interest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option C is closer, but it incorrectly states that the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, which, under the majority view in lien theory states, it doesn't.\n\nThis is a bit tricky, and it seems like the question might be expecting a specific answer based on the majority view, which I believe is that the mortgage lien doesn't destroy the joint tenancy, but the bank can still enforce its lien against the property.\n\nTherefore, option A might be the best choice, even though it doesn't fully address the bank's rights.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the mortgage severs the joint tenancy, but I don't think that's the majority view in lien theory states.\n\nI need to make a decision based on the options provided.\n\nOption A seems to be the most accurate, but with the understanding that the bank can still execute on its mortgage lien against the surviving joint tenant's interest.\n\nSo, I'll go with option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
