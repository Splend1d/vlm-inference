Let's see:\n\nOption A says that only human beings have direct moral standing. That sounds like anthropocentrism, where humans are considered the central or most important entity. Biocentrism, I think, is about broader life forms, not just humans. So maybe A isn't the right one.\n\nOption B says that all and only sentient creatures have direct moral standing. Sentient means able to feel or perceive things. So this seems to include animals that can feel pain or experience emotions, but not plants or microorganisms, maybe. Is biocentrism about sentience? I'm not sure.\n\nOption C says that all living beings have direct moral standing because they are living. This sounds more inclusive, including plants, microbes, everything that is alive. That seems like it could be biocentrism, as it centers on all life.\n\nOption D talks about ecosystems having direct moral standing due to their functional integrity. This seems more like ecocentrism, where the focus is on the health and balance of entire ecosystems rather than individual living beings.\n\nSo, biocentrism should be about the value of life itself, right? It should emphasize the moral importance of all living things, not just humans or sentient beings, but everything that is alive. So, maybe option C is the correct one.\n\nBut let me double-check. I recall that biocentrism is a term often associated with the idea that life is the central concept in understanding the world, and that all living things have intrinsic value. That aligns with option C, which says that all living beings possess direct moral standing because they are living.\n\nOption A is definitely more anthropocentric, which is different from biocentrism. Option B is closer to sentiocentrism, which is another ethical viewpoint. Option D seems more focused on ecosystems as a whole rather than individual living beings.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: all living beings, because they are living, possess direct moral standing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
