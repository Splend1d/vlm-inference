                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says a completely submerged object always displaces its own... and then it gives options: weight of fluid, volume of fluid, density of fluid, or all of these.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for an object to be completely submerged in a fluid. When an object is fully submerged, it means that it is completely enclosed by the fluid, right? Now, displacement refers to the amount of fluid that the object pushes aside or moves out of the way to make space for itself.\n\nI think this relates to Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. So, from that, I know that the object displaces a certain amount of fluid, and that's related to the buoyant force.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: weight of fluid.\n\nAccording to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force equals the weight of the fluid displaced. So, the object displaces an amount of fluid whose weight is equal to the buoyant force. But the question is asking what the object displaces: its own weight of fluid, volume of fluid, or density of fluid.\n\nWait, the object displaces a certain weight of fluid, but is that equal to its own weight? Not necessarily. The buoyant force equals the weight of the fluid displaced, and this buoyant force affects the apparent weight of the object in the fluid. But the amount of fluid displaced should be based on the object's volume, not necessarily its weight.\n\nLet me think about that again. If an object is completely submerged, it displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. The weight of that displaced fluid would then depend on the fluid's density.\n\nSo, perhaps the object displaces its own volume of fluid, not its own weight of fluid.\n\nOption B: volume of fluid.\n\nThis seems more accurate. When an object is completely submerged, it displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. That makes sense because it's pushing aside the fluid to make space for itself.\n\nOption C: density of fluid.\n\nDensity is a property of the fluid itself, not something that the object displaces. So, this doesn't make much sense. The object doesn't displace its own density of fluid. Density is mass per unit volume, and displacement refers to volume of fluid.\n\nOption D: All of these.\n\nGiven that option C doesn't seem to make sense, this probably isn't the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the relationship between the object's density and the fluid's density. If the object's density is greater than the fluid's, it will sink and displace a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. If the object's density is less than the fluid's, it would float, but since the question specifies that the object is completely submerged, we're only considering cases where the object's density is greater than or equal to the fluid's density.\n\nBut actually, objects less dense than the fluid can be forced to stay submerged, right? Like, if you have a piece of wood and you push it below the water surface, it's still completely submerged, but it naturally wants to float back up.\n\nSo, in any case, when an object is completely submerged, it displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume, regardless of its density compared to the fluid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that the object displaces its own volume of fluid.\n\nWait, but option A says \"weight of fluid.\" Is there a relationship between the object's weight and the weight of the displaced fluid?\n\nIn terms of buoyancy, the buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid. If the object is in equilibrium, meaning it's neither sinking nor floating, then its weight must equal the buoyant force, which equals the weight of the displaced fluid. So, in that specific case, the object displaces a weight of fluid equal to its own weight.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify that the object is in equilibrium. It just says \"a completely submerged object always displaces its own...\"\n\nSo, in general, for any completely submerged object, regardless of whether it's in equilibrium or not, it displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. The weight of that displaced fluid would depend on the fluid's density.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is that it displaces its own volume of fluid.\n\nOption B seems to be the correct choice.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Let's think about the units.\n\nVolume is in cubic meters, liters, etc., and weight is in newtons, pounds, etc. They are different quantities.\n\nSo, the object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume, and the weight of that displaced fluid can be calculated by multiplying the volume by the fluid's density and gravity.\n\nBut the question is asking what the object displaces: its own weight of fluid, volume of fluid, or density of fluid.\n\nGiven that displacement is a volume, not a weight or a density, option B seems correct.\n\nHowever, in the context of buoyancy, both volume and weight are related through the fluid's density.\n\nBut the question is phrased in a way that it's displacing \"its own\" weight or volume or density.\n\nIf it's displacing its own weight of fluid, that would imply that the weight of the displaced fluid is equal to the weight of the object. But that's only true if the object is in equilibrium, i.e., neither sinking nor floating, which isn't specified in the question.\n\nOn the other hand, the object always displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume when it's completely submerged, regardless of its density or the fluid's density.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\nOption C, density of fluid, doesn't make sense in this context because displacement is a volume, not a density.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. Volume of fluid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
