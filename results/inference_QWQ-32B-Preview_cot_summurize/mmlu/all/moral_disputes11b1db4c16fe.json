                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Corvino's reading of Aquinas regarding \"unnatural\" sexual acts. The options are:\n\nA. deliberately pro-creative.\n\nB. non-consensual.\n\nC. deliberately non-procreative.\n\nD. uncommonly practiced among adults.\n\nI need to figure out which one Corvino thinks Aquinas would consider \"unnatural.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Aquinas thought about sexual acts and what he meant by \"natural\" and \"unnatural.\" I remember that Aquinas based his ethics on natural law, which holds that moral goodness aligns with the natural purpose or end of things.\n\nIn the context of sexuality, Aquinas believed that the natural end of sexual acts is procreation and unity between husband and wife. So, any sexual act that doesn't meet these criteria would be considered unnatural by him.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Deliberately pro-creative.\n\nWell, if the natural end includes procreation, then deliberately aiming for procreation would seem natural, not unnatural. So, this doesn't make sense as the answer.\n\nB. Non-consensual.\n\nNon-consensual acts, like rape, are certainly unethical, but I'm not sure if Aquinas would specifically label them as \"unnatural\" in the same way as, say, same-sex acts. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nC. Deliberately non-procreative.\n\nThis seems interesting. If Aquinas thinks that procreation is the natural end of sexual acts, then acts that are deliberately non-procreative might be considered unnatural.\n\nD. Uncommonly practiced among adults.\n\nThis seems more about popularity or frequency rather than about the nature of the act itself. I don't think Aquinas would base morality on how common an act is.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at Corvino's interpretation. Corvino is a contemporary philosopher who discusses same-sex marriage and morality. In his work, he often engages with traditional natural law arguments, including those inspired by Aquinas.\n\nIn Corvino's view, Aquinas considered sexual acts unnatural if they thwart or don't aim at procreation. So, acts that are deliberately non-procreative would be seen as unnatural.\n\nLet me think about this. If sexual acts are meant for procreation, then using contraception or engaging in acts that can't result in procreation would be unnatural.\n\nOption C says \"deliberately non-procreative.\" That seems to fit.\n\nBut option A is \"deliberately pro-creative.\" Wouldn't that be the natural thing to do, according to Aquinas? So, that shouldn't be considered unnatural.\n\nOption B, non-consensual acts, are certainly immoral, but I think Aquinas would consider them sinful for reasons of violating justice or respect for persons, not necessarily because they are \"unnatural\" in the same sense as, say, homosexual acts.\n\nOption D, uncommonly practiced, seems more about social norms than about the nature of the act.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be C: deliberately non-procreative.\n\nWait, but I recall that Aquinas also considered adultery and fornication as unnatural, even though those acts can be procreative. So maybe there's more to it.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe Aquinas had a broader concept of natural law that includes both procreation and the proper context of marriage.\n\nIn that case, any sexual act outside of marriage would be unnatural, even if it's procreative.\n\nBut according to the options, none of them specify the context of marriage.\n\nOption B is about consent, which is related but not exactly the same as being within marriage.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that the question is about Corvino's reading of Aquinas, and Corvino focuses on the procreative aspect in his discussions of same-sex marriage, it's likely that the answer is C: deliberately non-procreative.\n\nMoreover, in natural law theory, sexual acts are meant to be both procreative and unitive, and any act that separates these ends is considered immoral.\n\nSo, if an act is deliberately non-procreative, it's separating the procreative end from the act, which would make it unnatural.\n\nTherefore, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
