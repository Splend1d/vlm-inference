                    "text": "I'm trying to recall what Ross said about constructing a moral theory. Let's see, option A suggests constructing logical proofs for moral principles. That sounds pretty formal and analytical. Ross was a philosopher, and some philosophers do try to build moral theories through logical deduction. But I think Ross had a different approach.\n\nOption B is about consulting social conventions. That means looking at what society accepts as moral and building a theory based on that. But I recall that Ross was concerned about the relativity of social norms and maybe didn't think that was a solid foundation for a universal moral theory.\n\nOption C says reflecting on what we really think. This sounds like introspection or considering our intuitions about moral issues. Ross was known for his theory of prima facie duties, which were based on moral intuitions. So, this seems promising.\n\nOption D is consulting scripture. That would involve basing moral theory on religious texts. Ross was a British philosopher, and while religion might have influenced his thinking, I don't think he advocated for building moral theory solely on scripture.\n\nLet me think again. In his book \"The Right and the Good,\" Ross talks about intuitionism in ethics. He believed that certain moral principles are self-evident and can be known through intuition. So, it seems like he was more about reflecting on our moral judgments and intuitions rather than relying on logic alone, social conventions, or scripture.\n\nMoreover, he criticized utilitarianism, which tries to base morality on the greatest happiness principle, and deontological theories that rely heavily on rules and duties derived from rationality. Instead, he proposed that there are multiple self-evident moral principles that we intuitively grasp.\n\nTherefore, among the options given, option C: reflecting on what we really think, aligns best with Ross's approach to constructing a moral theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
