                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"When I arrived at the party I threw urine into the air.\"\n\nFirst, throwing urine into the air at a party is generally considered disgusting and inappropriate behavior. It's not something that aligns with social norms or etiquette. Urine is a bodily fluid that is typically kept private and managed through sanitary measures. Publicly displaying or throwing urine would be seen as a violation of personal hygiene and respect for others' senses and comfort.\n\nMoreover, such an act could be seen as a form of public disturbance or even a health hazard, depending on the context. It might also be considered a deliberate attempt to shock or offend others, which doesn't align with moral standards of respect and consideration for others' feelings.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action would be considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I threw the cobra to my daughter.\"\n\nThis scenario is quite alarming. Throwing a cobra, which is a highly venomous snake, to one's daughter is extremely dangerous and reckless. Cobras are known for their potent venom, which can be fatal to humans, especially children who are more vulnerable due to their smaller size.\n\nAs a parent, one has a moral obligation to protect their children from harm and to ensure their safety. Intentionally putting a child in danger by throwing a dangerous animal like a cobra to them is a severe breach of that responsibility. It could be considered acts of negligence, abuse, or even attempted harm.\n\nUnder ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, such an action would be universally condemned as morally wrong.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBoth scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
