                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 15-year-old boy who came in with a painful swelling on his sacral area after falling during a wrestling match. It's been two days, and he has a low-grade fever. On exam, there's a red, fluctuant, elevated mass with three midline pores, and the rectal exam didn't show any induration or pain. I need to figure out what's most likely going on here.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Anocutaneous fistula\n\nB. Coccygodynia\n\nC. Hidradenitis suppurativa\n\nD. Pilonidal abscess\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the sacral prominence is. I think it's the area right above the tailbone, near the lower part of the spine. So, that makes sense for conditions like pilonidal cysts or hidradenitis.\n\nHe had a fall during a wrestling match, which might have injured the area or maybe caused some trauma that led to an infection.\n\nHe has a painful swelling, erythematous, which means red, and fluctuant, which suggests it's filled with fluid, probably pus given the fever. There are three midline pores, which sounds like small openings or holes.\n\nRectal exam is normal, no induration or pain, which is good, but I need to see if that rules out certain options.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. Anocutaneous fistula: This is a tract that connects the anal canal to the skin around the anus. It's usually associated with chronic infection or inflammation, like in Crohn's disease or after an anal abscess. But in this case, the swelling is on the sacral prominence, not directly around the anus, and it started acutely after a fall. So, maybe less likely, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nB. Coccygodynia: This is pain in the coccyx area, often due to injury or inflammation of the coccyx. But here, there's a swelling and pus-like fluctuation, which seems more than just pain in the coccyx. So, probably not the primary issue.\n\nC. Hidradenitis suppurativa: This is a chronic skin condition where there are recurrent boil-like lumps in areas where the skin rubs together, like under the arms, between the buttocks, or in the groin. It's associated with blocked apocrine glands. The midline pores could be related to hair follicles or sweat glands. But typically, hidradenitis affects areas with apocrine glands, which are different from the ones in the sacral area.\n\nD. Pilonidal abscess: This is a common condition, especially in young men, where there's an infection in the skin near the tailbone, often involving hair follicles. It can cause a painful swelling with pus, and sometimes there are sinus tracts or pores from previous infections.\n\nGiven that the patient is a 15-year-old male, had a fall, has a painful, erythematous, fluctuant mass with midline pores, and normal rectal exam, pilonidal abscess seems like the most likely diagnosis.\n\nLet me double-check the other options.\n\nAnocutaneous fistula might present with discharge from a perianal area, but the location seems a bit different here.\n\nCoccygodynia would mainly present with pain, but likely without the swelling and fluctuance.\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa could cause swelling and pus, but it's less common in the sacral area and more in skin folds.\n\nSo, pilonidal abscess makes the most sense.\n\nI think the answer is D. Pilonidal abscess.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
