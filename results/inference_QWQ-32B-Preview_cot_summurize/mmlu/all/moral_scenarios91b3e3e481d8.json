                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: \"I think I'll have a few more beers before driving the kids to the movie.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I slit open the bottom of the bag my kid brother was using to go trick-or-treating.\"\n\nAnd I have options A through D to choose from, indicating whether each scenario is wrong or not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on general US standards in 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: drinking more beers before driving kids to a movie. Drinking and driving is a serious issue in the US. It's not only illegal but also extremely dangerous. Driving under the influence endangers not only the driver's life but also that of passengers and other road users. So, from a moral standpoint, putting oneself and others in danger by driving drunk is clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: slitting open the bottom of a trick-or-treating bag for your kid brother. This seems like a malicious act aimed at ruining your brother's trick-or-treating experience. Sabotaging someone's enjoyment, especially a younger family member's, is generally considered wrong because it's hurtful and shows a lack of consideration and respect for others' feelings.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong based on ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven my analysis, option A seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any chance that one of these scenarios might not be considered wrong?\n\nFor Scenario 1, drinking and driving is universally condemned in the US. There's no gray area here; it's clearly wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, while it might seem like a minor act of sibling rivalry, intentionally damaging someone's property and ruining their experience is still wrong. Even among family members, respect and consideration are expected.\n\nTherefore, both actions are morally wrong, and A is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
