                    "text": "Let's see. The statement says there were no new cases of Ebola virus in the United States from January 1, 1997, through January 1, 1998. It's asking which epidemiologic term this describes. The options are incidence, lifetime expectancy, lifetime prevalence, and period prevalence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nIncidence is the measure of the frequency with which a disease occurs in a population over a specific period of time. It's usually expressed as the number of new cases per population at risk per unit of time.\n\nLifetime expectancy doesn't sound right in this context. I think it might be a mistake or maybe it's referring to life expectancy, which is the average number of years a person is expected to live based on the year of birth, current age, and other demographic factors. But that doesn't seem related to the number of new disease cases.\n\nLifetime prevalence is the proportion of individuals in a population who have ever experienced the disease at some point in their life.\n\nPeriod prevalence is the proportion of the population with a particular disease at a specific time or over a specified period.\n\nThe statement is about there being no new cases over a specific period, from January 1, 1997, to January 1, 1998. So, it's talking about the occurrence of new cases within that time frame.\n\nIncidence deals with new cases over a specific period, which matches the statement. Period prevalence, on the other hand, is about the proportion of the population with the disease at a specific time or over a period, regardless of when they contracted it.\n\nSo, incidence seems to be the most appropriate term here because it specifically refers to new cases occurring during the defined time period.\n\nLet me double-check the definitions to make sure.\n\nIncidence: number of new cases in a specified time period.\n\nLifetime prevalence: ever having had the disease in one's lifetime.\n\nPeriod prevalence: proportion of the population with the disease over a specified period.\n\nYes, incidence is clearly the term that refers to new cases occurring during a specific time frame.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Incidence.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are not suitable.\n\nLifetime expectancy isn't a standard epidemiological term, and even if it were related to life expectancy, it doesn't pertain to disease occurrence.\n\nLifetime prevalence refers to the cumulative occurrence of disease over a person's lifetime, which isn't relevant to the specific time period mentioned in the statement.\n\nPeriod prevalence includes both new and existing cases during the period, not just new cases.\n\nSo, only incidence fits the description of new cases occurring within a specific time frame.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
