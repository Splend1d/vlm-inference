We need to find out the total number of straws he used for all the shapes.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many straws he used for the initial 9 shapes. Since each shape has 5 straws, I can multiply the number of shapes by the number of straws per shape. So, 9 shapes times 5 straws each that's 9 times 5.\n\nLet me calculate that: 9 times 5 is 45. So, he used 45 straws for the first 9 shapes.\n\nNext, he used 15 more straws to make more shapes. So, I need to add those 15 straws to the initial 45 straws to find the total number of straws he used.\n\nSo, 45 plus 15 that's 60.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. 45 plus 15 should indeed be 60.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 20\n\nB. 29\n\nC. 45\n\nD. 60\n\nOption D is 60, which matches the total I calculated.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says Conor made 9 shapes with 5 straws each, which is 45 straws, and then he used 15 more straws to make more shapes. It doesn't specify how many additional shapes he made with those 15 straws, but it says he used 15 more straws in total.\n\nSo, the total number of straws used should indeed be the initial 45 plus the additional 15, which is 60.\n\nI think the answer is D. 60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
