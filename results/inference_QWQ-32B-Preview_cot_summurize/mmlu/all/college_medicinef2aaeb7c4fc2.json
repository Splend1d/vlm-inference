                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about David, who's a really good cellist and he just got a scholarship to a big college. He's been given a bunch of sheet music to learn over the summer, and he's supposed to be really good at it by the time school starts in the fall. The problem is, he's a perfectionist. He always compares himself to better players and is really hard on himself when he can't master a part of a piece.\n\nSo, the question is asking which option best describes David based on the information given. The options are about his self-esteem, self-efficacy, and locus of control. I need to understand what each of these terms means to answer this correctly.\n\nFirst, self-esteem is basically how much you value yourself or how good you feel about yourself. High self-esteem means you have a positive view of yourself, and low self-esteem means you have a negative view.\n\nSelf-efficacy is about your belief in your ability to accomplish tasks or reach goals. If you have strong self-efficacy, you believe you can succeed. If you have low self-efficacy, you might doubt your abilities.\n\nLocus of control refers to whether you believe that the events in your life are controlled by your own actions (internal locus of control) or by external forces beyond your control (external locus of control).\n\nNow, let's look at David's characteristics.\n\nHe's a nationally ranked cellist, which suggests that he's very skilled and has achieved a lot in his field. That should contribute to high self-esteem, right? But the problem is, he's a perfectionist and always compares himself to better players. He's hard on himself when he can't master a section.\n\nThis sounds a bit conflicting. On one hand, he's accomplished a lot, but on the other hand, he's not satisfied with himself and is harsh when he doesn't meet his own high standards.\n\nMaybe his self-esteem isn't as high as it could be because he's always comparing himself to others and feeling\u4e0d\u8db3. So, perhaps he has low self-esteem.\n\nBut wait, he is nationally ranked, which means he's among the best in the country. That should give him high self-esteem. Maybe his self-esteem is actually high, but his perfectionism is just pushing him harder.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently. Perfectionism can sometimes coexist with high self-esteem; people might set high standards for themselves because they believe in their abilities. On the other hand, perfectionism can also be associated with low self-esteem, where individuals set high bars to prove their worth.\n\nI need to consider both possibilities.\n\nNext, his self-efficacy. He's been given a packet of sheet music to be proficient in by fall semester. As a scholarship student and a nationally ranked player, it's likely that he believes in his ability to learn and master this music. So, his self-efficacy seems strong.\n\nLastly, his locus of control. He's a perfectionist and is hard on himself when he can't master something. This suggests that he believes he has control over his achievements; he attributes his success or failure to his own efforts and abilities. That points to an internal locus of control.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Self-esteem: unsure, could be high or low\n\n- Self-efficacy: strong\n\n- Locus of control: internal\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control\n\nB. High self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control\n\nC. Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, external locus of control\n\nD. Low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, internal locus of control\n\nGiven that, I need to decide between A and B, since both have strong self-efficacy and internal locus of control.\n\nNow, to choose between low and high self-esteem.\n\nDavid is a nationally ranked cellist, which should indicate high self-esteem. However, his perfectionism and tendency to compare himself to better players and being hard on himself when he can't master something might suggest that he doesn't feel good enough, which could point to low self-esteem.\n\nBut, perhaps his achievements do give him high self-esteem, and his perfectionism is just pushing him to be even better.\n\nI think the key here is understanding how he feels about himself despite not meeting his own expectations immediately.\n\nMaybe his self-esteem is high because of his accomplishments, but his perfectionism makes him set even higher standards for himself.\n\nTherefore, option B seems more appropriate: high self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control.\n\nOption A suggests low self-esteem, which might not align with his achievements.\n\nOption C has an external locus of control, which doesn't fit because he seems to believe in his own abilities and efforts.\n\nOption D has low self-efficacy, which contradicts his likely belief in his ability to master the music.\n\nTherefore, B is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
