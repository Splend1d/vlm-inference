Fidelio'\n\nLudwig van Beethoven composed only one opera during his lifetime, and it was called \"Fidelio.\" The opera is a tragedy in two acts and was first performed in 1805. Beethoven worked on this piece for several years and revised it multiple times, with the final version being performed in 1814. \"Fidelio\" tells the story of a woman named Leonore, who disguises herself as a prison guard named Fidelio to rescue her husband, Florestan, who has been imprisoned for political reasons.\n\nThe other options listed are not Beethoven's works:\n\n- \"Faust\" is a well-known opera by Charles Gounod, based on Goethe's play of the same name.\n\n- \"The Silence\" is not an opera but a play by Swedish playwright Ingmar Bergman.\n\n- \"Immortal Beloved\" is a 1994 film directed by Bernard Rose, which explores Beethoven's life and his relationships, particularly with his \"Immortal Beloved,\" the identity of whom remains unknown.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Fidelio'."
