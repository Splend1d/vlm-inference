There are a few options here, and I need to figure out which one he would agree with.\n\nOption A says that it's just bad for the government to fail to recognize natural rights. That sounds pretty general, but I think there might be more to it.\n\nOption B suggests that sometimes it's okay for the government to disregard natural rights when the harms are bad enough. That seems like a utilitarian approach, where the ends justify the means.\n\nOption C is similar, but it specifies that it's okay to disregard natural rights to protect someone from themselves. Like, for their own good.\n\nOption D states that failures by the government to recognize natural rights count as injustices. That sounds more absolute, like natural rights should always be respected.\n\nI need to recall Huemer's views on this. I remember that Huemer is a proponent of libertarianism, which generally emphasizes individual liberty and natural rights. So, he likely places a strong emphasis on the government recognizing and protecting natural rights.\n\nLet me think about Option A first. Saying that it's \"just bad\" for the government to fail to recognize natural rights seems a bit mild. It doesn't capture the seriousness of such failures. Maybe Huemer would have a stronger stance than that.\n\nOption B suggests that sometimes it's acceptable for the government to disregard natural rights if the harms are severe. But, in libertarian thought, natural rights are often considered inviolable, meaning they shouldn't be violated even for greater goods. So, this might not align with Huemer's views.\n\nOption C is similar to Option B but focuses on protecting people from themselves. Again, this seems to allow for government intervention in personal choices, which libertarians typically oppose, unless there's harm to others.\n\nOption D says that failures to recognize natural rights are injustices. This sounds more in line with a rights-based approach, where respecting natural rights is a moral imperative, and failing to do so is unjust.\n\nConsidering Huemer's libertarian leanings, I think he would agree with Option D: failures by the government to recognize natural rights count as injustices. He likely believes that natural rights are fundamental and that the government has a moral obligation to respect them, and any failure to do so is unjust.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider why he might not choose the other options.\n\nOption A is too weak; it just says it's \"bad,\" but doesn't convey the moral severity of the issue.\n\nOption B allows for exceptions, which contradicts the idea of natural rights being absolute.\n\nOption C is a specific case of Option B, where the government intervenes to protect individuals from themselves. Libertarians generally argue that people have the right to make their own choices, even if those choices are self-harming, as long as they don't harm others.\n\nTherefore, Option D seems the most consistent with Huemer's likely views on natural rights and government responsibilities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
