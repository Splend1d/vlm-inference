                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option would shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right. Let me recall what the long-run aggregate supply curve represents. It's the potential output of an economy in the long run, when all inputs are fully employed, and it's generally vertical at the level of potential GDP.\n\nSo, a rightward shift in the LRAS curve means that the economy's potential output has increased. That could happen due to an increase in the labor force, an improvement in labor productivity, or an increase in the capital stock, among other things.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. A nation that devotes more resources to nondurable consumption goods rather than durable capital goods.\n\nHmm, nondurable goods are things like food and clothing, which are consumed quickly, while durable capital goods are things like machinery and equipment that are used to produce other goods and services over a longer period.\n\nIf a nation shifts resources from durable capital goods to nondurable consumption goods, it means less investment in capital that could increase future production capacity. So, this would likely decrease the capital stock over time, which would shift the LRAS curve to the left, not to the right. So, option A doesn't seem likely.\n\nB. Research that improves the productivity of labor and capital.\n\nImprovements in productivity mean that each unit of labor and capital can produce more output. This would increase the economy's potential output, shifting the LRAS curve to the right. This seems like a strong candidate.\n\nC. More restrictive trade policies.\n\nMore restrictive trade policies could limit the flow of goods, services, and factors of production across borders. This could reduce the efficiency of resource allocation and potentially decrease potential output, shifting the LRAS curve to the left. So, this doesn't seem like it would shift the curve to the right.\n\nD. Annual limits to immigration of foreign citizens.\n\nImmigration affects the labor force. If there are limits to immigration, that could reduce the growth of the labor force, which might decrease potential output over time, shifting the LRAS curve to the left.\n\nWait a minute, but in some cases, immigration can bring in workers with specific skills that might enhance productivity. However, the question is about limits to immigration, which would likely reduce the labor force or slow its growth, thereby decreasing potential output.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option B seems to be the one that would shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right, as it directly increases productivity and potential output.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
