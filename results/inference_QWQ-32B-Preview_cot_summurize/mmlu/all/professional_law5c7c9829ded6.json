M. by two or more persons if such noise is audible off the premises where the singing takes place. The ordinance expressly exempted from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs. After the ordinance was enacted and went into effect, several college students were walking down the street on their way to a victory celebration following a big college football game. They began loudly chanting, \"We're number 1. . . we're number 1. \" One of the residents who lived on the street was greatly disturbed by the noise and reported the incident to the police, who were immediately summoned to the scene. The students who engaged in the chanting were arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. The students who were prosecuted now bring suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance. Which of the following would constitute their WEAKEST argument against enforcement of the city ordinance?\n\nA. The ordinance deprives persons of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First andFourteenth Amendments.\nB. The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest.\nC.

So, there's an ordinance in a city that prohibits singing and chanting by two or more people from 1 PM to 1 AM if it's audible off the premises. But it specifically exempts religious songs. Some college students were chanting \"We're number 1\" after a football game, and they got arrested for violating this ordinance. Now, they're challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance, and we need to figure out which argument would be their weakest.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The ordinance deprives persons of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\" Hmm, that seems relevant. Freedom of expression is protected by the First Amendment, and the Fourteenth Amendment applies it to the states. So, if the ordinance is restricting speech, that could be a strong argument. But I need to think about whether chanting falls under freedom of expression.\n\nOption B says: \"The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest.\" This seems to be arguing that the ordinance isn't serving a valid purpose, which is part of the due process analysis. But I wonder if there is a legitimate community interest, like preventing noise disturbances. So, maybe this isn't the weakest argument.\n\nOption C says: \"The statutory language of the ordinance is vague and overbroad since it attempts to encompass all forms of singing.\" Wait, the ordinance specifies that it's about singing and chanting by two or more people that's audible off premises, between 1 PM and 1 AM, and exempts religious songs. Is it vague? Well, it seems pretty specific about the time and the conditions. Overbroad? It only applies to group singing and chanting during certain hours that can be heard outside the premises. Maybe not the strongest argument.\n\nOption D says: \"The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.\" Oh, this is interesting. The ordinance exempts religious singing, which could be seen as discriminating based on the content of the speech. That might be a strong equal protection argument.\n\nNow, to determine which is the weakest argument, I need to think about which one has the least merit or is least likely to succeed.\n\nLet's consider Option A first. Freedom of expression certainly includes verbal expressions like chanting. So, restricting chanting could be seen as a restriction on free speech. However, the government can regulate the time, place, and manner of speech if it serves a significant interest and is content-neutral. Here, the ordinance seems targeted at reducing noise disturbances, which is a legitimate interest. So, while there might be an argument, it's not necessarily weak.\n\nOption B argues that the ordinance isn't related to any legitimate community interest, which seems questionable because noise control is a legitimate interest. So, this argument might not hold much water.\n\nOption C claims the ordinance is vague and overbroad. Vagueness means people don't know what's prohibited, but the ordinance seems pretty clear: no group singing or chanting between 1 PM and 1 AM if it's audible off premises, except for religious songs. Overbreadth means it prohibits too much speech beyond what's necessary to serve the government's interest. Here, it's targeted at group singing and chanting during certain hours that can be heard outside, which seems narrowly tailored. So, this argument might not be strong.\n\nOption D argues that the ordinance violates equal protection by distinguishing between religious and non-religious singing. This could be a strong argument because it's based on content discrimination, which is subject to strict scrutiny. Exempting religious singing might not be justified if the exemption isn't narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Option C is the weakest argument. The ordinance seems pretty clear about what it prohibits and when, so it's not vague. And it's not overbroad because it's targeted at specific group activities during certain hours that cause noise disturbances.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
