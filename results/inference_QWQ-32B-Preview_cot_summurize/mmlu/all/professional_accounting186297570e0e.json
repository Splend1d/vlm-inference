                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which pair of elements a client needs to prove in order to hold an accountant liable for common law fraud. The options are:\n\nA. Material misrepresentation and breach of contract.\n\nB. Freedom from contributory negligence and loss.\n\nC. Scienter and justifiable reliance.\n\nD. Intent to deceive and privity.\n\nI need to understand what common law fraud entails and what elements are required to prove it.\n\nFirst, I know that common law fraud is a legal concept that allows someone to seek damages if they've been defrauded by another party. In the context of an accountant, this would mean that the accountant has acted fraudulently in their professional capacity, perhaps by providing false information or misrepresenting financial statements.\n\nTo prove common law fraud, there are generally several elements that the plaintiff (in this case, the client) needs to establish. These elements can vary slightly depending on the jurisdiction, but typically they include:\n\n1. A false representation of a material fact.\n\n2. Knowledge by the defendant that the representation is false.\n\n3. Intent by the defendant to deceive the plaintiff.\n\n4. Justifiable reliance by the plaintiff on the representation.\n\n5. Damages suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the reliance.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let's look at each option:\n\nOption A: Material misrepresentation and breach of contract.\n\nMaterial misrepresentation is indeed one element of fraud, as it involves a false statement about something important. However, breach of contract is different. Breach of contract occurs when one party fails to fulfill their obligations under a contract. While a breach of contract can be related to fraud if the breach involves fraudulent conduct, they are separate legal issues. So, this option seems incomplete for proving fraud.\n\nOption B: Freedom from contributory negligence and loss.\n\nContributory negligence refers to a situation where the plaintiff is also at fault to some extent for their own damages. In some jurisdictions, if the plaintiff is contributorily negligent, they may not be able to recover damages. However, this isn't directly an element of fraud; it's more of a defense that the defendant might raise. Additionally, proving loss is certainly part of fraud, as the plaintiff needs to show they were damaged by the fraudulent act. So, this option mixes a defense with one element of fraud.\n\nOption C: Scienter and justifiable reliance.\n\nScienter is a legal term that refers to having knowledge of the facts or having acted with intent. In the context of fraud, it means that the defendant knew the representation was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. Justifiable reliance is when the plaintiff reasonably relied on the false representation. Both of these are key elements in proving fraud.\n\nOption D: Intent to deceive and privity.\n\nIntent to deceive aligns with the requirement that the defendant had the intention to defraud the plaintiff. Privity, on the other hand, refers to a direct relationship between the parties involved. In some legal contexts, privity is required for certain claims, but in fraud cases, the concept of privity might not be as crucial, especially if the fraud is direct and the plaintiff is the immediate victim.\n\nComparing these options, option C seems to be the most accurate pair of elements required to prove common law fraud. Scienter covers the knowledge or intent to deceive, and justifiable reliance ensures that the plaintiff's action was reasonable based on the false representation.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider whether other elements are missing. For instance, option A includes material misrepresentation, which is crucial, but breach of contract isn't directly related to fraud. Option B includes loss, which is necessary in fraud cases, but freedom from contributory negligence is more of a defensive argument. Option D has intent to deceive, which is essential, but privity might not be as relevant as justifiable reliance.\n\nMoreover, in fraud cases, the plaintiff must prove that there was a false representation, that it was material, that the defendant knew it was false, that the plaintiff relied on it justifiably, and that they suffered damages as a result. Option C captures two of these essential elements: scienter (knowledge or intent) and justifiable reliance.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option C is the correct answer. The client must prove scienter and justifiable reliance to hold an accountant liable for common law fraud.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
