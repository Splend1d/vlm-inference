                    "text": "So I've got this question here about excise taxes and how they affect consumers and producers. The question is asking which scenario would result in consumers paying the largest burden of an excise tax placed on a producer. There are four options, each describing different combinations of price elasticity for demand and supply.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an excise tax is. An excise tax is a tax placed on the production or sale of a specific good or service. In this case, it's placed on the producer, but the question is about how much of that tax burden is passed on to consumers.\n\nI recall that the distribution of the tax burden between consumers and producers depends on the price elasticities of demand and supply. Specifically, the more inelastic the demand, the more consumers will bear the tax burden, and the more inelastic the supply, the more producers will bear the tax burden.\n\nSo, if demand is inelastic, consumers are less sensitive to price changes, meaning they'll keep buying even if the price goes up. Therefore, producers can pass on more of the tax to consumers without seeing a big drop in quantity sold.\n\nConversely, if supply is inelastic, producers can't easily increase or decrease production in response to price changes, so they'll have to absorb more of the tax burden.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Demand is price elastic and supply is price inelastic.\n\nIf demand is elastic, consumers are sensitive to price changes, so if producers try to pass on the tax by raising prices, consumers might buy less, meaning producers can't pass on much of the tax to consumers. Since supply is inelastic, producers can't adjust their production easily, so they'll have to bear more of the tax burden. Therefore, consumers wouldn't be paying much of the tax in this scenario.\n\nB. Demand is price elastic and supply is perfectly elastic.\n\nPerfectly elastic supply means that producers can supply any quantity at a fixed price; any increase in price above that level would lead to infinite quantity supplied, but since it's an excise tax, the price received by producers decreases by the tax amount. In this case, producers can't pass any of the tax to consumers because they have to keep their price to remain competitive. So, consumers wouldn't pay any of the tax; producers would bear the entire burden.\n\nC. Demand is price inelastic and supply is price elastic.\n\nHere, demand is inelastic, so consumers aren't sensitive to price changes, and supply is elastic, meaning producers can adjust their production easily in response to price changes. In this scenario, producers can pass on more of the tax to consumers because consumers will keep buying even if prices rise. Producers can adjust their production to maintain profits. So, consumers would bear a larger portion of the tax burden.\n\nD. Demand is perfectly inelastic and supply is price elastic.\n\nPerfectly inelastic demand means that consumers will buy the same quantity regardless of price. So, no matter how much producers raise prices, consumers will still buy the same amount. In this case, producers can pass on the entire tax burden to consumers because there's no change in quantity demanded in response to price changes.\n\nComparing options C and D, option D has perfectly inelastic demand, which is even less elastic than option C's inelastic demand. Therefore, in option D, consumers would bear the entire tax burden.\n\nBut the question is asking for the largest burden on consumers, so between C and D, D seems to be the extreme case where consumers pay the entire tax.\n\nHowever, let's make sure that's the case.\n\nIn option C, demand is inelastic, but not perfectly inelastic. So, there is some responsiveness to price changes, just not a lot. Therefore, producers can pass on a large portion of the tax to consumers, but not the entire amount because some consumers might still reduce their quantity demanded slightly when prices rise.\n\nIn option D, demand is perfectly inelastic, so no matter how much prices rise, quantity demanded stays the same. Therefore, producers can pass on the entire tax to consumers.\n\nSo, in option D, consumers are paying the entire tax burden, which is larger than in option C where they pay a large portion but not the entire amount.\n\nLooking back at options A and B, in A, consumers pay less because demand is elastic, and in B, consumers pay nothing because supply is perfectly elastic.\n\nTherefore, the scenario where consumers pay the largest burden of the excise tax is when demand is perfectly inelastic and supply is price elastic, which is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
