                    "text": "Co-defendants were dealers at a casino. They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.\nB. The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.\nC. Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.\nD. Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this law problem. It's about some ex-casino dealers who got fired and decided to get revenge by planting a bomb in the casino. They planned to demand a million dollars and then tell the casino where the bomb was and how to defuse it. They were careful to give the casino enough time to make sure no one got hurt.\n\nSo, one of them, who was good with electronics, built the bomb and put it in a closet at the casino. Then, the other co-defendant called the casino and told them about the bomb, saying it would explode in 24 hours unless they paid the money. But the casino didn't believe them and didn't pay. Then, the co-defendants decided that one of them should go back to the casino to defuse the bomb, but before they could, the bomb exploded because of a faulty wire, killing 30 people.\n\nThere's a state law that says it's a felony to detonate or try to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling. Now, both co-defendants are being charged with violating this law, and I need to figure out which statement is correct among the options given.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.\"\n\nWell, it seems like both were involved in planning the whole thing. One built the bomb and placed it, and the other made the phone call to demand the money. So, if they're both part of the plan, maybe they're both guilty.\n\nBut I need to think about whether both of their actions contributed to the explosion. The phone call was to demand the money, but the bomb was already placed. So, maybe the phone call wasn't directly related to the explosion.\n\nWait, but the explosion happened because the bomb was placed, and the phone call was part of their plan to get the money and then defuse the bomb. So, their intention was to plant the bomb, make the demand, get the money, and then defuse it without hurting anyone.\n\nBut things went wrong because the casino didn't pay, and then the bomb exploded prematurely due to a faulty wire.\n\nSo, was their action of planting the bomb and making the threat enough to make them guilty of violating the law against detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb?\n\nI think so, because they planted the bomb, which is an explosive device, in the casino, which is a building. And even if they didn't intend for it to explode and hurt people, the fact is that it did explode.\n\nBut option D says: \"Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.\"\n\nHmm, that seems relevant. They didn't want anyone to get hurt; they wanted to give the casino time to pay and defuse the bomb. So, maybe their intent wasn't to detonate the bomb; it was to use it as a threat to get the money.\n\nBut the law says \"detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device.\" They attempted to detonate it by placing it and setting it up, even if they didn't want it to actually explode.\n\nSo, maybe intent isn't the issue here. Maybe just the act of placing the bomb is enough to constitute attempting to detonate it.\n\nOption B says: \"The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.\"\n\nWait, was the phone call a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime?\n\nWell, the crime is detonating or attempting to detonate the bomb. The phone call was to demand money and inform the casino about the bomb, but it wasn't directly related to setting off the bomb.\n\nSo, maybe the person who built and placed the bomb is the one who actually attempted to detonate it, and the other person just made a threat.\n\nBut in criminal law, aiding and abetting can make both parties guilty if they were part of the same criminal plan.\n\nSo, even if one person built the bomb and the other made the call, they were both part of the plan, so maybe both are guilty.\n\nOption C says: \"Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.\"\n\nThis is interesting. The casino didn't take the threat seriously and didn't pay the money, which led to the bomb exploding.\n\nBut was the casino's negligence an independent intervening cause that breaks the chain of causation?\n\nWell, the bomb would have exploded anyway because of the faulty wire, regardless of what the casino did.\n\nSo, maybe the casino's negligence isn't an independent cause; it's more that the bomb was just poorly made and exploded on its own.\n\nSo, perhaps that doesn't absolve the co-defendants of responsibility.\n\nOption D says: \"Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.\"\n\nAs I thought earlier, their intent was not to kill anyone; they wanted to plant the bomb as a threat to get the money.\n\nBut in law, attempted detonation might not require intent to harm; it's more about the act of trying to set off the bomb.\n\nSo, even if they didn't intend to hurt anyone, their actions led to the bomb exploding, which caused deaths.\n\nBut maybe their lack of intent to harm could be a mitigating factor, but I don't think it absolves them of the crime entirely.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think option A is the correct answer: both are guilty because each participated in the planning of the crime.\n\nThey both had roles in the plan to plant the bomb and make the threat, and their actions led to the bomb being present and eventually exploding, even if it was due to a faulty wire.\n\nTheir collective actions constitute attempting to detonate the bomb, and both are liable for their parts in the plan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
