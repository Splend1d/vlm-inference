International law\n\nC. Intergovernmental organizations\n\nD. All of the above\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constraints are in this context. Constraints are factors that limit or influence the decisions that the US can make in its foreign policy. So, I need to think about how each of these options might affect or restrict the US's ability to act in certain ways on the international stage.\n\nStarting with option A: foreign policies of other states. Every country has its own interests and policies, and these can certainly impact what the US can do. For example, if another country doesn't want to engage in a particular trade agreement, that can limit the US's options. Similarly, alliances and rivalries can constrain the US's actions. So, it seems like the foreign policies of other states do act as constraints on US foreign policy.\n\nOption B: international law. International law consists of rules and norms that govern the conduct of nations. The US, like other countries, is expected to abide by these laws, although there can be debates about compliance and enforcement. International law can constrain US actions by setting standards for behavior, defining rights and obligations, and providing frameworks for resolving disputes. For instance, regulations on warfare, human rights, and environmental protection can limit what the US can do in certain situations.\n\nOption C: intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). These are organizations composed of multiple governments, like the United Nations, NATO, or the World Trade Organization. IGOs can impose constraints on US foreign policy through agreements, treaties, and collective decision-making processes. For example, the US may have to consider the positions of other member states in these organizations when making decisions, and sometimes has to compromise or follow collective policies.\n\nGiven that all three options\u2014foreign policies of other states, international law, and intergovernmental organizations\u2014can indeed constrain US foreign policy decision making, the correct answer would be D. All of the above.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these are constraints, the US also has significant influence and power on the global stage, which allows it to shape some of these constraints to its advantage. But ultimately, none of these factors can be entirely ignored or bypassed without consequences.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
