                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which clinician here is most likely following Carl Rogers's approach to psychotherapy. I know that Carl Rogers is famous for his humanistic approach, particularly client-centered therapy. Let me see what that's all about.\n\nFirst off, Rogers believed in the power of the client's own ability to find their own path to personal growth and healing. He emphasized empathy, unconditional positive regard, and congruence as the key ingredients for a therapeutic relationship. So, in his approach, the therapist is more of a facilitator rather than an authority figure who tells the client what to do.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Dr. Jones focuses on modifying undesirable behaviors. That sounds more like behavior therapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy, where the emphasis is on changing specific behaviors through techniques like reinforcement or cognitive restructuring. That doesn't align with Rogers's humanistic approach.\n\nB. Terence Springer counsels individuals to find their inner spirituality and develop their relationship with a supreme being. This seems more like a spiritually oriented therapy, which could be part of some therapeutic approaches, but it's not specifically Rogers's client-centered therapy. Rogers's approach is more about the individual's self-actualization and personal growth without necessarily focusing on spirituality.\n\nC. Cathy Cooper is described as an empathic counselor who encourages clients through unconditional support to find their own path to better health and growth. This sounds a lot like Rogers's approach. Empathy and unconditional positive regard are central to client-centered therapy. By providing a supportive environment, the therapist allows the client to explore their own feelings and find their own solutions.\n\nD. Utrese Leed creates a framework for her patients that defines ideal psychological growth and development and supports their efforts toward professional achievement. This seems more directive than Rogers's approach. In client-centered therapy, the client is the one who defines their goals and path, not the therapist. So, having the therapist define an \"ideal\" growth path doesn't align with Rogers's philosophy.\n\nBased on this, it seems like Cathy Cooper in option C is the clinician who most closely follows Carl Rogers's approach to psychotherapy. She provides empathy and unconditional support, encouraging clients to find their own path, which is exactly what Rogers advocated for.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
