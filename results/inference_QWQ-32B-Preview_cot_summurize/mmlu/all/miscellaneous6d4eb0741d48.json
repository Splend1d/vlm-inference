                    "text": "To determine which of these rocks will float in water, we need to consider their densities. Rocks with lower density than water will float, while those with higher density will sink. Water has a density of approximately 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm\u00b3).\n\nLet's look at the typical densities of each rock type:\n\nA. Granite: Granite is an igneous rock composed mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica. Its density typically ranges from 2.6 to 2.7 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nB. Limestone: Limestone is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of calcium carbonate (calcite). Its density usually falls between 2.5 and 2.7 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nC. Shale: Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of clay and silt-sized particles. Its density is generally around 2.0 to 2.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nD. Pumice: Pumice is a volcanic rock that is formed from rapidly cooled lava containing trapped gas bubbles. It is known for its low density, often less than 1 g/cm\u00b3, which allows it to float on water.\n\nBased on this information, pumice is the only rock among the options that has a density lower than water. Therefore, pumice will float in water.\n\nSo, the answer is D. pumice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
