                    "text": "To determine which of these ionic substances has the greatest lattice enthalpy, we need to consider the factors that influence lattice enthalpy. Lattice enthalpy is a measure of the energy required to separate one mole of an ionic compound into its gaseous ions. It is influenced by the charges of the ions and the sizes of the ions.\n\nThe higher the charges of the ions, the stronger the electrostatic attraction between them, leading to a higher lattice enthalpy. Conversely, larger ions are farther apart, leading to weaker attractions and lower lattice enthalpy.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. MgO\n\nB. MgS\n\nC. NaF\n\nD. NaCl\n\nFirst, let's consider the charges of the ions involved:\n\n- MgO: Mg\u00b2\u207a and O\u00b2\u207b\n\n- MgS: Mg\u00b2\u207a and S\u00b2\u207b\n\n- NaF: Na\u207a and F\u207b\n\n- NaCl: Na\u207a and Cl\u207b\n\nBoth MgO and MgS have divalent ions (Mg\u00b2\u207a and O\u00b2\u207b or S\u00b2\u207b), while NaF and NaCl have monovalent ions (Na\u207a and F\u207b or Cl\u207b). Since higher charges lead to higher lattice enthalpy, MgO and MgS are likely to have higher lattice enthalpies than NaF and NaCl.\n\nNow, between MgO and MgS, we need to consider the sizes of the anions. Oxygen is smaller than sulfur, so the distance between Mg\u00b2\u207a and O\u00b2\u207b is smaller than between Mg\u00b2\u207a and S\u00b2\u207b. This means that the electrostatic attraction in MgO is stronger due to the closer proximity of the ions, leading to a higher lattice enthalpy compared to MgS.\n\nBetween NaF and NaCl, both have monovalent ions, but again, the size of the anion matters. Fluoride (F\u207b) is smaller than chloride (Cl\u207b), so the distance between Na\u207a and F\u207b is smaller than between Na\u207a and Cl\u207b. Therefore, NaF has a higher lattice enthalpy than NaCl.\n\nNow, to compare MgO and NaF:\n\nMgO has divalent ions, which have stronger attractions than the monovalent ions in NaF. Despite NaF having smaller ions, the higher charge of MgO's ions leads to a higher lattice enthalpy.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, MgO should have the greatest lattice enthalpy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
