                    "text": "Let's see what this passage is saying. It's from Isabella Beeton's Book of Household Management in 1861. She compares the mistress of the house to a commander of the army, saying that her spirit is seen throughout the establishment, and that how well she does her duties affects everyone in the family.\n\nSo, she's putting a lot of emphasis on the importance of the woman running the household. It seems like she thinks this role is really crucial for the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.\n\nNow, the question is asking what we can infer about Beeton's beliefs regarding women's power and responsibility in different spheres of social life.\n\nOption A says that women held considerable power and responsibility in the public sphere of social life. But the passage is talking about the household, which is more the domestic sphere, not necessarily the public sphere.\n\nOption B says that women were denied power and responsibility in the public sphere. Again, the passage is focusing on the domestic sphere, so it doesn't directly address women's roles in the public sphere.\n\nOption C says that women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life. That seems to align with what Beeton is saying. She's highlighting the importance of the mistress of the house and how her actions and abilities affect the entire family.\n\nOption D says that women were denied power and responsibility within the domestic sphere. But that doesn't make sense with the passage, because Beeton is praising the mistress of the house and emphasizing the importance of her duties.\n\nSo, based on the passage, it seems that Beeton believed women had significant power and responsibility within the domestic sphere.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let's think about the context. This is from the 19th century, around the Victorian era, when women's roles were often confined to the home, especially among the middle and upper classes.\n\nBeeton is writing a book on household management, which suggests that she is an authority on how to run a household effectively. By comparing the mistress of the house to a commander, she's elevating the status of this role, suggesting that it's a position of authority and responsibility.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is specifically within the domestic sphere. The passage doesn't talk about women's roles outside the home, in public life or in professions.\n\nSo, if we have to choose the best inference from the options given, option C seems most appropriate: women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any hint in the passage about women's power in the public sphere. The comparison to a commander of the army might suggest that Beeton sees similarities between leading a household and leading an army, both requiring intelligent and thorough performance of duties.\n\nHowever, leading an army is a public role, whereas managing a household is private. So, perhaps Beeton is implying that the skills and responsibilities required in the domestic sphere are akin to those in public leadership roles, even if the domains are different.\n\nBut again, the passage itself is focused on the household, so it's primarily about the domestic sphere.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward inference is option C: women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life.\n\nOption A is too broad because the passage doesn't discuss public sphere activities. Option B is about denial of power in the public sphere, which isn't addressed in the passage. Option D contradicts the passage, as Beeton clearly values the mistress's role in the household.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
