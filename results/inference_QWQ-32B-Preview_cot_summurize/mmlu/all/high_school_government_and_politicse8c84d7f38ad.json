                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about independent regulatory agencies and how Congress tries to protect them from political influence. The options are:\n\nA. be led by a group of commissioners representing both major political parties\n\nB. plan policy cooperatively with the appropriate congressional committees\n\nC. reapply for funding at the end of each fiscal year\n\nD. submit all planned policy changes to the president for approval\n\nFirst, I need to understand what independent regulatory agencies are. These are government agencies that have some autonomy from the executive branch, meaning they're not directly controlled by the president or other executive officials. They're created by Congress to oversee specific areas like finance, transportation, communications, and more.\n\nNow, the question is about how Congress protects these agencies from political influence. Political influence can come from various sources, including the executive branch, congressional leaders, or special interest groups. The idea is to keep these agencies independent so they can make decisions based on their mandates and expertise, rather than political pressures.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nOption A suggests that the agencies should be led by a group of commissioners representing both major political parties. This is actually a common practice. Many independent agencies have boards or commissions with members from different political parties to ensure bipartisan decision-making. This balance can help prevent one political party from dominating the agency's decisions and policies.\n\nOption B proposes that agencies plan policy cooperatively with congressional committees. While agencies often consult with Congress and may coordinate with committees, requiring them to plan policy cooperatively could potentially undermine their independence. The purpose of independent agencies is to operate separately from direct congressional control.\n\nOption C mentions that agencies should reapply for funding at the end of each fiscal year. Typically, agencies receive funding through the annual appropriations process, but requiring them to reapply each year could make them more vulnerable to political influence, as funding could be used as a lever to influence their decisions.\n\nOption D suggests submitting all planned policy changes to the president for approval. This would significantly reduce the independence of these agencies, as the president could veto or influence policy decisions, which contradicts the principle of independence.\n\nConsidering these points, option A seems to be the most plausible answer. Having commissioners from both major political parties can help maintain a balance and protect the agency from being controlled by one political faction.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there are other mechanisms Congress uses to protect these agencies. For example, some agencies have commissioners with staggered terms, meaning their terms don't all expire at the same time. This can prevent a single president from appointing all commissioners and potentially aligning the agency with their political agenda.\n\nAlso, some agencies have bipartisan appointment requirements, where commissioners must be approved by both parties in the Senate. This is another way to ensure that the agency remains balanced and not dominated by one party.\n\nAnother protection is that these agencies often have quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative powers, which means they can make rules and adjudicate disputes in their areas of expertise, similar to courts. This separation from the executive branch helps maintain their independence.\n\nIn terms of funding, some independent agencies might have more secure funding sources that don't require annual appropriations, further insulating them from political pressure.\n\nBut based on the options provided, option A directly addresses the leadership structure in a way that promotes bipartisanship, which is a key aspect of protecting independence from political influence.\n\nI think the answer is A. Be led by a group of commissioners representing both major political parties.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
