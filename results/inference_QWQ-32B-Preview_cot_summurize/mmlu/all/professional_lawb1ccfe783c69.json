A Russian immigrant recently moved to the United States from Moscow. The immigrant cannot read or speak English. One day, the immigrant purchased a bottle of the shampoo from a drug store. She looked at the label warning but did not understand it. After throwing away the box cover, she used the shampoo without making a \"patch test. \" Minutes later, she began experiencing an allergic reaction and scalp irritation.

                    "text": "This is a strict products liability case involving a shampoo that caused an allergic reaction and hair loss in a Russian immigrant who couldn't read English. Let's break down the options to determine the most likely outcome.\n\nOption A suggests that the immigrant will win because she suffered injury from using the product. In strict products liability, injury is indeed a requirement, but liability also depends on whether the product was defective and if the defect caused the injury. So, while injury is necessary, it's not sufficient on its own to determine liability.\n\nOption B proposes that she will win because the manufacturer was aware that a small percentage of the population might have an allergic reaction. This touches on the concept of foreseeability and whether the product is unreasonably dangerous. However, in strict products liability, the manufacturer's knowledge isn't the primary focus; rather, it's about whether the product is defective and unreasonably dangerous.\n\nOption C states that she will lose because she didn't read or speak English. This seems to suggest that the immigrant's inability to understand the warning label absolves the manufacturer of liability. However, in products liability, the duty to warn must be effective for the intended users, including those who may not read the language the warning is in.\n\nOption D suggests she will lose because she assumed the risk by not making a \"patch test.\" This implies that by not following the warning, she accepted the risks associated with the product's use.\n\nConsidering these points, let's think about the legal principles involved in strict products liability.\n\nFirst, for strict products liability, three elements generally need to be established:\n\n1. The product was defective when it left the defendant's control.\n\n2. The defect caused the plaintiff's injury.\n\n3. The plaintiff was using the product in a manner that was intended or foreseeable.\n\nIn this case, the defect is presumably the presence of chemicals that can cause allergic reactions in some people. The injury is the allergic reaction and hair loss. The use was intended, as she used the shampoo for its intended purpose.\n\nHowever, the manufacturer provided a warning to perform a \"patch test\" to avoid allergic reactions. The question is whether this warning was adequate.\n\nGiven that the immigrant couldn't read English, the warning may not have been effectively communicated to her. In products liability, warnings must be understandable to the reasonably prudent user. Here, the user didn't understand English, which might render the warning ineffective.\n\nSome jurisdictions consider language barriers in products liability cases. For example, if a product is sold in an area with a significant non-English speaking population, there might be an argument for providing warnings in multiple languages.\n\nAdditionally, the \"assumption of risk\" defense in option D is worth considering. Assumption of risk occurs when a plaintiff knowingly assumes the risks associated with a particular activity or product. However, for this defense to apply, the plaintiff must have known about the risks and voluntarily chosen to take them on.\n\nIn this case, the immigrant didn't understand the warning, so she couldn't have known about the risk of allergic reaction unless otherwise informed. Therefore, it's questionable whether she assumed the risk.\n\nMoreover, strict products liability often focuses on whether the warnings were adequate. If the warnings aren't understandable to the user, the manufacturer may still be liable.\n\nConsidering these factors, it seems that options C and D might not hold up as strongly as they initially appear. The manufacturer has a duty to ensure that warnings are effective for the intended users, which in this case may include non-English speakers.\n\nOption A suggests she will win because she suffered injury from using the product. While injury is part of the equation, it doesn't account for the adequacy of the warning.\n\nOption B mentions that the manufacturer was aware of the potential allergic reactions, which aligns with the idea that the product may be defective if it's unreasonably dangerous due to this known risk.\n\nGiven that, option B seems more plausible. The manufacturer's knowledge of the risk suggests that they should have taken steps to ensure that all potential users were adequately warned, including providing multilingual warnings or using universal symbols.\n\nHowever, in strict products liability, the plaintiff doesn't need to prove the manufacturer's knowledge; rather, it's about the product's condition and the foreseeability of the harm.\n\nUpon further reflection, perhaps the best answer is A: she will win because she suffered injury from using the product, and the warning was ineffective due to her inability to understand English.\n\nBut let's consider the legal standards more carefully.\n\nIn strict products liability, a warning may bar recovery if it's adequate. An adequate warning is one that communicates the nature of the risk to the user. If the warning isn't understandable, it may not be adequate.\n\nIn this scenario, since the immigrant didn't understand English, the warning didn't effectively communicate the risk to her. Therefore, the warning may be considered inadequate, and she might still be able to recover.\n\nOption C suggests she will lose because she didn't read or speak English. However, this seems to place the burden solely on the user, ignoring the manufacturer's responsibility to provide understandable warnings.\n\nOption D proposes she assumed the risk by not performing the \"patch test.\" But assuming the risk requires knowledge of the risk, which she didn't have due to the language barrier.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the most likely outcome is that she will win the case because the warning was ineffective for her, and she didn't understand the risks involved.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might influence the outcome.\n\nPerhaps the shampoo is a commonly used product, and it's reasonable to expect users to understand basic instructions, even if they don't read English. However, this seems unfair, as it discriminates against non-English speakers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the box cover had universal symbols or images that could have indicated the need for a patch test, but the question doesn't mention that.\n\nAnother angle is that the immigrant threw away the box cover, which contained the warning. If she had kept it, perhaps she could have sought assistance in understanding the warning. However, discarding the box cover doesn't negate the manufacturer's responsibility to provide adequate warnings at the point of use.\n\nIn conclusion, the most plausible answer is A: she will win because she suffered injury from using the product, and the warning was ineffective due to her inability to understand English.\n\nOption B is also tempting, but it focuses on the manufacturer's knowledge, which isn't the primary consideration in strict products liability.\n\nOptions C and D seem less favorable because they impose burdens on the user that may not be consistent with the principles of products liability law.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
