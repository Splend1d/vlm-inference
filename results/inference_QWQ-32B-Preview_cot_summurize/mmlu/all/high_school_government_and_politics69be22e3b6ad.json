                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the option that best describes the balance the Supreme Court has struck between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause. First, I should remember what these clauses are about.\n\nThe establishment clause is part of the First Amendment and it says that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. This means the government can't officially favor one religion over others or promote religion in general. The free-exercise clause is also in the First Amendment and it says that Congress can't prohibit the free exercise of religion. So, people can practice their religion as they see fit, as long as it doesn't harm others or go against important public interests.\n\nSo, the Supreme Court has to balance these two: on one hand, not promoting religion or favoring one over another, and on the other hand, allowing people to freely practice their religion. It's tricky because sometimes what the government does might be seen as promoting religion, which could step on the establishment clause, but at the same time, restricting religious practices could violate the free-exercise clause.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Freedom of speech is protected except in certain situations, such as yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater.\n\nWait, this is about freedom of speech, not directly about religion. So, this seems unrelated to the establishment and free-exercise clauses. Maybe I should skip this one.\n\nB. Once a church has been recognized by the federal government, its tax-exempt status can never be revoked.\n\nHmm, this seems to be about tax-exempt status for churches. I know that churches are generally tax-exempt, but I don't think the Supreme Court has said that this status can never be revoked. Probably, there are conditions under which it could be revoked, like if the church engages in too much political activity or something. So, this might not be the best answer.\n\nC. Once Congress has created an administrative agency, that agency can be dissolved only by a constitutional amendment.\n\nThis seems to be about administrative agencies and constitutional amendments, which doesn't directly relate to the establishment or free-exercise clauses. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nD. State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n\nOkay, this seems relevant. I recall that the Supreme Court has ruled that school-sponsored prayer is not allowed because it would be the government promoting religion, which violates the establishment clause. However, students have the right to pray on their own, as long as it's not sponsored or organized by the school. So, this seems to balance the two clauses: prohibiting government promotion of religion but allowing individual expression of religion.\n\nLet me think about this some more. Is there any case law that supports this?\n\nWell, in Engel v. Vitale (1962), the Supreme Court ruled that it's unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools. Similarly, in Abington School District v. Schempp (1963), the Court banned Bible reading in public schools. These cases show the Court's stance against government promotion of religion in schools.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court has also recognized that students have the right to engage in voluntary prayer. For example, in Lee v. Weisman (1992), the Court prohibited school-led prayers at graduation ceremonies, but it's generally understood that students can pray on their own or in groups, as long as it's not sponsored by the school.\n\nSo, option D seems to capture this balance: prohibiting state-sponsored prayer during school hours but allowing voluntary prayer by student groups before school.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is about freedom of speech, which is important, but not directly related to the establishment and free-exercise clauses.\n\nOption B is about tax-exempt status for churches. While tax-exemption is related to religion, I don't think it's the best example of balancing the establishment and free-exercise clauses. Plus, I don't think the Supreme Court has said that once recognized, a church's tax-exempt status can never be revoked. There must be ways for the government to revoke tax-exempt status under certain conditions.\n\nOption C is about administrative agencies and constitutional amendments, which seems completely off-topic for this question.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate answer. It directly addresses the balance between prohibiting government promotion of religion (establishment clause) and allowing individual religious expression (free-exercise clause) in the context of schools.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
