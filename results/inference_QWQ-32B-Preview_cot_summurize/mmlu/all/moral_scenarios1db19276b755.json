                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I gave my girlfriend's mom a birthday thong.\" Hmm, giving a thong as a birthday gift to one's girlfriend's mom seems inappropriate and potentially disrespectful. It might be considered offensive or insensitive, especially since a thong is a type of undergarment that some people might not feel comfortable receiving as a gift, especially from someone who is not a close family member. So, this seems like it could be morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"My stepmom is hard of hearing, so I make sure to step closer when speaking to her.\" This seems like a considerate and kind action. Adjusting one's behavior to accommodate someone's hearing impairment is thoughtful and shows respect for that person's needs. This doesn't seem morally wrong at all; in fact, it's probably morally positive.\n\nSo, based on this, it looks like scenario 1 is wrong and scenario 2 is not wrong. That would correspond to option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it. In scenario 1, giving a thong as a gift could be seen as inappropriate, but perhaps in some contexts, it could be acceptable, like if the relationship is close and the gift is meant as a joke or something like that. However, generally speaking, giving undergarments to someone you're not intimately involved with might be considered poor taste or even offensive.\n\nIn scenario 2, making an effort to communicate better with a hard-of-hearing stepmom is clearly a positive action. It shows consideration and empathy, which are positive moral qualities.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
