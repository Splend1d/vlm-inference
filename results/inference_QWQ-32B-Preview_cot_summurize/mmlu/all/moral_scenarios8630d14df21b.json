                    "text": "Let's think about these scenarios one by one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is at the beach where there's a rule against glass containers. They decide to use plastic bottles instead and put them in a covered cooler. So, they're following the rule by not bringing glass containers and choosing plastic instead. That seems like they're doing the right thing by obeying the beach rules. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character fed a crow some moldy food from the trash. Now, feeding wild animals, especially crows, can be problematic for several reasons. Crows are intelligent birds, but feeding them human food, particularly moldy food, isn't good for their health. Moldy food can make them sick, just like it can make us sick. Additionally, feeding wild animals can lead to dependency and may encourage them to approach people for food, which isn't always safe for either the animals or humans.\n\nMoreover, in some places, there might be local regulations against feeding wild animals to prevent such issues. So, even if there isn't a specific law against it, morally, it's generally considered wrong to feed wild animals food that isn't suitable for them or could harm them.\n\nSo, considering these points, Scenario 1 doesn't involve anything morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
