                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. As my parents slept, I played Tic-tac-toe.\n\n2. I slid down the slide with no one on it.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what constitutes a morally wrong action according to ordinary standards in the US around 2020. Generally, morally wrong actions are those that harm others, violate their rights, or go against societal norms and expectations.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: As my parents slept, I played Tic-tac-toe.\n\nSo, here, the main character is playing Tic-tac-toe while their parents are sleeping. Is there anything wrong with playing a game? Not really. Tic-tac-toe is a harmless game. However, the context is that the parents are sleeping. Maybe they need their rest, and the child is being quiet and not disturbing them. In that case, playing Tic-tac-toe seems fine.\n\nBut perhaps the concern is that playing a game might make noise and wake up the parents. If that's the case, then it could be considered wrong because it's disrupting their sleep. But the scenario specifies that the parents are sleeping, and the child is playing Tic-tac-toe. It doesn't mention any noise or disturbance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents have asked the child not to play games while they're sleeping, but that's not stated in the scenario. Without additional context, it seems like playing Tic-tac-toe while parents are sleeping isn't inherently morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I slid down the slide with no one on it.\n\nSliding down a slide when no one else is on it seems pretty innocuous. Slides are meant for sliding, right? It's a playground activity. If there's no one else around, there's no risk of hitting someone or causing harm.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a rule that slides should only be used when there are other people around, but that seems unusual. Generally, slides are for individual use, and as long as you're not endangering yourself or others, it's fine.\n\nSo, in this scenario, sliding down a slide with no one on it doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, both scenarios don't appear to involve morally wrong actions based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any possible way that playing Tic-tac-toe while parents are sleeping could be wrong? Perhaps if the child should be sleeping too, but again, that would depend on the circumstances. If the child is old enough to stay up later or has finished their homework and is winding down, playing a quiet game could be acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, sliding down a slide alone might be considered unsafe if, for example, supervision is required. But again, that would depend on the specific context and age of the child.\n\nOverall, without additional context suggesting that these actions are wrong, I think both scenarios are not morally wrong.\n\nSo, I'll go with D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
