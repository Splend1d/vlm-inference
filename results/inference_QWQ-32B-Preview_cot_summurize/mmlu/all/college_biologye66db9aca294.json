Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says \"photosynthesis to produce glucose.\" Now, photosynthesis is the process by which plants, some bacteria, and algae convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Fungi don't have the ability to do this because they lack chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis. So, fungi can't produce their own food through photosynthesis. They obtain their nutrients by breaking down and absorbing organic matter from their environment. So, it seems like fungi don't participate in photosynthesis to produce glucose.\n\nOption B is \"fermentation to produce alcohol.\" Fungi, particularly yeast, are known for their role in fermentation processes, including the production of alcohol in beverages like wine and beer. During fermentation, yeast converts sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This is a well-known process, so fungi do participate in fermentation to produce alcohol.\n\nOption C mentions \"association with humans to produce ringworm.\" Ringworm is a fungal infection that affects the skin, causing a ring-shaped rash. It's caused by various types of fungi, mainly dermatophytes. So, fungi do associate with humans in this way, causing ringworm infections.\n\nOption D is \"association with the roots of plants to form mycorrhizae.\" Mycorrhizae are symbiotic associations between fungi and plant roots. In this relationship, the fungi help the plant absorb water and nutrients from the soil, while the plant provides the fungi with carbohydrates. This is a mutually beneficial relationship that is common in nature.\n\nSo, looking back at option A, fungi don't participate in photosynthesis to produce glucose. They obtain their nutrients differently. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
