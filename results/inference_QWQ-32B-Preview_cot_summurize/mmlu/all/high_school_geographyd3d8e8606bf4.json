Von Th\u00fcnen\n\nVon Th\u00fcnen's model, also known as the von Th\u00fcnen's isoline model or the von Th\u00fcnen's rings, is a theoretical construct that attempts to explain how agricultural land use is organized around a central market. The model was developed by the German economist and philosopher Johann Heinrich von Th\u00fcnen in his book \"The Isolated State\" published in 1826.\n\nVon Th\u00fcnen's model is based on several assumptions, including:\n\n1. A flat, featureless plain with uniform soil fertility.\n\n2. A single central market located at the center of the plain.\n\n3. Transportation costs are the only factor affecting the cost of moving goods to market.\n\n4. Farmers aim to maximize profits.\n\nGiven these assumptions, von Th\u00fcnen proposed that different types of agriculture would be located at varying distances from the central market based on their transportation costs and profitability.\n\nIn von Th\u00fcnen's model, the plain is divided into concentric rings, each dedicated to a specific type of agricultural activity:\n\n1. **Ring 1: Market Garden Agriculture**\n\n   - Closest to the market.\n\n   - Includes high-value, perishable crops that require frequent transportation, such as vegetables and dairy products.\n\n   - These products have high transportation costs per unit distance due to their perishability and weight.\n\n2. **Ring 2: Forestry**\n\n   - Slightly farther from the market.\n\n   - Includes activities like timber production and fuelwood.\n\n   - These products have lower transportation costs per unit distance compared to perishable goods.\n\n3. **Ring 3: Rotational Crops**\n\n   - Further from the market.\n\n   - Includes crops like rye and wheat that can be stored for longer periods.\n\n   - Transportation costs are lower than for perishable goods but higher than for timber.\n\n4. **Ring 4: Three-Field System**\n\n   - Even farther from the market.\n\n   - Includes crops that require less frequent transportation, such as oats and barley.\n\n   - Transportation costs are lower due to the longer storage life of these crops.\n\n5. **Ring 5: Pastoral Farming**\n\n   - Farthest from the market.\n\n   - Includes grazing lands for livestock.\n\n   - Transportation costs are the lowest since animals can walk to market or are transported over longer distances without significant spoilage.\n\nVon Th\u00fcnen's model suggests that the most profitable use of land closest to the market is for high-value, perishable goods, while lower-value, less perishable goods are located farther away. This spatial organization minimizes transportation costs and maximizes profits for farmers.\n\nWhile von Th\u00fcnen's model is a theoretical construct and makes several simplifying assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios, it provides a foundational understanding of how economic factors influence land use patterns in agriculture.\n\n**Other Options Explained:**\n\n- **A. Rostow**\n\n  - W.W. Rostow is known for his theory of economic growth, particularly the \"stages of economic growth\" model, which outlines the process by which traditional agrarian societies develop into modern industrial nations. His work is more related to economic development and less to specific patterns of land use in agriculture.\n\n- **B. Ravenstein**\n\n  - Ernst Georg Ravenstein was a geographer known for his laws of migration, which describe the patterns and characteristics of human migration. His work is focused on population movement rather than agricultural land use.\n\n- **D. Burgess**\n\n  - Ernest W. Burgess is known for his concentric zone model, which describes the spatial structure of urban areas. His model divides cities into concentric rings based on social and economic characteristics, focusing on urban land use rather than agricultural patterns.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, von Th\u00fcnen is the theorist who specifically tried to explain the prices of farm products in relation to patterns of land use.\n\n"
