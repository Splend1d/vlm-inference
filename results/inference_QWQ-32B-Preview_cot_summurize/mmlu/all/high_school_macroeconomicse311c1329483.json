                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about automatic fiscal policy stabilizers. I need to figure out which statement is true regarding them. So, first things first, I should recall what automatic fiscal policy stabilizers are.\n\nAutomatic fiscal policy stabilizers are built-in mechanisms in the economy that help to stabilize economic fluctuations without the need for new government actions or policies. They work automatically to counteract economic downturns and upswings. The main components are typically progressive taxation and unemployment benefits.\n\nOkay, so let's look at option A: \"For a given level of government spending, they produce a deficit during a recession and a surplus during an expansion.\"\n\nHmm, that sounds plausible. During a recession, economic activity slows down, people earn less, and therefore pay less in taxes. If government spending remains the same, the reduced tax revenue could lead to a deficit. Conversely, during an expansion, people earn more, pay more in taxes, and if spending stays the same, that could lead to a surplus. So, this seems consistent with how automatic stabilizers work.\n\nNow, option B: \"They serve to prolong recessionary and inflationary periods.\"\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. The whole point of automatic stabilizers is to dampen economic fluctuations, not to prolong them. So, this seems contrary to their purpose. I can cross this one out.\n\nOption C: \"The regressive tax system is a fundamental component of automatic stabilizers.\"\n\nHmm, I know that progressive tax systems are often associated with automatic stabilizers because they take a larger percentage of income from higher earners, who may save more, and thus help to reduce consumption during booms and increase it during busts. A regressive tax system, where lower-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes, might not have the same stabilizing effect. In fact, it could potentially exacerbate economic fluctuations. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D: \"For a given level of government spending, they produce a surplus during a recession and a surplus during an expansion.\"\n\nThis one doesn't make sense. If they produce a surplus during both a recession and an expansion, that would mean that revenue consistently exceeds spending, which isn't aligning with the typical behavior of automatic stabilizers. During a recession, we'd expect lower tax revenues and potentially higher spending on social programs, leading to a deficit, not a surplus.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option A seems to be the correct choice. Automatic fiscal policy stabilizers, for a given level of government spending, produce a deficit during a recession and a surplus during an expansion.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nDuring a recession:\n\n- Tax revenues decrease because incomes are lower.\n\n- Unemployment benefits and other transfer payments increase.\n\n- If government spending remains constant, the combination of lower revenues and higher transfer payments leads to a deficit.\n\nDuring an expansion:\n\n- Tax revenues increase as incomes rise.\n\n- Unemployment benefits decrease as fewer people are unemployed.\n\n- Again, with spending held constant, higher revenues and lower transfer payments lead to a surplus.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think A is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption B is wrong because automatic stabilizers are designed to mitigate economic fluctuations, not prolong them. They help to smooth out the business cycle.\n\nOption C is incorrect because regressive tax systems are not typically considered stabilizers. In fact, they might have the opposite effect, as lower-income individuals may spend a higher proportion of their income, which could amplify economic swings.\n\nOption D is just illogical because it suggests surpluses in both recession and expansion, which doesn't align with the behavior of automatic stabilizers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
