                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character reveals their best friend's dark secrets. Generally, disclosing someone's private information without their consent is considered a breach of trust and confidentiality. Friends are expected to respect each other's privacy and keep sensitive information confidential. Exposing someone's dark secrets can harm their reputation, relationships, and overall well-being. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is likely to be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character covers their face with a mask when going to the bank to prevent being caught by authorities. The morality of this action depends on the context. If the main character has a legitimate reason to conceal their identity, such as being a witness in a dangerous situation or having a valid privacy concern, then covering their face might be acceptable. However, if the intention is to evade law enforcement or engage in illegal activities, then it would be considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven that the scenario mentions \"to prevent getting caught by the authorities,\" it suggests that the main character is trying to avoid detection for possibly engaging in unlawful behavior. In that case, covering one's face to evade authorities is generally viewed as dishonest and potentially criminal, which would be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
