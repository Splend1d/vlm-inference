Aristotle was all about empirical observation and rational thought, and he seemed to believe that ethics was something that could be improved upon and adapted over time. He didn't see his ideas as set in stone, but rather as a starting point for further discussion and development. So, I think \"open-ended and revisable\" best describes his view of the virtues."
