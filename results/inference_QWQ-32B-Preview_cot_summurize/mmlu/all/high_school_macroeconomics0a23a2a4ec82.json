                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option best represents a monetarist point of view. Let's see what each option says.\n\nOption A: \"monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy.\" I think monetarists might not entirely agree with this. From what I remember, monetarists, like Milton Friedman, believe in a more rules-based approach to monetary policy rather than constant adjustments to fine-tune the economy. So, maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B: \"crowding out is not a problem.\" Crowding out refers to the situation where government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, which in turn reduces private investment. I don't recall monetarists having a specific stance on crowding out. They focus more on the money supply and its effects on the economy. So, perhaps this isn't the primary monetarist view.\n\nOption C: \"the money supply should be increased steadily.\" This sounds familiar. Monetarists believe in controlling the money supply and often advocate for a steady, predictable growth rate in the money supply. This is to avoid inflation and economic fluctuations. So, this seems like a likely candidate.\n\nOption D: \"the velocity of money is unstable.\" Velocity of money refers to how quickly money circulates in the economy. Monetarists, particularly Milton Friedman, argued that the velocity of money is relatively stable in the long run. So, saying it's unstable wouldn't align with their views.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems to best represent a monetarist point of view. They emphasize the importance of a steady, predictable increase in the money supply to maintain economic stability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
