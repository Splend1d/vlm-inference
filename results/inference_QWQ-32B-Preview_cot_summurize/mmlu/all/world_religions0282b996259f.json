                    "text": "Pure Land Buddhism belongs to the Mahayana school. So, the correct answer is C. Mahayana.\n\nTo provide some context, Buddhism is primarily divided into three main branches: Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. Each of these branches has different schools and traditions within them.\n\n- **Theravada** is often referred to as the \"School of the Elders\" and is predominant in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. It focuses on the earliest teachings of the Buddha and emphasizes individual enlightenment through monastic life and meditation.\n\n- **Mahayana** is known as the \"Great Vehicle\" and is practiced in China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Tibet. It emphasizes the bodhisattva path, where individuals vow to attain enlightenment not just for themselves but for all sentient beings. Within Mahayana, there are various schools such as Zen, Pure Land, Nichiren, and Tiantai.\n\n- **Vajrayana** is also known as Tibetan Buddhism and is prominent in Tibet, Bhutan, Mongolia, and parts of India and Nepal. It incorporates esoteric practices and rituals along with the core Mahayana principles.\n\n**Pure Land Buddhism** is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism that focuses on devotion to the Buddha Amitabha and the aspiration to be reborn in his pure land, known as Sukhavati. It is particularly popular in East Asian countries such as China, Japan, and Korea.\n\nSo, to summarize, Pure Land Buddhism is part of the Mahayana tradition.\n\n**Additional Note:** The option D, Mahavira, is not a school of Buddhism. Mahavira is the founder of Jainism, which is a separate Indian religion distinct from Buddhism."
