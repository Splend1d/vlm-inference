                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the set S is in the unit square [0,1] x [0,1], where S consists of all points (x,y) where x or y or both are irrational numbers. I need to determine its properties with respect to the standard topology on R^2, specifically whether it's closed, open, connected, or totally disconnected.\n\nFirst, let's understand what S is. The unit square is all points (x,y) where both x and y are between 0 and 1, inclusive. S includes all points where at least one of x or y is irrational. So, the points not in S would be those where both x and y are rational numbers, because if both are rational, then neither x nor y is irrational.\n\nSo, the complement of S, denoted as S^c, is the set of all points (x,y) in [0,1] x [0,1] where both x and y are rational.\n\nNow, I need to recall some topological definitions to determine the properties of S.\n\n1. **Closed set**: A set is closed if it contains all its limit points.\n\n2. **Open set**: A set is open if for every point in the set, there exists a neighborhood around that point entirely contained within the set.\n\n3. **Connected set**: A set is connected if it cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open subsets.\n\n4. **Totally disconnected set**: A set is totally disconnected if no two points can be connected by a connected subset containing both of them.\n\nLet's analyze S based on these definitions.\n\n**Is S closed?**\n\nTo determine if S is closed, I need to see if it contains all its limit points. Consider a sequence of points in S that converges to a point in [0,1] x [0,1]. Does the limit point necessarily belong to S?\n\nTake a sequence of points in S, where each point has at least one irrational coordinate. If this sequence converges to a point where both coordinates are rational, then S does not contain all its limit points, meaning S is not closed.\n\nFor example, consider the sequence of points (x_n, y_n) where x_n is irrational approaching a rational number x, and y_n is rational approaching y. If y is rational, then the limit point (x,y) has x rational (since x is the limit of x_n, which are irrational, but limits don't preserve irrationality) and y rational. Wait, but x is the limit of irrational numbers; however, the limit of irrational numbers can be rational or irrational. For instance, take x_n = \u221a2/n, which are all irrational, and they converge to 0, which is rational.\n\nSo, if x_n \u2192 0 and y_n is rational approaching y, then the limit point is (0,y), where y is rational. But 0 is rational, so (0,y) is in S^c, meaning S does not contain all its limit points. Therefore, S is not closed.\n\n**Is S open?**\n\nTo determine if S is open, I need to check if for every point in S, there exists an open ball around that point entirely contained in S.\n\nTake a point (x,y) in S, meaning at least one of x or y is irrational. Suppose x is irrational. Can I find an open ball around (x,y) where all points have at least one irrational coordinate?\n\nWell, in any open ball around (x,y), there will be points where both coordinates are rational, because rational numbers are dense in the real numbers. So, no matter how small the ball, there will be points with both rational coordinates, which would be in S^c. Therefore, S is not open.\n\n**Is S connected?**\n\nTo determine if S is connected, I need to see if it cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open subsets.\n\nConsider the unit square [0,1] x [0,1]. S is the set where at least one coordinate is irrational. S^c is the set where both coordinates are rational.\n\nI suspect S is connected because any separation of S into two disjoint open sets would have to cut through points where at least one coordinate is irrational, which seems difficult due to the density of irrational numbers.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the set of points where x is irrational is connected (it's homeomorphic to the irrationals in [0,1] times [0,1]), and similarly for y irrational. Since these two sets overlap (where both x and y are irrational), their union S should be connected.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. Maybe I should try to find a continuous function that maps S onto a connected space.\n\nAlternatively, suppose S is not connected, so there exist two disjoint non-empty open sets U and V in S such that S = U \u222a V. Consider a point in U and a point in V; since irrational numbers are dense, there should be a path connecting them through irrational coordinates, suggesting that S is connected.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure, so maybe I should consider another approach.\n\n**Is S totally disconnected?**\n\nA set is totally disconnected if no two points can be connected by a connected subset containing both of them.\n\nGiven that S is dense in the unit square (since irrational numbers are dense), and considering that any two points in S can be connected via a path that mostly lies in S (since irrational numbers are dense), it seems unlikely that S is totally disconnected.\n\nMoreover, in a dense subset with dense connections, it's typically connected.\n\nTherefore, I think S is connected.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- S is not closed.\n\n- S is not open.\n\n- S is connected.\n\n- S is not totally disconnected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. connected.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
