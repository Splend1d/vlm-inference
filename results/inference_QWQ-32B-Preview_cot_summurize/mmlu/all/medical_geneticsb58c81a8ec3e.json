When it does occur in men, it's often linked to genetic mutations, similar to female breast cancer.\n\nBRCA2 is a gene that, when mutated, increases the risk of several cancers, including breast cancer in both men and women, as well as ovarian, prostate, and other cancers. In the context of male breast cancer, BRCA2 mutations are particularly significant.\n\nBRCA1 mutations are also associated with breast cancer, but in men, BRCA2 seems to play a larger role. NF1 is related to neurofibromatosis, and RET mutations are more commonly associated with thyroid and other endocrine cancers, not specifically with male breast cancer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. BRCA2.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- American Cancer Society. (2021). *What Causes Breast Cancer in Men?* [Online].
