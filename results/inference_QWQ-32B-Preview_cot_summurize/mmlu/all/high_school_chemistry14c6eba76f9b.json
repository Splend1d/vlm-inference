                    "text": "So I've got this question about reaction rates and determining the order of a reactant. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nThe question is: In determining the order for reactant A in a certain reaction, the concentrations of all other reactants are held constant while the concentration of A is tripled from one experiment to another. The reaction rate is found to triple. The appropriate exponent for A in the rate law is... and then it gives options A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to recall what a rate law is. I think the rate law expresses the relationship between the reaction rate and the concentrations of the reactants, right? And the exponent on each reactant in the rate law indicates the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant.\n\nSo, generally, a rate law looks like this: rate = k [A]^m [B]^n, where [A] and [B] are the concentrations of reactants A and B, and m and n are their respective orders.\n\nIn this problem, all other reactants are held constant, so I can probably ignore them for the purpose of finding the order with respect to A. So, the rate law simplifies to rate = k [A]^m, where m is the order with respect to A.\n\nNow, the problem says that when the concentration of A is tripled, the reaction rate also triples. So, if I let the initial concentration be [A], and the initial rate be rate1, then rate1 = k [A]^m.\n\nIf I triple the concentration of A, new [A] is 3[A], and the new rate is rate2 = k (3[A])^m.\n\nAccording to the problem, rate2 is three times rate1, so rate2 = 3 * rate1.\n\nSo, plugging in the expressions:\n\nk (3[A])^m = 3 * k [A]^m\n\nI can cancel out k and [A]^m from both sides, assuming [A] is not zero and k is not zero.\n\nSo, (3[A])^m / [A]^m = 3\n\nSimplifying, 3^m * [A]^m / [A]^m = 3\n\nSo, 3^m = 3\n\nTherefore, m = 1\n\nSo, the order with respect to A is 1.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. 1 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nIs there any possibility that m could be different? Let's see.\n\nIf m were 2, then 3^2 = 9, but the rate only tripled, so that doesn't match.\n\nIf m were 3, then 3^3 = 27, which is way more than 3.\n\nSimilarly, m = 4 would give 3^4 = 81, which is even worse.\n\nSo, indeed, m = 1 is the only value that satisfies the condition that tripling [A] triples the rate.\n\nAlternatively, if m were 1/1, which is just 1, that fits.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]\n\n"
