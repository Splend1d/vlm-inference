According to various studies and reports, including those from the World Bank and Credit Suisse, the threshold for being in the top one percent globally is around $35,000 per year.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this is the case:\n\n1. **Global Income Distribution**: Income distribution varies significantly across different countries due to differences in economic development, cost of living, and other factors. To be in the top one percent globally, one needs to earn more than 99% of the world's population.\n\n2. ** Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)**: When comparing incomes across countries, it's essential to consider the cost of living. Purchasing power parity adjusts for these differences, allowing for a more accurate comparison of living standards.\n\n3. **Data Sources**: According to Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Report 2020, the top one percent of adults worldwide held 44% of total global wealth. In terms of income, a study by economists such as Branko Milanovic and Christoph Lakner suggests that the global income distribution has been shifting, with emerging economies like China and India contributing to changes in the income brackets.\n\n4. **Specific Thresholds**: Various estimates place the income threshold for the top one percent anywhere between $32,000 to $42,000 per year, depending on the data source and methodology. For the purpose of this question, $35,000 is a reasonable estimate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $35,000\n\nThis means that earning $35,000 per year places an individual among the top one percent of global earners, considering the vast differences in income levels across the world. It's important to note that this figure is based on annual income and does not account for wealth, which includes assets like real estate, investments, and savings.\n\nFor further reading and to explore different perspectives on global income inequality, you might want to look into reports from organizations such as the World Bank, OECD, and academic research papers on income distribution."
