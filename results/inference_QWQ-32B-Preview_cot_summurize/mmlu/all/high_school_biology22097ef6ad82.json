Permafrost is that permanently frozen soil, right? So, I need to think about which of these biomes has permafrost.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Desert - Deserts are known for being dry, but I don't think they have permafrost. Permafrost is more associated with cold regions, not necessarily dry ones.\n\nB. Tundra - Ah, tundra is a cold biome, and I think it's known for having permafrost. That makes sense.\n\nC. Taiga - Taiga is also a cold biome, but I'm not sure if permafrost is a major feature there.\n\nD. Deciduous forests - These are in temperate regions, and I don't think they have permafrost.\n\nSo, between tundra and taiga, which one is more characterized by permafrost?\n\nI recall that tundra is the coldest of the biomes and has a layer of permafrost very close to the surface, which prevents roots from growing deep. Taiga, on the other hand, does have permafrost, but it's not as consistently near the surface as in the tundra.\n\nAlso, in tundra, the soil thawing is very shallow, so plants adapt by having shallow root systems.\n\nDesert plants have shallow roots to absorb water from rare rains, but it's not because of permafrost.\n\nDeciduous forests have deep soil that thaws completely in summer, so no permafrost issue.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Tundra.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nPermafrost is defined as soil that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years. It's common in high latitudes and\u9ad8\u5c71\u5730\u533a\u3002\n\nIn the tundra, the subsoil is permanently frozen, and only the top layer thaws during the very short summer, which forces plants to have shallow roots.\n\nIn the taiga, or boreal forests, permafrost exists but is more sporadic and not as widespread as in the tundra.\n\nDeserts can be cold or hot, but permafrost is not a defining characteristic.\n\nDeciduous forests are in temperate regions without permafrost.\n\nTherefore, the biome that fits the description is the tundra.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
