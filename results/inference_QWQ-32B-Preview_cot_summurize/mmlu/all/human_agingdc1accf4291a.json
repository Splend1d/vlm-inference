                    "text": "Let's see. In the Senior View chapter with Dr. Donham, he discussed several factors that contribute to a long and healthy life. He emphasized the importance of mental stimulation, exercise, and diet. Now, the question is asking for one more factor that he mentioned.\n\nOption A is moderate amounts of alcohol. I do recall that in some studies, moderate alcohol consumption has been linked to health benefits, but I'm not sure if Dr. Donham specifically mentioned this in the chapter.\n\nOption B is social support. That sounds familiar. I think Dr. Donham did talk about the role of relationships and social connections in longevity.\n\nOption C is good genes. Certainly, genetics play a role in lifespan, but I think Dr. Donham focused more on lifestyle factors that people can control.\n\nOption D is avoiding stress. While managing stress is important, I don't remember if he singled this out as one of the key factors.\n\nLet me try to recall the chapter. Dr. Donham was interviewing seniors who had lived long lives, right? And he was identifying common habits or factors that contributed to their longevity.\n\nI think he mentioned that mental stimulation, like reading, learning new things, and staying curious, is important. Exercise was another key point\u2014regular physical activity. Diet was also emphasized, probably focusing on balanced nutrition and perhaps specific dietary habits.\n\nNow, besides these, what else did he highlight? I think social support was a significant factor. The seniors he interviewed often talked about the importance of family, friends, and community in their lives. It seems like having strong social connections provided emotional support and perhaps even practical help when needed.\n\nGood genes are certainly a factor, but Dr. Donham seemed more interested in aspects that people can influence themselves, rather than just inheriting good genes.\n\nAs for avoiding stress, while it's important to manage stress, I don't remember if he specifically listed it as one of the main factors.\n\nSo, based on my memory of the chapter, I would go with social support as the additional factor Dr. Donham mentioned for a long life.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
