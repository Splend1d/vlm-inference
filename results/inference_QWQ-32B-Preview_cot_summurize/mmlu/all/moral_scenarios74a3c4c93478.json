                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I went fishing for trout last weekend.\n\nScenario 2: As a business owner, I must take some money out of my employee's checks to put into the business.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about Scenario 1. Going fishing for trout. Is that morally wrong? Well, in general, fishing is a common activity in the US, and it's legal as long as you follow the rules, like having a license and following regulations about the size and number of fish you can catch. So, unless there's something specific about how the person was fishing that was unethical, like using illegal methods or fishing in protected areas, it seems like just going fishing shouldn't be morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: As a business owner, taking some money out of employees' checks to put into the business. Hmm, that sounds fishy. Normally, as a business owner, you pay your employees the agreed-upon wages, right? Taking money out of their checks without their consent would be like deducting money from their pay without a valid reason, which could be considered theft or at least unethical.\n\nBut maybe there's a context where it's acceptable. For example, if the employees agreed to some sort of investment or something where part of their pay goes back into the business. But the way it's phrased, \"must take some money out of my employee's checks to put into the business,\" it sounds like the owner is compelled to do this, perhaps without the employees' consent. That doesn't sound right.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, taking money out of employees' checks without their agreement would likely be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 seems not wrong, and Scenario 2 seems wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like C. Not wrong, Wrong would be the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing about Scenario 1. Is there any way that going fishing could be morally wrong? Well, some people might have ethical concerns about fishing, considering it cruel to animals. However, in general, fishing is accepted as a sport and a food source in the US, so it's not universally considered morally wrong.\n\nIn contrast, withholding or deducting money from employees' pay without their consent is clearly against moral standards and likely legal standards as well.\n\nSo, yes, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
