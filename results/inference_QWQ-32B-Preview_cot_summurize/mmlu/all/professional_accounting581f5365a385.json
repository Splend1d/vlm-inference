                    "text": "So Holt Co. found out that they didn't report $40,000 of depreciation for a new building in the previous year. And this depreciation was calculated correctly for tax purposes, but they just forgot to put it in their financial statements. Now, the tax rate for the current year is 20%, and they need to correct this error in the current year. The question is, how should they report this correction?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happened here. Depreciation is an expense that reduces the value of an asset over time, and it's supposed to be recorded in the period it relates to, according to the matching principle in accounting. So, if Holt Co. forgot to record $40,000 of depreciation in the prior year, that's an error that needs to be corrected in the current year.\n\nSince it's a prior period error, the correction should be made by adjusting the beginning retained earnings of the current year. The amount to be adjusted would be the depreciation expense of $40,000, less any tax effect, because depreciation affects taxable income.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes. Does that mean they already accounted for it in their tax returns, or that they calculated the depreciation correctly but just didn't record it in their financial statements? I think it's the latter, that they calculated it correctly for tax purposes but didn't record it in their financial statements.\n\nSo, for financial reporting, they need to recognize this missed depreciation expense. Now, depreciation expense flows through to retained earnings via the income statement. So, correcting a prior period's depreciation expense would require an adjustment to the beginning retained earnings.\n\nThe journal entry to correct this would typically be:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings (beginning balance) for the amount of the correction, which is the depreciation expense of $40,000, adjusted for taxes.\n\nCredit Accumulated Depreciation for the same amount.\n\nBut wait, the tax rate is given as 20% for the current year. Does that mean that the tax effect needs to be considered in the correction?\n\nYes, because the depreciation was not recorded in the prior year, it likely affected the tax liability in the prior year. But since the depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes, maybe they already adjusted their taxes accordingly. Hmm.\n\nLet me think differently. If the depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes, but not recorded in the financial statements, that means that for financial reporting, they need to recognize the depreciation expense, which will reduce their net income and, consequently, retained earnings.\n\nNow, considering the tax effect, if they're using the liability method for income taxes, they need to consider the tax rate in the year the error is corrected, which is 20% in the current year.\n\nSo, the tax savings from the additional depreciation would be $40,000 multiplied by the current year's tax rate of 20%, which is $8,000.\n\nTherefore, the net adjustment to retained earnings would be $40,000 (depreciation expense) minus $8,000 (tax savings), equaling $32,000.\n\nSo, they would debit Retained Earnings for $32,000 and credit Accumulated Depreciation for $32,000.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the full $40,000 is the depreciation expense that should be recognized, and the tax effect is separate.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nActually, when correcting prior period errors, the full amount of the expense should be adjusted, and the tax effect should be considered separately.\n\nSo, the correction would involve:\n\n1. Recognizing the missed depreciation expense of $40,000 in the prior year, which would reduce retained earnings by $40,000.\n\n2. Adjusting for the tax effect. Since the depreciation was not recorded in the prior year, but was computed correctly for tax purposes, perhaps they already took the tax deduction in the prior year.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify when the tax deduction was taken. It just says that the depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes.\n\nAssuming that they did take the tax deduction in the prior year, then in the current year, when they correct the financial statements, they need to recognize the depreciation expense of $40,000, but since the tax effect is already accounted for in the prior year, perhaps there's no additional tax effect in the current year.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. As an increase in accumulated depreciation of $32,000.\n\nB. As an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40,000.\n\nC. As an increase in depreciation expense of $32,000.\n\nD. As an increase in depreciation expense of $40,000.\n\nGiven that this is a correction of a prior period error, it's more likely that they would adjust the accumulated depreciation directly, rather than recording it through the current year's depreciation expense.\n\nSo, options A and B are about increasing accumulated depreciation, while C and D are about increasing the current year's depreciation expense.\n\nI think adjusting accumulated depreciation directly is the correct approach, as it's a prior period error correction.\n\nNow, between A and B, whether it's $32,000 or $40,000, that depends on whether they need to consider the tax effect in the adjustment.\n\nGiven that the tax rate is 20%, and assuming that the tax effect needs to be considered, then the adjustment would be $40,000 minus $8,000 (20% of $40,000), which is $32,000.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct: increase accumulated depreciation by $32,000.\n\nBut wait, I recall that for prior period adjustments, the full amount of the error is typically adjusted, without considering the tax effect separately, because the tax effect was already considered in the prior period.\n\nBut in this case, since the tax rate is given for the current year, maybe they need to consider the current year's tax rate for the adjustment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tax effect has already been accounted for in the prior year, and in the current year, they only need to adjust the financial statements for the depreciation expense.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If Holt Co. failed to record $40,000 of depreciation in the prior year, then in the current year, to correct that, they need to recognize that $40,000 as a prior period adjustment.\n\nThe journal entry would be:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings for $40,000\n\nCredit Accumulated Depreciation for $40,000\n\nThis would reduce the beginning retained earnings by $40,000 and increase accumulated depreciation by $40,000, reflecting the missed depreciation in the prior year.\n\nHowever, if there is a tax effect, things might be different.\n\nAssuming that the depreciation was deductible for tax purposes in the prior year, and they already claimed the tax deduction, then in the current year, when they correct the financial statements, they don't need to adjust for taxes again.\n\nTherefore, the correction would be to adjust accumulated depreciation by the full $40,000, not considering the tax effect again.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct: increase accumulated depreciation by $40,000.\n\nBut the presence of the tax rate in the question makes me think that perhaps there is a tax effect that needs to be considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they need to adjust for the deferred tax asset or liability related to the depreciation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about the deferred taxes.\n\nIf Holt Co. failed to record depreciation in the prior year, that means their book net income was higher than their taxable income by $40,000 in the prior year.\n\nBut the problem says that depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes, which suggests that they did report the correct depreciation for tax purposes, meaning they likely took the $40,000 depreciation deduction in their tax return for the prior year.\n\nTherefore, in the prior year, their book income was higher than their taxable income by $40,000, resulting in a deferred tax liability of $8,000 (20% of $40,000).\n\nIn the current year, when they correct the error by recording the missed depreciation, they are reducing their book income by $40,000, which would increase the deferred tax asset or reduce the deferred tax liability.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to consider that the correction of the prior period error requires adjusting the accumulated depreciation by the full amount of the missed depreciation, which is $40,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: increase accumulated depreciation by $40,000.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure about the tax effect. Maybe I should look for guidance in the accounting standards.\n\nAccording to GAAP, specifically ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, corrections of errors should be reflected in the financial statements as if the error never occurred.\n\nThis typically involves adjusting the beginning balance of retained earnings in the year of correction, along with any other necessary adjustments to the financial statements.\n\nIn this case, correcting the missed depreciation of $40,000 would require decreasing the beginning retained earnings by $40,000 and increasing the accumulated depreciation by $40,000.\n\nThe tax effect may or may not need to be considered, depending on how taxes were handled in the prior period.\n\nGiven the information provided, and considering that the depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes, it's likely that the tax effect has already been accounted for, and the correction in the current year is purely related to the financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option B: increase accumulated depreciation by $40,000.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why option A might be considered.\n\nIf they adjust accumulated depreciation by $32,000, that would imply that they are considering the tax effect in the adjustment, perhaps by only recognizing $32,000 in the financial statements.\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the proper treatment of prior period error corrections, which should adjust the financial statements for the full amount of the error.\n\nTherefore, I believe option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nb. As an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40,000."
