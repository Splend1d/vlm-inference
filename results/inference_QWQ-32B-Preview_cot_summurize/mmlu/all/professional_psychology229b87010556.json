This can be done by calculating the z-score for each exam. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations above or below the mean a particular score is.\n\nThe formula for the z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( X \\) is the student's score on the exam,\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean score of the exam,\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the exam scores.\n\nA higher z-score indicates better performance relative to the other test-takers.\n\nLet's calculate the z-scores for each of the exams:\n\n1. **English:**\n\n   - Student's score (\\( X \\)): 150\n\n   - Mean (\\( \\mu \\)): 125\n\n   - Standard deviation (\\( \\sigma \\)): 20\n\n   \\[ z = \\frac{(150 - 125)}{20} = \\frac{25}{20} = 1.25 \\]\n\n2. **Math:**\n\n   - Student's score (\\( X \\)): 100\n\n   - Mean (\\( \\mu \\)): 90\n\n   - Standard deviation (\\( \\sigma \\)): 10\n\n   \\[ z = \\frac{(100 - 90)}{10} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1.00 \\]\n\n3. **Chemistry:**\n\n   - Student's score (\\( X \\)): 55\n\n   - Mean (\\( \\mu \\)): 45\n\n   - Standard deviation (\\( \\sigma \\)): 5\n\n   \\[ z = \\frac{(55 - 45)}{5} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2.00 \\]\n\n4. **History:**\n\n   - Student's score (\\( X \\)): 30\n\n   - Mean (\\( \\mu \\)): 30\n\n   - Standard deviation (\\( \\sigma \\)): 5\n\n   \\[ z = \\frac{(30 - 30)}{5} = \\frac{0}{5} = 0.00 \\]\n\nNow, let's compare the z-scores:\n\n- English: 1.25\n\n- Math: 1.00\n\n- Chemistry: 2.00\n\n- History: 0.00\n\nThe highest z-score is for Chemistry (2.00), which means the student performed best relative to others on the chemistry exam.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. chemistry.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
