I need to remember the order of operations, which is exponentiation first, then multiplication.\n\nSo, first, I look at 1 ** 4. Exponentiation in Python is done using the ** operator. So, 1 raised to the power of 4 should be 1, because any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1.\n\nNext, I have 4 multiplied by that result. So, 4 * 1 is 4.\n\nTherefore, the output should be 4.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Is there any precedence rule I should be aware of?\n\nLooking it up, in Python, exponentiation has higher precedence than multiplication. So, yes, 1 ** 4 is done first, which is 1, and then 4 * 1 is 4.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 4.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no tricks here. Is there any scenario where this could be different? For example, if 1 was a float, but it's just an integer 1.\n\nAlso, 4 is an integer, and multiplying integers in Python should just give an integer result.\n\nI think that's straightforward. No need to overcomplicate it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
