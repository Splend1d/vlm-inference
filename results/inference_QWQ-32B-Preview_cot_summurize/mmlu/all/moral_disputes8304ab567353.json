                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Pence's objections to the argument that SCNT (which I think stands for somatic cell nuclear transfer, a cloning technique) isn't best for the child. The question is asking which of the options isn't an objection that Pence gives. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Pence's objections are regarding this argument. SCNT is a way to create a genetically identical copy of an existing person, and there are ethical concerns about whether it's in the best interest of the child.\n\nOption A says that the argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism. Genetic determinism is the idea that genes solely determine who we are, ignoring environmental and other factors. Genetic reductionism is similar, suggesting that genes are the primary or only important factor in development. So, Pence might be objecting that the argument against SCNT being best for the child is based on an overemphasis on genetics, which isn't entirely accurate.\n\nOption B states that the expectations people will place on SCNT individuals could be no worse than normal expectations of children created sexually. This suggests that the concerns about how society might treat cloned children aren't necessarily worse than how they treat naturally conceived children. Maybe Pence is arguing that the expectations aren't as bad as some people think.\n\nOption C says that people's prejudicial attitudes are likely to change. This implies that any prejudice against cloned children might diminish over time as society becomes more accepting. Perhaps Pence believes that societal attitudes will evolve, making the initial concerns less relevant.\n\nOption D proposes that if people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT. This seems like a condition or a conclusion based on the persistence of prejudice. If prejudice remains, then SCNT should be prohibited to protect the welfare of the child.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these isn't an objection that Pence gives. An objection would be a reason why the argument against SCNT being best for the child is flawed or insufficient.\n\nOption A is presenting an objection by questioning the assumption of genetic determinism in the argument. So, that seems like an objection.\n\nOption B is suggesting that the expectations placed on SCNT individuals might not be worse than those on naturally conceived children, which could be seen as countering the argument that SCNT is\u4e0d\u597d for the child due to societal expectations. So, that's also an objection.\n\nOption C is optimistic about changing attitudes, suggesting that any prejudice issue might resolve itself over time. That's another way of undermining the argument against SCNT.\n\nOption D, however, is conditional. It says that if prejudice doesn't change, then SCNT shouldn't be allowed. This seems more like a conclusion based on the persistence of prejudice rather than an objection to the argument itself. In other words, it's not challenging the argument's assumptions or validity; instead, it's accepting the argument and proposing a course of action based on it.\n\nSo, compared to options A, B, and C, which seem to be objections to the argument, option D appears to be a conclusion drawn from accepting the argument. Therefore, it might not be an objection that Pence gives.\n\nTo double-check, let's see:\n\n- A: Objection based on assumption of genetic determinism.\n\n- B: Objection based on comparison of expectations.\n\n- C: Objection based on potential change in attitudes.\n\n- D: Conclusion about action based on persistent prejudice.\n\nYes, D seems different in nature. It's not questioning the argument but accepting it and suggesting a prohibition under certain conditions.\n\nHence, the answer is likely D. If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
