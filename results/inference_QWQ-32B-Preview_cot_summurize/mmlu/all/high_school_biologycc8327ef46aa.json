                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out the difference between meiosis and mitosis. I remember that both are types of cell division, but they have some key differences, especially in terms of the number of divisions and what happens to the chromosomes.\n\nOption A says that in meiosis, there is one round of cell division, whereas in mitosis, there are two rounds. Wait, actually, I think it's the other way around. Meiosis involves two rounds of cell division, right? That's how it produces four daughter cells, each with half the chromosomes of the parent cell. Mitosis, on the other hand, has just one round of division, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B talks about the separation of sister chromatids. In meiosis, the first division is the reduction division where homologous chromosomes separate, and the second division is similar to mitosis where sister chromatids separate. In mitosis, the separation of sister chromatids happens in the first division, during anaphase. So, option B seems correct because in meiosis, separation of sister chromatids occurs during the second division, not the first.\n\nOption C mentions that chromosomes are replicated during interphase in meiosis, whereas in mitosis, they are replicated during prophase. But I think in both meiosis and mitosis, chromosomes are replicated during interphase, before the cell enters mitosis or meiosis. So, this option doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D says that spindle fibers form during prophase in meiosis, whereas in mitosis, they form during metaphase. Actually, in both meiosis and mitosis, spindle fibers begin to form during prophase. In mitosis, spindle fibers help to align the chromosomes during metaphase and then separate them during anaphase. So, this option is also incorrect.\n\nBased on this, option B seems to be the correct answer. In meiosis, separation of sister chromatids occurs during the second division, whereas in mitosis, it occurs during the first division.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
