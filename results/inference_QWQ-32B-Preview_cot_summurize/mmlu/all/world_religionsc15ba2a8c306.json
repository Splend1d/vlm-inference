Stillness of Love\n\nI know that \"Dalai Lama\" is a title given to spiritual leaders in Tibetan Buddhism, but I'm not sure about the exact meaning of the words.\n\nI think \"Dalai\" and \"Lama\" are Tibetan words, so maybe I should look into what those words mean in Tibetan.\n\nI recall that \"Lama\" refers to a teacher or a spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism. So, that makes sense.\n\nNow, \"Dalai\" is the part I'm less sure about. I've heard that it's related to the ocean, but I don't remember the exact connection.\n\nLet me consider option A: \"Ocean of Love.\" That sounds nice, but I'm not sure if \"Dalai\" specifically means \"ocean of love.\"\n\nOption B is \"Lover of Wisdom.\" I don't think \"Dalai\" has anything to do with wisdom in this context.\n\nOption C is \"Ocean of Wisdom.\" Hmm, this seems plausible. Maybe \"Dalai\" means \"ocean\" and it's combined with \"wisdom.\"\n\nOption D is \"Stillness of Love.\" Again, I don't recall \"Dalai\" meaning \"stillness.\"\n\nLet me see if I can recall any information about the Dalai Lama's title. I think it was given to him by a Mongol ruler, and it's a combination of Tibetan words.\n\nI believe \"Dalai\" does mean \"ocean,\" and \"Lama\" means \"teacher\" or \"highest spiritual being.\"\n\nSo, putting them together, \"Dalai Lama\" would mean \"ocean of wisdom,\" as wisdom is associated with the depth and vastness of the ocean.\n\nAlternatively, it could be \"ocean of compassion,\" but that might be different.\n\nWait, in Tibetan Buddhism, wisdom is highly valued, and the ocean is often used as a metaphor for its depth and breadth.\n\nSo, \"Ocean of Wisdom\" seems like a fitting title for a spiritual leader.\n\nLet me check option A again: \"Ocean of Love.\" While love and compassion are important in Buddhism, especially in Tibetan Buddhism, the primary emphasis in the title might be on wisdom.\n\nOption C is \"Ocean of Wisdom,\" which aligns with my current understanding.\n\nMaybe I should look up the etymology of \"Dalai Lama\" to confirm.\n\nI know that \"Dalai\" comes from the Mongolian word for \"ocean,\" and \"Lama\" is from Tibetan, meaning \"teacher.\"\n\nSo, combining them, it would indeed mean \"ocean of wisdom,\" as wisdom is compared to the vastness of the ocean.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Ocean of Wisdom.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nI've heard that the title was given to describe the depth and vastness of the Dalai Lama's wisdom.\n\nSo, it makes sense that it would be \"ocean of wisdom\" rather than \"ocean of love.\"\n\nAlthough love and compassion are central to Buddhism, the title seems to emphasize wisdom.\n\nHence, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
