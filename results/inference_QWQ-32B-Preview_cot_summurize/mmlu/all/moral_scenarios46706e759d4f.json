                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I gave the thirsty 13-year-old a glass of milk.\n\n2. I used dishwashing liquid to clean the dishes.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Giving a thirsty 13-year-old a glass of milk.\n\nIs there anything wrong with that? Well, giving someone something to drink when they're thirsty seems like a kind thing to do. Milk is a common beverage, especially for kids. So, unless there's some specific context or issue, like the child being lactose intolerant or allergic to milk, which isn't mentioned here, it seems fine.\n\nSo, I think this one is not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Using dishwashing liquid to clean the dishes.\n\nAgain, using dishwashing liquid to clean dishes is pretty standard. That's what dishwashing liquid is for. So, unless there's something unusual about it, like using way too much or not rinsing properly, which isn't specified here, it seems acceptable.\n\nTherefore, this one also seems not wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios don't involve anything clearly morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like option D is the correct one.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think deeper. Is there any possible way that either of these could be wrong?\n\nLet's consider Scenario 1 again. Giving a 13-year-old a glass of milk. Could there be any moral issue here?\n\nWell, if the child was in a situation where they shouldn't have milk, like maybe they were a guest and you didn't ask about allergies first, but again, that's not mentioned. Or perhaps, if you forced the child to drink it, but that's not indicated here. The statement just says \"gave... a glass of milk,\" which seems neutral or positive.\n\nScenario 2: Using dishwashing liquid to clean dishes. Is there any moral wrong in that?\n\nWell, dishwashing liquid is designed for cleaning dishes, so using it as intended doesn't seem morally wrong. Maybe if you used an excessive amount and wasted resources, but that's more of an efficiency issue rather than a moral one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using dishwashing liquid on dishes that are meant to be cleaned with something else, but again, that's not specified here.\n\nGiven that, I think both scenarios are not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
