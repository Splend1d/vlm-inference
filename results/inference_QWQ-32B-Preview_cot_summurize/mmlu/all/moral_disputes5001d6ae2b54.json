                    "text": "Let's see what Nathanson's form of retributivism entails, according to this question. Retributivism is a theory of punishment that focuses on giving offenders what they deserve based on their wrongdoing. So, it's all about proportionate revenge or just deserts.\n\nThe question says Nathanson proposes a form of retributivism that requires all of the following except one option. We have to find out which one isn't required according to his proposal.\n\nOption A is \"a list of crimes ranked according to their seriousness.\" That sounds like a necessary part of retributivism because to mete out just punishment, you need to know the relative severity of different crimes. So, ranking crimes makes sense.\n\nOption B is \"a scale of punishments that correspond to the seriousness of certain crimes.\" Again, this seems essential for retributivism. The punishment should fit the crime, meaning more serious crimes should have more severe punishments. So, this also appears to be required.\n\nOption C is \"treating criminals humanely.\" Hmm, this is interesting. Retributivism is sometimes criticized for potentially leading to harsh or inhumane treatments, but if Nathanson includes humane treatment as part of his proposal, that would suggest a more tempered approach. So, perhaps this is required in his version.\n\nOption D is \"the death penalty for the most serious crimes.\" Now, this is where things might get tricky. While some retributivists might argue for the death penalty for the most heinous crimes, others might argue against it for various reasons, such as the possibility of error or moral objections to taking life.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and C seem like foundational elements of a retributivist framework, and option D is more specific and potentially controversial, I'm leaning towards D as the exception.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe Nathanson's retributivism requires a strict proportionality that includes the death penalty for the most serious crimes. In that case, D would be required, and perhaps one of the other options isn't.\n\nWait, the question says \"requires all of the following except one.\" So, I need to find the one that is not required.\n\nLet's consider the implications of each option.\n\nIf Nathanson's retributivism requires a list of crimes ranked by seriousness and a corresponding scale of punishments, that makes sense for proportionality.\n\nIncluding humane treatment (option C) might be a way to distinguish his version from more punitive forms of retributivism.\n\nBut regarding the death penalty, it's possible that Nathanson's retributivism either requires it for the most serious crimes or rejects it altogether.\n\nIf he rejects it, then option D would be the exception.\n\nAlternatively, if he includes it, then perhaps one of the other options isn't required.\n\nWait, but the question implies that all options except one are required. So, if Nathanson includes the death penalty, then D would be required, and one of the other options isn't.\n\nAlternatively, if he doesn't include the death penalty, then D is the exception.\n\nGiven that options A and B seem indispensable for any retributivist theory, and option C is perhaps more nuanced, maybe the answer is that humane treatment isn't required in Nathanson's retributivism.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because treating criminals humanely is often considered a basic principle in modern penal systems.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Nathanson's retributivism doesn't require a formal list of crimes ranked by seriousness, but instead uses a more flexible approach.\n\nHowever, having a structured list and scale seems like it would be important for consistency and fairness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's option B that isn't required, suggesting that punishments don't strictly correspond to the seriousness of crimes.\n\nBut that again seems contrary to the core principle of retributivism, which is about proportionality.\n\nWait, perhaps Nathanson's retributivism doesn't require a precise scale of punishments, but allows for some discretion or considers other factors.\n\nBut that still seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exception is that humane treatment isn't required, meaning that in some cases, criminals wouldn't be treated humanely.\n\nBut that seems unethical and unlikely for a contemporary philosopher.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is option D: the death penalty for the most serious crimes.\n\nMaybe Nathanson's retributivism doesn't endorse the death penalty, even for the most serious crimes, thus making D the exception.\n\nThis could be for various reasons, such as believing that life imprisonment is sufficient, or having moral qualms about capital punishment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Nathanson's retributivism requires the death penalty, making D a required element, and thus one of the other options is not required.\n\nBut earlier, option C seemed the most plausible as the exception.\n\nWait, perhaps Nathanson's retributivism doesn't require treating criminals humanely, focusing solely on desert without concerning itself with their treatment.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with contemporary ethical standards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option A isn't required, meaning that crimes don't need to be ranked in terms of seriousness.\n\nBut again, that seems fundamental to retributivism.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the scale of punishments doesn't strictly correspond to the seriousness of crimes, allowing for other factors to influence punishment.\n\nBut that would deviate from the core principle of proportionality.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the most plausible answer is that Nathanson's retributivism doesn't require the death penalty for the most serious crimes, making D the exception.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
