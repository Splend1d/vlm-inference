                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a pipe that's open at both ends, and it resonates at 440 hertz at 20 degrees Celsius. Then, on a colder day, the speed of sound is 3% lower than it is at 20 degrees, and I need to find out what frequency the pipe resonates at on that cold day. The options are A) 414 Hz, B) 427 Hz, C) 433 Hz, and D) 440 Hz.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the resonant frequency of an open pipe relates to the speed of sound and the length of the pipe. For an open pipe, the fundamental frequency is given by f = v / (2L), where f is the frequency, v is the speed of sound, and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nSo, at 20 degrees Celsius, the pipe resonates at 440 Hz. That means:\n\n440 Hz = v_20 / (2L)\n\nWhere v_20 is the speed of sound at 20 degrees Celsius.\n\nNow, on the colder day, the speed of sound is 3% lower than at 20 degrees. So, v_cold = v_20 - 0.03 * v_20 = 0.97 * v_20\n\nI need to find the resonant frequency on that cold day, which I'll call f_cold. Using the same formula for the resonant frequency:\n\nf_cold = v_cold / (2L)\n\nBut I know that v_cold = 0.97 * v_20, so:\n\nf_cold = (0.97 * v_20) / (2L)\n\nBut from the first equation, v_20 / (2L) = 440 Hz, so:\n\nf_cold = 0.97 * 440 Hz\n\nNow, calculating that:\n\n0.97 * 440 = 426.8 Hz\n\nWhich is approximately 427 Hz.\n\nLooking back at the options, B) 427 Hz is one of them.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there a reason why the frequency would stay the same, which is option D) 440 Hz? Well, the pipe's length hasn't changed, but the speed of sound has changed, so the frequency should change accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem, like considering the wavelength or something.\n\nLet me think about the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and speed of sound. We know that v = f * \u03bb, where \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nFor an open pipe, the fundamental wavelength is twice the length of the pipe, so \u03bb = 2L.\n\nTherefore, v = f * 2L, which is the same as f = v / (2L), which is what I used earlier.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of percentage change. If the speed of sound decreases by 3%, then the frequency should also decrease by 3%, assuming the length of the pipe remains the same.\n\nSince 3% of 440 Hz is 0.03 * 440 = 13.2 Hz, subtracting that from 440 Hz gives 426.8 Hz, which again is approximately 427 Hz.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B) 427 Hz.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nFor example, does the temperature affect the pipe's length? Probably not significantly within the range of temperatures given, so I can safely assume the length remains constant.\n\nAlso, is there a possibility that higher harmonics are involved? The problem specifies resonance at the fundamental frequency, so I'm assuming it's the fundamental mode.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a higher harmonic, the relationship might be different, but since it's an open pipe and it's resonating at 440 Hz at 20 degrees, I'll assume it's the fundamental frequency.\n\nTherefore, I think B) 427 Hz is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{427 \\text{ Hz}} \\]"
