Where the state employs the use of force or violence, this can be regarded as an extraordinary measure.\n\nB. Those measures taken as a response to a securitized existential threat can be defined as extraordinary.\n\nC. Those measures that exist outside the usual paradigm of the political realm.\n\nD. All of these options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"extraordinary measures\" mean in this context. Generally, \"extraordinary\" suggests something that is beyond the normal or regular practices. So, in the realm of politics and state actions, extraordinary measures would be those that deviate from standard procedures or are exceptional in some way.\n\nOption A suggests that the use of force or violence by the state qualifies as an extraordinary measure. While it's true that the state's use of force can be exceptional, especially in peaceful times, it's not always the case. For example, law enforcement uses force in various situations, which might be routine in their operations. Therefore, simply using force doesn't necessarily make a measure extraordinary; it depends on the context and the extent of its use.\n\nOption B proposes that measures taken in response to a securitized existential threat are extraordinary. Securitization theory, developed by Barry Buzan and Ole W\u00e6ver, suggests that certain issues are constructed as security threats, justifying extraordinary measures. An existential threat implies a danger to the very survival of the state or society. In such cases, governments might implement emergency laws, suspend civil liberties, or take other exceptional actions. This seems like a valid definition of extraordinary measures.\n\nOption C states that measures existing outside the usual paradigm of the political realm are extraordinary. This is quite broad. The \"usual paradigm\" could refer to established political norms, legal frameworks, or standard policies. Measures that depart from these norms, perhaps in response to unusual circumstances, could indeed be considered extraordinary. This aligns with the general understanding of the term.\n\nOption D says \"all of these options,\" meaning that all the previous definitions are valid. Given the analysis above, while option A is somewhat limited, options B and C seem accurate. However, since option A might not always hold true, perhaps option D isn't entirely correct.\n\nConsidering this, I think the best answer is D. All of these options can define extraordinary measures in different contexts. The use of force, response to existential threats, and actions outside normal political paradigms can all be considered extraordinary, depending on the situation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
