                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the best way for the defendant to seek relief from the judgment after discovering this new videotape showing the plaintiff jogging with her doctor, which seems to contradict the earlier claim of permanent paralysis. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A suggests moving for a new trial or, alternatively, for remittitur to reduce the award, considering the shortened duration of the plaintiff's injuries. Remittitur is a process where the court can ask the plaintiff to accept a lower amount, and if they don't, the court can order a new trial. This might be applicable if the damages awarded were based on the assumption that the injuries were permanent, but now there's evidence suggesting they're not.\n\nOption B is about moving for relief from the judgment because the judgment was based on the jury's mistaken belief that the plaintiff's injuries would be permanent. This seems similar to Option A but is more directly aimed at the jury's misunderstanding.\n\nOption C proposes moving for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff committed fraud in obtaining damages for permanent injuries. This is a serious allegation, suggesting that the plaintiff knowingly misrepresented her condition to gain a larger award.\n\nOption D is about moving for relief from the judgment on the ground of newly discovered evidence that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent. This seems straightforward; the defendant has new evidence that wasn't available at the time of trial.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between these options, especially between B and D. Both involve the idea that there's new information indicating the injuries aren't permanent, but B frames it as the judgment being based on a mistaken belief, while D is about newly discovered evidence.\n\nOption C brings in the element of fraud, which is a more aggressive stance, implying that the plaintiff deliberately lied about her condition. This could have broader implications, including potential sanctions beyond just modifying the judgment.\n\nOption A seems like a more measured approach, focusing on the damages awarded in light of new information about the injury's permanence.\n\nGiven that the videotape was made two months after the judgment, it's considered newly discovered evidence because it wasn't available or couldn't have been discovered with reasonable diligence before the trial.\n\nIn federal court, Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows for relief from a final judgment based on several grounds, including fraud (Rule 60(b)(3)) and newly discovered evidence (Rule 60(b)(2)).\n\nOption C aligns with Rule 60(b)(3), which provides relief from a judgment obtained by fraud. However, to succeed on this ground, the defendant would need to prove that the plaintiff intentionally deceived the court or the jury regarding the permanence of her injuries.\n\nOption D aligns with Rule 60(b)(2), which allows for relief based on newly discovered evidence that could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence before the trial.\n\nComparing Options C and D, Option D seems more appropriate because it directly addresses the newly discovered videotape without making an accusation of fraud. The defendant might not have sufficient evidence to prove that the plaintiff intentionally misrepresented her condition; perhaps her recovery was unexpected or occurred after the trial.\n\nOption B is similar to Option D but frames the issue as the judgment being based on a mistaken belief. This could be seen as a request for relief due to mistake, which is covered under Rule 60(b)(1).\n\nHowever, Rule 60(b)(1) is generally reserved for mistakes of law or fact that are fundamental to the case, not for newly discovered evidence.\n\nTherefore, Option D seems to be the most straightforward and appropriate path: moving for relief from the judgment based on newly discovered evidence that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent.\n\nOption A, regarding a new trial or remittitur, might be considered, but it seems more suited if the defendant wanted to challenge the amount of damages rather than the basis of the judgment itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way for the defendant to seek relief from the judgment is to move for relief from the judgment on the ground that there is newly discovered evidence that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent (Option D).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
