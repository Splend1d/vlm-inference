                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which option is correct here. So, there's a state labor code that says employers can't knowingly hire aliens who aren't legally residing in the U.S., and this employment would have an adverse effect on lawful residents' right to work. Some immigrant farm workers are suing because they're being refused jobs while aliens are being hired instead.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the statute is trying to do. It seems like it's trying to protect jobs for lawful residents by preventing employers from hiring undocumented aliens. But the immigrant farm workers are being refused employment, and they're suing under this statute.\n\nOption A says the court would declare the statute unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The equal protection clause basically says that the state can't deny any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws. So, if this statute is treating certain groups differently in a way that's not allowed, it could be unconstitutional.\n\nOption B says the court would declare the statute constitutional as within the realm of rights reserved to the states by the Eleventh Amendment. The Eleventh Amendment deals with sovereign immunity, meaning states can't be sued in federal court without their consent. But I'm not sure how that directly relates to this statute.\n\nOption C says the court would declare the statute unconstitutional since the regulation of immigration is preempted. Preemption means that federal law takes precedence over state law in certain areas. Immigration is a federal matter, so maybe states can't make their own laws about hiring aliens.\n\nOption D says the court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens. This suggests that states do have some power to regulate the employment of illegal aliens.\n\nHmm. I think the key here is understanding the balance between state and federal power regarding immigration. Immigration is largely a federal issue, but states have some role in enforcing immigration laws. The Supreme Court has addressed this in a few cases.\n\nIn 1976, the Supreme Court decided in De Canas v. Bica that states have the power to regulate the employment of illegal aliens, even though immigration is a federal matter. The Court held that states can impose sanctions on employers who hire undocumented workers, as long as it doesn't conflict with federal law.\n\nThen, in 1982, the Court decided in Plyler v. Doe that states can't deny education to children based on their immigration status, because it violates the equal protection clause. But that's about education, not employment.\n\nMore recently, in 2012, the Court decided in Arizona v. United States that most of Arizona's immigration law was preempted by federal law, but it did allow one provision standing: the requirement that police check the immigration status of people they stop or arrest.\n\nGiven that background, I think Option C is the most likely correct answer. The regulation of immigration is a federal matter, and states can't make their own laws that conflict with federal immigration laws. So, if the state statute is trying to regulate who can be employed based on immigration status, it might be preempted by federal law.\n\nOption A seems possible too, but I'm not sure about the equal protection clause in this context. The statute is aimed at protecting jobs for lawful residents, which might be a legitimate state interest. So, it might not violate equal protection.\n\nOption B doesn't seem directly relevant because the Eleventh Amendment is about sovereign immunity, not about the substance of the statute.\n\nOption D suggests that states aren't preempted in economic regulation of illegal aliens, but based on the Arizona case, it seems like some state regulations in this area can be preempted.\n\nSo, I think Option C is the most likely correct answer. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional because the regulation of immigration is preempted by federal law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
