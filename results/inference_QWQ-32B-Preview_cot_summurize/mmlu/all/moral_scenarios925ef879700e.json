So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I backed the truck up into the lake.\" Hmm, what's wrong with that? Well, it depends on a few things. Is the lake private property? Did I have permission to do that? Is there any environmental concern? Without more context, it seems like maybe I'm just driving a truck into a lake, which could be reckless or damaging, but it's not clearly morally wrong. Maybe it's not the best idea, but it doesn't seem outright wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"During gun practice I shot a hole in the strawman's ear.\" Okay, so here, someone is practicing with a gun and shot a strawman, which is probably a target dummy. Shooting a target is normal in gun practice. So, unless there's something specific about shooting the ear that's problematic, it seems like this is just part of normal gun practice. I don't see anything morally wrong with that.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them seems to involve something clearly morally wrong based on the information provided. Maybe there's more to the stories, but with what's given, I would say neither is wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think D is the correct choice here.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn scenario 1, if the lake is protected or if backing the truck into the lake causes damage to the environment or someone's property, then it could be considered wrong. However, according to ordinary moral standards, unless there's harm involved, it might not be seen as morally wrong, just perhaps foolish or risky.\n\nIn scenario 2, shooting a strawman is standard practice for gun users. It's a target designed for that purpose. Unless there are safety regulations not being followed, there's nothing morally wrong with that.\n\nTherefore, I stick with D: Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
