                    "text": "I'm facing a tricky situation here. I've been subpoenaed to give a deposition about a former client, and during the deposition, the attorney for the other side is asking for confidential client information. Now, I need to decide how to handle this request. Let's look at the options I have:\n\nOption A says I should refuse to provide the information without a court order. Hmm, I know that client-attorney privilege is important, and generally, I shouldn't disclose confidential information without proper authorization. But I'm already at a deposition, and a subpoena is a court order itself, right? So, maybe this option isn't the best.\n\nOption B suggests asserting the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver. That sounds promising. Client-attorney privilege is a key principle in law, and it's there to protect the confidentiality between a lawyer and their client. If the client hasn't waived this privilege, then I should assert it to protect the client's information. But I need to make sure about the status of the waiver.\n\nOption C says I should provide the information if I believe it's pertinent to the case. Well, as a lawyer, I understand the importance of relevant information in a case. However, protecting client confidentiality is also crucial. If I start deciding on my own what's pertinent and what's not, I might be overstepping my bounds and compromising the client's privacy.\n\nOption D states that I should provide the information since privilege is waived in this situation. Wait a minute, is privilege automatically waived just because I've been subpoenaed? I don't think so. Privilege can be waived, but it usually requires the client's consent or certain legal circumstances.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. First, client-attorney privilege is designed to protect communications between a client and their attorney. This privilege generally survives even after the attorney-client relationship ends, unless the client waives the privilege.\n\nBeing subpoenaed to give a deposition means that I'm required to appear and testify under oath. However, just because I'm required to appear doesn't mean that I have to disclose privileged information without the client's consent.\n\nIf the client has not waived the privilege, then I should assert the privilege to protect the confidential information. It's important to remember that as an attorney, I have a duty to protect my client's confidential information, even after the representation has ended.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the most appropriate. I should assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver. This way, I'm upholding my duty to protect the client's confidentiality.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider the other options again. Option A suggests refusing to provide information without a court order. Well, I am already at a deposition pursuant to a subpoena, which is a court order. So, perhaps this option isn't as strong as asserting the privilege based on client-attorney confidentiality.\n\nOption C involves using my own judgment about what's pertinent to the case. While relevance is important, I don't want to unilaterally decide to disclose confidential information. That could potentially breach my duty to the client.\n\nOption D assumes that privilege is waived in this situation, but I don't see any basis for that assumption. Privilege isn't automatically waived just because I've been subpoenaed.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the best course of action is to assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver. This approach respects the client's confidentiality and adheres to my professional duties.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
