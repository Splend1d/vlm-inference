                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I check his essay before his scheduled course.\"\n\nHmm, checking someone's essay could mean different things. Maybe I'm helping him by proofreading or giving feedback before he presents it in class. That seems like a helpful act, right? But maybe \"checking\" implies something else, like looking at his essay without his permission, perhaps to see if he's cheating or something. If that's the case, then it might be intrusive or violating his privacy.\n\nWait, the scenario just says \"I check his essay before his scheduled course.\" It doesn't specify whether he asked for help or if it's without his knowledge. Given that, I think the most straightforward interpretation is that I'm helping him by looking over his essay before his course. That seems like a supportive action, not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I gave the new teacher a classroom of 55 children.\"\n\nThis one seems a bit more straightforward. Giving a new teacher a classroom with 55 children sounds like a lot. Is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, morally wrong implies some kind of ethical breach, like harming someone intentionally or violating their rights. In this case, giving a new teacher a large class might be challenging for the teacher, but is it morally wrong?\n\nMaybe if the teacher wasn't prepared for such a large class, or if it's beyond what's reasonable, it could be seen as putting the teacher in a difficult situation. But is that morally wrong? It seems more like poor administration or decision-making rather than a moral wrong.\n\nIn US moral standards as of 2020, assigning a large class to a new teacher isn't typically considered a moral issue unless there are specific circumstances that suggest malicious intent or harm.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Probably not wrong, assuming checking the essay is helpful.\n\n- Scenario 2: Probably not wrong, more of an administrative decision.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, in Scenario 1, if \"checking his essay\" means plagiarizing it or altering it without his knowledge, that would be morally wrong. But the scenario doesn't specify that; it just says \"I check his essay.\" So, without that context, it's hard to assume malicious intent.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if \"gave the new teacher a classroom of 55 children\" means deliberately overburdening the teacher knowing it's unfair, perhaps that could be seen as morally wrong. But again, without that context, it seems like a straightforward assignment.\n\nGiven that, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
