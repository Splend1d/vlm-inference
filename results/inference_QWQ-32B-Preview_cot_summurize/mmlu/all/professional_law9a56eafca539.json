                    "text": "I've got this question here about a contractor and a homeowner who agreed on remodeling a garage. The contract was written, one page, for $5,000, but it didn't specify when the work would be done. Before signing, the homeowner pointed that out, and they orally agreed on 60 days, but didn't write it in the contract. Now, the contractor didn't finish in 60 days, and the homeowner is suing for breach of contract. The question is whether the court is likely to admit evidence about their oral agreement on the 60-day timeframe.\n\nLet's see. The options are:\n\nA. No, because the court must ascertain the meaning of the agreement from the terms of the written contract.\n\nB. No, because the oral agreement was merely part of the parties' negotiations.\n\nC. Yes, because the contract is ambiguous.\n\nD. Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a merger clause is. I think it's a clause that says the written contract is the final agreement between the parties and overrides any previous agreements or understandings. But in this case, the contract didn't have a merger clause, which might mean that other agreements could still be considered.\n\nNow, the contract was written and signed, but it didn't include the time of completion. The homeowner brought this up, and they orally agreed on 60 days, but didn't include it in the written contract. So, is this oral agreement something that can be considered by the court?\n\nOption A says no, because the court must look only at the written contract. But I think that might not always be the case, especially since there's no merger clause here.\n\nOption B says no, because the oral agreement was part of negotiations. Maybe, but they did orally agree on it, and it seems like it was a separate agreement.\n\nOption C says yes, because the contract is ambiguous. Well, the written contract doesn't specify the time, but does that make it ambiguous? Ambiguous usually means unclear or open to multiple interpretations. Here, it's just silent on the time.\n\nOption D says yes, because the time limit is an additional term that doesn't contradict the written contract. That seems plausible. The written contract doesn't say anything about time, so adding a time limit doesn't contradict what's already written.\n\nLet me think about this some more. Since there was no merger clause, it might be possible to include additional terms that weren't written in the contract. And they did orally agree on the time before signing.\n\nAlso, in contract law, sometimes parol evidence is allowed to interpret the written contract, especially if there's ambiguity or if there are additional terms that don't contradict the written agreement.\n\nIn this case, the oral agreement about the time doesn't contradict the written contract; it just adds to it. So, perhaps the court would allow evidence of that oral agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, if the written contract was intended to be the complete agreement, then maybe the court wouldn't allow it. But since there's no merger clause, it's possible that additional terms could be included.\n\nI think option D makes the most sense here: yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n(assuming there's no one to respond, continuing the thought process)\n\nOkay, maybe I should look up some case law or contract law principles to confirm this.\n\nIn contract law, the parol evidence rule generally prevents the introduction of evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral or written statements that contradict the written contract. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the written contract is incomplete or when there is an integrated agreement.\n\nAn integrated agreement is one where the parties intend the written contract to be the complete and final expression of their agreement. If there's a merger clause, it's clear that the written contract is the entire agreement. But here, there's no merger clause, so it might not be a fully integrated agreement.\n\nIn the absence of a merger clause, the contract might be considered a partial integration, meaning that there could be additional terms that are not included in the written contract.\n\nIn such cases, evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements can be admitted to add to or modify the written contract, as long as they don't contradict it.\n\nIn this scenario, the oral agreement about the 60-day completion period is an additional term that doesn't contradict the written contract. Therefore, it seems plausible that evidence of this oral agreement could be admitted.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider option C: yes, because the contract is ambiguous. Is the contract ambiguous? Well, it doesn't specify the time of completion, but that might not make it ambiguous. Ambiguity usually refers to language that is unclear or subject to multiple interpretations. Here, the contract simply doesn't address the time frame. So, I don't think ambiguity is the right reason.\n\nOption A says no, because the court must ascertain meaning from the written contract. While it's true that courts generally look to the written contract to determine the terms of the agreement, in cases where the contract is not fully integrated, additional evidence may be considered.\n\nOption B says no, because the oral agreement was part of negotiations. But in this case, it sounds like the oral agreement was reached just before signing and was intended to be part of the agreement, not just negotiation.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate.\n\nTo sum up, since there's no merger clause and the written contract doesn't address the time of completion, evidence of the oral agreement on the 60-day completion period can be admitted as an additional term that doesn't contradict the written contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract."
