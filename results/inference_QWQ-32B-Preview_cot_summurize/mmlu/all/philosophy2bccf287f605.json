                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Nussbaum and her views on ethical approaches based on virtues. The question says that according to Nussbaum, many current ethical theorists see a connection between focusing on virtues and turning towards one of these options: rationalism, empiricism, relativism, or absolutism. I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Nussbaum's perspective is on this. I remember that Nussbaum is a contemporary philosopher who has written a lot about capabilities and social justice, but I'm not sure about her specific views on virtue ethics in relation to these philosophical positions.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A is rationalism. Rationalism is the idea that knowledge comes primarily from reason and logical deduction, rather than from experience or sensory data. Virtue ethics, on the other hand, focuses on the character and virtues of the moral agent. I'm not sure if there's a direct connection between virtue ethics and rationalism. Maybe some virtue ethicists use reason to determine what virtues are, but I don't think that's the main connection here.\n\nOption B is empiricism. Empiricism holds that knowledge comes from sensory experience. Again, virtue ethics is about character and virtues, but I don't immediately see a strong link to empiricism. Maybe some virtue ethicists look to observe virtuous behavior in practice, but that doesn't necessarily make it empiricist.\n\nOption C is relativism. Relativism is the view that moral truths are not absolute but are relative to cultural, individual, or situational perspectives. Virtue ethics can sometimes be associated with relativism because different cultures may value different virtues. However, many virtue ethicists, like Aristotle, argue for universal virtues that are applicable across different contexts.\n\nOption D is absolutism. Absolutism in ethics typically refers to the idea that there are objective, universal moral standards that apply to all people, regardless of context. Virtue ethics could align with absolutism if it posits that certain virtues are universally valuable.\n\nConsidering these options, I need to think about which one Nussbaum might say many current ethical theorists associate with virtue ethics.\n\nI recall that Nussbaum is critical of certain aspects of virtue ethics, particularly when it's used in a way that doesn't account for individual capabilities and social justice. She might be discussing how some theorists see virtue ethics as aligned with absolutism, suggesting there are universal virtues that should be upheld regardless of the situation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she sees a connection between virtue ethics and relativism, given that virtues can vary across cultures.\n\nWait, the question is about turning to an ethical approach based on virtues being connected with a turn towards one of these positions. I need to consider which position is most associated with a shift towards virtue ethics.\n\nLet me consider the contrast. If ethical theorists are moving away from, say, deontological or consequentialist approaches and towards virtue ethics, what philosophical stance might accompany that shift?\n\nDeontological ethics is often associated with rationalism, as it relies on universal moral laws derived through reason. Consequentialism can be associated with empiricism, as it often looks at outcomes and experiences.\n\nIf theorists are moving away from these towards virtue ethics, perhaps they are moving away from rationalism or empiricism. But that doesn't directly tell me which one virtue ethics is connected with.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift to virtue ethics is seen as a move towards relativism, as virtue ethics might allow for more contextual and culturally specific moral judgments.\n\nOn the other hand, some virtue ethicists argue for universal virtues, which would align more with absolutism.\n\nI think I need to consider Nussbaum's own views. Nussbaum is known for her capabilities approach, which emphasizes individual capabilities and functionings as central to ethics and social justice. She might see virtue ethics as compatible with a form of absolutism, in the sense that there are universal virtues that should be cultivated in all individuals.\n\nHowever, she might also be critical of virtue ethics if it's used to justify cultural practices that limit capabilities.\n\nGiven that, perhaps she sees the connection between virtue ethics and relativism, as some virtue ethicists might argue that virtues are culturally dependent.\n\nBut the question is about what Nussbaum claims many current ethical theorists think, not necessarily what she thinks herself.\n\nLet me try to recall the specific text or context where Nussbaum discusses this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she is discussing how virtue ethics is often associated with relativism because it seems to allow for diverse moral perspectives based on different virtues valued in different cultures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she sees a connection between virtue ethics and absolutism, as virtue ethicists like Aristotle argued for universal virtues that are essential for human flourishing.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is relativism, option C.\n\nI think that makes sense because virtue ethics can be seen as allowing for a variety of moral perspectives based on different cultural or individual virtues.\n\nMany ethical theorists might see this as a turn towards relativism, where there are no universal moral standards, only relative virtues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's connected with empiricism, as virtue ethics might look to observe and learn from examples of virtuous behavior.\n\nBut relativism seems more plausible to me in this context.\n\nI think I'll go with option C, relativism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
