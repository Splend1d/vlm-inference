The options are supermarkets, convenience stores, category-killer stores, and limited line retailers. I need to choose the most appropriate one.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each type of shop offers:\n\n1. **Supermarkets**: These are large stores that offer a wide variety of food and household products. They usually have multiple aisles and a broad selection, but they might not be the most convenient for quick stops because they can be time-consuming to navigate.\n\n2. **Convenience stores**: These are smaller stores designed for impulse or last-minute shopping. They offer a limited selection of items that are in high demand and often needed immediately, such as snacks, drinks, and basic household supplies.\n\n3. **Category-killer stores**: These are large retail stores that focus on a specific product category, like electronics or sporting goods. They offer a deep selection within their category but aren't typically known for groceries or general household items.\n\n4. **Limited line retailers**: These stores carry a narrow line of products, often specializing in a particular type of item. For example, a bookstore or a flower shop. They don't generally carry a range of grocery and household items.\n\nGiven that the question is about shops that cater to last-minute purchase needs for groceries and household items, I think convenience stores are the most suitable option. They are designed for quick stops and have items that people might need urgently, without having to go to a larger store.\n\nSupermarkets, while they have a wide range of items, might not be as convenient for last-minute shopping because of their size and the time it can take to find and purchase items. Category-killer stores focus on specific categories and wouldn't have a broad range of grocery and household items. Limited line retailers are too specialized to offer a range of both groceries and household items.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is B. Convenience stores.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
