However, the Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) holds the record for the tallest known tree species. The current tallest known tree is a Coast Redwood named \"Hyperion,\" which stands at over 379 feet (115.5 meters) tall.\n\nThe Coast Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and the Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis) also grow to tremendous heights, often exceeding 300 feet (90 meters). The Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), while not the tallest, is renowned for its massive trunk diameter and overall volume, making it the largest tree in terms of wood volume.\n\nSo, if the question is specifically about the tallest trees, the answer would be A. Coast Redwood. However, it's important to note that all these species are remarkable in their own ways."
