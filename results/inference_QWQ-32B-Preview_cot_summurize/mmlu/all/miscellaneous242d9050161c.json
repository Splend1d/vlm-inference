                    "text": "I've got this sentence: \"Whenever the mood strikes her, Angela takes a short walk around the block.\" And there's an underlined part: \"_Whenever the mood strikes her_.\" I need to figure out what kind of clause that is. The options are:\n\nA. an adjective clause\n\nB. a relative clause\n\nC. a subordinate clause\n\nD. an independent clause\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these clauses is.\n\nAn adjective clause is a type of dependent clause that modifies a noun or a noun phrase. It usually starts with a relative pronoun like \"who,\" \"which,\" or \"that.\"\n\nA relative clause is similar to an adjective clause; it provides additional information about a noun and also starts with a relative pronoun.\n\nA subordinate clause is a clause that cannot stand alone as a complete sentence; it depends on the main clause to make sense.\n\nAn independent clause is a clause that can stand alone as a complete sentence.\n\nLooking at the underlined part: \"Whenever the mood strikes her.\" This seems to be providing a condition or a time when Angela takes a walk. It starts with \"whenever,\" which is a subordinating conjunction.\n\nSo, \"whenever the mood strikes her\" is expressing a condition or a time, and it can't stand alone as a complete sentence. If I try to say it by itself: \"Whenever the mood strikes her.\" It doesn't convey a complete thought; I need to know what happens then.\n\nTherefore, it's a subordinate clause because it depends on the main clause (\"Angela takes a short walk around the block\") to complete the meaning.\n\nNow, is it also a relative clause or an adjective clause? Well, relative clauses typically start with relative pronouns like \"who,\" \"which,\" \"that,\" etc., and they modify a noun in the main clause.\n\nIn this case, \"whenever\" is a subordinating conjunction, not a relative pronoun, so it's not a relative clause.\n\nSimilarly, an adjective clause modifies a noun, but here, \"whenever the mood strikes her\" is not modifying a noun; it's indicating the time or condition under which Angela takes a walk.\n\nSo, it's not an adjective clause or a relative clause. It's a subordinate clause.\n\nLet me double-check. The entire sentence is: \"Whenever the mood strikes her, Angela takes a short walk around the block.\"\n\nHere, \"whenever the mood strikes her\" is providing the condition or the time for the action in the main clause, which is \"Angela takes a short walk around the block.\"\n\nSince the underlined part can't stand alone and needs the main clause to make complete sense, it's indeed a subordinate clause.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. a subordinate clause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
