                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this problem about price elasticity of demand and how it affects total revenue for a small business. The question says that the business estimates the price elasticity of demand for their product to be 3. And they want to know what they should do to raise their total revenue based on that information.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what price elasticity of demand means. Price elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in its price. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nSo, if the price elasticity is 3, that means if the price changes by 1%, the quantity demanded changes by 3%. Since 3 is greater than 1, this indicates that demand is elastic. Elastic demand means that consumers are very sensitive to price changes. A small change in price leads to a proportionally larger change in quantity demanded.\n\nNow, the question is about total revenue. Total revenue is price multiplied by quantity sold (R = P x Q). The relationship between price elasticity and total revenue is important here.\n\nI recall that:\n\n- When demand is elastic (elasticity > 1), decreasing the price will increase total revenue.\n\n- When demand is inelastic (elasticity < 1), increasing the price will increase total revenue.\n\n- When demand is unit elastic (elasticity = 1), changing the price won't affect total revenue.\n\nIn this case, since the elasticity is 3, which is greater than 1, demand is elastic. Therefore, to increase total revenue, the business should decrease its price.\n\nLet me think about why that is. If you decrease the price and demand is elastic, the percentage increase in quantity demanded will be greater than the percentage decrease in price. So, even though you're selling each unit at a lower price, the increase in the number of units sold will more than offset the lower price, leading to higher total revenue.\n\nOn the other hand, if you increase the price, the quantity demanded would decrease by a larger percentage, leading to lower total revenue because the loss in quantity sold would outweigh the gain from the higher price.\n\nSo, given that the elasticity is 3, which is elastic, the correct action to raise total revenue is to decrease the price.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. decrease price as demand is elastic.\n\nB. decrease price as demand is inelastic.\n\nC. increase price as demand is elastic.\n\nD. increase price as demand is inelastic.\n\nOption A seems to be the correct one because it says to decrease the price because demand is elastic, which aligns with what I've just reasoning.\n\nOption B says to decrease price but claims that demand is inelastic, which contradicts the given elasticity of 3.\n\nOption C suggests increasing the price when demand is elastic, which would actually decrease total revenue, not increase it.\n\nOption D says to increase price because demand is inelastic, but again, the given elasticity is 3, which is elastic, not inelastic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Decrease price as demand is elastic.\n\nI think that makes sense. Just to double-check, I'll consider a simple numerical example.\n\nSuppose the current price is $10, and the quantity sold is 100 units. So, total revenue is $1,000.\n\nIf they decrease the price by 1%, the new price is $9.90.\n\nGiven the elasticity is 3, the quantity demanded will increase by 3%, so the new quantity is 103 units.\n\nNew total revenue is $9.90 x 103 = $1019.70, which is higher than the original $1,000.\n\nSimilarly, if they increase the price by 1% to $10.10, the quantity demanded would decrease by 3% to 97 units, leading to total revenue of $10.10 x 97 = $979.70, which is lower than the original.\n\nThis example confirms that decreasing the price increases total revenue when demand is elastic.\n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
