                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these statements isn't directly from Kepler's laws or doesn't follow directly from them. Let's review what Kepler's laws are.\n\nFirst, Kepler's First Law states that the orbit of each planet around the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. So, option B says exactly that: \"The orbit of each planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.\" That's directly from Kepler's First Law.\n\nKepler's Second Law is about the area swept out by a line connecting a planet to the Sun. It says that a planet moves faster when it's closer to the Sun and slower when it's farther away, in such a way that the line sweeps out equal areas in equal times. So, option A says, \"As a planet moves around its orbit, it sweeps out equal areas in equal times.\" That's directly from Kepler's Second Law.\n\nOption D says, \"A planet travels faster when it is nearer to the Sun and slower when it is farther from the Sun.\" This is also a direct consequence of Kepler's Second Law. It's essentially describing the same thing in different words.\n\nNow, option C says, \"The force of attraction between any two objects decreases with the square of the distance between their centers.\" This sounds familiar, but is it directly from Kepler's laws?\n\nWell, Kepler's laws describe the motion of planets around the Sun, but they don't specify the nature of the force causing that motion. The statement in option C is more related to Newton's law of universal gravitation, which says that the force between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.\n\nKepler's laws describe the observed motions, but it was Newton who later explained why planets move that way, by proposing the law of universal gravitation. So, while Kepler's laws and Newton's law of gravitation are related, the statement in option C is not directly from Kepler's laws; it's from Newton's theory.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"not one of nor follows directly from Kepler's laws.\" So, I need to make sure that none of the other options can be argued to not follow directly from Kepler's laws.\n\nOption A is directly from Kepler's Second Law.\n\nOption B is directly from Kepler's First Law.\n\nOption D is a direct consequence of Kepler's Second Law.\n\nOption C is about the force of attraction and its dependence on distance, which is not part of Kepler's laws but rather part of Newton's theory that explains Kepler's laws.\n\nSo, yes, option C is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
