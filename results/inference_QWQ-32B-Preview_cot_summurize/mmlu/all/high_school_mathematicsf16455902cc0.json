                    "text": "So I have this problem here. It defines M as 4a\u00b2 minus 2b\u00b2 plus a. Then it says let j be the value of M when a is 5 and b is 3, and k be the value of M when a is -1 and b is 4. Finally, I need to calculate j plus 2k and choose the correct answer from the options given.\n\nAlright, first things first. I need to find j, which is M when a=5 and b=3. So, plugging those values into the expression for M:\n\nM = 4*(5)\u00b2 - 2*(3)\u00b2 + 5\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 5 squared is 25, so 4 times 25 is 100.\n\nNext, 3 squared is 9, so 2 times 9 is 18.\n\nSo, M = 100 - 18 + 5 = 87.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that.\n\n4*(5)\u00b2 = 4*25 = 100\n\n-2*(3)\u00b2 = -2*9 = -18\n\nPlus a, which is +5.\n\nSo, 100 - 18 + 5 indeed equals 87.\n\nSo, j = 87.\n\nNow, I need to find k, which is M when a=-1 and b=4.\n\nPlugging those values into the expression:\n\nM = 4*(-1)\u00b2 - 2*(4)\u00b2 + (-1)\n\nLet's calculate this step by step as well.\n\nFirst, (-1) squared is 1, so 4 times 1 is 4.\n\nNext, 4 squared is 16, so 2 times 16 is 32.\n\nSo, M = 4 - 32 -1 = -29.\n\nWait, let's confirm that.\n\n4*(-1)\u00b2 = 4*1 = 4\n\n-2*(4)\u00b2 = -2*16 = -32\n\nPlus a, which is -1.\n\nSo, 4 - 32 -1 equals -29.\n\nTherefore, k = -29.\n\nNow, I need to calculate j + 2k.\n\nj is 87, and k is -29, so 2k is 2*(-29) = -58.\n\nTherefore, j + 2k = 87 + (-58) = 29.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure about that.\n\n87 plus -58 should be 87 - 58.\n\n87 - 50 is 37, and 37 - 8 is 29.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, j + 2k equals 29.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 29\n\nB. 28\n\nC. 27\n\nD. 26\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. 29.\n\nBut wait, let me just double-check all the calculations to be absolutely sure.\n\nFirst, calculating j:\n\nM = 4a\u00b2 - 2b\u00b2 + a\n\na=5, b=3\n\n4*(5)\u00b2 = 4*25 = 100\n\n-2*(3)\u00b2 = -2*9 = -18\n\n+ a = +5\n\nSo, 100 - 18 + 5 = 87. That seems correct.\n\nThen, calculating k:\n\na=-1, b=4\n\n4*(-1)\u00b2 = 4*1 = 4\n\n-2*(4)\u00b2 = -2*16 = -32\n\n+ a = +(-1) = -1\n\nSo, 4 - 32 -1 = -29. That seems correct.\n\nThen, j + 2k = 87 + 2*(-29) = 87 - 58 = 29. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 29.\n\nBut the answer provided is A. 29, which matches my calculation.\n\nWait, but the initial statement said the answer is A. 29, but then there was a note saying \"The correct answer is B. 28\", which contradicts.\n\nWait, no, the initial statement said \"Answer is A 29\", and then \"The correct answer is B 28\", which seems conflicting.\n\nBut according to my calculation, it should be 29.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the reference solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Let M=4a\u00b2 - 2b\u00b2 +a. Let j be the value of M when a=5 and b=3, and let k be the value of M when a=-1 and b=4. Calculate j+2k.\"\n\nMy calculations:\n\nj = M(5,3) = 4*(25) - 2*(9) + 5 = 100 - 18 + 5 = 87\n\nk = M(-1,4) = 4*(1) - 2*(16) + (-1) = 4 - 32 -1 = -29\n\nThen, j + 2k = 87 + 2*(-29) = 87 - 58 = 29\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem or in the answer choices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression for M is different, but in the problem statement, it's clearly M=4a\u00b2 - 2b\u00b2 +a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is misinterpreted.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the expression.\n\nWait, in the expression M=4a\u00b2 - 2b\u00b2 +a, is it possible that it's M=4a\u00b2 - 2b\u00b2 + a, or maybe it's M=4a\u00b2 - 2b\u00b2 + ab or something else?\n\nBut according to the problem, it's M=4a\u00b2 - 2b\u00b2 +a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are different conventions for the variables, but in the problem, it's clearly a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the reference solution.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer should be A. 29.\n\nBut the initial statement says \"The correct answer is B. 28\", which contradicts my calculation.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the reference solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misprint in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression for M is different, but in the problem statement, it's clearly as I interpreted.\n\nGiven that, I'm confident that my calculation is correct, and the answer should be A. 29.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{29} \\]"
