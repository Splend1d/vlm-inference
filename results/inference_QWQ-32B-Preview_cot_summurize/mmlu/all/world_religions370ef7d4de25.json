I think I've heard of Ikebana before in relation to arranging flowers in Japan, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up what each of these terms means to be confident in my answer.\n\nStarting with A. Zazen: I believe Zazen is a meditation practice in Zen Buddhism. It's about sitting in a specific posture and focusing the mind. So, that doesn't seem related to flower arranging.\n\nNext, B. Tariki: I think Tariki is a concept in Japanese Buddhism, particularly in the Pure Land sect. It refers to relying on the grace of Amida Buddha for salvation. Again, this doesn't sound like flower arranging.\n\nOption C. Kami: Kami is a term used in Shinto, the indigenous religion of Japan. Kami refers to the spirits or deities worshipped in Shinto. This also doesn't seem connected to arranging flowers.\n\nFinally, D. Ikebana: This is the one that rings a bell. I recall that Ikebana is indeed the Japanese art of flower arrangement. It's known for its minimalistic approach and emphasis on the line and form of the flowers and branches used.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should quickly look up each term. Let's see:\n\n- Zazen: Confirmed, it's a meditation practice in Zen Buddhism.\n\n- Tariki: Correct again, it's related to Pure Land Buddhism and the concept of other-power.\n\n- Kami: Yes, central to Shinto religion.\n\n- Ikebana: Definitely the art of flower arrangement in Japan.\n\nSo, among these options, Ikebana is the term that denotes the Japanese art of flower arranging. I think the answer is D. Ikebana.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
