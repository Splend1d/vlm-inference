                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"The BLEU metric uses precision, while the ROGUE metric uses recall.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what BLEU and ROUGE metrics are. I know that both are used to evaluate the quality of text generated by machine translation or text generation models, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nBLEU stands for Bilingual Evaluation Understudy. It's a metric that compares a machine-translated text to one or more human references. From what I remember, BLEU calculates precision by counting how many n-grams in the candidate translation are also found in the reference translations. So, yes, it seems like it uses precision.\n\nROUGE stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation. This one is designed to evaluate the quality of a summary by comparing it to a set of reference summaries. ROUGE measures recall by checking how many n-grams in the reference summaries are covered by the candidate summary. So, it makes sense that it uses recall.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"Hidden Markov Models were frequently used to model English sentences.\"\n\nNow, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are probabilistic models that are used to represent sequences of observations, where the underlying system is assumed to be a Markov process with unobservable (hidden) states.\n\nIn natural language processing, HMMs have been used for various tasks, especially in speech recognition and part-of-speech tagging. For example, in speech recognition, HMMs are used to model the pronunciation of words, and in part-of-speech tagging, they are used to predict the sequence of parts of speech in a sentence based on the sequence of words.\n\nSo, yes, HMMs have been frequently used to model aspects of English sentences, particularly in tasks involving sequence labeling and prediction.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 also seems to be true.\n\nGiven that both statements appear to be correct, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut I should double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nLet me verify Statement 1 again. BLEU is indeed based on precision, as it measures the overlap between the candidate translation and the reference translations. ROUGE, on the other hand, is based on recall, as it measures how much of the reference summary is covered by the candidate summary. So, that seems solid.\n\nFor Statement 2, while HMMs have been widely used in NLP, especially in the past, it's true that they are frequently used to model certain aspects of English sentences. Although more recent models like neural networks have taken over in many areas, HMMs still hold significance in the history of NLP and are still used in some applications.\n\nTherefore, both statements are accurate, and the correct choice is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
