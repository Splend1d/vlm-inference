                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to understand both the ReLU and sigmoid activation functions, their gradients, and how they behave for different values of x.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"The ReLU's gradient is zero for x < 0, and the sigmoid gradient \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x)) \u2264 1/4 for all x.\"\n\nFirst, ReLU stands for Rectified Linear Unit. Its definition is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x) \\]\n\nSo, for x > 0, ReLU(x) = x, and for x \u2264 0, ReLU(x) = 0.\n\nNow, the gradient of ReLU is:\n\n- For x > 0, the gradient is 1.\n- For x < 0, the gradient is 0.\n- At x = 0, the gradient is undefined or sometimes set to 0 or 0.5 depending on the implementation.\n\nSo, the first part of Statement 1 is correct: the ReLU's gradient is indeed zero for x < 0.\n\nNext, the sigmoid function is defined as:\n\n\\[ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\]\n\nIts gradient is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d\\sigma(x)}{dx} = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x)) \\]\n\nI need to verify if this gradient is always less than or equal to 1/4 for all x.\n\nLet me consider the expression \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x)). Since \u03c3(x) is between 0 and 1 for all real x, let's find its maximum value.\n\nLet\u2019s set y = \u03c3(x), so y \u2208 (0,1).\n\nThen, the expression becomes y(1 - y).\n\nTo find the maximum of y(1 - y), I can take the derivative with respect to y and set it to zero.\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dy}[y(1 - y)] = 1 - 2y \\]\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n1 - 2y = 0 \u21d2 y = 1/2\n\nNow, check the second derivative:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d^2}{dy^2}[y(1 - y)] = -2 \\]\n\nSince this is negative, y = 1/2 is a maximum.\n\nSo, the maximum value of y(1 - y) is at y = 1/2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nTherefore, \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x)) \u2264 1/4 for all x.\n\nSo, the first statement is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient.\"\n\nFirst, let's consider the sigmoid function's gradient.\n\nWe already have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d\\sigma(x)}{dx} = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x)) \\]\n\nSince \u03c3(x) is continuous and differentiable for all real x, its gradient is also continuous.\n\nNow, for ReLU, as mentioned earlier, the gradient is:\n\n- 0 for x < 0\n- 1 for x > 0\n- Undefined at x = 0\n\nSo, the gradient of ReLU has a discontinuity at x = 0.\n\nTherefore, the second statement is also true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth statements are true, so the correct choice is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
