The builder spent some money on the project and had some materials left over that he sold. Now, the builder is suing the homeowner, and we need to figure out how much the builder is likely to recover.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n- Contract price: $20,000, payable upon completion.\n\n- Builder spent $9,000 framing the greenhouse.\n\n- Builder spent an additional $1,000 for materials not yet incorporated into the greenhouse.\n\n- Homeowner wrongfully ordered the builder to stop work.\n\n- Builder resold unused materials for $1,000.\n\n- To complete the project, it would have cost the builder an additional $5,000.\n\n- The partially built greenhouse increased the value of the homeowner's property by $3,000.\n\nWe need to determine how much the builder is likely to recover in a lawsuit against the homeowner.\n\nFirst, let's understand what happened here. The homeowner breached the contract by ordering the builder to stop work. This means the homeowner is responsible for any damages caused by this breach.\n\nIn contract law, when a party breaches a contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages that put them in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed.\n\nIn this case, the builder has already incurred costs and has materials that were resold. So, we need to calculate the builder's damages based on the costs incurred, any profits lost, and any savings from not having to complete the project.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. $3,000, the increase in the value of the homeowner's property.\n\nThis seems too low. The builder has spent $10,000 ($9,000 + $1,000) and had expected to make a profit. The increase in property value might be relevant, but it doesn't account for the builder's expenses and lost profits.\n\nB. $10,000, the total cost expended by the builder at the time of the breach.\n\nThis accounts for the $9,000 spent framing and the $1,000 for materials. However, this doesn't consider any profit the builder expected to make from the contract or the fact that the builder resold some materials.\n\nC. $14,000, the total cost expended by the builder ($10,000) plus the builder's expected profit ($5,000), minus the loss avoided by the resale of the unused materials ($1,000).\n\nThis seems comprehensive. It includes the costs incurred, adds the expected profit, and subtracts the amount recovered from reselling the materials.\n\nD. $15,000, the contract price ($20,000) minus the costs saved by the breach ($5,000).\n\nThis suggests that the builder would get the full contract price minus any costs he didn't have to incur because of the breach. However, this doesn't account for the costs already incurred or the resale of materials.\n\nLet's analyze option C in more detail:\n\n- Total cost expended: $10,000\n\n- Expected profit: $5,000 (since the contract price was $20,000 and total costs would have been $15,000 [$10,000 + $5,000])\n\n- Resale of unused materials: $1,000\n\nSo, damages would be $10,000 (costs) + $5,000 (profit) - $1,000 (resale) = $14,000.\n\nThis seems logical because the builder can recover the costs incurred, plus the profit lost, but must account for any reduction in damages due to the resale of materials.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, simply subtracts the saved costs from the contract price, which ignores the costs already incurred.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the most accurate calculation of damages.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's any other factor we should account for. The problem mentions that the partially built greenhouse increased the value of the homeowner's property by $3,000. This might be relevant in terms of quantum meruit or the value conferred to the homeowner.\n\nBut since the builder is suing based on the contract, and there's a breach of contract, the primary measure of damages is to compensate the builder for the costs incurred and the profit lost.\n\nThe increase in property value might be considered if the builder is seeking restitution or if there's a claim for the value of the work performed, but in a breach of contract action, it's the builder's losses that are compensated, not necessarily the value the work added to the property.\n\nTherefore, I think option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
