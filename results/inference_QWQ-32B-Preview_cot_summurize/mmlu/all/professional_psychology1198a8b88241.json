Since you've never worked with clients who believe they've been abducted by aliens before, it's important to educate yourself on their specific needs and the appropriate therapeutic approaches. This way, you can provide competent and effective care from the start.\n\nOption A suggests starting to see these clients and consulting with someone else only if problems arise. However, this might not be the most responsible approach because you could potentially make mistakes or missteps in your initial interactions with these clients, which could harm them or damage your professional relationship.\n\nOption B proposes starting to see these clients after establishing a consultative relationship with someone familiar with this population. While this is better than option A, it still involves seeing clients before you've fully educated yourself. Having a consultant is helpful, but it's still risky to start treating clients without a solid foundation of knowledge.\n\nOption D is to place an ad in the National Enquirer to let members of this population know about your services. This seems unprofessional and might not be the best way to reach your target clients. It's also important to consider the credibility and ethics of advertising in such a manner.\n\nIn conclusion, taking a continuing education class (option C) is the most appropriate and responsible step to ensure you are well-prepared to handle the unique challenges and needs of clients who believe they have been abducted by aliens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
