Let me explain why each of these options is a common frustration in writing or reading about research ethics.\n\nOption A: Writers differ over what is ethically acceptable.\n\nThis is a significant issue because ethics is not a one-size-fits-all field. Different cultures, disciplines, and individuals may have varying beliefs about what constitutes ethical behavior in research. This divergence can lead to confusion and inconsistency in ethical standards and guidelines. For example, what is considered acceptable in one country might be deemed unethical in another.

For instance, the use of animals in research, human subject experimentation, and the distribution of benefits and burdens in research are topics that have been discussed for decades. The persistence of these debates can be frustrating because it may seem like no progress is being made towards resolving these issues. However, it's important to recognize that ethical questions are complex and often don't have straightforward answers, which is why they continue to be debated.\n\nOption C: Cases of ethical violation tend to be linked with certain research methods.\n\nThis suggests that some research methods are more prone to ethical issues than others. For example, qualitative research methods that involve in-depth interviews or observations may raise concerns about privacy and consent, while quantitative methods involving large data sets may raise issues about data security and anonymity. This linkage can lead to biases against certain methods and may result in overly restrictive regulations that hinder the conduct of research. It's crucial to address ethical issues specific to each method without dismissing the method entirely.\n\nGiven that all three options represent common frustrations in research ethics, the best answer is D. All of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
