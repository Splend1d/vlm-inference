                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a map \\( x \\mapsto a x a^2 \\) from a group \\( G \\) to itself, and we need to determine under what conditions this map is a homomorphism. The options are that \\( G \\) is abelian, \\( G \\) is the trivial group, \\( a^3 = e \\), or \\( a^2 = a \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a map to be a homomorphism. In the context of groups, a homomorphism preserves the group operation. So, if \\( \\phi: G \\to G \\) is a homomorphism, then for all \\( x, y \\in G \\), we have \\( \\phi(xy) = \\phi(x) \\phi(y) \\).\n\nIn this problem, the map is \\( \\phi(x) = a x a^2 \\). So, to check if it's a homomorphism, we need to see if \\( \\phi(xy) = \\phi(x) \\phi(y) \\) for all \\( x, y \\in G \\).\n\nLet's compute both sides:\n\n1. \\( \\phi(xy) = a (x y) a^2 \\)\n\n2. \\( \\phi(x) \\phi(y) = (a x a^2) (a y a^2) \\)\n\nWe need to set these equal to each other and see what conditions on \\( G \\) or \\( a \\) make this true.\n\nSo, set \\( a (x y) a^2 = (a x a^2)(a y a^2) \\).\n\nLet's simplify the right-hand side:\n\n\\( (a x a^2)(a y a^2) = a x a^2 a y a^2 \\)\n\nNow, since \\( G \\) is a group, it's associative, so we can rearrange the parentheses:\n\n\\( a x (a^2 a) y a^2 = a x a^3 y a^2 \\)\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the left-hand side: \\( a (x y) a^2 \\).\n\nAnd the right-hand side: \\( a x a^2 a y a^2 \\).\n\nFor these to be equal for all \\( x, y \\in G \\), perhaps we can manipulate one side to look like the other.\n\nLet's see, maybe we can multiply both sides by \\( a^{-1} \\) on the left and by \\( a^{-2} \\) on the right to isolate \\( x y \\) and \\( x a^2 a y a^2 \\).\n\nSo, multiplying both sides on the left by \\( a^{-1} \\):\n\n\\( a^{-1} a (x y) a^2 = a^{-1} (a x a^2 a y a^2) \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( (x y) a^2 = (a^{-1} a) x a^2 a y a^2 = e x a^2 a y a^2 = x a^2 a y a^2 \\)\n\nWait, that didn't help much.\n\nMaybe try multiplying both sides on the right by \\( a^{-2} \\):\n\n\\( a (x y) a^2 a^{-2} = (a x a^2 a y a^2) a^{-2} \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( a (x y) = a x a^2 a y \\)\n\nHmm, still not very helpful.\n\nPerhaps I should try expanding both sides differently.\n\nLet's consider the right-hand side again: \\( a x a^2 a y a^2 \\).\n\nLet's group the terms differently:\n\n\\( a x (a^2 a) y a^2 = a x a^3 y a^2 \\)\n\nNow, if \\( a^3 = e \\), then this simplifies to:\n\n\\( a x e y a^2 = a x y a^2 \\), which is equal to the left-hand side \\( a (x y) a^2 \\).\n\nSo, if \\( a^3 = e \\), then \\( \\phi(xy) = \\phi(x) \\phi(y) \\).\n\nTherefore, one condition is that \\( a^3 = e \\).\n\nBut the problem says \"if and only if\", so we need to check if this is the only condition.\n\nWait, maybe there are other conditions that could make this true.\n\nLet's consider option A: G is abelian.\n\nIf \\( G \\) is abelian, then all elements commute with each other.\n\nSo, in that case, \\( a x = x a \\), and \\( a^2 x = x a^2 \\), etc.\n\nLet's see what \\( \\phi(x) = a x a^2 \\) becomes in an abelian group.\n\nSince \\( G \\) is abelian, \\( a x = x a \\), so \\( \\phi(x) = a x a^2 = x a a^2 = x a^3 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\phi(y) = y a^3 \\), so \\( \\phi(x) \\phi(y) = x a^3 y a^3 = x y a^6 \\).\n\nOn the other hand, \\( \\phi(x y) = (x y) a^3 \\).\n\nFor \\( \\phi(x y) = \\phi(x) \\phi(y) \\), we need \\( (x y) a^3 = x y a^6 \\), which implies \\( a^3 = a^6 \\), which further implies \\( a^3 = e \\), since \\( a^6 = a^3 a^3 = e e = e \\).\n\nSo, in an abelian group, the map is a homomorphism if and only if \\( a^3 = e \\).\n\nBut option A says G is abelian, which isn't sufficient on its own; we also need \\( a^3 = e \\).\n\nBut perhaps there are non-abelian groups where this holds.\n\nOption B is G = {e}, the trivial group.\n\nIn the trivial group, there's only one element, e, and the map becomes \\( e \\mapsto a e a^2 = a a^2 = a^3 \\).\n\nBut in the trivial group, e is the only element, so \\( a \\) must be e, and \\( a^3 = e \\).\n\nSo, in this case, the map is trivially a homomorphism.\n\nOption C is \\( a^3 = e \\), which we've already seen is a condition that makes the map a homomorphism.\n\nOption D is \\( a^2 = a \\), which implies \\( a = e \\), since in a group, if \\( a^2 = a \\), then multiplying both sides by \\( a^{-1} \\) gives \\( a = e \\).\n\nSo, option D essentially says \\( a = e \\), which is a specific case of option C, since \\( e^3 = e \\).\n\nBut option C is more general, as there could be elements other than e with \\( a^3 = e \\).\n\nNow, let's see if there are any other conditions.\n\nSuppose \\( a \\) is in the center of \\( G \\), denoted \\( Z(G) \\), which means \\( a \\) commutes with all elements of \\( G \\), i.e., \\( a x = x a \\) for all \\( x \\in G \\).\n\nIn that case, \\( \\phi(x) = a x a^2 = x a a^2 = x a^3 \\).\n\nThen, \\( \\phi(x y) = x y a^3 \\), and \\( \\phi(x) \\phi(y) = x a^3 y a^3 = x y a^6 \\).\n\nFor \\( \\phi(x y) = \\phi(x) \\phi(y) \\), we need \\( x y a^3 = x y a^6 \\), which again implies \\( a^3 = a^6 \\), or \\( a^3 = e \\).\n\nSo, even if \\( a \\) is in the center, we still need \\( a^3 = e \\) for the map to be a homomorphism.\n\nNow, let's consider the general case without assuming \\( G \\) is abelian or \\( a \\) is in the center.\n\nWe have \\( \\phi(x y) = a (x y) a^2 \\), and \\( \\phi(x) \\phi(y) = a x a^2 a y a^2 \\).\n\nSet them equal: \\( a (x y) a^2 = a x a^2 a y a^2 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by \\( a^{-1} \\): \\( (x y) a^2 = x a^2 a y a^2 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides on the right by \\( a^{-2} \\): \\( x y = x a^2 a y \\).\n\nSimplify: \\( x y = x a^3 y \\).\n\nNow, multiply both sides on the left by \\( x^{-1} \\): \\( y = a^3 y \\).\n\nThen, multiply both sides on the right by \\( y^{-1} \\): \\( e = a^3 \\).\n\nSo, in the general case, the map is a homomorphism if and only if \\( a^3 = e \\).\n\nWait, but this seems too strong. Did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me check the steps again.\n\nStarting from \\( a (x y) a^2 = a x a^2 a y a^2 \\).\n\nLeft-multiply by \\( a^{-1} \\): \\( (x y) a^2 = x a^2 a y a^2 \\).\n\nRight-multiply by \\( a^{-2} \\): \\( x y = x a^2 a y \\).\n\nSimplify: \\( x y = x a^3 y \\).\n\nLeft-multiply by \\( x^{-1} \\): \\( y = a^3 y \\).\n\nRight-multiply by \\( y^{-1} \\): \\( e = a^3 \\).\n\nSo, indeed, \\( a^3 = e \\) is a necessary condition for the map to be a homomorphism.\n\nMoreover, earlier, we saw that if \\( a^3 = e \\), then \\( \\phi(x y) = \\phi(x) \\phi(y) \\), regardless of whether \\( G \\) is abelian or not.\n\nTherefore, the map \\( x \\mapsto a x a^2 \\) is a homomorphism if and only if \\( a^3 = e \\).\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is \\( a^3 = e \\), which matches our conclusion.\n\nOption A, G is abelian, is not necessarily required, as the map can be a homomorphism in non-abelian groups as long as \\( a^3 = e \\).\n\nOption B, G = {e}, is a special case where \\( a = e \\), and \\( a^3 = e \\), which is consistent with option C.\n\nOption D, \\( a^2 = a \\), implies \\( a = e \\), which again is a special case of option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: \\( a^3 = e \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
