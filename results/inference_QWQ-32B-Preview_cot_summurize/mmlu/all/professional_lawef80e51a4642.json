                    "text": "I've got this question here about a woman selling her 10-acre farmland to a man. They have a written agreement saying the land is sold for $10,000, and the man acknowledges receiving the money. But in reality, he hasn't paid yet. At closing, he gives her a check for $10,000, which bounces because of insufficient funds. She sues him, and wants to testify that he didn't pay the $10,000 as stated in their written agreement. The man objects to her testimony, and the question is whether the judge should sustain his objection.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. No, because the parol evidence rule doesn't apply to events after the writing was formed.\n\nB. No, because the parol evidence rule doesn't exclude evidence showing lack of consideration.\n\nC. Yes, because the written instrument seems to be a complete agreement.\n\nD. Yes, because promissory estoppel prevents her from denying her own acknowledgment of receiving the $10,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The woman and the man have a written agreement that says the land is sold for $10,000, and it says that the woman has received this amount. But in reality, she hasn't received it yet; the check bounced. Now, she's trying to testify in court that she didn't actually receive the money, contradicting what's written in their agreement.\n\nSo, the man is objecting to her testimony, probably arguing that the written agreement is final and can't be contradicted by oral statements or subsequent events. This sounds like the parol evidence rule, which generally says that when parties have a complete written contract, oral statements or earlier agreements can't contradict it.\n\nOption A says no, because the parol evidence rule doesn't apply to events after the writing was formed. That makes sense because the rule is about what was agreed at the time of the writing, not about what happened afterward. So, if the check bounced after the writing was signed, that's an event subsequent to the agreement, and perhaps the parol evidence rule doesn't bar evidence of that.\n\nOption B also says no, because the parol evidence rule doesn't exclude evidence showing lack of consideration. Consideration is what each party gives to the other in exchange for something. Here, the consideration is the $10,000 for the land. If the man didn't actually give her the money, that affects whether there was valid consideration. So, maybe the parol evidence rule doesn't apply to challenge the existence of consideration.\n\nOption C says yes, because the written instrument appears to be a complete integration of the parties' agreement. This aligns with the parol evidence rule\u2014if the writing is the complete agreement, you can't bring in external evidence to contradict it. But in this case, the issue is whether the stated consideration was actually provided, which might be a different matter.\n\nOption D says yes, because promissory estoppel prevents her from denying her own acknowledgment. Promissory estoppel is when one party relies on another's promise to their detriment, and the promisor is estopped from going back on that promise. Here, the woman acknowledged receiving the $10,000 in writing. If the man relied on that to his detriment, maybe promissory estoppel applies. But in this scenario, the man is the one trying to enforce the acknowledgment, not relying on a promise.\n\nI think options A and B are more relevant here. The parol evidence rule typically doesn't allow evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict the written contract, but it might not bar evidence of subsequent events or the actual provision of consideration.\n\nIn this case, the woman is trying to show that despite the writing saying she received the $10,000, she actually didn't because the check bounced. This seems like evidence of a subsequent event\u2014that the check didn't clear due to insufficient funds.\n\nMoreover, consideration is a necessary element for the contract to be enforceable. If there was no actual transfer of consideration, that could affect the validity of the contract.\n\nSo, perhaps the parol evidence rule doesn't bar this evidence. That would support options A and B.\n\nOption C says yes, the judge should sustain the objection because the writing is a complete integration. But if the issue is whether the consideration was provided, which is essential to the contract's validity, maybe the parol evidence rule doesn't apply in this way.\n\nOption D mentions promissory estoppel, which might not be directly applicable here. The woman is not going back on a promise; she's trying to correct a statement in the writing about whether she received the money.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the correct answer is B: No, because the parol evidence rule doesn't operate to exclude evidence to show lack or want of consideration.\n\nThis makes sense because the existence of consideration is crucial to the contract's enforceability, and allowing evidence that the consideration wasn't provided wouldn't be contradicting the written agreement but rather questioning whether the stated consideration actually occurred.\n\nSo, the judge should not sustain the man's objection, and the woman should be allowed to testify that she didn't receive the $10,000 as stated in the writing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
