                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand what Kant is saying about marriage and sexual activity. The question is: \"Kant argues that marriage allows spouses to treat each other not as mere means when engaging in sexual activity because...\" and then there are four options. I need to pick the one that best captures Kant's view.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Kant's moral philosophy, especially his views on sexuality and marriage. Kant is known for his deontological ethics, which is based on duties and rules rather than consequences. The categorical imperative is central to his ethics, and there are different formulations of it.\n\nOne of the formulations is the \"formula of humanity,\" which states that we should act in such a way that we treat humanity, whether in our own person or in the person of another, always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means to an end. So, treating someone as a mere means is immoral because it violates their dignity as a rational being.\n\nNow, applying this to sexual activity, Kant has some specific views. He generally has a negative view of sexual desire because he sees it as animalistic and not aligned with rationality. However, he acknowledges that sexual activity within marriage can be morally permissible.\n\nOption A says: \"God demands that all sexual activity occur in the context of marriage.\" I don't recall Kant placing much emphasis on divine command in his moral philosophy. He was more focused on pure reason as the source of moral law. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption B: \"this will ultimately produce the most happiness for the greatest number of persons.\" This sounds like utilitarianism, which is a consequentialist approach. Kant, being a deontologist, wouldn't prioritize happiness or consequences as the basis for moral actions. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C: \"in marriage two persons equally and reciprocally transfer their whole person to the other.\" This sounds interesting. Kant does discuss marriage as a mutual agreement where both parties consent to a lifelong partnership. Maybe in this context, the transfer of their whole person signifies a complete commitment and mutual respect, which would prevent treating each other as mere means.\n\nOption D: \"the universal law formulation of the categorical imperative requires that each of us be married.\" I'm not sure about this. The universal law formulation says that you should act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law. I don't see how this directly requires everyone to be married.\n\nLet me think more about option C. If in marriage, both spouses transfer their whole person to each other, it suggests a complete giving of oneself, including sexual rights, to the other. This mutual transfer could be seen as a way to ensure that neither party is using the other solely for sexual gratification. Instead, they are committing to a comprehensive relationship where sexual activity is part of a broader mutual commitment.\n\nKant does discuss marriage in his Lectures on Ethics, where he considers marriage as a contract that allows for the mutual use of each other's sexual faculties without treating each other merely as means. So, it seems that in marriage, the mutual transfer of rights and the reciprocal commitment allow sexual activity to be morally permissible because it's part of a larger, mutual relationship.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to align best with Kant's view. It emphasizes the mutual and reciprocal nature of marriage, where both parties fully commit to each other, which prevents either from treating the other merely as a means for sexual satisfaction.\n\nI should double-check if Kant explicitly mentions the transfer of the whole person. From what I recall, he discusses the transfer of sexual rights within marriage, but \"whole person\" might be a bit broader. However, in the context of marriage being a comprehensive union, it makes sense to interpret it as a transfer of the whole person.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Kant's moral theory is based on pure reason, not on divine command. Option B is wrong because Kant doesn't endorse consequentialist reasoning. Option D is unlikely because the categorical imperative doesn't require universal marriage; it's about acting on maxims that can be universalized.\n\nHence, the best answer is C: in marriage two persons equally and reciprocally transfer their whole person to the other.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
