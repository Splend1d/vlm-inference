                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about Maria and her therapy sessions. She's been going to see a therapist because her parents noticed she was in the early stages of an eating disorder. But from the sounds of it, Maria isn't exactly making things easy for anyone involved. She's late to sessions, not cooperative, and even hostile. Her counselor eventually digs into these feelings of hostility and discovers that they're actually directed at her parents, not really at the counselor herself.\n\nNow, the question is asking about what Maria's behavior towards her counselor represents. There are four options: suppression, conflicting motives, transference, and countertransference. I need to figure out which one best describes Maria's uncooperativeness and hostility towards her counselor.\n\nFirst, let's look at suppression. Suppression is a defense mechanism where a person consciously or unconsciously pushes unwanted thoughts or feelings out of awareness. So, if Maria is suppressing her feelings towards her parents, maybe she's not even aware of them, and they're coming out in her behavior towards the counselor. That seems plausible, but maybe there's a better fit.\n\nNext, conflicting motives. This refers to having two or more opposing desires or impulses at the same time. For example, Maria might want to get better and overcome her eating disorder, but at the same time, she might feel resistant to change or resentful towards her parents for forcing her into therapy. These conflicting feelings could manifest as hostility towards the counselor. That makes sense too.\n\nThen there's transference. Transference is a psychological phenomenon where a person directs feelings or attitudes from a past relationship to someone in the present, often the therapist. So, if Maria has certain feelings towards her parents, she might transfer those feelings onto her counselor. This seems particularly relevant here because the counselor discovered that Maria's hostility was actually directed at her parents. So, Maria is projecting her feelings about her parents onto the counselor. That sounds like a classic case of transference.\n\nLastly, countertransference. This is when the therapist experiences unconscious feelings towards the patient, often influenced by the therapist's own past experiences or unresolved issues. But in this scenario, the focus is on Maria's behavior towards the counselor, not the counselor's feelings towards Maria. So, countertransference doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nComparing all four options, transference appears to be the most accurate description of Maria's behavior. She's directing her feelings towards her parents onto her counselor, which explains her lateness, uncooperativeness, and hostility.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider suppression again. While suppression could be happening, the key point is that the counselor was able to uncover that Maria's hostility was actually towards her parents. This suggests that Maria maybe wasn't aware of those feelings initially, and they were being projected onto the counselor. That aligns more with transference than suppression.\n\nConflicting motives could also play a role. Maria might have conflicting feelings about going to therapy and about her parents' intervention. However, the specific behavior towards the counselor seems more directly related to transference.\n\nCountertransference is clearly not the answer here, as it involves the counselor's feelings, not Maria's.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. transference.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
