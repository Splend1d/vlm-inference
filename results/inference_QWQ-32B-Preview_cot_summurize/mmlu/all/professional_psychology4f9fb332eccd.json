                    "text": "Let's see what the Buckley Amendment is all about. I remember it has something to do with student records, but I need to recall the specifics.\n\nOption A says it establishes the right of parents or legal guardians to inspect their child\u2019s school records. That sounds familiar. I think that\u2019s part of it.\n\nOption B mentions patients\u2019 access to their hospital records. Hmm, that seems related to medical privacy, maybe like HIPAA, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the Buckley Amendment is about.\n\nOption C talks about employers making reasonable modifications to tests for applicants with disabilities. That sounds more like Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations, not the Buckley Amendment.\n\nOption D mentions the requirement for schools to provide a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d to students with disabilities. I believe that\u2019s part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), not the Buckley Amendment.\n\nSo, going back to option A, it seems like the Buckley Amendment is about parents\u2019 or legal guardians\u2019 right to see their child\u2019s school records. I think that\u2019s correct.\n\nTo make sure, I should remember that the Buckley Amendment is also known as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). It\u2019s a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. It gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records, including the right to review and inspect them.\n\nAfter high school, when a student reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level, the rights under FERPA transfer to the student. So, it\u2019s important to know that parents\u2019 rights regarding access to their child\u2019s records change once the student becomes an adult or enrolled in higher education.\n\nAlso, FERPA requires that schools obtain written permission from the parent or eligible student before releasing any personally identifiable information from the student's education records, except in certain specified circumstances.\n\nSo, in summary, the Buckley Amendment, or FERPA, primarily establishes the right of parents or legal guardians of a child to inspect the child\u2019s school records, which aligns with option A.\n\nI think that\u2019s the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
