                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a bunch of real estate transactions and I need to figure out the legal effect of the son's mortgage agreement with the bank in 2008. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, in 1940, the state conveyed a tract of land to a man via a deed that was immediately recorded. That seems straightforward. Then, in 1990, this man died without a wife, devising all his real property to his son. The will was probated shortly after his death. So, the son inherited the property.\n\nFast forward to 2005, the son conveyed the tract of land to a friend, but the deed wasn't recorded until after the son's death in 2009. Then, in 2008, the son mortgaged the property to a bank, and this mortgage was recorded in 2008. Importantly, this mortgage recited that it was subordinate to a earlier mortgage given to a rancher in 1988, which was also recorded in 1988.\n\nAlso, all these deeds are general warranty deeds, and the state follows a notice-type recording statute and a title theory for mortgages.\n\nOkay, so I need to determine the probable legal effect of the son's mortgage agreement with the bank in 2008.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. The mortgage would be invalid because the son conveyed his interest in the property to the friend in 2005.\n\nB. The mortgage would be invalid because the first mortgage in 1988 would take precedence over the second mortgage.\n\nC. The mortgage would be invalid unless the mortgagee bank had knowledge of the prior conveyance to the friend.\n\nD. The subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.\n\nHmm.\n\nStarting with option A: Is the mortgage invalid because the son conveyed his interest to the friend in 2005?\n\nWell, the son conveyed the property to the friend in 2005, but the deed wasn't recorded until after the son's death in 2009. Meanwhile, in 2008, the son mortgaged the property to the bank, and that mortgage was recorded in 2008.\n\nNow, since the state has a notice-type recording statute, I need to think about how that affects the priorities of these transactions.\n\nIn a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent bona fide purchaser who records first will have priority over a prior unrecorded conveyance.\n\nSo, here, the friend received the deed in 2005 but didn't record it until after the son's death in 2009. The bank got a mortgage in 2008 and recorded it then.\n\nSo, under notice recording statutes, the bank, as a subsequent purchaser who recorded first, would have priority over the friend, who didn't record until later.\n\nTherefore, option A might not be correct because even though the son conveyed to the friend in 2005, the friend didn't record, and the bank recorded their mortgage in 2008.\n\nOption B says the mortgage would be invalid because the first mortgage in 1988 takes precedence.\n\nWell, the mortgage to the bank in 2008 expressly states that it is subordinate to the earlier mortgage to the rancher in 1988. So, it's acknowledging that the 1988 mortgage has priority. That doesn't necessarily make the 2008 mortgage invalid; it just means it's subordinate.\n\nSo, perhaps option B isn't the right answer.\n\nOption C says the mortgage would be invalid unless the mortgagee bank had knowledge of the prior conveyance to the friend.\n\nAgain, in a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser without notice of prior unrecorded interests will have priority. Since the friend didn't record the deed until after the bank's mortgage was recorded, the bank likely didn't have notice. Therefore, the bank's mortgage would be valid, despite the prior conveyance to the friend.\n\nSo, option C seems unlikely.\n\nOption D says the subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail against the prior conveyee, the friend, who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.\n\nThis seems consistent with what I've read about notice recording statutes. Since the friend didn't record their deed until after the bank recorded their mortgage, the bank should have priority.\n\nBut wait, is the bank's interest superior to the friend's?\n\nIn notice recording states, the first to record prevails, provided they didn't have notice of the prior unrecorded interest.\n\nHere, the bank recorded in 2008, and the friend didn't record until after 2009. So, unless the bank had notice of the 2005 conveyance to the friend, the bank's mortgage should have priority.\n\nBut the friend's deed was never recorded before the bank's mortgage, so it's unlikely the bank had notice.\n\nTherefore, option D seems plausible.\n\nHowever, let's think about the son's authority to mortgage the property after he'd already conveyed it to the friend in 2005, even if the deed wasn't recorded.\n\nUnder real estate law, a grantor who conveys title to another retains no interest in the property, at least once the deed is delivered and accepted, regardless of recording.\n\nBut in this case, the deed wasn't recorded until after the son's death.\n\nSo, did the son still have any interest in the property in 2008 when he mortgaged it to the bank?\n\nWell, in terms of equity, he had conveyed it to the friend in 2005, but since it wasn't recorded, the bank, as a subsequent purchaser, might not have known about it.\n\nLegally, in a notice jurisdiction, the bank, by recording first, might have priority over the friend.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it.\n\nAlso, the state follows a title theory for mortgages. In title theory states, a mortgage conveys legal title to the mortgagee, subject to the mortgagor's right of redemption.\n\nSo, in this case, when the son mortgaged the property to the bank in 2008, legal title would pass to the bank, subject to the son's right to redeem.\n\nBut earlier, in 2005, the son conveyed the property to the friend, but didn't record it.\n\nSo, there's a conflict between the friend's interest and the bank's interest.\n\nGiven that the friend's deed wasn't recorded until after the bank's mortgage, and in a notice jurisdiction, the bank, as a subsequent purchaser without notice, should have priority.\n\nTherefore, the bank's mortgage would be valid, and the friend's interest would be subject to the bank's mortgage.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A is probably incorrect because, in notice jurisdictions, recording matters, and the bank recorded before the friend.\n\nOption B is unlikely because the mortgage expressly subordinates itself to the 1988 mortgage, so it's acknowledging that subordination.\n\nOption C is similar to A, and for the same reasons, it's probably not correct.\n\nOption D aligns with the principles of notice recording statutes, where a subsequent purchaser who records first has priority over prior unrecorded interests.\n\nTherefore, the probable legal effect is that the subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail against the prior conveyee, the friend, who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) The subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated."
