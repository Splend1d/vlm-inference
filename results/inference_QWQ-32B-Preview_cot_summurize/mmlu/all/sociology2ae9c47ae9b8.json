                    "text": "So I've got this question here about what a \"nuclear family\" means, and there are four options to choose from. Let me read them again to make sure I understand each one.\n\nOption A says: \"a group of people sharing living accommodation and meals.\" Hmm, that sounds like a household where multiple people live together and share meals. Could that be a nuclear family? Well, nuclear families typically consist of parents and their children living together, so maybe this fits, but it's a bit broad because it could include extended family members too, right?\n\nOption B is: \"a network of relatives extended within or between generations.\" This seems to be describing an extended family, where grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc., are all part of the family network. That's not exactly a nuclear family, which is more limited in its members.\n\nOption C says: \"the new family created when an adult leaves home and gets married.\" So, this is talking about someone who has left their parents' home and started their own family by getting married. That sounds like the beginning of a nuclear family, but it doesn't fully capture the concept, I think. A nuclear family includes not just the married couple but also their children, if they have any.\n\nOption D is: \"a two-generation unit of parents and their children.\" Okay, this seems pretty straightforward. It specifies that a nuclear family consists of two generations: parents and their children. That aligns with what I've learned about nuclear families.\n\nNow, let me think about this. The term \"nuclear family\" generally refers to a family structure that includes only the immediate family members: parents and their children, excluding grandparents or other relatives. It's called \"nuclear\" because it's the core or central unit of the family.\n\nOption A is too broad because it could include extended family members who share living accommodation and meals. For example, in some cultures, it's common for multiple generations to live under one roof, which would be an extended family, not a nuclear family.\n\nOption B clearly describes an extended family, which is larger than a nuclear family and includes relatives beyond just parents and children.\n\nOption C describes the formation of a new family when an adult marries and leaves their parents' home, but it doesn't specify that this new family includes children. While it's a step towards forming a nuclear family, it's not entirely accurate.\n\nOption D directly matches the definition of a nuclear family as a two-generation unit consisting of parents and their children.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is Option D: \"a two-generation unit of parents and their children.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
