                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about reserve requirements and what happens when they are lowered. So, first things first, I need to remember what reserve requirements are.\n\nReserve requirements are the amount of money that banks are required to hold in reserve and not lend out. This is set by the central bank to ensure that banks have enough liquidity to meet the demands of their depositors.\n\nSo, if reserve requirements are lowered, that means banks have to hold less money in reserve. That should free up more money for them to lend out or invest.\n\nOption A says that lowering reserve requirements would force banks to hold more reserves and make more loans. But that doesn't make sense because lowering reserve requirements means holding less in reserve, not more.\n\nOption B says that banks can make more loans and buy more investments, which would decrease the money supply. Hmm, that seems contradictory. If banks make more loans, that usually increases the money supply because when banks lend money, they create new money in the process.\n\nOption C says that banks can make more loans and buy more investments, thus increasing the money supply. That aligns with what I just thought. If banks make more loans, they increase the money supply.\n\nOption D says that lowering reserve requirements allows banks more freedom to merge and acquire other businesses. I don't think reserve requirements directly relate to banks' ability to merge or acquire other businesses. That seems more related to regulatory constraints or capital requirements.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C is the correct answer. Lowering reserve requirements allows banks to make more loans and buy more investments, which increases the money supply.\n\nBut let me double-check. If reserve requirements are lowered, banks have more excess reserves, which they can use to make loans or buy securities. When they make loans, those loans create new money in the economy, thus increasing the money supply.\n\nAlso, buying investments, like government securities, can inject money into the economy, although that mechanism is a bit different.\n\nSo, yes, option C seems to be the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
