It says, \"Normal goods always have a/an...\" and then it gives four options: A. elastic demand curve, B. inelastic demand curve, C. elastic supply curve, D. positive income elasticity.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what normal goods are. I remember that normal goods are those for which demand increases as income increases, and vice versa. So, there's a positive relationship between income and the demand for normal goods.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Elastic demand curve: Elastic demand means that the quantity demanded is sensitive to changes in price. The elasticity is greater than 1. But the question is about normal goods, which is related to income, not price.\n\nB. Inelastic demand curve: This would mean that the quantity demanded is not very responsive to price changes. Elasticity is less than 1. Again, this is about price, not income.\n\nC. Elastic supply curve: This refers to how supply responds to price changes. It's about the supplier's responsiveness, not about the goods being normal or inferior.\n\nD. Positive income elasticity: Income elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded responds to a change in income. For normal goods, this elasticity is positive, meaning that as income rises, quantity demanded rises.\n\nSo, option D seems to directly relate to the definition of normal goods.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is it possible that normal goods always have a positive income elasticity?\n\nWell, by definition, normal goods are those for which income elasticity is positive. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWhat about the other options? Why aren't they correct?\n\nOption A: Elastic demand curve. Elasticity here refers to price elasticity, not income elasticity. So, whether a good is normal or inferior doesn't determine its price elasticity. Some normal goods might have elastic demand, while others might have inelastic demand. It varies.\n\nOption B: Inelastic demand curve. Same as above. The income nature of the good doesn't determine its price elasticity.\n\nOption C: Elastic supply curve. This is about supply elasticity, which is unrelated to whether a good is normal or inferior.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Positive income elasticity.\n\nWait, but the question says \"always.\" Does that mean there are cases where normal goods don't have positive income elasticity? I don't think so. The definition of normal goods is that they have positive income elasticity.\n\nSo, I think D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
