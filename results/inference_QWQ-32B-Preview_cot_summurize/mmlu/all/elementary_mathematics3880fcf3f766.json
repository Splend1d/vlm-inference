The options are A. 3 - p, B. p + 3, C. 3 / p, and D. p - 3. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"3 fewer than a number, p\" means. If I have a number p, and I need something that is 3 fewer than that, it means I should subtract 3 from p, right? Because \"fewer\" suggests subtraction.\n\nSo, if I have p and I subtract 3, that would be p - 3. That seems straightforward. Let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is 3 - p. That would be subtracting p from 3, which is different from subtracting 3 from p. For example, if p is 5, 3 - 5 is -2, whereas 5 - 3 is 2. So, these are not the same.\n\nOption B is p + 3, which means adding 3 to p. But the phrase says \"fewer than,\" which means less, so addition doesn't make sense here.\n\nOption C is 3 / p, which is dividing 3 by p. That doesn't relate to the \"fewer than\" concept.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, D. p - 3 seems to be the correct choice.\n\nLet me double-check by plugging in a number. Suppose p is 10.\n\n\"3 fewer than 10\" should be 7, right? Because 10 minus 3 is 7.\n\nNow, let's see what each option gives:\n\nA. 3 - 10 = -7\n\nB. 10 + 3 = 13\n\nC. 3 / 10 = 0.3\n\nD. 10 - 3 = 7\n\nYes, only D gives the correct result of 7.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the order of the phrase: \"3 fewer than a number, p.\" This means starting with p and reducing it by 3, which is p - 3.\n\nIf it were \"p fewer than 3,\" that would be 3 - p, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is D. p - 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
