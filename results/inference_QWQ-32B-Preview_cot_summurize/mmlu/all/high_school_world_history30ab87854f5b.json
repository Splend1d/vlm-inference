And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nThe most likely source of Islam in Mali came from\n\nA. wandering Berber mystics.\nB. conquering Mughal armies.\nC. contact with Muslim trade caravans.\nD. pilgrims to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia.\n"

So, I need to think about the options given and see which one makes the most sense in that time period.\n\nOption A is \"wandering Berber mystics.\" Berbers are from North Africa, and some were certainly involved in the spread of Islam, especially through Sufism, which is a mystical branch of Islam. So, it's possible that Berber mystics traveled south and introduced Islam to Mali.\n\nOption B is \"conquering Mughal armies.\" Hmm, the Mughal Empire was in India, right? So, that seems unlikely because Mali is in West Africa, and the Mughals were in South Asia. I don't think their armies reached that far west.\n\nOption C is \"contact with Muslim trade caravans.\" Mali was located along important trans-Saharan trade routes. Trade caravans brought not only goods but also ideas and religion. So, it's very plausible that Islam spread through these trade networks.\n\nOption D is \"pilgrims to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia.\" Ethiopia is east of Mali, and while there was some interaction between Ethiopia and West Africa, the major Islamic influence in West Africa came more from the north via the Sahara.\n\nGiven this, options A and C seem the most plausible. Berber mystics could have traveled to Mali, and trade caravans certainly did. But trade was a major factor in the region, and Islam often spread through commerce because traders needed religious connections and shared beliefs to facilitate trade.\n\nAlso, considering that Ibn Battuta was a traveler who visited Mali and observed their practices, it's likely that Islam had spread through peaceful means like trade and missionary activities rather than conquest.\n\nSo, between A and C, I think C is the most likely answer. Contact with Muslim trade caravans would have been a significant way for Islam to spread into Mali.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about the time period. The 1300s correspond to the height of the Mali Empire, which was known for its wealth and trade connections across the Sahara to North Africa and beyond. The emperor Mansa Musa, who ruled in the early 1300s, is famous for his hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, which he undertook around 1324. This shows that Mali had strong connections with the Islamic world.\n\nGiven that, it's likely that Islam was introduced through trade connections before Mansa Musa's time. So, contact with Muslim trade caravans seems like the most probable source.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Contact with Muslim trade caravans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
