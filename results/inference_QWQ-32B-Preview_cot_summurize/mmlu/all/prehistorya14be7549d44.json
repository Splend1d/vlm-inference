                    "text": "Let's see what evidence there is that Neandertals were hunters. I have these options:\n\nA. Neandertal canine teeth showed that they relied only on meat for their subsistence.\n\nB. Animal bones were found showing stone tool cut marks and no animal teeth marks.\n\nC. Bones of large animals, such as elephant and horse, were found in caves.\n\nD. Both A and C.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what evidence would support the idea that Neandertals were hunters. Hunting involves chasing down and killing animals for food, so finding remains that suggest they were processing meat would be relevant.\n\nOption A mentions Neandertal canine teeth showing they relied only on meat. Hmm, teeth can tell us about diet, but does relying on meat necessarily mean they were hunters? Maybe they were scavengers, eating meat from animals already killed by other predators. Also, \"only on meat\" seems too absolute. weren't Neandertals known to have some plant material in their diet as well? I recall reading about plant starch grains found on their teeth, suggesting they ate vegetables too. So, maybe option A isn't entirely accurate.\n\nOption B talks about animal bones with stone tool cut marks and no animal teeth marks. That sounds promising. Cut marks from tools would suggest that Neandertals were butchering animals, which implies they had control over the carcasses, possibly from hunting. The absence of animal teeth marks might mean that they didn't scavenge from carcasses that had already been torn apart by other animals. So, this seems like strong evidence for hunting.\n\nOption C mentions bones of large animals like elephant and horse found in caves. Finding large animal bones in places where Neandertals lived could suggest they hunted these animals and brought them back to their shelters. However, it's also possible that these bones ended up in caves through other means, like natural death or even flood deposits. So, while it's suggestive, it might not be as direct evidence as option B.\n\nOption D combines A and C, but since I'm questioning A, maybe D isn't the best choice.\n\nLet me consider this again. If Neandertals were hunters, we'd expect to find evidence of them processing animal remains, which aligns with option B. Option C is more about the location of the bones, which is interesting but perhaps not as directly indicative of hunting behavior.\n\nAlso, regarding option A, I think it's important to note that Neandertals had a varied diet. There's evidence from isotopic analysis and dental calculus that suggests they consumed both meat and plants. So, saying they relied only on meat might not be accurate.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, option B seems to be the strongest evidence for Neandertals being hunters. It directly points to their involvement in butchering animals, which is a key aspect of hunting.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are other types of evidence that support hunting, like stone tools designed for hunting or depictions of hunting scenes. However, the question provides specific options, so I should stick to those.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the best answer is B: Animal bones were found showing stone tool cut marks and no animal teeth marks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
