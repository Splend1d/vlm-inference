                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the most obvious material symbols of ancient state societies are. The options are stone tablets, pyramids, monumental works, and irrigation canals. Hmm, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, stone tablets are important because they often contain writings and records, which are crucial for administration and law in a state society. But are they the most obvious symbols? Maybe not, because they're relatively small compared to other structures.\n\nPyramids come to mind immediately, especially the ones in Egypt. They're massive and clearly represent the power and organization of ancient states. But I also know that not all ancient states built pyramids. For example, the pyramids were prominent in Egypt and Mesoamerica, but other civilizations had different\u6807\u5fd7\u6027 structures.\n\nMonumental works is a broad category that could include pyramids, temples, statues, and other large-scale constructions. These kinds of projects require a lot of resources and labor, which suggests a strong central authority and social organization. So, this seems like a very likely answer.\n\nIrrigation canals are also important, as they allowed for agriculture to flourish, supporting larger populations and the development of cities. They are definitely a key aspect of state societies, but they might not be considered the most obvious material symbols compared to more visible monuments.\n\nConsidering all this, I think \"monumental works\" is the best answer because it encompasses a wide range of large-scale constructions that are iconic representations of ancient state societies' power and achievements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
