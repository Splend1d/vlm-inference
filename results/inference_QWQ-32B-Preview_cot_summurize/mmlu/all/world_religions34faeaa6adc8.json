So, the correct answer is A. 30.\n\nHere's a bit more context: Guru Nanak was born in 1469 in what is now Pakistan. At the age of 30, he had a profound spiritual experience where he disappeared for three days and upon his return, he started spreading the message of one God, the importance of leading a moral life, and the equality of all humans, regardless of their caste, creed, or gender. His teachings formed the basis of Sikhism, which is one of the world's largest religions."
