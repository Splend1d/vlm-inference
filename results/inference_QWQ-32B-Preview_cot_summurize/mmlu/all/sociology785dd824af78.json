Let's see what each one is saying.\n\nOption A says it's \"the objective categories of ethnicity used in the census.\" So, this sounds like it's about how governments classify people into different ethnic groups for statistical purposes. Like, when you fill out a census form and they ask about your ethnicity, and you pick from a list of options provided.\n\nOption B says it's \"a felt sense of group membership on the basis of religion, language, or history.\" This seems more subjective. It's about how people personally identify themselves as belonging to a particular group because of shared characteristics like religion, language, or a common history.\n\nOption C is \"the imposition of a racial label on a minority by a powerful majority.\" This sounds like it's about how dominant groups assign racial categories to minority groups, maybe in a way that's not chosen by the minorities themselves.\n\nOption D says \"the fragmented and pluralistic nature of ethnicity.\" This seems to be describing ethnicity as being diverse and made up of many different parts, maybe overlapping or conflicting identities.\n\nNow, I need to think about what ethnic identity really means. I think it's more about how people perceive themselves and their connections to a particular group based on shared characteristics like culture, language, religion, or history. So, it's more of a personal and subjective identification rather than just an objective category imposed by external sources.\n\nOption A seems too official and bureaucratic, focusing on how governments categorize people, which might not always match how people see themselves. Option C sounds more about racial labeling, which is related but seems different from ethnic identity, which is more about cultural and historical connections.\n\nOption D describes the nature of ethnicity as diverse and fragmented, but it doesn't directly define what ethnic identity is. It's more about the characteristics of ethnicity in general.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, talks about a \"felt sense of group membership,\" which aligns with the idea that ethnic identity is something people feel and identify with based on shared attributes like religion, language, or history.\n\nSo, I think option B is the best answer here. It captures the personal and subjective aspect of ethnic identity, which I believe is key to understanding what it really means.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider again. If ethnic identity were just about objective categories used in censuses, that would be too narrow, because people might identify with ethnic groups that aren't recognized by their government, or they might identify with multiple groups.\n\nSimilarly, if it were about the imposition of racial labels, that would focus more on how others see you rather than how you see yourself.\n\nAnd the fragmented and pluralistic nature of ethnicity is more about the complexity of ethnic relationships and identities in society, not specifically about what ethnic identity is.\n\nTherefore, the felt sense of group membership based on religion, language, or history seems to be the most accurate definition of ethnic identity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
