So, I need to think about how their money changes over time.\n\nThey start with $2000, and every day they spend $150. So, after one day, they would have $2000 minus $150, which is $1850. After two days, they would spend another $150, so it would be $1850 minus $150, which is $1700, and so on.\n\nSo, for each day that passes, they subtract $150 from their initial amount. If x represents the number of days, then the total amount spent after x days would be $150 multiplied by x, which is 150x.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money they have left after x days would be the initial amount minus the total amount spent, which is 2000 minus 150x.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1850x\n\nB. 2000 \u2212150x\n\nC. 150x\n\nD. 2000 +150x\n\nOption B matches what I just figured out: 2000 minus 150x.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. If they spend $150 each day, then after x days, they spend 150x dollars. So, starting with $2000, they would have 2000 - 150x left.\n\nOption A is 1850x, which would represent 1850 multiplied by x, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption C is 150x, which is the total amount spent, but we need the amount left, not spent.\n\nOption D is 2000 + 150x, which would mean they are adding money each day, but they are actually spending money, so it should be subtraction, not addition.\n\nSo, definitely, option B is the correct expression: 2000 \u2212 150x.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's plug in a value for x and see if it makes sense. Suppose x = 1 day.\n\nAmount left = 2000 - 150(1) = 2000 - 150 = 1850, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nIf x = 2 days,\n\nAmount left = 2000 - 150(2) = 2000 - 300 = 1700, which also matches.\n\nSo, yes, the expression that represents how much money they had after x days is 2000 minus 150x.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
