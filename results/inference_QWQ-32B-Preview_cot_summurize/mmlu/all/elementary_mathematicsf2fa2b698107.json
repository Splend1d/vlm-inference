                    "text": "Let's see which situation can be represented by the fraction 20/8. I'll go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Leslie spent 20 dollars and 8 cents at a store. How is the amount of money Leslie spent written as a fraction?\n\nSo, 20 dollars and 8 cents is the same as 20.08 dollars. To write this as a fraction, I need to express 20.08 as a fraction. 20.08 is equal to 20 and 8/100, which simplifies to 20 and 2/25, or as an improper fraction, (20 * 25 + 2)/25 = 502/25. That's not equal to 20/8, so this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B: Mr. Kramer\u2019s 8 grandchildren shared 20 crackers equally. How many crackers did each grandchild get?\n\nHere, we're dividing 20 crackers among 8 grandchildren. So, each grandchild gets 20 divided by 8 crackers, which is 20/8. This seems like a match.\n\nOption C: Mitch bought 20 containers of flowers at a plant store. Each container had 8 flowers in it. How many flowers did Mitch buy?\n\nIn this case, Mitch bought 20 containers, each with 8 flowers. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply 20 by 8, which is 160 flowers. This is a multiplication problem, not division, so it doesn't represent the fraction 20/8.\n\nOption D: Stamps are sold in booklets of 20 stamps. Donna used 8 stamps to send invitations for a party. How many booklets of stamps did Donna use to send her invitations?\n\nDonna used 8 stamps, and each booklet has 20 stamps. To find out how many booklets she used, we divide 8 by 20, which is 8/20, or simplified, 2/5. That's not the same as 20/8.\n\nSo, the only option that represents the fraction 20/8 is option B, where 20 crackers are shared among 8 grandchildren.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
