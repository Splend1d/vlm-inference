                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here. A defendant set fire to a homeowner's house that was occupied, and unfortunately, the homeowner's daughter died in the fire. The defendant was charged with two things: felony murder and arson. The jury found him guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. Now, the defendant's attorney wants to have that guilty verdict for felony murder set aside. So, we need to figure out which option is most likely correct.\n\nLet's break this down. First, what's felony murder? Felony murder is when someone dies during the commission of a dangerous felony, and the person committing the felony can be charged with murder, even if they didn't directly cause the death or intended for someone to die.\n\nIn this case, the felony in question is arson, which is the crime of deliberately setting fire to someone's property. So, the idea is that during the commission of arson, someone died, and therefore, it's felony murder.\n\nNow, the jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. That seems a bit contradictory, right? Because felony murder is based on the underlying felony, which here is arson.\n\nThis inconsistency might be why the attorney wants to have the felony murder conviction set aside. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.\n\nB. Granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.\n\nC. Denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.\n\nD. Denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.\n\nOkay, so options A and B suggest that the motion should be granted, while C and D suggest it should be denied.\n\nLet's think about option A first. It says that the guilty verdict is plain error affecting constitutional rights. What constitutes plain error? It's usually a clear and obvious mistake that affects the defendant's rights in a significant way.\n\nIn this case, the inconsistency in the verdicts might be seen as an error, but is it plain and does it adversely affect constitutional rights? Well, the constitution guarantees a fair trial, and inconsistent verdicts might suggest that the jury didn't fully understand the charges or made a mistake.\n\nHowever, inconsistent verdicts are not uncommon, and the law generally allows them. For example, it's possible for a defendant to be convicted of a greater offense but acquitted of a lesser included offense, and that hasn't been seen as automatically reversible error.\n\nSo, I'm not sure if this would qualify as plain error affecting constitutional rights. Maybe it's stretching it a bit.\n\nOption B says that the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges. This seems interesting. If the felony murder conviction relies on the underlying felony of arson, and the jury found the defendant not guilty of arson, then how can they be guilty of felony murder?\n\nIt seems like there's an inconsistency here. In legal terms, felony murder requires that the defendant committed a felony that resulted in death. If they're not guilty of the underlying felony, then how can they be guilty of felony murder?\n\nThis might be a stronger argument for granting the motion.\n\nOption C says that the motion should be denied because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error. This suggests that, despite the inconsistency, it's not enough to overturn the felony murder conviction.\n\nBut, if the felony murder conviction is based on the arson, and the jury found the defendant not guilty of arson, then shouldn't that affect the felony murder conviction?\n\nOption D says that the motion should be denied because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek appellate review for a non-constitutional error. This suggests that any error here is not constitutional in nature and should be addressed through the appeals process.\n\nBut again, if there's a fundamental inconsistency in the verdicts that calls into question the validity of the felony murder conviction, maybe it should be addressed at this stage.\n\nLet me try to find some case law or legal principles that might apply here.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, inconsistent verdicts are allowed, especially when the jury could have based their decisions on different interpretations of the facts.\n\nFor example, maybe the jury believed that the defendant set fire to the house but didn't intend to commit arson, or that the fire wasn't intentional in the way required for arson, but still, the act constituted a felony that led to death.\n\nHowever, in this specific case, arson is the underlying felony for the felony murder charge. If the jury found the defendant not guilty of arson, then it seems logically inconsistent to convict them of felony murder based on that same arson.\n\nI think this points towards option B being correct: the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.\n\nWait a minute, but does it have to lead to an acquittal of both charges? Maybe it's just that the felony murder conviction should be set aside because it's based on the arson, which the jury found the defendant not guilty of.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arson conviction could be set aside, but the felony murder stands if there's another underlying felony that the jury could have found the defendant guilty of.\n\nBut in this case, the only felony mentioned is arson.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the jury made a mistake, and the court should correct it by setting aside the felony murder conviction.\n\nI think that's what the motion is seeking: to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge.\n\nSo, considering that, and given the inconsistency, it seems like the motion should be granted.\n\nTherefore, options A or B might be correct.\n\nOption A focuses on plain error and constitutional rights, while option B focuses on legal inconsistency leading to acquittal.\n\nI think option B is more directly applicable here because it addresses the legal inconsistency in the verdicts.\n\nOption A might be reaching too far by invoking constitutional rights, unless you can argue that the inconsistency deprives the defendant of due process or a fair trial.\n\nBut, generally, inconsistent verdicts are allowed, and it's up to the jury to decide which charges to convict on.\n\nHowever, in some cases, especially where one conviction logically depends on the other, there might be an issue.\n\nIn this case, felony murder depends on the commission of the underlying felony, which is arson.\n\nIf the jury finds the defendant not guilty of arson, it's hard to see how they can be guilty of felony murder based on that arson.\n\nTherefore, the motion to set aside the felony murder conviction should be granted due to the legal inconsistency.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nOption C says the motion should be denied because the verdicts do not amount to reversible error.\n\nBut if the inconsistency is such that it invalidates the felony murder conviction, then it is a reversible error.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D suggests that the defendant should seek appellate review for a non-constitutional error.\n\nBut if the error is significant enough to require the conviction to be set aside, it should be addressed at this stage rather than waiting for appeal.\n\nMoreover, appellate review might not necessarily lead to reversal, and time is of the essence in these matters.\n\nTherefore, option D is less appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, option B is most likely correct: the motion should be granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
