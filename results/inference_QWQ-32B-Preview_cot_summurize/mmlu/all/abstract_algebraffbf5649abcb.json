                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K| / |H \u2229 K|.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what HK represents. HK is the set of all products hk where h is in H and k is in K. So, HK = {hk | h \u2208 H, k \u2208 K}.\n\nNow, the formula |HK| = |H||K| / |H \u2229 K| is familiar from group theory, but I need to confirm under what conditions it holds.\n\nI think this formula is true when HK is a subgroup of G, or more generally, when one of H or K is a normal subgroup of G. But is it always true for any two subgroups H and K of G?\n\nLet me think of a counterexample. Suppose G is the Klein four-group, which is Z2 \u00d7 Z2. Let H = {(0,0), (1,0)} and K = {(0,0), (0,1)}. Then H and K are both subgroups of G.\n\nNow, HK would be {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)}, which is all of G, so |HK| = 4.\n\nAlso, |H| = 2, |K| = 2, and |H \u2229 K| = 1, since only (0,0) is in both H and K.\n\nPlugging into the formula: |HK| = (2 * 2) / 1 = 4, which matches |G| = 4.\n\nSo in this case, the formula holds.\n\nLet me try another example. Consider G = S3, the symmetric group on 3 elements. Let H be the subgroup generated by (12), so H = {id, (12)}, and let K be the subgroup generated by (13), so K = {id, (13)}.\n\nThen HK = {id, (12), (13), (12)(13) = (132)}.\n\nSo |HK| = 4.\n\nNow, |H| = 2, |K| = 2, and |H \u2229 K| = 1 (only the identity is in both).\n\nSo according to the formula, |HK| should be (2*2)/1 = 4, which matches.\n\nAnother example: Let G = Z4 \u00d7 Z2, where Z4 is the cyclic group of order 4 and Z2 is of order 2.\n\nLet H = {(0,0), (2,0)} and K = {(0,0), (0,1)}.\n\nThen HK = {(0,0), (2,0), (0,1), (2,1)}, so |HK| = 4.\n\n|H| = 2, |K| = 2, |H \u2229 K| = 1, so (2*2)/1 = 4, which matches.\n\nSeems like the formula holds in these cases.\n\nBut let's try a case where H and K are not normal.\n\nTake G = S3 again. Let H = {id, (123), (132)}, which is A3, and K = {id, (12)}.\n\nThen HK = {id, (123), (132), (12), (123)(12) = (13), (132)(12) = (23)}.\n\nSo HK = S3, which has 6 elements.\n\n|H| = 3, |K| = 2, |H \u2229 K| = 1, so (3*2)/1 = 6, which matches.\n\nAnother example: G = D4, the dihedral group of order 8.\n\nLet H be the rotation subgroup, H = {r0, r90, r180, r270}, and K = {r0, s}, where s is a reflection.\n\nThen HK = {r0, r90, r180, r270, s, r90s, r180s, r270s}, which is all of D4.\n\n|H| = 4, |K| = 2, |H \u2229 K| = 1 (assuming s is not a rotation), so (4*2)/1 = 8, which matches.\n\nHmm, seems consistent.\n\nWait, is there a case where this formula fails?\n\nLet me think about when H and K are not subgroups, but that's not possible since the statement assumes they are subgroups.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in non-abelian groups, but my examples include non-abelian groups and the formula seems to hold.\n\nPerhaps there's a specific case where HK is not a subgroup, but in the formula, we're just considering the set HK, not necessarily a subgroup.\n\nWait, in group theory, even if HK is not a subgroup, the formula |HK| = |H||K| / |H \u2229 K| still holds, as long as H and K are subgroups.\n\nI recall that in general, for subgroups H and K of G, |HK| = |H||K| / |H \u2229 K|, regardless of whether HK is a subgroup or not.\n\nSo, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\n**Statement 2:** A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nOkay, let's recall some group theory here.\n\nFirst, p is an odd prime, so p \u2265 3.\n\nA group of order 2p, where p is prime, has order that is the product of two distinct primes, 2 and p.\n\nThere is a theorem that says that a group of order pq, where p and q are primes and p < q, and p does not divide q-1, is cyclic.\n\nIn this case, p is odd, so p \u2265 3, and 2 is the smaller prime.\n\nSo, p does not divide q-1 translates to p does not divide 2-1 = 1, which it doesn't, since p \u2265 3.\n\nTherefore, by that theorem, a group of order 2p should be cyclic.\n\nBut Statement 2 says it is either cyclic or isomorphic to D_p, the dihedral group of order 2p.\n\nWait, but according to that theorem, it should be cyclic.\n\nIs there a gap here?\n\nLet me check the conditions again.\n\nThe theorem states: If G is a group of order pq, where p and q are primes, p < q, and p does not divide q-1, then G is cyclic.\n\nIn our case, p is odd, so p \u2265 3, and 2 < p.\n\nWait, no, p is the larger prime here, since p is odd and greater than or equal to 3, and 2 is the smaller prime.\n\nWait, hold on.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nIn the standard theorem, if p and q are primes with p < q, and p does not divide q-1, then a group of order pq is cyclic.\n\nIn our case, the order is 2p, with 2 < p, and 2 does not divide p-1 (since p is odd, p-1 is even, so 2 divides p-1).\n\nWait, but p is odd, so p-1 is even, meaning 2 divides p-1.\n\nSo, in this case, the condition \"p does not divide q-1\" is not satisfied because 2 divides p-1.\n\nTherefore, the theorem does not apply, and a group of order 2p may not necessarily be cyclic.\n\nIn fact, there are two possibilities for a group of order 2p:\n\n1. It is cyclic, isomorphic to Z_{2p}.\n\n2. It is dihedral, isomorphic to D_p.\n\nThis is a standard result in group theory.\n\nFor example, when p=3, groups of order 6 are either cyclic (Z6) or isomorphic to S3, which is D3.\n\nSimilarly, for p=5, groups of order 10 are either cyclic (Z10) or dihedral (D5).\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
