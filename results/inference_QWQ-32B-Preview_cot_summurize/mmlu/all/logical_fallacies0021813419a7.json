Let's see:\n\nOption A says it's about arguing that something should be done because that's the way it's been done in the past. Hmm, that sounds more like an appeal to tradition, doesn't it? I think _ad nauseam_ is different.\n\nOption B is about arguing that an act should be carried out because it won't have significant consequences, and there's no evidence of the effects. This seems more like an appeal to ignorance or something. Not sure if that's _ad nauseam_.\n\nOption C says it's about reasoning that a conclusion is true because it's been claimed so often. Oh, that sounds familiar. _Ad nauseam_ means something like \"to the point of sickness,\" right? So, maybe it's about repeating something so many times that people get sick of it, and then accepting it as true because of repetition. That makes sense.\n\nOption D is about claiming something is true because many people believe it. That sounds like an appeal to popularity or consensus, not _ad nauseam_.\n\nSo, based on this, I think option C is the correct definition of the _ad nauseam_ fallacy. It's when someone keeps repeating a claim so often that people accept it as true just because they've heard it so many times.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm misremembering. _Ad nauseam_ does indeed mean \"to the point of nausea,\" so it's about repeating something excessively. In arguments, this would mean repeating a claim over and over until people accept it, not because it's true, but because they're tired of hearing it.\n\nYes, that aligns with option C. Arguing that a conclusion is true because it's been claimed so often.\n\nOption A seems more like tradition-based arguments, which is different. Option B sounds like ignoring evidence or assuming something is safe because there's no proof it's harmful, which is a different fallacy. Option D is clearly the bandwagon fallacy.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
