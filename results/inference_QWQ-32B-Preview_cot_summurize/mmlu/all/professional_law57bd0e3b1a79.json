                    "text": "On June 1, an owner of a business that built mobile homes was visited by a representative of a company that manufactured propane tanks. Propane tanks were an essential component of the mobile homes produced by the builder. The representative told the owner that the company could supply propane tanks at $50 per tank, a substantial savings over what the owner currently paid for propane tanks. The owner asked if the company could supply 1,000 propane tanks by the end of the month, and the representative assured him that they could. The owner stated that he would think about it and decide what to do within a week. On June 3, the owner sent the following memo to the company headquarters at the address provided by the representative: \"I am happy to confirm my order of 1,000 propane tanks, to be delivered by June 30. I have always received a 10 percent discount for cash payment, so I will assume you will grant me the same discount. I will have $45,000 cash ready to give to your representative at the time of delivery. \"On June 30, the company delivered 1,000 propane tanks to the owner. The representative accompanied the delivery and presented the owner with a bill for $50,000. The owner refused to pay any more than$45,000. Which of the following accurately states the legal rights of the parties?\n\nA. The contract price was $45,000, because the June 3 memo was an effective integration of their agreement.\nB. The contract price was $45,000, because the company did not specifically object to the 10 percent discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo.\nC. The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.\nD. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this contract problem. So, there's a business owner who builds mobile homes, and he needs propane tanks for them. A representative from a propane tank company comes by and offers to supply tanks at $50 each, which is cheaper than what the owner is currently paying. The owner asks if they can supply 1,000 tanks by the end of the month, and the rep says yes. The owner says he'll think about it and let them know in a week.\n\nThen, on June 3, the owner sends a memo to the company headquarters confirming the order of 1,000 propane tanks to be delivered by June 30. He also mentions that he always gets a 10% discount for cash payment and assumes they'll grant him the same discount. He says he'll have $45,000 ready in cash for the delivery.\n\nOn June 30, the company delivers the tanks and presents a bill for $50,000, but the owner refuses to pay more than $45,000.\n\nNow, I need to determine the legal rights of the parties based on the options given.\n\nOption A says the contract price was $45,000 because the June 3 memo was an effective integration of their agreement.\n\nAn integration means that the written memo is the complete and final agreement between the parties. If it's an integration, then any prior oral agreements or offers are superseded by the written memo.\n\nIn this case, the memo seems pretty straightforward: ordering 1,000 tanks to be delivered by June 30, assuming a 10% discount, and preparing $45,000 in cash.\n\nBut I need to consider whether this memo is an effective integration. For a writing to be an integration, it should be intended by the parties to be the final expression of their agreement.\n\nHere, the owner is confirming his order and stating his assumptions about the discount. However, he hasn't yet received a response from the company accepting those terms.\n\nSo, while the memo seems comprehensive, it might not be considered an integration unless the company accepts those terms.\n\nOption B says the contract price was $45,000 because the company didn't specifically object to the 10% discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo.\n\nThis seems related to the concept of acceptance of terms. If the company delivers the tanks without objecting to the discount, it might be seen as accepting the owner's terms.\n\nHowever, the company did present a bill for $50,000, which suggests they don't accept the discount. So, their action of delivering the tanks might not constitute acceptance of the discount term.\n\nOption C says the contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.\n\nThis relates to the concept of counter-offers. If the owner's memo adds a new term (the discount) that wasn't part of the original offer, it could be seen as a counter-offer.\n\nIf the company doesn't accept this counter-offer, the original offer remains, and the contract would be at $50,000 per tank.\n\nOption D says the contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer didn't expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\n\nThis seems to suggest that regardless of what the owner's memo says, the contract is based on the original offer of $50 per tank.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option C is the most accurate.\n\nThe company made an offer: 1,000 propane tanks at $50 each, deliverable by June 30.\n\nThe owner's memo can be seen as a counter-offer: accepting the offer but adding a term for a 10% discount, making the price $45,000.\n\nSince the company delivered the tanks but billed for $50,000, they didn't accept the counter-offer's terms.\n\nTherefore, the contract would be based on the original offer of $50 per tank, totaling $50,000, especially if the discount term materially altered the original terms.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
