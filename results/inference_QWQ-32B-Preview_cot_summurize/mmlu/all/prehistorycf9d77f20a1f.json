                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the pharaoh's rule, but I'm not entirely sure about the correct population numbers and the percentage of farmers. The options are:\n\nA. 100,000; 25%\n\nB. 1,000,000; 50%\n\nC. 3,000,000; 75%\n\nD. 5,000,000; 100%\n\nI remember that in ancient Egypt, agriculture was a major part of the economy, so I'm guessing a high percentage of the population would have been farmers. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.\n\nLet me think about the time period we're talking about. The term \"pharaoh\" refers to the rulers of ancient Egypt, right? So, this could be referring to any period in ancient Egyptian history, but I think it's probably about the Old, Middle, or New Kingdom periods when pharaohs had significant power.\n\nI know that ancient Egypt was heavily dependent on the Nile River for farming, and the population was concentrated along the Nile Valley and Delta. But I don't recall the exact population figures.\n\nMaybe I should consider the percentage first. Option D says 100% were farmers, which seems unlikely because there were certainly craftsmen, soldiers, priests, and other professions in ancient Egypt. So, I can probably rule out D.\n\nOption A says 25% were farmers. That seems too low because, in ancient societies, a larger portion of the population was involved in agriculture to feed everyone.\n\nOption B suggests 50% were farmers, which might be possible, but I suspect it's higher.\n\nOption C says 75% were farmers. That seems more plausible, given the agricultural basis of the economy.\n\nBut to be sure, I should try to recall or look up the approximate population of ancient Egypt during the pharaonic period.\n\nI think during the New Kingdom period, around the time of Ramses II, the population might have been around 1 to 2 million people. But I'm not certain.\n\nIf I consider that, then option B with 1,000,000 people might be plausible, but option C with 3,000,000 seems too high.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider a different time period. I've read that at its height, the population of ancient Egypt could have been as high as 5 million, but I think that might be an overestimate.\n\nI recall that some historians estimate the population of Egypt during the New Kingdom to be around 3 to 5 million. If that's the case, then option C with 3,000,000 might be possible, but option D with 5,000,000 seems too high.\n\nHowever, I also remember that the population wasn't uniformly distributed; most people lived in the Nile Valley and Delta, with vast desert areas sparsely populated.\n\nNow, considering the percentage of farmers, in pre-industrial societies, a large portion of the population was engaged in agriculture. For example, in medieval Europe, around 80-90% of the population were farmers.\n\nGiven that ancient Egypt was an agricultural society based on irrigation, it's likely that a similar percentage were farmers.\n\nSo, if I compare the options, A with 25% seems way too low, B with 50% is probably insufficient, C with 75% is more plausible, and D with 100% is clearly unrealistic.\n\nBut wait, if 75% were farmers, that would leave 25% for other professions. In ancient societies, there were artisans, scribes, priests, soldiers, and administrators. So, 25% seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was higher than 75%. But given that ancient Egyptian society had a complex bureaucracy and a significant religious sector, 25% non-farmers seems acceptable.\n\nNow, considering the population number, if I had to guess, I'd say that 3,000,000 is a plausible estimate for the population under the pharaoh's rule at its height.\n\nOption A with 100,000 seems too small, even for an earlier dynasty.\n\nOption B with 1,000,000 might be possible for an earlier period, but during the New Kingdom, it was likely higher.\n\nOption D with 5,000,000 seems too high, unless it was a much later period.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: 3,000,000 people, with 75% being farmers.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any historical data or estimates that can confirm this.\n\nI recall that some historians estimate the population of ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom to be around 3 to 5 million. For instance, during the reign of Ramses II, estimates range from 2 to 5 million.\n\nAs for the percentage of farmers, in ancient societies, it's generally accepted that a large majority were engaged in agriculture.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems the most reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is referring to an earlier Old Kingdom period, the population might have been lower, perhaps around 1 million, but I think the question is likely referring to the peak period of pharaonic power, which was the New Kingdom.\n\nTherefore, I will go with option C: 3,000,000 people, with 75% being farmers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
