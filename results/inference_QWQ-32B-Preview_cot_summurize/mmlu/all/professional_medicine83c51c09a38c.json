He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?\n\nA. Carvedilol\nB. Furosemide\nC. Metoprolol\nD. Phentolamine\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out the best next step for this patient. He's 25, came in with chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine for the first time. His chest pain is pretty severe, and it's radiating to his left arm. He doesn't have any medical history, and he's not on any medications or other drugs. His vitals show he's hypertensive with a blood pressure of 200/100, and he's tachycardic at 110 bpm. His oxygen saturation is 95% on room air, which isn't too bad, but he's diaphoretic, so he's sweating a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's causing his symptoms. He used cocaine for the first time, which can have various effects on the body, especially the cardiovascular system. Cocaine can cause vasoconstriction, which increases blood pressure and heart rate, and it can also cause coronary arteries to spasm, leading to chest pain similar to angina.\n\nGiven that, his ECG shows sinus tachycardia but no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities, which might suggest that he's not having a heart attack, at least not an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, he's still in a lot of pain and short of breath, and the treatments they've given him so far\u2014oxygen, aspirin, nitroglycerin, and lorazepam\u2014aren't fully relieving his symptoms.\n\nSo, I need to think about what else can be done. The options provided are carvedilol, furosemide, metoprolol, and phentolamine.\n\nLet's consider each one:\n\nA. Carvedilol: This is a beta-blocker with alpha-blocking properties. Beta-blockers can be useful in hypertension and in reducing heart rate and oxygen demand, which might help with chest pain. However, given that the patient just used cocaine, which can cause coronary vasospasm, and considering that beta-blockers can exacerbate vasospasm by not being able to counteract the alpha-adrenergic effects of cocaine, they might not be the best choice here.\n\nB. Furosemide: This is a loop diuretic used to reduce fluid overload, which can help in heart failure or hypertension. However, in this acute setting, especially with a hypertensive emergency, furosemide might not be the quickest or most effective way to lower blood pressure. Also, the patient doesn't show signs of fluid overload.\n\nC. Metoprolol: Another beta-blocker, similar to carvedilol but without the alpha-blocking properties. Again, concerns about exacerbating coronary vasospasm due to lack of alpha blockade.\n\nD. Phentolamine: This is an alpha-adrenergic blocker. It can counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine by blocking alpha receptors, which might help to dilate blood vessels and reduce blood pressure. It could also potentially alleviate coronary vasospasm.\n\nConsidering that the patient is hypertensive and has chest pain possibly due to coronary vasospasm from cocaine use, an alpha-blocker like phentolamine might be the most appropriate choice here. It can help to reverse the vasoconstriction caused by cocaine and potentially relieve the chest pain.\n\nBeta-blockers, like carvedilol and metoprolol, might not be the best option because they could worsen vasospasm by not addressing the alpha-adrenergic effects of cocaine. Furosemide might not be as effective in this acute hypertensive situation for rapid blood pressure reduction.\n\nTherefore, I think the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time is phentolamine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
