LSB, Least Significant Bit; B. MSB, Most Significant Bit; C. First Bit; D. Last Bit. Hmm, let's see.\n\nI know that in binary, numbers are represented using only 0s and 1s. Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the right. So, the rightmost bit is 2^0, which is 1, then 2^1 which is 2, and so on, moving leftward.\n\nNow, the question is about the first digit from right to left. That would be the rightmost bit, which is 2^0. I think that's called the Least Significant Bit, or LSB. Let me confirm that.\n\nThe Least Significant Bit is the bit that has the smallest value in the number, which is indeed the rightmost bit. On the other hand, the Most Significant Bit, or MSB, is the leftmost bit, which has the highest value in the number.\n\nSo, according to this, option A, LSB, seems correct. But let's make sure none of the other options make more sense.\n\nOption B is MSB, which is the most significant bit, and that's the leftmost bit, not the rightmost one. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption C is \"First Bit.\" Well, \"first\" could be subjective. If you're reading from right to left, it's the first bit you encounter, but in terms of the overall number, the leftmost bit is often considered the first bit. But in programming and computer science, sometimes the rightmost bit is referred to as the least significant bit. So, \"First Bit\" isn't a standard term in this context.\n\nOption D is \"Last Bit.\" If you're reading from left to right, the rightmost bit would be the last bit. But again, in technical terms, it's more precise to call it the LSB.\n\nGiven this, I think the best answer is A. LSB, Least Significant Bit. It's the standard terminology used in computer science and digital electronics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
