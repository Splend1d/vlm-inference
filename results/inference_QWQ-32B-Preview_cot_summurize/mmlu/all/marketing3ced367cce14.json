I need to know which phase of the business cycle that corresponds to. The options are Expansion, Peak, Recovery, and Trough.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the business cycle is. I know it's a periodic fluctuation in the economy, moving between periods of expansion and contraction. Expansion is when the economy is growing, and contraction is when it's slowing down.\n\nDuring expansion, businesses are doing well, hiring more people, and the unemployment rate is low. So, that's not the phase with high business failures and unemployment.\n\nPeak is the highest point of the business cycle, where the economy is at its strongest. After the peak, the economy starts to contract. But at the peak, things are still good, so probably not the phase with high failures and unemployment.\n\nRecovery is when the economy is starting to improve after a downturn. Unemployment is decreasing, and businesses are recovering. So, that's not the phase with high failures and unemployment either.\n\nTrough is the lowest point of the business cycle, where the economy has finished contracting and is about to start expanding again. At this point, businesses have failed, unemployment is high, and the economy is at its weakest.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the trough is the phase with high levels of business failures and unemployment.\n\nWait, but I should make sure. Let me think again.\n\nIn expansion, things are good.\n\nAt peak, things are still good but about to turn downward.\n\nIn recovery, things are getting better.\n\nIn trough, things are at their worst.\n\nSo, yes, trough seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check if there's any confusion between trough and recovery.\n\nIn recovery, unemployment is decreasing, but it's still higher than in expansion. However, it's not as bad as in the trough.\n\nSimilarly, in the trough, unemployment is at its highest, and many businesses have failed.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. Trough.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
