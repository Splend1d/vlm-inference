                    "text": "Let's see. So in this rock opera, Tommy becomes deaf and blind after witnessing a terrible murder, but there's nothing physically wrong with his ears or eyes. So, he's not deaf and blind because of some medical condition; it's more like his mind is causing these symptoms. That sounds pretty interesting.\n\nI need to figure out which disorder among the options best describes what's happening to Tommy. Let's look at each one:\n\nA. Panic disorder: That's when someone has sudden episodes of intense fear that trigger severe physical reactions, like heart palpitations, sweating, shaking, and a feeling of impending doom. But in Tommy's case, he's experiencing deafness and blindness, which don't seem directly related to panic attacks. So, maybe not this one.\n\nB. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): This is a disorder that can develop after someone experiences or witnesses a traumatic event, like war, assault, or, in this case, a murder. Symptoms can include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. While Tommy did witness a terrible murder, the symptoms he's exhibiting are deafness and blindness, which don't directly match the typical symptoms of PTSD. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nC. Conversion disorder: This is a condition where physical symptoms, such as paralysis or blindness, occur in response to emotional distress or trauma, but there's no underlying physical cause. The symptoms are real and not intentionally produced. This sounds a lot like what's happening to Tommy. He's experiencing deafness and blindness after a traumatic event, even though there's nothing organically wrong with his senses. This seems promising.\n\nD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): This is characterized by recurrent obsessions and/or compulsions that are time-consuming or cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Obsessions are intrusive thoughts, and compulsions are repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing the anxiety caused by the obsessions. Again, Tommy's symptoms don't seem to align with OCD; he's not exhibiting obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors.\n\nComparing all these options, conversion disorder seems to fit best with Tommy's symptoms. He's experiencing physical symptoms (deafness and blindness) in response to a traumatic event, without any organic cause. So, I think the answer is C. Conversion disorder.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if PTSD could also be a factor here. Sometimes, PTSD can present with a variety of symptoms, including dissociative symptoms, where a person might feel detached from themselves or their surroundings. However, deafness and blindness aren't typical symptoms of PTSD. Conversion disorder, on the other hand, specifically involves the conversion of emotional distress into physical symptoms.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that conversion disorder is the most appropriate answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
