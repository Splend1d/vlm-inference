                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which category of voters would be least likely to vote. Let me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A is blue-collar workers who belong to a union. Blue-collar workers are often involved in manual labor, and being part of a union typically means they have a collective voice in their workplace. Unions often encourage their members to vote, especially in elections that could affect labor rights and benefits. So, I think these voters might be pretty motivated to vote.\n\nOption B is professionals. Professionals are usually educated and have stable jobs, which might mean they have the time and resources to participate in elections. Education levels are often linked to higher voting rates, so I guess this group is likely to vote.\n\nOption C is voters who are active in their political parties. If someone is active in a political party, they probably care a lot about politics and elections. They might even work to get out the vote for their party, so it's safe to say they themselves would vote.\n\nOption D is voters aged 18-29. This is the youngest group of voters, and statistically, younger voters tend to have lower voting rates compared to older voters. There could be various reasons for this, such as being new to voting, having less established voting habits, or feeling less connected to the political process.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems like voters aged 18-29 would be the least likely to vote. The other groups either have incentives to vote or are more likely to be engaged in the political process.\n\nSo, my answer is D. Voters aged 18-29.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
