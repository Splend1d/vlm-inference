It consists of two protons and two neutrons bound together, which is identical to the nucleus of a helium-4 atom. Alpha particles are commonly emitted in the process of alpha decay, a type of radioactive decay where an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle and transforms into a new nucleus with a mass number reduced by four and an atomic number reduced by two.\n\nOption A, an electron, is a different subatomic particle with a negative charge and is much lighter than a proton or neutron. Option C, a positron, is the antiparticle of an electron, having the same mass but a positive charge. Option D, a cosmic ray, refers to high-energy particles originating from space, which can include protons, electrons, and atomic nuclei, but is not specifically an alpha particle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Another name for a helium nucleus."
