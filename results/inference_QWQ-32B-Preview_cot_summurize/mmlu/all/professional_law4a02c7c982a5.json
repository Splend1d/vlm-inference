Among the purposes of the statute are the prevention of theft of boats in coastal waters and the protection of the rights of individual boat owners throughout the United States. Congress enacted the statute despite the fact that all states require boat owners to register their craft with the state department of motor vehicles. In addition, there is uncontradicted evidence that most stolen boats are kept or resold in the state in which the theft occurred. Nonetheless, an increasing number of boats are transported to other states and other countries for resale. Is the statute likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because most stolen boats remain within the state in which they were stolen.\nB. No, because the registration of boats is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the constitutionality of a new federal boat registration statute. So, Congress has passed a law that requires all boat owners to register their boats with a new federal boat registry. The stated purposes are to prevent theft of boats in coastal waters and to protect the rights of boat owners across the U.S. Now, even though all states already require boat registration, there's been an increase in boats being transported and resold in other states and countries. The question is whether this federal statute is likely to be held constitutional.\n\nFirst off, I need to think about the basis for Congress enacting this law. Since it's a federal law, it has to be justified under one of Congress's enumerated powers, typically under the Commerce Clause, which allows Congress to regulate activities that affect interstate commerce.\n\nOption A says no, because most stolen boats remain within the state where they were stolen. But just because most stolen boats stay in the same state doesn't necessarily mean that the federal interest is lacking. If there's an increasing trend of boats being transported and sold across state lines, that could still impact interstate commerce.\n\nOption B says no, because boat registration is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment. The Tenth Amendment says that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states or the people. While states traditionally regulate boat registration, if there's a valid federal interest, Congress can still regulate in that area, especially if it relates to interstate commerce.\n\nOption C says yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce. This seems promising. If stolen boats are being transported across state lines, that's clearly affecting interstate commerce, and Congress has the power to regulate such activities to prevent harm.\n\nOption D says yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare. This refers to the General Welfare Clause, but it's important to note that while Congress has broad powers to promote the general welfare, especially when combined with its spending power, in this case, it's more directly related to the Commerce Clause, since it involves regulation of boat registration in relation to interstate commerce.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is the strongest argument for the constitutionality of the statute. Congress can regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, and if stolen boats are being transported across state lines, that fits within that framework.\n\nBut let's consider option A again. Just because most stolen boats stay in the same state doesn't mean that the federal regulation is unwarranted. The fact that there's an increasing number being transported elsewhere suggests that there is an interstate commerce issue here that Congress could validly address.\n\nOption B mentions state's rights and the Tenth Amendment, but the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate activities that affect interstate commerce, even if states have traditionally regulated those activities. So, while states do regulate boat registration, that doesn't preclude federal regulation in this area.\n\nOption D is a bit broad. While Congress does have the power to regulate for the general welfare, especially through spending, in this case, it's more about regulatory power under the Commerce Clause.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
