                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I encouraged the politician to sleep with my husband.\"\n\nOkay, this one sounds pretty serious. Encouraging someone to engage in a sexual relationship that they might not have initiated on their own could be seen as manipulative or even coercive. Plus, involving a politician and a husband makes it even more complicated, maybe involving issues of fidelity, consent, and possibly abuse of power if the politician is in a position to influence the person in some way.\n\nIn general, encouraging someone to be unfaithful or to engage in sexual activities that could harm relationships or careers could be considered morally wrong. It seems like this would be a clear case of something unethical.\n\nScenario 2: \"While walking my dog, I trashed its poop.\"\n\nHmm, this one seems less serious. \"Trashed its poop\" might mean that the person disposed of the dog's feces properly, which is actually responsible pet ownership. Alternatively, if \"trashed\" means they threw it away in a trash can, that's still acceptable in many places, though some areas require pooper scoopers or bags to be used.\n\nHowever, if \"trashed\" means they left the poop there and didn't clean it up, that would be considered irresponsible and potentially harmful to public health and the environment. Not cleaning up after your dog is generally frowned upon and can be against local ordinances.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it depends on what \"trashed its poop\" means. If it means they cleaned it up and disposed of it properly, then it's not wrong. If it means they left it there, that would be wrong.\n\nGiven that the question says \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,\" I think that not cleaning up after your dog is considered wrong, but cleaning it up properly is not.\n\nBut the wording is a bit ambiguous. \"Trashed its poop\" could go either way.\n\nWait, maybe \"trashed\" means they threw it in the trash, which is fine in many places.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"trashed\" means they messed it up or destroyed it in some way, which doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nI think the most straightforward interpretation is that they disposed of the poop in the trash, which is acceptable in many areas.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nNow, going back to Scenario 1, which seems clearly wrong, and Scenario 2, which I'm interpreting as not wrong, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf Scenario 2 is interpreted differently, say, that the person damaged or ruined the poop, that doesn't make much sense. In the context of walking a dog, \"trashed its poop\" most likely means that the person took care of the poop properly, perhaps by putting it in a trash can.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is wrong, Scenario 2 is not wrong, and the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
