The options are Virgo, Laniakea, Sculptor, and Bo\u00f6tes. I think I've heard of Laniakea before in relation to our galaxy, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up what each of these superclusters is known for.\n\nFirst, Virgo Supercluster: I know that the Virgo Cluster is a large cluster of galaxies about 50 million light-years away, and our Local Group is moving towards it as part of the Virgocentric flow. But is the Virgo Supercluster the same as the Laniakea Supercluster? I think Laniakea is a larger structure that includes the Virgo Supercluster.\n\nThen there's Laniakea: I recall that in 2014, astronomers introduced the concept of the Laniakea Supercluster, which is said to include the Milky Way, the Virgo Cluster, and extends to other clusters. The name Laniakea comes from Hawaiian, meaning \"immeasurable heaven.\" I think this is the one that has a diameter of around 160 megaparsecs.\n\nSculptor Supercluster: I'm not as familiar with this one. I think it's another large-scale structure in the universe, but I don't know its relation to the Milky Way.\n\nBo\u00f6tes Supercluster: Again, I'm not sure about this one. I think it's a supercluster in the Bo\u00f6tes constellation, but I don't know if it includes the Milky Way.\n\nLet me try to recall: isn't Laniakea the supercluster that includes the Milky Way, and it's described as having a diameter of about 160 megaparsecs? I think that's right. So, perhaps the answer is B. Laniakea.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check the dimensions. 160 megaparsecs is approximately 520 million light-years. Is that the size of Laniakea? I might need to look up the exact dimensions of the Laniakea Supercluster to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Virgo Supercluster is the correct answer. But I thought the Virgo Supercluster was smaller than Laniakea and is a component within Laniakea.\n\nSculptor and Bo\u00f6tes superclusters\u2014 I'm not sure if they include the Milky Way. Perhaps they are separate structures.\n\nGiven that the question specifies that the supercluster includes the Milky Way and has a diameter of 160 Mpc, I think Laniakea is the most plausible answer.\n\nSo, I'll go with B. Laniakea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
