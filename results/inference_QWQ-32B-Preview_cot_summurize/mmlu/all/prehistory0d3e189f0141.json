                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about Neandertal DNA in modern Africans. So, the statement is that modern Africans don't possess any Neandertal DNA, and we need to figure out what that indicates among the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about Neandertals and human evolution. Neandertals were a group of humans who lived in Europe and western Asia, and they coexisted with modern humans, Homo sapiens, for some time. There's evidence that modern humans and Neandertals interbred, especially in regions outside of Africa.\n\nNow, the key point here is that modern Africans don't have Neandertal DNA. So, what does that tell us?\n\nOption A says that gene flow between Neandertals and modern humans must have occurred before Neandertals migrated out of Africa. Hmm, but I thought Neandertals originated in Europe and western Asia, not in Africa. Wait, maybe I need to clarify their migration patterns.\n\nActually, Neandertals are believed to have evolved in Europe and western Asia, not in Africa. So, if they didn't originate in Africa, when would they have been in Africa to interbreed with modern humans there?\n\nOption B says that gene flow occurred after modern humans migrated out of Africa. That makes sense because Neandertals were in Europe and western Asia, so if modern humans migrated out of Africa and encountered Neandertals there, they could have interbred. Therefore, people outside of Africa might have Neandertal DNA, but those who stayed in Africa wouldn't have it because there were no Neandertals there to interbreed with.\n\nOption C suggests that Neandertals who lived in Africa didn't interbreed with modern humans but followed them out of Africa. But again, Neandertals aren't thought to have originated in Africa. So, this seems a bit confusing.\n\nOption D claims that interbreeding never occurred. But we have evidence from genetic studies that interbreeding did occur between modern humans and Neandertals, particularly in populations outside of Africa.\n\nGiven this, option B seems the most logical. Gene flow between Neandertals and modern humans occurred after modern humans migrated out of Africa, which is why people outside of Africa have some Neandertal DNA, but those in Africa do not.\n\nTo double-check, I recall that genetic studies have shown that non-African populations have around 1-4% Neandertal DNA, whereas African populations have negligible or no Neandertal DNA. This supports the idea that interbreeding happened outside of Africa.\n\nAlso, if interbreeding had occurred in Africa, then African populations should have some Neandertal DNA, which they don't. So, it's consistent with option B.\n\nOption A suggests that gene flow occurred before Neandertals migrated out of Africa, but Neandertals didn't migrate out of Africa; they evolved in Europe and western Asia. So, this option doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C is a bit muddled. It says Neandertals in Africa didn't interbreed but followed modern humans out of Africa. But again, Neandertals aren't thought to have been in Africa in significant numbers, if at all.\n\nOption D is contradicted by genetic evidence that interbreeding did occur.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans occurred after anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
