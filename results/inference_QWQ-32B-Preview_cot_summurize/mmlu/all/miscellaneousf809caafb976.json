The Eagle and the Beetle\n\nD. The Ox and the Frogs\n\nI know that Aesop's fables are famous stories with moral lessons, and they usually involve animals that can talk and act like humans. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, \"The Hare and the Tortoise.\" That's a really well-known fable where the tortoise wins a race against the hare by being slow and steady. So, that's definitely an Aesop's fable.\n\nNext, \"The Eagle and the Beetle.\" I'm not sure about this one. I think there might be a fable about an eagle, but I'm not positive about the beetle part. Maybe it's not a standard Aesop's fable.\n\nThen, \"The Ox and the Frogs.\" I recall a fable where a ox steps on a group of frogs, and it's about how even the mighty can be brought down by the weak. So, that sounds like an Aesop's fable.\n\nLastly, \"The Dog and the Squirrel.\" This one seems unfamiliar to me. I don't remember a fable with these characters. Maybe it's not an Aesop's fable.\n\nTo be honest, both A and C seem a bit unfamiliar, but since B and D are definitely Aesop's fables, perhaps A is the one that's not.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up a list of Aesop's fables to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I know that Aesop's fables have been translated and retold many times, so there might be variations or less known ones.\n\nLet me consider the characters in each story.\n\nIn \"The Hare and the Tortoise,\" the main characters are a hare and a tortoise, competing in a race.\n\nIn \"The Eagle and the Beetle,\" I'm not sure what the plot is, but eagles are often depicted as powerful birds, and beetles are small insects.\n\nIn \"The Ox and the Frogs,\" it's about an ox and frogs, probably involving the ox stepping in a pond or something.\n\nIn \"The Dog and the Squirrel,\" again, I don't recall a story with these characters.\n\nMaybe \"The Eagle and the Beetle\" is a lesser-known fable, but still part of Aesop's collection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"The Dog and the Squirrel\" is not an Aesop's fable at all.\n\nLet me try to remember if I've ever heard of a fable involving a dog and a squirrel.\n\nI don't think so. Most dog-related fables involve dogs and bones, or dogs and wolves, but not specifically with squirrels.\n\nOn the other hand, \"The Eagle and the Beetle\" might be a story where the eagle looks down on the beetle, but the beetle somehow outsmarts the eagle.\n\nThat could be a possible fable, but I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider that \"The Dog and the Squirrel\" is not an Aesop's fable, while \"The Eagle and the Beetle\" might be a less known one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both A and C are Aesop's fables, and D is not.\n\nWait, but D is \"The Ox and the Frogs,\" which I think is a known fable.\n\nI'm getting confused now.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll eliminate the ones I know are Aesop's fables.\n\nI know \"The Hare and the Tortoise\" is definitely an Aesop's fable.\n\n\"The Ox and the Frogs\" also seems familiar as an Aesop's fable.\n\nSo, between A and C, perhaps one of them is not.\n\nIf I had to choose, I would say \"The Dog and the Squirrel\" is not an Aesop's fable.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider the morals of the stories.\n\nFor \"The Hare and the Tortoise,\" the moral is that slow and steady wins the race.\n\nFor \"The Ox and the Frogs,\" it might be about how the mighty can be humbled by the weak.\n\nFor \"The Eagle and the Beetle,\" perhaps it's about not underestimating others based on appearance.\n\nAnd for \"The Dog and the Squirrel,\" I have no idea what the moral would be.\n\nMaybe that's why it's not an Aesop's fable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"The Dog and the Squirrel\" is a different type of folk tale or a modern story.\n\nI think I'll go with A, \"The Dog and the Squirrel,\" as the one that's not an Aesop's fable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
