This is when the cell duplicates its DNA, resulting in double the amount of genetic material. \n\nTo provide more context, let's briefly go through the phases of the cell cycle:\n\n1. **G1 phase (Gap 1):** This is the first gap phase where the cell grows and carries out its normal functions. It also checks for any damage or issues before proceeding to the S phase.\n\n2. **S phase (Synthesis):** During this phase, DNA replication takes place, and the cell's DNA content doubles. Each chromosome is duplicated to form two sister chromatids.\n\n3. **G2 phase (Gap 2):** After DNA replication, the cell enters another growth phase where it continues to grow and prepares for mitosis. It also checks for any errors in DNA replication.\n\n4. **M phase (Mitosis):** This is the phase where cell division occurs, resulting in two daughter cells, each with an identical set of chromosomes.\n\nSo, the quantity of DNA doubles specifically during the S phase.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **G1 phase:** During this phase, the cell grows and carries out its functions but does not duplicate its DNA.\n\n- **G2 phase:** Although the cell continues to grow and prepare for mitosis, DNA replication has already occurred in the S phase.\n\n- **M phase:** This is the phase of cell division, where the duplicated chromosomes are separated into two daughter cells, each receiving one copy of each chromosome. DNA quantity does not double during this phase; rather, it is distributed.\n\n**Additional information:**\n\n- The cell cycle is tightly regulated to ensure that DNA replication and cell division occur accurately and at the right times.\n\n- Errors in DNA replication during the S phase can lead to mutations, which might result in various diseases, including cancer.\n\n- Some cells, like those in adult muscle or nerve cells, may exit the cell cycle and enter a stage called G0, where they no longer divide.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe S phase is crucial for DNA replication, during which the quantity of DNA in a eukaryotic cell doubles, preparing the cell for division in the M phase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
