In one such story, which appeared in a newspaper, an unidentified Cabinet member was quoted as saying that the President pardoned the owner of a professional baseball team, for a previous felony conviction because the owner promised to give the President a lifetime pass to all future games. Upset by these news \"leaks,\" the President, in his last official act, issued an executive order banning all executive employees from having conversations with members of the press unless prior permission had been obtained from an administrative supervisor. The executive order called for the dismissal of any employee willfully in violation of that order. After the President left office, the press made repeated references to the executive order and derisively referred to it as the President's legacy. Nonetheless, after the new President took office he promised to abide by the order. Thereafter one of the Vice President's senior advisers, leaked a story to a magazine stating that the Vice President told staff members that the only reason he visited a city following an earthquake was because he wanted to play golf at a nearby golf course. The magazine printed the story and named the senior adviser as the source. In compliance with civil service regulations, a hearing was conducted and the senior adviser was found to have violated the executive order barring unauthorized conununications with print media. Subsequently, the senior adviser was summarily dismissed from his executive staff position. The senior adviser brings an appropriate action seeking reinstatement and challenges the constitutionality of the executive order. If this case reaches the U. S. Supreme Court, the justices should rule the executive order is\n\nA. constitutional, because governmental employment is a privilege and not a right.\nB. constitutional, because the President has plenary power to set forth employment regulations for executive department employees.\nC. unconstitutional, because Congress, not the President, has authority to regulate the terms and conditions of federal employment.\nD. unconstitutional, because the President cannot broadly limit all executive employees' freedom of speech and association.\n"

So, the President issued an executive order right before leaving office that bans executive employees from talking to the press without permission from a supervisor, and anyone who violates this can be fired. Then, after the new President takes office, they decide to keep this order, and a senior adviser gets fired for leaking a story to a magazine, and now this adviser is challenging the constitutionality of that executive order.\n\nOkay, so the question is, is this executive order constitutional? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nOption A says it's constitutional because governmental employment is a privilege, not a right. Hmm, that sounds plausible. If working for the government is a privilege, maybe they can set rules like this.\n\nOption B says it's constitutional because the President has complete power to set employment regulations for executive department employees. Well, the President does have a lot of authority over executive branch employees, but I wonder if there are limits to that authority.\n\nOption C says it's unconstitutional because Congress, not the President, has the authority to regulate the terms and conditions of federal employment. I know that Congress makes laws about federal employment, but maybe the President can also issue regulations within certain bounds.\n\nOption D says it's unconstitutional because the President can't broadly limit all executive employees' freedom of speech and association. This one catches my attention because it mentions freedom of speech, which is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nLet me think about this. First, is governmental employment a privilege or a right? I think it's generally considered a privilege, meaning that employees can be subject to more restrictions than ordinary citizens. So, Option A might be correct.\n\nBut, at the same time, employees still have constitutional rights, including freedom of speech. So, maybe Option D is also a strong candidate.\n\nLet me look into this further. There's a concept called \"public employee speech\" and how it interacts with the First Amendment. In general, when employees are speaking as citizens on matters of public concern, they do have First Amendment protections. However, when they're speaking in their official capacity or on matters related to their job, the government has more leeway to regulate their speech.\n\nIn this case, the executive order bans talking to the press about certain things without permission. So, it's restricting their ability to speak to the press, which is a form of speech.\n\nBut, the government has interests in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of its operations, so it can impose some restrictions on employees' speech.\n\nHowever, completely banning employees from talking to the press unless approved by a supervisor seems pretty broad. It might be seen as prior restraint on speech, which is a serious limitation.\n\nAlso, firing employees for violating this order is a significant penalty.\n\nI recall that the Supreme Court has ruled on similar issues. For example, in Pickering v. Board of Education, the Court established that public employees do have some First Amendment protections when speaking on matters of public concern.\n\nIn this case, the senior adviser was leaking information to the press, which could be considered a matter of public concern, especially since it's about the Vice President's motives for visiting a city after an earthquake.\n\nSo, perhaps the executive order is too broad and infringes on the employee's First Amendment rights.\n\nOn the other hand, the government has an interest in preventing leaks and maintaining confidentiality, especially regarding sensitive information.\n\nBut in this scenario, the leak was about the Vice President's motives for visiting a city, which might not be classified or sensitive in the same way national security information is.\n\nMoreover, the executive order seems to apply to all executive employees, which is a very broad category, and it restricts their ability to communicate with the press in a significant way.\n\nI think the Supreme Court would likely find that this executive order violates the employees' freedom of speech, especially since it's a blanket ban without specific justification for each case.\n\nTherefore, Option D seems to be the most appropriate answer: the executive order is unconstitutional because the President cannot broadly limit all executive employees' freedom of speech and association.\n\nOption A might be partially correct in that governmental employment is a privilege, but that doesn't necessarily mean that employees lose all their constitutional rights, particularly something as fundamental as free speech.\n\nOption B is too broad because while the President does have authority over executive branch employees, that authority isn't unlimited, especially when it comes to restricting constitutional rights.\n\nOption C is interesting because it suggests that only Congress can regulate terms and conditions of federal employment, but I think the President has the authority to issue executive orders regarding employment regulations, as long as they don't violate the Constitution or existing laws.\n\nSo, overall, I think Option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
