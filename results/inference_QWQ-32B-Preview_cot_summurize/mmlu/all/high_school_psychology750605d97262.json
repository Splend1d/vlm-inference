                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Adeel's research findings. He surveyed 2,000 randomly selected study participants and found that college juniors who work at paying jobs 15 hours a week get higher grades than those who don't have paying jobs or who work full time. The question is asking which research method Adeel used, and the options are experimental, naturalistic observation, case study, or survey.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each of these research methods entails.\n\nStarting with experimental research. In experimental research, the researcher manipulates one or more variables to observe the effect on another variable. It usually involves an experimental group and a control group to determine cause and effect. But in Adeel's study, it doesn't seem like he manipulated any variables. He just collected and analyzed responses from participants. So, probably not experimental.\n\nNext, naturalistic observation. This is where researchers observe subjects in their natural environment without interfering or manipulating anything. It's like watching how people behave in real-life settings. But again, Adeel collected responses, which sounds more like he asked participants questions rather than just observing them. So, maybe not naturalistic observation.\n\nThen, there's the case study method. This involves an in-depth analysis of a single individual, group, or event. It's more detailed and focused on specific instances rather than large samples. Adeel's study involved 2,000 participants, which is a pretty large sample size, so it doesn't sound like a case study.\n\nThat leaves survey research. A survey involves collecting data through responses to questions, either through interviews, questionnaires, or other methods. Since Adeel collected responses from 2,000 randomly selected participants, this seems to fit the description of survey research.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about it step by step:\n\n1. Adeel collected responses from participants. This suggests that he asked them questions about their work hours and grades.\n\n2. The participants were randomly selected, which is a common practice in survey research to ensure representativeness.\n\n3. He then analyzed these responses to find a relationship between working 15 hours a week and grades compared to those who don't work or work full time.\n\nThis all aligns with survey research methods, where data is collected through questions and then analyzed to find patterns or relationships.\n\nLet me double-check by considering why the other options don't fit:\n\n- Experimental: There's no mention of manipulating variables or having control and experimental groups. Adeel just collected data on existing behaviors and outcomes.\n\n- Naturalistic observation: This would involve observing behaviors without intervention, but Adeel collected responses, which is more active than just observing.\n\n- Case study: This typically involves in-depth analysis of a single subject or a small group, whereas Adeel's study is based on a large sample size.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is that Adeel used survey research methods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
