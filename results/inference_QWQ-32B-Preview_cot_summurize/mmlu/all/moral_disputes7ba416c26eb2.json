                    "text": "I'm trying to understand why Corvino thinks the argument \"homosexuals are born that way, therefore homosexual activity is good and natural\" is unsound. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption A says it ignores the possibility that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice. But the argument explicitly states that homosexuals are \"born that way,\" which suggests that it's not a choice. So, if the argument already assumes it's not a choice, then criticizing it for ignoring that possibility doesn't make much sense. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nOption B says it assumes that all innate desires are good ones. Hmm, that seems plausible. Just because something is innate or natural doesn't necessarily mean it's good. For example, people might have innate tendencies towards aggression or jealousy, but that doesn't make those tendencies good. So, perhaps the argument is flawed because it assumes that being born a certain way automatically makes the associated behaviors good.\n\nOption C says it's equivalent to recognizing that homosexuality is unusual. I don't see the connection here. The argument is about being born a certain way and therefore the activity being good and natural. Whether homosexuality is common or unusual doesn't directly bear on the validity of the argument. So, this option seems less relevant.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above.\"\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The argument is: Homosexuals are born that way; therefore, homosexual activity is good and natural.\n\nFirst, the premise is that homosexuals are born that way, meaning their sexual orientation is innate or natural. From this, the conclusion is drawn that homosexual activity is good and natural.\n\nNow, Corvino claims this argument is unsound. An argument is unsound if either its premises are false or its logic is invalid.\n\nLooking at the premises: \"Homosexuals are born that way.\" This is a claim about the nature of sexual orientation, suggesting it's innate or determined at birth. Whether this is true or not is a separate question, but for the sake of evaluating the argument's logic, let's assume it's true.\n\nThe conclusion is that homosexual activity is good and natural. So, from the premise that homosexuality is innate, it's being inferred that homosexual activities are good and natural.\n\nNow, is this a valid logical step? That's what Corvino is questioning.\n\nOption B suggests that the argument assumes all innate desires are good ones. That seems relevant. Just because something is innate doesn't necessarily make it good. For example, hunger is innate, and it's good in that it motivates us to eat, but acting on hunger by stealing food might not be considered good. Similarly, aggression might be innate in some form, but acting aggressively isn't always good.\n\nSo, the argument seems to be making the leap from \"innate\" to \"good,\" which might not be logically valid.\n\nOption A suggests that the argument ignores the possibility that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice. But the argument explicitly states that homosexuals are born that way, which contradicts the idea that it's a choice. So, criticizing it for ignoring that possibility doesn't seem fitting.\n\nOption C says it's equivalent to recognizing that homosexuality is unusual. I don't see how that relates to the argument's logic. The argument is about being born a certain way and the goodness of the associated activities, not about the prevalence of homosexuality.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the most appropriate reason why Corvino might consider the argument unsound. It's because the argument assumes that all innate desires are good ones, which isn't necessarily the case.\n\nBut let me consider if there are other possible issues with the argument.\n\nAnother potential problem is equating \"natural\" with \"good.\" Even if homosexuality is natural or innate, that doesn't necessarily make it good. Many things are natural but not necessarily good, like natural disasters or predatory behavior in animals.\n\nHowever, option B already covers the idea that innate desires aren't necessarily good, so this might be subsumed under that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the argument is flawed because it assumes that being born a certain way determines the morality of actions based on that characteristic. But that seems similar to option B as well.\n\nI think option B is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
