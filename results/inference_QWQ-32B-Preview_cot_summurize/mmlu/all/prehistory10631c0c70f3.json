                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about complex societies. It asks, \"Which of the following is evidence of a complex society? A. monumental works, B. burials with grave goods, C. leisure and a sedentary lifestyle, D. all of the above.\" Hmm, I need to think about what makes a society complex.\n\nFirst off, I know that complex societies are usually larger and have more social stratification, meaning there are different classes or levels of people with varying degrees of power and resources. So, evidence of this kind of structure would suggest a complex society.\n\nOption A is \"monumental works.\" I think of things like pyramids, temples, or large public buildings. These require a lot of organization, labor, and resources. Probably, only a society with some level of complexity could pull that off, right? So, that seems like a good indicator.\n\nOption B is \"burials with grave goods.\" This suggests that some people were buried with more valuable items than others, which could indicate social stratification. If some individuals were more important or had higher status, they might be buried with more goods. That sounds like evidence of a complex society.\n\nOption C is \"leisure and a sedentary lifestyle.\" A sedentary lifestyle implies that people aren't constantly on the move, which often correlates with agriculture and settled communities. Leisure time suggests that not everyone is solely focused on survival; some people have time for other activities. This could also indicate a society with some level of complexity, as resources are being allocated in ways that support non-survival activities.\n\nOption D is \"all of the above.\" If all three of these are indeed evidence of a complex society, then this would be the correct answer.\n\nLet me consider each one again:\n\n- Monumental works: require organization and resources, suggesting complexity.\n\n- Burials with grave goods: indicate social stratification, which is a feature of complex societies.\n\n- Leisure and a sedentary lifestyle: suggest settled communities with surplus resources, which often accompany complex social structures.\n\nIt seems like all three are valid indicators of a complex society. Therefore, the answer should be D, all of the above.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should think about whether there could be scenarios where one of these exists without the others.\n\nFor example, could there be monumental works without social stratification? Maybe, but it's unlikely. Building large structures usually requires a significant workforce and organization, which typically implies some form of social hierarchy.\n\nWhat about burials with grave goods without monumental works? Perhaps a society could have social stratification reflected in burial practices but not have the resources or need to build large monuments.\n\nSimilarly, could a society have a sedentary lifestyle and leisure time without being particularly complex? Maybe, but generally, sedentary lifestyles correlate with more complex social structures.\n\nGiven that, it still seems like all three are strong indicators of a complex society, and thus, \"all of the above\" is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
