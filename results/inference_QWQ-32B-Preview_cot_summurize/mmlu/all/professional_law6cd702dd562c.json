From reports by employees and customers, the department store's manager concluded that the losses were due, wholly or in large part, to the depredations of a female shoplifter, aged 30 to 40 years, about 5 feet 5 inches in height, with red hair and green eyes, who usually wore a suit. This information was passed on to all of the employees of the department store. One day, a woman entered the store to purchase accessories. The woman was 5 feet 5 inches tall, 37 years old, red-haired and green-eyed, and dressed in a smartly tailored suit. She carried a large shopping bag. The manager noticed her as she picked up, examined, and put down a number of gloves and scarves. After a while, she looked about tentatively, and then started to walk out, swinging her bag. The manager intercepted her and, standing in front of her, politely asked the woman if she would accompany her to the store manager's office. When the woman asked for an explanation, the manager told her of the store's recent experience and the suspicion that the woman might be concealing pilfered merchandise in her bag. Flushing angrily, the woman replied, \"Very well,\" and followed her to the office. Once there, the manager began to question the woman quite intensively. After the questioning, the manager then asked the woman's permission to inspect the contents of her shopping bag. At first, the woman curtly refused and announced that she had had enough of this nonsense. When she rose to go, the manager told her, \"Listen, unless you let me look inside that bag, I'm going to call the police. \" The woman replied, \"Very well,\" and handed her the bag. The manager inspected the contents of the bag thoroughly but did not find any pilfered merchandise. She then gave the woman permission to leave. The total length of the woman's detention was 30 minutes. If the woman asserts a claim for false imprisonment against the department store, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because she was detained for an unreasonably long period of time.\nB. prevail, because the manager did not have reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft.\nC. not prevail, because under the circumstances, the manager had reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft.\nD. not prevail, because the manager gave the woman permission to leave after conducting her investigation.\n"

                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this department store that's been having a bunch of thefts over several months. The manager thinks it's one specific woman causing most of the problems. She's described as a female shoplifter, around 30 to 40 years old, about 5 feet 5 inches tall, with red hair and green eyes, and she usually wears a suit.\n\nOne day, a woman who matches that description exactly comes into the store to buy accessories. She's looking at gloves and scarves, and then starts to leave while swinging her shopping bag. The manager stops her and asks her to come to the office, explaining that there have been recent thefts and that she suspects the woman might be hiding stolen merchandise in her bag.\n\nThe woman gets angry but goes with the manager to the office. There, the manager questions her intensively. After the questioning, the manager asks permission to check the bag, but the woman refuses at first. The manager threatens to call the police unless she lets her look in the bag. So, the woman gives her the bag, and upon inspection, there's no stolen merchandise found. Then, the manager lets the woman leave after detaining her for 30 minutes.\n\nNow, the question is, if the woman sues for false imprisonment against the department store, which option is most likely correct?\n\nOption A says she'll prevail because she was detained for an unreasonably long time. Option B says she'll prevail because the manager didn't have reasonable grounds to suspect her of theft. Option C says she won't prevail because the manager had reasonable grounds to suspect her of theft. Option D says she won't prevail because the manager let her leave after the investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what false imprisonment is. False imprisonment is when someone intentionally restricts another person's freedom of movement without lawful authority. So, in this case, the manager detained the woman, and now the woman is claiming that this was unjustified.\n\nTo determine whether the detention was lawful, I need to look at whether the manager had reasonable grounds to suspect the woman of theft. If the manager had reasonable suspicion, then the detention might be considered lawful, and the woman wouldn't prevail in her claim.\n\nThe manager had information from employees and customers that a specific woman matching the description was responsible for the thefts. The woman who was detained matched that description exactly: same age, height, hair color, eye color, and attire. Plus, her behavior of looking around tentatively before leaving could be seen as suspicious.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems like the manager had reasonable grounds to suspect that this woman might be the one responsible for the thefts. Therefore, detaining her for further questioning could be justified.\n\nHowever, the detention lasted for 30 minutes, which might be considered a relatively long time. But in the context of investigating potential theft, especially given the history of thefts at the store, 30 minutes might be acceptable, provided that the questioning was relevant and the search of the bag was conducted promptly.\n\nAlso, the manager did give the woman permission to leave after the investigation, which suggests that she didn't intend to hold her against her will indefinitely.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like the manager had reasonable grounds for suspicion, and the detention was for a specific purpose related to that suspicion. Therefore, the woman is less likely to prevail in her claim for false imprisonment.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. She might prevail because of the duration, but 30 minutes doesn't seem excessively long in this context.\n\nB. The manager did have reasonable grounds based on the description and the woman's behavior.\n\nC. The manager had reasonable grounds, so the woman shouldn't prevail.\n\nD. The manager did let her leave after the investigation, which is appropriate.\n\nBetween C and D, I think C is more directly addressing the key point: whether the manager had reasonable grounds for suspicion. If she did, then the detention was lawful, and the woman shouldn't prevail in her claim.\n\nSo, I would go with option C: not prevail, because under the circumstances, the manager had reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
