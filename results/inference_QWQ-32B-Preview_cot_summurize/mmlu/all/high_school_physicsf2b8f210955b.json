                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about fluid flowing through a pipe, and it splits into three smaller pipes. I need to find out the flow speed in each of the smaller pipes. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that fluid flow in pipes can be described by the continuity equation, which says that the volume flow rate has to be the same at all points in the pipe if the fluid is incompressible and steady. That makes sense because the fluid can't just accumulate in the pipe; whatever goes in must come out.\n\nSo, the continuity equation is usually written as A1 * V1 = A2 * V2, where A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe and V is the flow speed.\n\nIn this case, the pipe splits into three smaller pipes, each with a radius of Q/2, and the original pipe has a radius of Q. So, I need to find the flow speed in each of the smaller pipes, let's call it V'.\n\nFirst, I should find the area of the original pipe and the area of each smaller pipe.\n\nThe area of a circle is A = \u03c0 * r^2.\n\nSo, the area of the original pipe is A = \u03c0 * Q^2.\n\nThe area of each smaller pipe is A' = \u03c0 * (Q/2)^2 = \u03c0 * (Q^2)/4.\n\nSince there are three smaller pipes, the total area of the three smaller pipes is 3 * A' = 3 * \u03c0 * (Q^2)/4 = (3\u03c0Q^2)/4.\n\nNow, according to the continuity equation, the volume flow rate in the original pipe should equal the total volume flow rate in the three smaller pipes.\n\nSo, A * V = 3 * A' * V'.\n\nPlugging in the areas:\n\n\u03c0 * Q^2 * V = 3 * (\u03c0 * (Q^2)/4) * V'.\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u03c0 * Q^2 * V = (3\u03c0Q^2)/4 * V'.\n\nI can cancel out \u03c0 and Q^2 from both sides:\n\nV = (3/4) * V'.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If I solve for V', I get V' = (4/3) V.\n\nBut that means the flow speed in the smaller pipes is higher than in the original pipe, which seems counterintuitive. Usually, when a pipe widens, the flow speed decreases, and when it narrows, it increases.\n\nBut in this case, the smaller pipes have a smaller radius, so they are narrower, but there are three of them.\n\nLet me double-check the continuity equation. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nThe continuity equation for incompressible fluids is indeed A1 * V1 = A2 * V2, assuming steady flow.\n\nIn this case, A1 is the area of the original pipe, V1 is the original speed, A2 is the total area of the three smaller pipes, and V2 is the speed in each smaller pipe.\n\nWait, but there are three smaller pipes, each with speed V', so the total volume flow rate in the smaller pipes is 3 * A' * V'.\n\nSo, A * V = 3 * A' * V'.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nLet me plug in the areas again:\n\n\u03c0 * Q^2 * V = 3 * \u03c0 * (Q/2)^2 * V' = 3 * \u03c0 * (Q^2)/4 * V' = (3\u03c0Q^2)/4 * V'.\n\nNow, solving for V':\n\nV' = (\u03c0 * Q^2 * V) / ((3\u03c0Q^2)/4) = (\u03c0Q^2 V * 4)/(3\u03c0Q^2) = (4V)/3.\n\nSo, V' = (4/3)V.\n\nBut intuitively, since the pipes are narrower, I would expect the speed to increase to maintain the same flow rate. However, there are three of them, which increases the total area.\n\nLet me calculate the total area of the three smaller pipes:\n\nA_total = 3 * \u03c0 * (Q/2)^2 = 3 * \u03c0 * (Q^2)/4 = (3\u03c0Q^2)/4.\n\nThe original area is \u03c0Q^2.\n\nSo, the total area of the smaller pipes is (3/4) of the original area.\n\nWait, but in the continuity equation, A1 * V1 = A2 * V2.\n\nSo, \u03c0Q^2 * V = (3\u03c0Q^2)/4 * V'.\n\nSolving for V', we get V' = (4/3)V.\n\nThat makes sense because the total area of the smaller pipes is less than the original area (3/4 of the original area), so to maintain the same flow rate, the speed must increase by a factor of 4/3.\n\nAlternatively, if the total area had been larger, the speed would decrease.\n\nSo, in this case, even though each individual smaller pipe has a smaller area, the fact that there are three of them increases the total area compared to a single smaller pipe.\n\nWait, but in this case, the total area of the three smaller pipes is still less than the original area, right?\n\nBecause (3/4)\u03c0Q^2 < \u03c0Q^2.\n\nSo, to compensate for the reduced total area, the speed must increase.\n\nHence, V' = (4/3)V.\n\nBut let's check the options:\n\nA. 1/3 V\n\nB. 2/3 V\n\nC. 4/3 V\n\nD. 4V\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs the fluid ideal? Yes, it says \"ideal fluid,\" so viscosity is ignored, and the flow is steady and incompressible.\n\nSo, the continuity equation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're expecting the speed to decrease because each smaller pipe has less flow, but that doesn't make sense because the total flow has to be conserved.\n\nWait, perhaps they're thinking that the flow splits into three paths, so each path has one-third of the original flow rate.\n\nIf that were the case, then for each smaller pipe:\n\nA' * V' = (1/3) * A * V.\n\nSo, \u03c0*(Q/2)^2 * V' = (1/3) * \u03c0*Q^2 * V.\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u03c0*(Q^2)/4 * V' = (\u03c0*Q^2 * V)/3.\n\nThen, V' = (4V)/3, same as before.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, even if I think of each smaller pipe carrying one-third of the total flow, I still end up with V' = (4/3)V.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 4/3 V.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other principle I should apply here, like Bernoulli's equation or something else.\n\nBut since the question is only about flow speeds and radii, and it's an ideal fluid with no pressure changes mentioned, the continuity equation should suffice.\n\nMoreover, the problem is about flow speeds in the pipes, not about pressure or energy.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently go with C. 4/3 V.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{3}\\,V} \\]"
