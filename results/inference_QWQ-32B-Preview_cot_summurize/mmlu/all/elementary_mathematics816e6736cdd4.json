                    "text": "So Lisa has a small business, and she had some ups and downs in the first few days. Let's see what happened each day and then figure out the total profit or loss.\n\nFirst, on Monday, there was a loss of $14. That means she spent more than she earned that day. So, we can think of that as -14 dollars.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, there was a profit of $18. That's good; she earned more than she spent. So, that's +18 dollars.\n\nNext, on Wednesday, there was another loss of $6. That's another negative amount: -6 dollars.\n\nFinally, on Thursday, there was a profit of $7. That's +7 dollars.\n\nTo find the total profit or loss, we need to add up all these amounts together. So, let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, add Monday and Tuesday:\n\n-14 + 18 = 4\n\nSo, after Monday and Tuesday, she has a positive $4.\n\nThen, add Wednesday's loss:\n\n4 + (-6) = 4 - 6 = -2\n\nNow, after Wednesday, she has a negative $2, which is a loss.\n\nFinally, add Thursday's profit:\n\n-2 + 7 = 5\n\nSo, after all four days, she has a positive $5, which is a profit.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $15 profit\n\nB. $45 loss\n\nC. $5 profit\n\nD. $10 profit\n\nThe correct answer is C. $5 profit.\n\nAlternatively, we can add all the amounts together at once:\n\n-14 (Monday) + 18 (Tuesday) -6 (Wednesday) +7 (Thursday) = 5\n\nYes, that matches our step-by-step addition.\n\nSo, the total is a $5 profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
