Time and motion studies.\n\nFrank and Lillian Gilbreth were pioneers in the field of scientific management, particularly known for their contributions to time and motion studies. Frank Gilbreth is often referred to as the \"Father of Motion Study.\" Their work focused on improving efficiency in the workplace by analyzing and optimizing the methods of performing tasks.\n\nTime and motion studies involve breaking down work processes into their simplest components to identify and eliminate unnecessary movements and reduce the time required to complete tasks. This approach was aimed at increasing productivity and reducing fatigue among workers.\n\nWhile options A, C, and D are also important aspects of workplace management, Frank Gilbreth's most notable contribution is in the area of time and motion studies.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- Gilbreth, F.
