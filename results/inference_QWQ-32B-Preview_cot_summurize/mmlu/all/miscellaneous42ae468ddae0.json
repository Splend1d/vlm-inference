The ANC is a South African political party that played a central role in the fight against apartheid and has been the ruling party in South Africa since the first multiracial elections in 1994.\n\nOption B, the South African Democrats, was a liberal political party that existed from 1973 to 2000. It was not headed by Nelson Mandela.\n\nOption C, the Inkatha Freedom Party, is a political party in South Africa that was founded by Mangosuthu Buthelezi. It has its roots in the Zulu ethnic group and has often been in opposition to the ANC.\n\nOption D, the Aryan National Assembly, does not appear to be a recognized political party in South Africa. It might be confused with far-right groups, but it's not associated with Nelson Mandela.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. African National Congress."
