So, if G is a cyclic group, there exists some element g in G such that every element of G can be written as g^n for some integer n.\n\nNow, consider a homomorphism \u03c6: G \u2192 H, where G is cyclic. We need to show that \u03c6(G) is also cyclic.\n\nSince G is cyclic, generated by g, any element in G is of the form g^n. Therefore, any element in \u03c6(G) is \u03c6(g^n) = \u03c6(g)^n, because \u03c6 is a homomorphism. This means that \u03c6(G) is generated by \u03c6(g), so \u03c6(G) is cyclic.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.\n\nAn Abelian group is a group where the group operation is commutative; that is, for any two elements a and b in the group, ab = ba.\n\nLet\u2019s consider a homomorphism \u03c6: G \u2192 H, where G is Abelian. We need to show that \u03c6(G) is also Abelian.\n\nTake any two elements in \u03c6(G), say \u03c6(a) and \u03c6(b), where a and b are in G. Since G is Abelian, ab = ba. Then, \u03c6(ab) = \u03c6(a)\u03c6(b), and \u03c6(ba) = \u03c6(b)\u03c6(a). But since ab = ba, \u03c6(ab) = \u03c6(ba), so \u03c6(a)\u03c6(b) = \u03c6(b)\u03c6(a). This shows that \u03c6(G) is Abelian.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
