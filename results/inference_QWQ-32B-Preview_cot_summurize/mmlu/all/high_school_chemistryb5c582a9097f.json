                    "text": "Let's see. So, the student found that the reaction is nonspontaneous at 1 atm and 298 K, but becomes spontaneous when cooled with dry ice at -78\u00b0C. We need to figure out which combination of \u0394H, \u0394S, and \u0394G applies to this reaction.\n\nFirst, I recall that spontaneity is determined by the Gibbs free energy change, \u0394G. A negative \u0394G indicates a spontaneous reaction, while a positive \u0394G indicates a nonspontaneous reaction.\n\nAt 298 K, the reaction is nonspontaneous, so \u0394G must be positive there. But at -78\u00b0C (which is 195 K), the reaction becomes spontaneous, so \u0394G becomes negative.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy equation is:\n\n\u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u0394H is the enthalpy change\n\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n\n- \u0394S is the entropy change\n\nWe have two conditions:\n\n1. At 298 K, \u0394G > 0\n\n2. At 195 K, \u0394G < 0\n\nLet me write down these inequalities:\n\n1. \u0394H - (298 K)\u0394S > 0\n\n2. \u0394H - (195 K)\u0394S < 0\n\nI need to find the values of \u0394H and \u0394S that satisfy both inequalities.\n\nLet me rearrange these inequalities to express \u0394H in terms of \u0394S.\n\nFrom inequality 1:\n\n\u0394H > 298 K * \u0394S\n\nFrom inequality 2:\n\n\u0394H < 195 K * \u0394S\n\nSo, combining these:\n\n298 K * \u0394S < \u0394H < 195 K * \u0394S\n\nHmm, that's interesting. This suggests that \u0394S must be negative for this inequality to make sense because if \u0394S were positive, having 298 K * \u0394S < 195 K * \u0394S would imply that a larger positive number is less than a smaller positive number, which doesn't make sense. Similarly, if \u0394S is negative, then multiplying by T (which is positive) makes T\u0394S negative, and the inequalities could hold.\n\nLet me assume \u0394S is negative, say \u0394S = -S, where S is a positive number.\n\nThen the inequalities become:\n\n298 K * (-S) < \u0394H < 195 K * (-S)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-298 S < \u0394H < -195 S\n\nThis means that \u0394H is negative, and its magnitude is between 195 S and 298 S.\n\nSo, \u0394H is negative, and \u0394S is negative.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G = 0\n\nB. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0\n\nC. \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0\n\nD. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0, and \u0394G > 0\n\nFrom our analysis, \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0, which matches options A and C.\n\nBut in option A, \u0394G = 0, while in option C, \u0394G > 0.\n\nWait, but at 298 K, \u0394G > 0, and at 195 K, \u0394G < 0.\n\nOption A says \u0394G = 0, which isn't matching our condition at 298 K.\n\nSo, option C seems to match: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0 at 298 K.\n\nBut I need to confirm if this combination can lead to \u0394G becoming negative at lower temperatures.\n\nLet me plug in some hypothetical values to see.\n\nSuppose \u0394H = -100 kJ/mol, \u0394S = -0.2 kJ/(mol\u00b7K)\n\nAt 298 K:\n\n\u0394G = -100 - (298)(-0.2) = -100 + 59.6 = -40.4 kJ/mol\n\nWait, that's negative, but according to the problem, at 298 K, \u0394G > 0.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to choose different values.\n\nLet me try \u0394H = -100 kJ/mol, \u0394S = -0.5 kJ/(mol\u00b7K)\n\nAt 298 K:\n\n\u0394G = -100 - (298)(-0.5) = -100 + 149 = 49 kJ/mol\n\nThat's positive, which matches the nonspontaneous condition at 298 K.\n\nAt 195 K:\n\n\u0394G = -100 - (195)(-0.5) = -100 + 97.5 = -2.5 kJ/mol\n\nThat's negative, which matches the spontaneous condition at 195 K.\n\nSo, with \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0, we can have \u0394G > 0 at higher temperatures and \u0394G < 0 at lower temperatures.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be correct.\n\nBut wait, option A also has \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0, but \u0394G = 0.\n\n\u0394G = 0 would correspond to equilibrium, not necessarily the conditions described.\n\nSo, option C is the one that matches the described behavior.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
