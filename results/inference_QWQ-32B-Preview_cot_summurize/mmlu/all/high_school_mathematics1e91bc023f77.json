                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a bin with 5 green balls and \\( k \\) purple balls. So, the total number of balls in the bin is \\( 5 + k \\).\n\nWhen a ball is drawn at random, there are two possible outcomes:\n1. A green ball is drawn, and the player wins $2.\n2. A purple ball is drawn, and the player loses $2.\n\nWe're given that the expected amount won for playing the game is 50 cents, which is $0.50. We need to find the value of \\( k \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for expected value in probability. The expected value \\( E \\) is the sum of the products of each outcome and its probability. In this case, there are two outcomes:\n\n1. Winning $2 with probability of drawing a green ball, which is \\( \\frac{5}{5 + k} \\).\n2. Losing $2 with probability of drawing a purple ball, which is \\( \\frac{k}{5 + k} \\).\n\nSo, the expected value \\( E \\) is:\n\n\\[\nE = \\left(2 \\times \\frac{5}{5 + k}\\right) + \\left(-2 \\times \\frac{k}{5 + k}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWe know that \\( E = 0.50 \\), so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.50 = \\left(2 \\times \\frac{5}{5 + k}\\right) + \\left(-2 \\times \\frac{k}{5 + k}\\right)\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.50 = \\frac{10}{5 + k} - \\frac{2k}{5 + k}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators:\n\n\\[\n0.50 = \\frac{10 - 2k}{5 + k}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( k \\). First, multiply both sides by \\( 5 + k \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n0.50(5 + k) = 10 - 2k\n\\]\n\nLet's distribute 0.50 on the left side:\n\n\\[\n2.5 + 0.5k = 10 - 2k\n\\]\n\nNow, let's get all terms involving \\( k \\) on one side and constants on the other. Add \\( 2k \\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n2.5 + 0.5k + 2k = 10\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n2.5 + 2.5k = 10\n\\]\n\nSubtract 2.5 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2.5k = 7.5\n\\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 2.5:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{7.5}{2.5} = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the value of \\( k \\) is 3.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this because 3 is one of the options, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nThe expected value formula is:\n\n\\[\nE = \\left(2 \\times \\frac{5}{5 + k}\\right) + \\left(-2 \\times \\frac{k}{5 + k}\\right) = 0.50\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{5 + k} - \\frac{2k}{5 + k} = 0.50\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 - 2k}{5 + k} = 0.50\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( 5 + k \\):\n\n\\[\n10 - 2k = 0.50(5 + k)\n\\]\n\nDistribute 0.50:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2k = 2.5 + 0.5k\n\\]\n\nSubtract 0.5k from both sides:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2.5k = 2.5\n\\]\n\nSubtract 2.5 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n7.5 - 2.5k = 0\n\\]\n\nAdd \\( 2.5k \\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n7.5 = 2.5k\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2.5:\n\n\\[\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nYes, \\( k = 3 \\) is indeed the correct answer. Let's see if that makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\nIf \\( k = 3 \\), then there are 5 green balls and 3 purple balls, making a total of 8 balls.\n\nThe probability of drawing a green ball is \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\), and winning $2, so the expected gain from a green ball is \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\times 2 = \\frac{10}{8} = 1.25 \\) dollars.\n\nThe probability of drawing a purple ball is \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), and losing $2, so the expected loss from a purple ball is \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\times (-2) = -\\frac{6}{8} = -0.75 \\) dollars.\n\nThe total expected value is \\( 1.25 - 0.75 = 0.50 \\) dollars, which matches the given expected amount.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\( k = 3 \\), which corresponds to choice C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]\n"
