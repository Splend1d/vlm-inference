Helping someone with their academics, especially by testing their math skills, is generally considered a good thing. It shows support and a willingness to assist someone in improving their abilities. There's nothing morally wrong with this behavior; in fact, it's encouraged.\n\nScenario 2: \"I added some arsenic to hamburger that I cooked for my father.\"\n\nThis is a very different situation. Arsenic is a poison, and intentionally adding it to food that you're giving to someone, in this case, your father, is extremely dangerous and harmful. This action could lead to serious illness or even death. Intentionally harming someone, especially a family member, is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
