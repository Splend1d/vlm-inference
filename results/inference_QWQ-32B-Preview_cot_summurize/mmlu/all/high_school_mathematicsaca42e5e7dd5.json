                    "text": "So I have this problem here: given that \\(f(x) = ax^6 - bx^4 + x - 1\\) and that \\(f(2) = 5\\), I need to find \\(f(-2)\\). The options are A. 1, B. 3, C. 0, and D. 5.\n\nFirst, I should probably plug in \\(x = 2\\) into the function and set it equal to 5, since \\(f(2) = 5\\). That will give me an equation involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, let's do that:\n\n\\(f(2) = a(2)^6 - b(2)^4 + 2 - 1 = 5\\)\n\nCalculating the exponents:\n\n\\(2^6 = 64\\), so \\(a \\times 64\\)\n\n\\(2^4 = 16\\), so \\(b \\times 16\\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\(64a - 16b + 2 - 1 = 5\\)\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n\\(64a - 16b + 1 = 5\\)\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\(64a - 16b = 4\\)\n\nI can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 16:\n\n\\(4a - b = \\frac{4}{16}\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(4a - b = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation relating \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \\(4a - b = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find \\(f(-2)\\). Let's plug in \\(x = -2\\) into the function:\n\n\\(f(-2) = a(-2)^6 - b(-2)^4 + (-2) - 1\\)\n\nAgain, calculate the exponents:\n\n\\((-2)^6 = 64\\), so \\(a \\times 64\\)\n\n\\((-2)^4 = 16\\), so \\(b \\times 16\\)\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\(64a - 16b - 2 - 1\\)\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n\\(64a - 16b - 3\\)\n\nHmm, this looks familiar. I notice that \\(64a - 16b\\) is the same as in the equation I have from \\(f(2) = 5\\). Specifically, \\(64a - 16b = 4\\) from earlier.\n\nSo, I can substitute that in:\n\n\\(f(-2) = 4 - 3 = 1\\)\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. From \\(f(2) = 5\\), I had \\(64a - 16b = 4\\), and now \\(f(-2) = 64a - 16b - 3\\). So, indeed, \\(f(-2) = 4 - 3 = 1\\).\n\nBut let me make sure there are no mistakes here. Let's see, \\(f(2) = 64a - 16b + 1 = 5\\), which gives \\(64a - 16b = 4\\). That seems correct.\n\nThen, \\(f(-2) = 64a - 16b - 3\\). Since \\(64a - 16b = 4\\), substituting gives \\(f(-2) = 4 - 3 = 1\\).\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the function \\(f(x)\\). Notice that \\(f(x) = ax^6 - bx^4 + x - 1\\). Now, \\(ax^6 - bx^4\\) are even degree terms, and \\(x\\) is odd. So, \\(f(-x) = a(-x)^6 - b(-x)^4 + (-x) - 1 = ax^6 - bx^4 - x - 1\\).\n\nComparing \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(-x)\\):\n\n\\(f(x) = ax^6 - bx^4 + x - 1\\)\n\n\\(f(-x) = ax^6 - bx^4 - x - 1\\)\n\nSo, \\(f(-x) = f(x) - 2x\\)\n\nWait, because \\(f(-x) = f(x) - 2x\\).\n\nGiven that, and knowing \\(f(2) = 5\\), then \\(f(-2) = f(2) - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1\\), which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods lead to \\(f(-2) = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 1.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it or if there's any trick I might have missed.\n\nAnother approach could be to solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the equation \\(4a - b = \\frac{1}{4}\\), but I don't have another equation to find unique values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, that won't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's some symmetry or property of the function that I can exploit, but I think the method I used is straightforward and correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is A. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
