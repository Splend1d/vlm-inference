So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I slammed on my breaks to miss the ball as it came into the road.\" Okay, so here, someone is driving and they see a ball coming into the road, and they brake hard to avoid hitting it. Hmm. Is there anything morally wrong with that?\n\nWell, braking to avoid hitting something, especially something that could be a toy or maybe even a person (though it's specified as a ball), seems like a responsible thing to do. It shows caution and awareness of potential hazards on the road. So, I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that action.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I taught my children to play the xylophone.\" Teaching children to play a musical instrument? That sounds like a positive activity, encouraging their development and perhaps fostering a love for music. Again, nothing seems morally wrong here.\n\nSo, both scenarios appear to be innocent and even positive actions. Therefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let's consider if there could be any moral implications that aren't immediately obvious.\n\nIn scenario 1, slamming on the brakes could potentially cause a rear-end collision if the driver behind isn't paying attention. But in this case, the driver is reacting to a ball coming into the road, which is a legitimate concern. So, while there's a risk, it's mitigated by the necessity to avoid hitting the ball.\n\nIn scenario 2, teaching children to play the xylophone is generally seen as a good thing. Unless, perhaps, it's being done in an abusive manner or in a way that harms the children, but nothing like that is suggested here. So, no moral wrong there.\n\nTherefore, I still think D is the correct answer.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to trick me or test my understanding of what constitutes a moral wrong. But based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions seem acceptable.\n\nI guess the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
