The defendant was inside the store waiting for his coffee when a member of the city's parking enforcement department drove by the vehicle. Seeing that there was no handicapped sticker on the car, the parking official stopped and started ticketing the vehicle. When the defendant came outside, he got into an argument with the parking official. After the defendant became verbally abusive, the parking official told him to desist or he was going to impound the vehicle. After the defendant continued his badgering, the parking official told him that he was impounding the vehicle and called the station house for officer assistance. A few minutes later, a police officer arrived on the scene. He asked the defendant for identification and then proceeded to frisk him for weapons. The officer found a clear vial containing heroin in the defendant's back pocket. He then placed the defendant under arrest. Thereupon, the parking official went into the defendant's car and began an inventory search. In this jurisdiction, parking enforcement personnel have statutory authority to conduct inventory searches of impounded vehicles. The parking official did not find anything of interest. After the police officer placed the defendant in the patrol car, the officer asked the parking official if he could search the vehicle, to which the parking official responded yes. The officer looked under the floor mat and found a bag containing marijuana. The defendant was taken to the station house and charged with unlawful possession of heroin and marijuana. Prior to trial, the defense filed a motion to exclude the heroin and marijuana from being admitted into evidence. The motion will be granted with respect to\n\nA. the heroin only.\nB. the marijuana only.\nC. both the heroin and the marijuana.\nD. neither the heroin nor the marijuana.\n"

There's a lot going on, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the defendant parked illegally in a handicapped space without a handicapped sticker. A parking enforcement official noticed this and decided to ticket the vehicle. When the defendant came out of the store, there was an argument, and things escalated to the point where the parking official decided to impound the vehicle.\n\nNow, impounding a vehicle is a serious step, and I need to make sure that it was done legally. In this jurisdiction, parking enforcement personnel have statutory authority to conduct inventory searches of impounded vehicles. So, if the impoundment was lawful, then the inventory search would also be lawful.\n\nBut was the impoundment lawful? The parking official impounded the vehicle because the defendant was being verbally abusive and didn't stop even after being warned. I'm not sure if verbal abuse alone justifies impounding a vehicle for a parking violation. Maybe in this jurisdiction, it does, but I need to consider whether the impoundment was proper.\n\nAssuming the impoundment was lawful, the parking official conducted an inventory search but didn't find anything of interest. Then, the police officer asked the parking official if he could search the vehicle, and the parking official said yes. The officer then found marijuana under the floor mat.\n\nSo, there are two pieces of evidence here: the heroin found during the frisk and the marijuana found during the subsequent search.\n\nLet's start with the heroin. The police officer frisked the defendant for weapons and found a vial of heroin in his back pocket. Was this frisk lawful?\n\nWell, the officer asked for identification and then proceeded to frisk the defendant for weapons. Frisks are generally allowed for officer safety if there's a reasonable suspicion that the person is dangerous or armed. Here, the defendant had been verbally abusive, which might raise some concern, but I'm not sure if that alone justifies a frisk.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, when making an arrest, officers are allowed to conduct a search incident to arrest, which can include searching the person and the areas within their control. The defendant was arrested for possessing heroin, so perhaps the frisk was part of that.\n\nBut the sequence of events seems a bit muddled. The officer asked for ID, frisked the defendant, found the heroin, and then placed him under arrest. So, the frisk was before the arrest was officially made, but the arrest was based on the discovery of the heroin during the frisk.\n\nThis could be a chicken and egg situation. If the frisk was unjustified, then the discovery of the heroin was unlawful, and the evidence should be excluded.\n\nOn the other hand, if the frisk was lawful, then the discovery of the heroin was proper, and the arrest followed logically.\n\nI need to consider whether the frisk was justified. Given that the defendant was verbally abusive, but there's no indication of threatening behavior or any specific reason to believe he was armed, I'm inclined to think that the frisk may not have been justified.\n\nTherefore, the discovery of the heroin might be suppressed as fruit of an unlawful frisk.\n\nNow, moving on to the marijuana. The officer found it after searching the vehicle, with the parking official's permission, after the defendant had been arrested and placed in the patrol car.\n\nFirst, was the impoundment and the subsequent inventory search lawful? As I mentioned earlier, in this jurisdiction, parking enforcement personnel have statutory authority to conduct inventory searches of impounded vehicles. So, if the impoundment was lawful, then the inventory search would be okay.\n\nBut the parking official already conducted an inventory search and didn't find anything. Then, the officer asked for permission to search the vehicle again, and the parking official agreed.\n\nI'm a bit confused here. Was the vehicle already impounded, or was it still in the process of being impounded? The parking official had impounded the vehicle before the officer arrived, but the officer was there to provide assistance.\n\nAssuming the impoundment was lawful, and the inventory search had already been conducted, why would the officer ask for permission to search again? Maybe the officer wanted to conduct a more thorough search or was looking for something specific.\n\nIn any case, if the vehicle was lawfully impounded, and the inventory search was properly conducted, then evidence found during that search should be admissible.\n\nHowever, in this case, the parking official had already conducted the inventory search and found nothing. Then, the officer conducted another search and found the marijuana.\n\nWas this second search justified? The officer asked the parking official for permission, and the parking official said yes.\n\nBut, in reality, since the vehicle was impounded, the officer should be following the procedures for inventory searches. Asking the parking official for permission might not be necessary if the officer has authority to conduct an inventory search as part of the impoundment process.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the better approach is to consider whether the officer's search was lawful under the circumstances.\n\nGiven that the vehicle was lawfully impounded, and inventory searches are allowed, the officer likely had the right to conduct a further search of the vehicle, even if it was beyond the initial inventory search.\n\nTherefore, the marijuana found during this search might be admissible.\n\nBut wait a minute. The defendant is moving to exclude both the heroin and the marijuana from evidence. So, I need to determine whether the motion to exclude should be granted with respect to:\n\nA. the heroin only.\n\nB. the marijuana only.\n\nC. both the heroin and the marijuana.\n\nD. neither the heroin nor the marijuana.\n\nBased on my earlier analysis, the heroin was found during a frisk that may not have been justified, while the marijuana was found during a search of the impounded vehicle, which seems lawful.\n\nTherefore, the motion to exclude should be granted with respect to the heroin only.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the frisk was unlawful, then the heroin should be excluded. If the vehicle search was lawful, then the marijuana should be admitted.\n\nTherefore, only the heroin should be excluded.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
