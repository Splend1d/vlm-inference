It is caused by the loss of function of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene, which is located on chromosome 15.\n\nLet's analyze each option to determine which one would result in Angelman syndrome:\n\n**Option A: Maternal UPD 15**\n\n- UPD stands for Uniparental Disomy, which means that an individual receives both copies of a chromosome from one parent instead of one from each parent.\n\n- Maternal UPD 15 means that both chromosome 15s are inherited from the mother, and none from the father.\n\n- In this scenario, the individual has two maternal copies of chromosome 15, including the UBE3A gene.\n\n- Since both copies are maternal, and Angelman syndrome results from the loss of function of the maternal UBE3A gene, having two maternal copies should not cause Angelman syndrome.\n\n- In fact, maternal UPD 15 is associated with Prader-Willi syndrome, another genetic disorder.\n\n**Option B: Paternal UPD 15**\n\n- Paternal UPD 15 means that both chromosome 15s are inherited from the father, and none from the mother.\n\n- In this case, the individual lacks any maternal contribution to chromosome 15, including the maternal UBE3A gene.\n\n- Since Angelman syndrome is caused by the loss of function of the maternal UBE3A gene, having no maternal copy would lead to Angelman syndrome.\n\n- Therefore, paternal UPD 15 can cause Angelman syndrome.\n\n**Option C: Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15**\n\n- A deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15 would remove genetic material from the father's contribution.\n\n- However, Angelman syndrome is associated with the loss of function of the maternal UBE3A gene.\n\n- A deletion in the paternal chromosome 15 would not directly affect the maternal UBE3A gene.\n\n- Therefore, a deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15 would not cause Angelman syndrome.\n\n- In fact, deletions in the paternal chromosome 15 are associated with Prader-Willi syndrome.\n\n**Option D: A mutation in the SNRPN promoter**\n\n- SNRPN (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N) is a gene located on chromosome 15 that is imprinted and normally expressed from the paternal allele.\n\n- The SNRPN promoter is involved in regulating the expression of several imprinted genes.\n\n- Mutations in the SNRPN promoter can affect the imprinting center, leading to abnormalities in gene expression from both parental chromosomes.\n\n- Depending on the specific mutation, this could affect the expression of the UBE3A gene.\n\n- However, Angelman syndrome is specifically associated with the loss of function of the maternal UBE3A gene.\n\n- Therefore, a mutation in the SNRPN promoter could potentially lead to Angelman syndrome if it affects the imprinting of the UBE3A gene.\n\n- But this is less straightforward compared to paternal UPD 15.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most direct cause of Angelman syndrome among the options is paternal UPD 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
