                    "text": "So I've got this passage from The Epic of Gilgamesh, which is really old, like around 2100 B.C.E. It's talking about this guy Gilgamesh, who was a king of Uruk. The first part describes how the gods made him, giving him a perfect form, glory from the sun god Shamash, courage from the storm god Adad, and making him two-thirds god and one-third man. That sounds pretty epic!\n\nThen the second part is all about Uruk, the city he ruled. It says he built the great rampart and the wall of the Eanna temple, which is holy. It describes the walls as gleaming like copper and mentions that the inner wall is unmatched. There's a threshold stone that's from ancient times, and if you go into the Eanna temple, it's the dwelling place of the goddess Ishtar, and no later king or person could equal it.\n\nIt also says to ascend and walk on the city wall, check out the cornerstones and the brickwork, which are made of burned bricks, and the foundation was laid by the Seven Sages. The city is divided into three parts: one for the city itself, one for gardens, one for fields, and there's a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. All of these make up Uruk.\n\nNow, the question is about which statement about ancient cities is most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph. The options are:\n\nA. Ancient cities lacked effective fortifications against attack.\n\nB. Ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.\n\nC. Ancient cities commonly decorated their temples in modest ways.\n\nD. Ancient cities featured areas for training their armies.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that ancient cities lacked effective fortifications against attack. But in the passage, it talks about the great rampart and the walls of Uruk, which are described as gleaming like copper and the inner wall being unmatched. It also mentions ascending and walking on the city wall, inspecting the cornerstones and brickwork. So, it seems like Uruk had strong, well-built fortifications. Therefore, option A doesn't seem supported; in fact, it's contradicted by the text.\n\nOption B says that ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities. The passage mentions the Eanna temple, which is the holy sanctuary of Ishtar, and it's described as magnificent, with no subsequent king or living man might equal it. So, this suggests that Uruk had a prominent area for worshipping Ishtar, who was likely their patron deity. This seems to be supported by the text.\n\nOption C says that ancient cities commonly decorated their temples in modest ways. But again, the Eanna temple is described as glorious and unmatched, with no one later able to equal it. This suggests that the temple was lavishly built and not modest at all. So, option C seems contradicted by the passage.\n\nOption D says that ancient cities featured areas for training their armies. The passage mentions that Gilgamesh was given courage by Adad, the god of storms, and he built fortifications, but there's no direct mention of areas for training armies in the city description. It talks about the city's divisions into areas for the city, gardens, fields, and the temple precinct, but not specifically an area for army training. So, option D isn't strongly supported by the text.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B seems to be the most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph. The text clearly indicates that there was a prominent and magnificent temple for the goddess Ishtar, suggesting that ancient cities like Uruk had areas dedicated to worshipping their patron deities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
