                    "text": "So I have this problem here about k-Means Clustering. I need to find the cluster centers after the first iteration for three clusters, C1, C2, and C3, each containing some points in two-dimensional space. Let me see what I've got.\n\nFirst, cluster C1 has two points: (0,6) and (6,0). Cluster C2 has three points: (2,2), (4,4), and (6,6). And cluster C3 has two points: (5,5) and (7,7). The task is to compute the centers of these clusters.\n\nI remember that in k-Means Clustering, the center of a cluster is the mean of all the points in that cluster. So, for each cluster, I need to calculate the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the points in that cluster.\n\nLet's start with C1. It has points (0,6) and (6,0). To find the center, I'll add the x-coordinates together and divide by the number of points, and do the same for the y-coordinates.\n\nFor C1:\n\nx_center = (0 + 6) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\ny_center = (6 + 0) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nSo, the center of C1 is (3,3).\n\nNext, C2 has three points: (2,2), (4,4), and (6,6). Let's calculate its center.\n\nFor C2:\n\nx_center = (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4\n\ny_center = (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4\n\nSo, the center of C2 is (4,4).\n\nNow, C3 has points (5,5) and (7,7). Let's find its center.\n\nFor C3:\n\nx_center = (5 + 7) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6\n\ny_center = (5 + 7) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6\n\nSo, the center of C3 is (6,6).\n\nPutting it all together, the cluster centers are:\n\nC1: (3,3), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6)\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. C1: (3,3), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6)\n\nB. C1: (3,3), C2: (6,6), C3: (12,12)\n\nC. C1: (6,6), C2: (12,12), C3: (12,12)\n\nD. C1: (0,0), C2: (48,48), C3: (35,35)\n\nOption A matches the centers I calculated. So, the correct answer should be A.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's verify the calculations again.\n\nFor C1: (0,6) and (6,0)\n\nx_center = (0 + 6)/2 = 3\n\ny_center = (6 + 0)/2 = 3\n\nFor C2: (2,2), (4,4), (6,6)\n\nx_center = (2 + 4 + 6)/3 = 12/3 = 4\n\ny_center = (2 + 4 + 6)/3 = 12/3 = 4\n\nFor C3: (5,5), (7,7)\n\nx_center = (5 + 7)/2 = 12/2 = 6\n\ny_center = (5 + 7)/2 = 12/2 = 6\n\nYes, everything checks out. So, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
