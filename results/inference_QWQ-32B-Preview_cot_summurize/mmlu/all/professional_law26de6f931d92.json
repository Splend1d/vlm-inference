                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, we have a property owner who agreed to sell a real estate parcel to a neighbor for $200,000. He wrote up an agreement of sale, signed it, and the neighbor came back with a bank check for the full amount, asking for the deed. But then the property owner changed his mind, returned the money, and refused to tender the deed. Now, the neighbor is suing for specific performance, and the property owner is defending by saying that the neighbor didn't sign the document, so there's no binding contract.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what makes a contract binding. Generally, a contract requires an offer and acceptance, and usually, both parties need to agree to the terms. In this case, the property owner made an offer by writing up the agreement and signing it. The neighbor then brought the full payment, which seems like acceptance of the offer.\n\nBut here's the catch: the neighbor didn't sign the document. So, is signature necessary for the contract to be binding? Well, it depends on the law in the jurisdiction. In some places, for real estate transactions, a signed writing might be required for the contract to be enforceable, due to the Statute of Frauds.\n\nThe Statute of Frauds is a law that requires certain contracts, including those for the sale of land, to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. So, in this case, since the property owner is the one trying to back out, and he's the one who signed the document, maybe the neighbor doesn't need to sign it for the contract to be enforceable against the property owner.\n\nBut, the property owner might argue that since the neighbor didn't sign, he didn't accept the terms of the agreement. However, the neighbor did take some action: he brought the full payment, which seems like he's accepting the offer.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the neighbor did not expressly state that he accepted the agreement.\n\nWell, maybe. But actions can speak louder than words. By bringing the full payment, isn't that accepting the agreement?\n\nB. No, because the neighbor had to put his signature on the document to make it a binding contract.\n\nThis could be plausible, especially if the jurisdiction requires both parties to sign the document for it to be enforceable.\n\nC. Yes, because the neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\n\nThis seems similar to option A but emphasizes the neighbor's conduct as acceptance.\n\nD. Yes, because the property owner created a binding contract when he prepared an agreement containing the agreed terms.\n\nThis suggests that once the property owner signed the agreement, the contract is binding, regardless of the neighbor's signature.\n\nHmm. I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, was there a valid offer? Yes, the property owner wrote up an agreement and signed it, which seems like a clear offer.\n\nNext, was there acceptance? The neighbor brought the full payment, which seems like acceptance through conduct. But did he need to sign the document as well?\n\nIn contract law, acceptance can be through words or actions, depending on the circumstances. If the offer specifies that acceptance must be in a particular way, then the acceptance must comply with that.\n\nWas there any indication that the property owner required the neighbor to sign the document? If so, then perhaps the neighbor's acceptance was incomplete without signing.\n\nAlternatively, if the property owner didn't specify that the neighbor needed to sign, then perhaps the neighbor's action of bringing the full payment was sufficient acceptance.\n\nAlso, consider the concept of consideration. For a contract to be binding, there needs to be something of value exchanged. Here, the neighbor is offering $200,000 in exchange for the deed to the property.\n\nBut, did the exchange actually happen? The neighbor brought the check, but the property owner returned the money without accepting it. So, maybe there was no meeting of the minds, and thus no contract.\n\nWait, but the neighbor brought the check in response to the property owner's offer. That should constitute acceptance, and once accepted, a contract is formed.\n\nHowever, if the property owner returned the money, perhaps that's an attempt to rescind the contract or to refuse the acceptance.\n\nBut in contract law, once acceptance is properly communicated, the contract is formed, and neither party can back out unilaterally.\n\nSo, perhaps the court would rule that a contract was formed when the neighbor accepted the offer by bringing the full payment, and therefore the property owner is obligated to perform by tendering the deed.\n\nBut, considering the Statute of Frauds, which typically requires certain contracts to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged, in this case, the property owner is the one who signed the document.\n\nNow, does the Statute of Frauds require both parties to sign? I'm not entirely sure, but in some jurisdictions, only the party against whom enforcement is sought needs to sign.\n\nSo, if the neighbor is seeking to enforce the contract against the property owner, and the property owner has signed the document, maybe that's sufficient under the Statute of Frauds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the neighbor's conduct of bringing the full payment can be considered a partial performance, which takes the agreement out of the Statute of Frauds.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, partial performance can ratify a contract that would otherwise be unenforceable due to the Statute of Frauds.\n\nSo, if the neighbor brought the full payment, that could be considered partial performance, making the contract enforceable.\n\nGiven all this, it seems plausible that the court could rule in favor of the neighbor, despite the neighbor not signing the document.\n\nTherefore, options C and D seem more likely to be correct.\n\nOption C says: Yes, because the neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\n\nThis aligns with the idea that acceptance can be through conduct, and that the neighbor's action of bringing the full payment constitutes acceptance of the offer.\n\nOption D says: Yes, because the property owner created a binding contract when he prepared an agreement containing the agreed terms.\n\nThis seems a bit vague. The property owner prepared and signed the agreement, but for the contract to be binding on him, the neighbor needed to accept it in some way.\n\nWhile the property owner's signature binds him to the terms, the neighbor still needs to accept those terms for a contract to be formed.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is better because it emphasizes the neighbor's acceptance through conduct.\n\nOption A says: No, because the neighbor did not expressly state that he accepted the agreement.\n\nBut, as we've discussed, acceptance can be through conduct, so this might not hold water.\n\nOption B says: No, because the neighbor had to put his signature on the document to make it a binding contract.\n\nThis might be true if the property owner required the neighbor to sign, or if the agreement itself stated that it needed to be signed by both parties.\n\nBut, if there was no such requirement, then perhaps the neighbor's conduct was sufficient.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most accurate answer is C: Yes, because the neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\n\nThis suggests that the neighbor's actions were sufficient to accept the property owner's offer, thereby forming a binding contract that the property owner must honor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
