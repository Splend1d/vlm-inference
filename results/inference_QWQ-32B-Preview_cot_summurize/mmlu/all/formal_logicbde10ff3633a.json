                    "text": "So I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which of the options isn't a direct consequence of the given premises in propositional logic. The premises are:\n\n1. I \u2283 (J \u2261 K)\n\n2. (J \u2261 K) \u2283 (L \u2228 M)\n\n3. I \u2283 ~L\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. ~L\n\nB. J \u2261 K\n\nC. I \u2283 (L \u2228 M)\n\nD. ~L \u2283 (J \u2261 K)\n\nI need to determine which one isn't directly follows from these premises in one step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"immediate consequence\" means. In logic, an immediate consequence is something that can be directly inferred from the premises using rules of inference without needing additional steps.\n\nSo, I need to check each option to see if it can be derived directly from the premises.\n\nLet's start with option A: ~L\n\nLooking at premise 3: I \u2283 ~L\n\nThis says that if I is true, then L is false. But it doesn't tell me anything about L without knowing I. So, I can't immediately conclude ~L unless I know that I is true. Since we don't have any information about whether I is true or false, I can't directly infer ~L. So, maybe A is the answer.\n\nWait, but let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption B: J \u2261 K\n\nLooking at premise 1: I \u2283 (J \u2261 K)\n\nThis says that if I is true, then J is equivalent to K. Again, without knowing the truth value of I, I can't directly conclude J \u2261 K. So, similar to A, this isn't an immediate consequence unless I know I is true.\n\nHmm, so both A and B seem not to be immediate consequences without additional information.\n\nOption C: I \u2283 (L \u2228 M)\n\nLet's see. From premise 1: I \u2283 (J \u2261 K)\n\nAnd premise 2: (J \u2261 K) \u2283 (L \u2228 M)\n\nUsing hypothetical syllogism, which allows us to chain implications, we can infer:\n\nI \u2283 (L \u2228 M)\n\nWait, is that allowed?\n\nYes, hypothetical syllogism states that if P \u2283 Q and Q \u2283 R, then P \u2283 R.\n\nSo, applying that here:\n\nP is I, Q is (J \u2261 K), and R is (L \u2228 M).\n\nTherefore, I \u2283 (L \u2228 M)\n\nSo, option C is a direct consequence of premises 1 and 2.\n\nOption D: ~L \u2283 (J \u2261 K)\n\nLet's see. We have premise 3: I \u2283 ~L\n\nAnd premise 1: I \u2283 (J \u2261 K)\n\nBut I need to see if ~L \u2283 (J \u2261 K) can be directly inferred.\n\nFrom premise 1, I know that I implies both ~L and (J \u2261 K). But does ~L imply (J \u2261 K)?\n\nNot necessarily. There could be other reasons for ~L besides I being true.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at it differently.\n\nSuppose ~L is true. Does that mean (J \u2261 K) is true?\n\nFrom premise 3, I \u2283 ~L, which means if I is true, then L is false.\n\nBut if ~L is true, I could be true or false. If I is true, then from premise 1, J \u2261 K is true. If I is false, J \u2261 K could be anything.\n\nSo, ~L doesn't necessarily imply J \u2261 K.\n\nTherefore, ~L \u2283 (J \u2261 K) is not a direct consequence.\n\nBut wait, in option D, it's ~L \u2283 (J \u2261 K), and from what I just said, this isn't necessarily true.\n\nSo, option D seems not to be an immediate consequence.\n\nBut earlier, option A also seemed not to be an immediate consequence.\n\nBut the question says \"which of the following is not an immediate consequence\", and it's probably expecting a single answer.\n\nMaybe I need to choose the one that is most clearly not an immediate consequence.\n\nOption A: ~L - this can't be directly inferred without knowing I.\n\nOption D: ~L \u2283 (J \u2261 K) - this can't be directly inferred because ~L doesn't necessarily lead to J \u2261 K.\n\nBut perhaps option D is a bit more removed than option A.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that option C is definitely a direct consequence, and options A and B are not, and option D is also not.\n\nBut the question is to choose which one is not an immediate consequence.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is D, because A and B could be considered potential consequences if I is true, but D has no direct logical connection.\n\nWait, but in option B, J \u2261 K, which is directly connected to I through premise 1.\n\nSimilarly, A, ~L, is directly connected to I through premise 3.\n\nBut D, ~L \u2283 (J \u2261 K), doesn't directly follow from any of the premises.\n\nTherefore, D is the one that is not an immediate consequence.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
