                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a bunch of property transactions, and I need to figure out who ends up with the property based on a notice-type recording statute. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, on February 1, a woman conveys her farm to a man, and he records this conveyance. So, the man now owns the property, and since he recorded it, everyone has notice of his ownership.\n\nNext, on February 2, the man conveys the property to his sister, but she doesn't record her deed. So, she has an unrecorded interest in the property.\n\nThen, on February 4, the man conveys the same property to a friend. The friend gives him a check for $100,000 and records the conveyance, even though he knows about the previous conveyance to the sister. So, the friend has recorded his deed, but he had actual knowledge of the sister's interest.\n\nAfter that, the sister records her deed on February 6.\n\nFinally, the friend conveys his interest in the farm to a farmer for $115,000, and the farmer records this deed on February 5, without notice of the conveyance to the sister.\n\nNow, the question is, in a notice-type recording statute state, who would ultimately prevail in owning the property?\n\nFirst, I need to recall how notice-type recording statutes work. In such states, recording a deed gives the recorder constructive notice to subsequent purchasers. So, if someone records a deed, subsequent purchasers are presumed to have notice of that recording, unless they can show they had no actual or constructive notice.\n\nLet's look at the sequence of events:\n\n1. Woman conveys to man on Feb 1, man records.\n\n2. Man conveys to sister on Feb 2, no recording.\n\n3. Man conveys to friend on Feb 4, friend records on Feb 4, with actual knowledge of sister's interest.\n\n4. Sister records her deed on Feb 6.\n\n5. Friend conveys to farmer on Feb 5, farmer records on Feb 5, without notice of sister's conveyance.\n\nOkay, so under a notice-type recording statute, a subsequent purchaser who records without notice of prior unrecorded interests generally has priority.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- The sister has an unrecorded deed from Feb 2.\n\n- The friend records on Feb 4, but he has actual knowledge of the sister's interest. So, even though he records, his recording doesn't give him priority because he had actual knowledge of the sister's prior interest.\n\n- The sister records on Feb 6.\n\n- The farmer purchases from the friend on Feb 5 and records on Feb 5, without notice of the sister's conveyance.\n\nSo, the friend recorded his deed on Feb 4, but he had actual knowledge of the sister's interest. In a notice-type recording statute state, if a subsequent purchaser records with actual knowledge of a prior unrecorded interest, that recording doesn't protect him against the prior interest.\n\nTherefore, the friend's recording doesn't give him priority over the sister's interest.\n\nNow, the farmer purchases from the friend on Feb 5, records on Feb 5, without notice of the sister's conveyance. Since the farmer didn't have notice of the sister's interest, he's a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, so his recording should give him priority over the sister's unrecorded interest.\n\nBut wait, the sister recorded her deed on Feb 6, after the farmer recorded on Feb 5.\n\nIn a notice-type recording statute, recording gives constructive notice to subsequent purchasers. So, anyone recording after Feb 6 would have constructive notice of the sister's interest.\n\nBut the farmer recorded on Feb 5, before the sister recorded on Feb 6, so he doesn't have constructive notice of her interest.\n\nTherefore, the farmer, having recorded first without notice, should have priority over the sister.\n\nSo, ultimately, the farmer should prevail.\n\nWait, but the friend had actual knowledge of the sister's interest when he recorded on Feb 4. Does that affect the farmer's position?\n\nI think the key is that the farmer purchased from the friend on Feb 5, recorded on Feb 5, without notice of the sister's interest.\n\nSince the friend had actual knowledge, his recording didn't perfect his interest against the sister, but the farmer, as a subsequent purchaser without notice, should still have priority.\n\nTherefore, the farmer should be the one who prevails.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. The farmer.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption B is the sister. She recorded on Feb 6, but the farmer recorded earlier on Feb 5 without notice, so she should be subordinate to the farmer.\n\nOption C is the friend. He recorded on Feb 4 with actual knowledge, so his recording doesn't protect him against the sister's prior interest.\n\nOption D is the man, but he conveyed the property away, so he no longer has an interest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The farmer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
