                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a certain number that, when divided by 4, gives us a quotient of 160 and a remainder of 2. We need to find out what that number is. The options are 38, 42, 638, and 642.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how division works with quotients and remainders. When you divide a number by another number, you get a quotient and possibly a remainder. The relationship can be expressed with the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{dividend} = (\\text{divisor} \\times \\text{quotient}) + \\text{remainder} \\]\n\nIn this case, the divisor is 4, the quotient is 160, and the remainder is 2. So, plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{number} = (4 \\times 160) + 2 \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 160 = 640 \\]\n\n\\[ 640 + 2 = 642 \\]\n\nSo, the number should be 642.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure. If I divide 642 by 4, what do I get?\n\n\\[ 642 \\div 4 = 160.5 \\]\n\nHmm, that's not exactly the quotient and remainder form. Actually, when we talk about division with remainders, we consider only the integer part of the quotient.\n\nSo, 642 divided by 4 is 160 with a remainder of 2, because 4 times 160 is 640, and 642 minus 640 is 2.\n\nYes, that matches the given information.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 38\n\nB. 42\n\nC. 638\n\nD. 642\n\nOption D is 642, which matches our calculation.\n\nLet me just quickly check the other options to ensure that 642 is indeed the correct choice.\n\nOption A: 38\n\nIf we divide 38 by 4:\n\n\\[ 38 \\div 4 = 9 \\] with a remainder of 2, because 4 times 9 is 36, and 38 minus 36 is 2.\n\nBut the quotient should be 160, not 9. So, this is not the correct number.\n\nOption B: 42\n\nDividing 42 by 4:\n\n\\[ 42 \\div 4 = 10 \\] with a remainder of 2, because 4 times 10 is 40, and 42 minus 40 is 2.\n\nAgain, the quotient is 10, not 160.\n\nOption C: 638\n\nDividing 638 by 4:\n\n\\[ 638 \\div 4 = 159.5 \\]\n\nConsidering integer division, it's 159 with a remainder of 2, because 4 times 159 is 636, and 638 minus 636 is 2.\n\nBut the quotient should be 160, not 159.\n\nOption D: 642\n\nAs previously calculated, 642 divided by 4 is 160 with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 642.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{642} \\]"
