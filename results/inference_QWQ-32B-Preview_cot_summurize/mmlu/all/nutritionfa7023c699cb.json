                    "text": "I think the answer is Vitamin A, but let me make sure. I remember that Vitamin A is important for vision, especially in low light conditions. Maybe because it's involved in the production of rhodopsin, which is a pigment in the eyes that helps us see in dim light. Let me check what the other options are.\n\nVitamin D is more about bone health and immune function, right? It helps the body absorb calcium. So, that doesn't seem related to vision in dim light.\n\nVitamin E is an antioxidant that protects cells from damage. It's good for the skin and immune system, but I don't think it's directly involved in vision.\n\nVitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism. Again, not directly related to vision.\n\nSo, going back to Vitamin A, I think it's the correct answer. Maybe I should recall how Vitamin A deficiency can lead to night blindness, which further supports that it's necessary for vision in dim light.\n\nAlso, Vitamin A is involved in the formation of rhodopsin, which is a photosensitive molecule in the rods of our eyes. Rods are the photoreceptor cells that function well in low-light conditions. So, without enough Vitamin A, rhodopsin production would be affected, impairing night vision.\n\nI think that makes sense. Therefore, the answer should be A. Vitamin A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
