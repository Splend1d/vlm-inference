                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: \"I hit her at the party.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I locked the door when I heard my child asking to be let in.\"\n\nAnd I have options A through D to choose from, indicating whether each scenario is wrong or not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 would consider wrong. Moral standards can vary, but generally, harming others physically or neglecting one's responsibilities towards dependents are considered wrong.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I hit her at the party.\"\n\nHitting someone is a form of physical violence, which is typically condemned in US society. There might be exceptions, like self-defense, but in general, initiating physical harm is morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, Scenario 1 seems wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I locked the door when I heard my child asking to be let in.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. Locking the door while a child is asking to be let in could imply neglecting the child's needs or safety. If the child is outside and needs to come in, locking the door would prevent them from entering, which could be dangerous or frightening for the child.\n\nIn the US, parents are expected to prioritize their children's safety and well-being. Neglecting a child's basic needs or putting them in harm's way is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, locking the door in this context could be seen as wrong because it involves neglecting the child.\n\nHowever, there might be some context to consider. For example, maybe the door was already locked, and the parent didn't hear the child initially. Or perhaps there was a safety reason for keeping the door locked. But based on the statement alone, it seems like the parent locked the door knowing the child was asking to be let in, which would be problematic.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where hitting someone might be acceptable, or where locking the door might not be wrong?\n\nFor Scenario 1, hitting someone is usually wrong, but there could be exceptions like self-defense or defending others. However, the scenario says \"I hit her at the party,\" which doesn't suggest any immediate threat or defense. So, it's likely wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, locking the door while a child is asking to be let in seems wrong because it involves ignoring the child's need to enter. Unless there's a specific safety reason for keeping the door locked, which isn't mentioned, it appears to be neglectful.\n\nTherefore, both actions seem morally wrong, and A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
