Maybe back in the day before Nissan became more well-known.\n\nLet me think about this. So, Datsun... I think it was Nissan's entry into the U.S. market. They started selling cars under the Datsun name to avoid the negative perception of Japanese products at the time. But then, over the years, as Nissan's reputation improved, they phased out the Datsun name and started using the Nissan brand exclusively.\n\nI recall seeing old Datsun cars, like the Datsun 240Z, which was a pretty popular sports car. I think that was made by Nissan. Also, my parents used to have a Datsun B210, which was a reliable sedan. So, based on that, I'm pretty sure it's Nissan.\n\nLet me check the other options just to be sure. B. Mazda \u2013 I don't think Mazda ever sold cars under the Datsun name. Mazda has its own brands and models. C. Toyota \u2013 Toyota has Toyota-branded cars and also Lexus for their luxury line, but not Datsun. D. Daihatsu \u2013 Daihatsu is another Japanese car maker, but again, I don't think they had anything to do with Datsun.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is A. Nissan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
