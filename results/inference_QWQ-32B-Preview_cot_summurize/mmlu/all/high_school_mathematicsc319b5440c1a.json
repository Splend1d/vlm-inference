The options are A. 5, B. 3, C. 15, D. 31.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \\( 5! \\) is. Factorial of 5, denoted as \\( 5! \\), is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 5. So, \\( 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the greatest odd integer that is a factor of 120. An odd integer is a whole number that is not divisible by 2. So, I need to find the largest odd number that divides 120 without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet me list down the factors of 120 to identify the odd ones.\n\nThe factors of 120 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nNow, among these, the odd factors are 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 15\n\nD. 31\n\nFrom the list of odd factors, 15 is the greatest. So, at first glance, the answer seems to be C. 15.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are any larger odd factors that I might have missed. Is 31 a factor of 120? Let's see: 120 divided by 31 is approximately 3.87, which is not an integer. So, 31 is not a factor of 120. Hence, option D is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, 15 is a factor of 120, and it's odd. Is there any odd factor larger than 15? Looking back at the list of factors, the next odd number after 15 is 15 itself multiplied by an even number, which would make it even. So, no, 15 is the largest odd factor.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the prime factorization of 120 to confirm this.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is:\n\n\\( 120 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\)\n\nAn odd factor would not include any factors of 2. So, the odd factors would be composed only of the odd prime factors, which are 3 and 5.\n\nSo, the odd factors are:\n\n\\( 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 1 \\)\n\n\\( 3^1 \\times 5^0 = 3 \\)\n\n\\( 3^0 \\times 5^1 = 5 \\)\n\n\\( 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 15 \\)\n\nSo, again, the odd factors are 1, 3, 5, and 15, with 15 being the greatest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
