                    "text": "Let's see. So, in this criminal prosecution for theft, the defendant wants to call a witness who knew him as an army supply sergeant and will testify that the defendant turned down many opportunities for black marketeering. The question is whether this witness's testimony is admissible.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some rules about character evidence in criminal trials. I know that character evidence can be a bit tricky because there are limitations on when and how it can be introduced.\n\nOption A says no, because it's irrelevant to the present charge. I need to think about whether the witness's testimony has any bearing on the defendant's guilt or innocence in this specific theft case. The witness is essentially saying that the defendant has a good character and hasn't engaged in certain unethical behaviors in the past. But does that directly relate to whether he committed theft in this particular instance?\n\nWell, character evidence can be relevant in some circumstances, especially when it's used to show a person's tendency to act in a certain way. If the defendant is presenting evidence of his good character, it might suggest that he's less likely to have committed the theft. So, maybe it's not entirely irrelevant.\n\nOption B says no, because the defendant may not prove his good character by specific instances of good conduct. Hmm, this sounds familiar. I think there's a rule that character traits should generally be proved through opinion or reputation evidence, not through specific acts. So, if the witness is testifying about specific instances where the defendant refused to engage in black marketeering, that might be considered specific conduct rather than general character.\n\nOn the other hand, option C says yes, because a criminal defendant may prove his good character as a basis for inferring conduct. This seems to contradict option B. So, perhaps there's a distinction here between how character evidence is presented.\n\nOption D says yes, because by accusing the defendant of being a thief, the prosecution has put his character in issue. This is interesting. I know that in some jurisdictions, once one party introduces character evidence, the other side is allowed to rebut it. But in this case, the prosecution hasn't necessarily introduced character evidence; they're prosecuting for theft, which is a specific act.\n\nLet me try to sort this out. In criminal trials, defendants often have the right to present character evidence to suggest that they're less likely to have committed the crime. However, there are rules about how this evidence can be introduced.\n\nRule 404(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence allows a defendant in a criminal case to offer evidence of a pertinent trait of his own character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same. So, in this case, since the defendant is being prosecuted for theft, a relevant character trait would be honesty or integrity.\n\nNow, how should this evidence be presented? Rule 405(a) states that in cases where character or a character trait is admissible, it may be proved by reputation or opinion evidence, but not by specific acts. So, this seems to support option B\u2014that the defendant cannot prove his good character through specific instances of good conduct.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions or nuances depending on the jurisdiction and specific court rules.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. No, because it is irrelevant to the present charge.\u2014But character evidence can be relevant in criminal cases when properly introduced.\n\nB. No, because the defendant may not prove his good character by specific instances of good conduct.\u2014This aligns with Rule 405(a).\n\nC. Yes, because a criminal defendant may prove his good character as a basis for inferring conduct.\u2014This is generally true, but the method of proving it must comply with the rules.\n\nD. Yes, because, by accusing the defendant of being a thief, the prosecution has put his character in issue.\u2014This could be seen as putting character in issue, but typically, the prosecution doesn't introduce character evidence unless it's relevant to something like propensity.\n\nGiven that, I think option B is the correct answer. The defendant can't prove his good character through specific instances of conduct; instead, he should present reputation or opinion evidence about his character.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any circumstances where specific acts can be introduced to prove character. Generally, specific acts are used for purposes other than proving character, such as motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident. But in this case, the defendant is trying to prove his good character, so specific acts wouldn't be appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(a)(2), evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same, is allowed. But again, according to Rule 405(a), this should be done through reputation or opinion evidence, not specific acts.\n\nTherefore, the witness's testimony about specific instances where the defendant refused to engage in black marketeering would not be admissible to prove his good character.\n\nSo, the answer is B. No, because the defendant may not prove his good character by specific instances of good conduct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
