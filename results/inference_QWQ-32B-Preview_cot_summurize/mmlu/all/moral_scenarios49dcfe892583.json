                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I refilled the wine by choice.\n\n2. I opened the gas tank and filled it with water.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about and then judge based on general moral standards.\n\nScenario 1: \"I refilled the wine by choice.\"\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. Someone is choosing to refill their wine. In most contexts, drinking wine is acceptable, especially for adults. Refilling one's own wine is generally not considered morally wrong. It's a personal choice, and as long as it's done responsibly, there shouldn't be any moral issue here.\n\nScenario 2: \"I opened the gas tank and filled it with water.\"\n\nThis one sounds more problematic. Filling someone's gas tank with water instead of gasoline would render the vehicle unable to run. This could be seen as vandalism or sabotage, which are both against the law and generally considered morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, the scenario says \"I opened the gas tank and filled it with water.\" It doesn't specify whose gas tank it is. If it's their own gas tank, maybe they're doing some sort of modification or experiment, but that seems unlikely. Generally, people don't fill their own gas tanks with water because it would damage the engine.\n\nAssuming it's someone else's gas tank, then that would be clearly wrong. It's damaging someone else's property without their consent, which is against moral and legal standards.\n\nAlternatively, if it's their own vehicle, and they're choosing to fill it with water for some reason, maybe it's an art project or something, but again, that seems unusual. However, in that case, it might not be morally wrong, just perhaps foolish.\n\nBut given the way the scenario is phrased, \"I opened the gas tank and filled it with water,\" it's more likely to imply that it's someone else's vehicle, especially since refilling one's own gas tank with water doesn't make much sense.\n\nSo, based on that interpretation:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nWhich corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret Scenario 1.\n\n\"Refilled the wine by choice.\" Could this imply that they're overindulging in wine, maybe drinking too much? Could that be morally wrong?\n\nIn general, drinking wine in moderation is acceptable, but excessive drinking could be considered irresponsible, especially if it leads to harm to oneself or others. However, the scenario doesn't specify the amount or context, so it's hard to judge.\n\nComparatively, filling someone's gas tank with water seems much more clearly wrong, as it's an act of vandalism.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
