Their agreement makes us feel more certain that we're right.\n\nC. We expect positive interactions with them.\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. When someone agrees with me, it feels good, right? It's like they're validating my thoughts and feelings. So, option A mentions positive reinforcement from their agreement. That makes sense. It's rewarding when people agree with us because it reinforces our beliefs.\n\nOption B says that their agreement bolsters our sense of rightness. Yeah, when someone else sees things the same way, it makes us feel more confident that our views are correct. It's like having an ally in our perspective.\n\nOption C talks about anticipating positive interactions with that person. If someone shares our attitudes, we can probably have smoother conversations and fewer disagreements, which would be more enjoyable. So, expecting positive interactions makes sense too.\n\nNow, considering all these points, it seems like all three options have merit. Positive reinforcement, boosted confidence in our beliefs, and expectations of positive interactions\u2014all of these could attract us to people who are similar to us in attitudes.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is D: all of the above. But let's double-check. Is there any reason to think that only one of these is the primary reason?\n\nWell, positive reinforcement is a strong psychological factor. When we receive agreement, it's rewarding, and we're likely to seek it out again. So, A is definitely a player.\n\nSimilarly, having our sense of rightness bolstered is also appealing. It enhances our self-esteem and confidence in our judgments. So, B is also a significant factor.\n\nAnd C, anticipating positive interactions, is pretty straightforward. Who doesn't want interactions that are pleasant and free from conflict?\n\nGiven that all three seem to contribute to why we're attracted to people who share our attitudes, it makes sense that the comprehensive answer is D: all of the above.\n\nBut, to be thorough, maybe there's another perspective. Is there any downside to being attracted to people solely based on attitude similarity? Well, yes, there is. It can lead to echo chambers where only similar thoughts are reinforced, and diverse opinions are shut out. But that's more about the consequences rather than the reasons for being attracted to them in the first place.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think D: all of the above, is the most complete answer. We seek out people who agree with us for positive reinforcement, to bolster our sense of rightness, and because we anticipate positive interactions with them.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
