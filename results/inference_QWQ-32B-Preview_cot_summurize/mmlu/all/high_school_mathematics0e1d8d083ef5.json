                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have an equilateral triangle with a side length of 8, and we need to find the area of a square that has the same perimeter as this triangle. The options are 9, 16, 36, and 49.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic properties of equilateral triangles and squares. An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal, and a square has all four sides equal. The perimeter of a shape is the sum of the lengths of its sides.\n\nSo, for the equilateral triangle with side length 8, the perimeter P_triangle would be:\n\nP_triangle = 3 * side = 3 * 8 = 24\n\nNow, we need a square that has the same perimeter as this triangle. Let's denote the side length of the square as s. The perimeter of the square P_square would be:\n\nP_square = 4 * s\n\nSince the perimeters are equal:\n\n4 * s = 24\n\nSolving for s:\n\ns = 24 / 4 = 6\n\nNow that we have the side length of the square, we can find its area. The area A of a square is given by:\n\nA = s^2 = 6^2 = 36\n\nSo, the area of the square is 36.\n\nLooking back at the options, 36 is one of them. But let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, perimeter of the triangle: 3 sides, each 8 units, so 3*8=24. That seems correct.\n\nThen, perimeter of the square is also 24, so each side is 24/4=6. That seems right.\n\nArea of the square is 6*6=36. That matches option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach to this problem.\n\nAnother way is to think about the relationship between the perimeters directly. Since the perimeters are equal, and we're dealing with regular polygons (equilateral triangle and square), we can relate their side lengths.\n\nGiven that, we already did that by setting 4s = 3*8, which led us to s=6 and A=36.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think about the area in terms of formulas involving perimeter, but for a square, the area is simply (P/4)^2, where P is the perimeter.\n\nSo, A = (24/4)^2 = 6^2 = 36. Same result.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning. Therefore, the correct answer should be 36, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
