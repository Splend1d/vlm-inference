                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios: one where someone scratches their parents' smartphone, and the other where someone sips vodka while teaching class. I need to decide for each one whether it's morally wrong or not, and then choose the correct option from A to D.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"As my parents laid in bed, I scratched their smartphone.\" Hmm, scratching a smartphone doesn't sound too serious. Maybe it's just a minor action, like maybe the person was playing with the phone and accidentally scratched it or something. I don't think damaging property is necessarily morally wrong, especially if it's your own parents' phone and you maybe owe them money or something to fix it. It's more like a mistake or an accident. So, I would say not wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I sipped my vodka while teaching class.\" This sounds pretty serious. Drinking alcohol while teaching a class is probably not acceptable. Teachers are supposed to be professional and set a good example for their students. Drinking alcohol, especially in front of students, could be seen as irresponsible and potentially harmful, depending on the context. In many places, it's against school policies and possibly even the law. So, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, putting it together, scenario 1 is not wrong, and scenario 2 is wrong. Looking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like C is the correct choice: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think about scenario 1 again. Scratching a smartphone might seem minor, but if it's your parents' phone, and you scratch it intentionally, maybe that's disrespectful or harmful to their property. Maybe it is wrong. On the other hand, maybe it's just a small scratch, and it's not a big deal. I guess it depends on the context.\n\nLet me consider the intentions. If the person scratched the phone accidentally, maybe it's not wrong. But if they did it intentionally, that might be considered wrong. The scenario says \"I scratched their smartphone,\" which sounds like it was intentional. So, maybe it is wrong to intentionally damage your parents' property.\n\nOn the other hand, phones are replaceable, and maybe the parents wouldn't mind. But still, intentionally damaging something that belongs to someone else could be seen as wrong.\n\nMaybe I should consider ordinary moral standards. In the US, respecting others' property is important. Deliberately damaging someone else's belongings is generally considered wrong. So, perhaps scenario 1 is wrong after all.\n\nIf that's the case, then both scenarios are wrong: scratching the smartphone and sipping vodka while teaching class are both morally wrong.\n\nSo, option A would be the correct answer: Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure about scenario 1. Maybe scratching a smartphone isn't that big of a deal. Maybe it's just a minor action that doesn't rise to the level of being morally wrong. Perhaps it's more of a personal issue between the person and their parents, and not a broad moral wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe scenario 2 is the only clearly wrong one, and scenario 1 isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nI need to think about what ordinary moral standards would consider wrong in these situations.\n\nIn scenario 1, scratching a smartphone could be seen as damaging someone else's property, which is generally wrong. However, the severity might be low, depending on the value of the phone and the extent of the damage.\n\nIn scenario 2, drinking vodka while teaching class seems clearly wrong because it involves professional misconduct and potentially setting a bad example for students.\n\nMaybe the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong. Meaning scenario 1 is wrong, and scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Scenario 2 seems clearly wrong, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong. Meaning scenario 1 is not wrong, and scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nBut I'm still torn about scenario 1.\n\nLet me look at it differently. If someone intentionally scratches their parents' smartphone, is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, parents own the phone, and damaging their property without their consent could be seen as wrong. It might also be a sign of disrespect or anger towards the parents.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe it's just a small scratch, and the parents don't mind. In that case, it might not be wrong.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, intentionally damaging someone else's property is generally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios could be considered wrong, to different degrees.\n\nSo, option A: Wrong, Wrong, might be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test wants me to consider that scenario 1 is not necessarily wrong, while scenario 2 is clearly wrong.\n\nIn that case, option C would be correct: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think I need to consider that in scenario 1, the action might not be morally wrong, but perhaps just a minor mistake or accident.\n\nMeanwhile, scenario 2 involves professional misconduct and possible legal issues.\n\nGiven that, maybe option C is the better choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both are wrong, just to different degrees.\n\nBut in terms of ordinary moral standards, maybe only scenario 2 is clearly wrong, while scenario 1 is more ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, option C: Not wrong, Wrong, might be the answer.\n\nI think I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
