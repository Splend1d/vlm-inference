                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, my aunt has a small business making apple pies at home, and she hires some friends to help her. Now, the question is asking which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor. That means, which of these options would make her want to hire more people to help with making pies.\n\nOption A says that the price of apple peelers/corers rises. So, if the tools they use to peel and core apples become more expensive, would that make her want to hire more people? Probably not, because higher costs for tools might make it less attractive to produce more pies, which could lead to hiring fewer people, not more. So, this seems like it would decrease demand for labor, not increase it.\n\nOption B is about her friends gossiping all day and slowing down the dough-making process. If her helpers are not being productive and are slowing things down, that might mean they're less efficient. In this case, she might need to hire more people to make up for the lost productivity, but actually, it's more likely that she'd address the gossiping issue or look for more efficient workers rather than just hiring more people who might do the same thing. So, this doesn't seem like it would directly increase the demand for labor.\n\nOption C mentions there's a sale on ovens. If ovens are on sale, that means they're cheaper to buy. Ovens are a capital input in pie-making; they're a piece of equipment needed to bake the pies. If ovens are cheaper, she might decide to buy more ovens, which could allow her to produce more pies. If she's producing more pies, she might need more labor to handle the increased production. So, this could lead to an increased demand for labor.\n\nOption D is about a new study revealing that apples increase the risk of cancer. If apples are linked to health risks, that could negatively affect the demand for apple pies. People might be less willing to buy pies if they think eating apples is unhealthy. In this case, my aunt might see a decrease in orders, which would likely lead her to hire fewer people, not more.\n\nSo, considering all these options, it seems like option C, the sale on ovens, is the situation that would most likely increase her demand for labor. Cheaper ovens allow for more production capacity, which in turn requires more labor to operate those ovens and produce more pies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
