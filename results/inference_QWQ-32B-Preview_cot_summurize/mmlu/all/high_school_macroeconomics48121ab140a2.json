Let's look at each option to see which one results from stagflation.\n\nOption A: Unemployment decreases.\n\nThis is unlikely during stagflation because, by definition, stagflation includes high unemployment. So, unemployment decreasing would be counter to what stagflation entails.\n\nOption B: The price level decreases.\n\nAgain, this doesn't align with stagflation, which features high inflation. A decrease in the price level would suggest deflation, which is the opposite of inflation.\n\nOption C: The aggregate supply curve shifts to the right.\n\nA shift to the right in the aggregate supply curve typically indicates an increase in supply, which can lead to lower prices and higher output. However, stagflation is characterized by high prices and low output, so a rightward shift in the aggregate supply curve wouldn't cause stagflation.\n\nOption D: The Phillips curve shifts to the right.\n\nThe Phillips curve typically shows an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. However, during stagflation, both inflation and unemployment are high, which can be represented by a shift in the Phillips curve outward, meaning higher inflation at each level of unemployment.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most plausible result of stagflation is that the Phillips curve shifts to the right, reflecting higher inflation even at higher unemployment rates.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
