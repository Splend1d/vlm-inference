It says, \"The output of the system has an effect upon the input quantity, then the system is a...\" and gives options A, B, C, and D.\n\nSo, first, I need to understand what it means when the output affects the input. In a control system, the input is what we feed into the system, and the output is what the system produces. If the output is fed back to influence the input, that sounds like some kind of feedback mechanism.\n\nI recall that in control systems, there are two main types: open-loop and closed-loop. Let me think about the differences between them.\n\nAn open-loop control system is one where the output doesn't affect the input. It's like a simple on-off switch. You set the input, and the system produces an output based on that input, but there's no feedback to adjust the input based on the output.\n\nOn the other hand, a closed-loop control system does have feedback. The output is measured and compared to the desired input, and any difference is used to adjust the input to bring the output closer to the desired value. So, in a closed-loop system, the output indeed has an effect on the input.\n\nGiven that, if the output has an effect upon the input quantity, it sounds like a closed-loop control system.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. open loop control system.\n\nB. closed loop control system.\n\nC. either A or B.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nBased on my understanding, option B seems correct. But maybe I should consider if there are any other types of systems where output affects input.\n\nIs there any other type of control system where output feeds back to input besides closed-loop? I don't think so. Open-loop is specifically defined by the lack of feedback.\n\nMaybe I should think about examples. For instance, a washing machine operates on an open-loop system: you set the cycle, and it runs through without adjusting based on the output. Whereas a temperature control system in a heater is closed-loop: it measures the temperature and adjusts the heating element to maintain the set temperature.\n\nSo, in the heater example, the output (temperature) affects the input (heating element operation).\n\nTherefore, the system where output affects input is a closed-loop control system.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are systems where output affects input in a different way, not necessarily in a feedback loop for control purposes. Maybe some kind of recursive system or something. But in the context of control systems, I think closed-loop is the correct term.\n\nOption C says \"either A or B.\" But since open-loop doesn't have output affecting input, I don't think that's correct.\n\nOption D, \"none of the above,\" isn't likely, given that closed-loop is the appropriate term.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is B. closed loop control system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
