                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Sikhism. The question is: \"What term refers to the divine order as an all-embracing higher principle in Sikhism?\" And the options are A. Sansar, B. Hukam, C. Mantar, and D. Karam.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about Sikhism. Sikhism is a religion founded in the 15th century in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan. It's based on the teachings of Guru Nanak and ten successive Gurus. The main holy book in Sikhism is the Guru Granth Sahib.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Sansar: I think Sansar refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, similar to the concept of samsara in Hinduism and Buddhism. So, it might not be the term for divine order.\n\nB. Hukam: Hukam seems familiar. I think it has something to do with the will of God or divine command in Sikhism. Let me think more about it.\n\nC. Mantar: Mantar might be similar to a mantra in Hinduism and Buddhism, which is a sacred word or phrase that's repeated in prayer or meditation. But I'm not sure if it specifically refers to divine order.\n\nD. Karam: Karam could refer to karma, which is about actions and their consequences. In Sikhism, I believe it's related to one's deeds and how they affect one's spiritual journey.\n\nLooking back, Hukam seems the most likely answer because it relates to the will of God or divine order. In Sikhism, Hukam is considered the divine order or command that governs the universe. It's the principle that everything happens according to God's will.\n\nTo confirm, I can think about the teachings of the Sikh Gurus. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, emphasized the importance of living in harmony with Hukam, accepting God's will in all aspects of life.\n\nAlso, in the Guru Granth Sahib, there are mentions of Hukam, describing it as the divine law that encompasses all creation.\n\nSo, compared to the other options:\n\n- Sansar is more about the worldly existence and the cycle of rebirth.\n\n- Mantar refers to sacred utterances or prayers.\n\n- Karam relates to actions and their karmic consequences.\n\nTherefore, the term that refers to the divine order as an all-embracing higher principle in Sikhism is Hukam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
