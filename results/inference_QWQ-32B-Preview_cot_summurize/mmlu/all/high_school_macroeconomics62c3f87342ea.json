This is because consumption is a component of AD, which is represented by the equation AD = C + I + G + (X - M), where C is consumption, I is investment, G is government spending, and (X - M) is net exports.\n\nWhen AD increases, it leads to a new equilibrium in the short run where both the price level and real GDP change. Specifically:\n\n1. **Real GDP**: In the short run, with the aggregate supply (AS) curve assumed to be upward sloping, an increase in AD will lead to an increase in real GDP. This is because firms respond to higher demand by increasing production, which in turn requires more labor and other inputs.\n\n2. **Price Level**: Concurrently, the increase in AD\u4e5f\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ef7\u683c\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u5347\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u538b\u529b\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u5176\u751f\u4ea7\u80fd\u529b\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ef7\u683c\u3002\n\n3. **Unemployment**: As real GDP increases, unemployment typically decreases.
