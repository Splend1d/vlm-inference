It goes like this: \"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\"\n\nNow, you're asking for the final word of this pledge. Let's look at the options you've provided:\n\nA. America\n\nB. stands\n\nC. indivisible\n\nD. all\n\nLet's recall the end of the pledge. The last few words are \"liberty and justice for all.\" So, the final word there is \"all.\"\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure. Let's repeat the pledge in our minds:\n\n\"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\"\n\nYes, it definitely ends with \"all.\"\n\nNow, looking back at the options, D. all seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut, let's consider if there might be any confusion here. Sometimes, people might add or omit words depending on the version they learned. For instance, some versions include \"under God,\" while others might not. However, the standard, officially recognized pledge includes \"under God.\"\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in some contexts, people might say \"the United States of America\" or just \"America.\" But in the official pledge, it's \"the United States of America.\"\n\nSo, sticking to the official text, the last word is indeed \"all.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. all.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
