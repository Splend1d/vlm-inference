                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. The newspaper company sold 179,912 newspapers in one day, and I need to write that number in word form. There are four options provided, and I have to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, let's break down the number 179,912. It's a six-digit number. In the standard numbering system, the first three digits represent the thousands, and the last three represent the units.\n\nSo, 179,912 can be divided into two parts:\n\n- 179: This represents the thousands.\n\n- 912: This represents the units.\n\nNow, let's recall how to write numbers in word form. For numbers up to nine hundred ninety-nine, we have specific names for each hundred, and then we add the tens and units. For thousands, we write the number in hundreds and then add \"thousand.\"\n\nSo, for 179,000, it would be \"one hundred seventy-nine thousand.\" Then, for the remaining 912, we write \"nine hundred twelve.\"\n\nPutting it all together, it should be \"one hundred seventy-nine thousand nine hundred twelve.\"\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. one hundred seventy-nine thousand twelve\n\nB. one hundred seventy-nine nine hundred twelve\n\nC. one hundred seventy thousand nine hundred twelve\n\nD. one hundred seventy-nine thousand nine hundred twelve\n\nOption A is close but missing the \"nine hundred.\" It only has \"twelve,\" which isn't correct because there are nine hundred twelve units.\n\nOption B is unclear and doesn't make much sense in standard number wording.\n\nOption C has \"one hundred seventy thousand\" instead of \"one hundred seventy-nine thousand,\" which is incorrect.\n\nOption D matches what I came up with: \"one hundred seventy-nine thousand nine hundred twelve.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's verify the number step by step.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n- The first digit is 1, which is in the hundred thousands place, but since it's 179,912, the hundred thousands place is occupied by 1, and the ten thousands place is 7, and the thousands place is 9. So, it's 179 thousand.\n\n- Then, the next three digits are 912, which is nine hundred twelve.\n\nSo, combining them, it's \"one hundred seventy-nine thousand nine hundred twelve.\"\n\nYes, option D is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
