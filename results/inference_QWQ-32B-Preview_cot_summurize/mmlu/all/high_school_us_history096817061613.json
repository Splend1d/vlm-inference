It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here that's asking about maize cultivation among native peoples in Mexico and asking which of these options it's most analogous to. The options are:\n\nA. Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux\n\nB. Wolf domestication by the Algonquians\n\nC. Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois\n\nD. Seal hunting among the Inuit\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"analogous\" means. Analogous means similar or comparable in certain ways, especially in function or role, but not necessarily in origin or structure. So, I'm looking for something that serves a similar purpose or has a similar role in the culture, even if the specifics are different.\n\nMaize cultivation in Mexico was a central part of the economy and society for many native groups. It was a staple food crop that required significant labor and attention. It was also tied to cultural practices, rituals, and identity.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux: The Lakota Sioux were Plains Indians who were heavily dependent on buffalo for food, clothing, tools, and other necessities. Buffalo hunting was central to their way of life, similar to how maize cultivation was central to many Mexican native groups. However, hunting is different from cultivation; one is taking animals from the wild, the other is cultivating plants.\n\nB. Wolf domestication by the Algonquians: I'm not entirely sure about this one. I know that some Native American tribes had relationships with wolves, but domestication is different from cultivation. Domestication involves taming and breeding animals, while cultivation is about growing plants. So, this seems less analogous to maize cultivation.\n\nC. Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois: The Iroquois practiced a form of agriculture that included growing crops like maize, beans, and squash together, known as the \"Three Sisters.\" This is very similar to maize cultivation, as it involves cultivating plants, specifically maize, as a staple crop. This seems very analogous to maize cultivation in Mexico.\n\nD. Seal hunting among the Inuit: The Inuit relied heavily on seals for food, clothing, and other materials. Seal hunting was central to their subsistence. Again, this is hunting, not cultivation, so it's different from growing maize.\n\nComparing these options, both A and C seem similar in that they were central to the respective cultures' subsistence. However, A is about hunting animals, while C is about cultivating plants, which is more similar to maize cultivation.\n\nBut wait, option C specifically mentions \"mixed agriculture,\" which includes maize, just like in Mexico. So, it's not just cultivation, but also a similar agricultural practice.\n\nOption A, buffalo hunting, is more similar in terms of centrality to the culture, but the actual practice is different.\n\nOption B, wolf domestication, seems less relevant to cultivation.\n\nOption D, seal hunting, is again hunting, not cultivation.\n\nTherefore, the most analogous practice to maize cultivation in Mexico would be mixed agriculture among the Iroquois, as both involve cultivating plants as a staple food source.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C.\n\nBut to make sure, let's think about it again. Maize cultivation is about growing a specific crop that is essential to the diet and culture. Mixed agriculture takes that a step further by growing multiple complementary crops together, which was also practiced in Mexico with the \"Three Sisters\" (maize, beans, and squash).\n\nThe Iroquois, like many native Mexican groups, practiced this type of agriculture, which makes it very similar or analogous to maize cultivation in Mexico.\n\nTherefore, C is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
