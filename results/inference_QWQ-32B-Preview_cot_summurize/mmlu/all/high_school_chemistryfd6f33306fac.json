However, one of them isn't as directly indicative of the relative strengths of these forces when comparing different substances. Let's think about each one:\n\nA. Heat of fusion: This is the energy required to change a substance from solid to liquid at its melting point. It's related to the strength of the intermolecular forces holding the solid together. Stronger forces would require more energy to break, so a higher heat of fusion would suggest stronger intermolecular attractions.\n\nB. Boiling points: The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the external pressure. Generally, higher boiling points indicate stronger intermolecular forces because more energy is needed to overcome these forces and turn the liquid into a gas.\n\nC. Vapor pressures: Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid or solid phase. Substances with higher vapor pressures at a given temperature have weaker intermolecular forces, as their molecules are more easily separated to enter the gas phase.\n\nD. Heat of vaporization: This is the energy required to change a substance from liquid to gas at its boiling point. Like heat of fusion, it's directly related to the strength of intermolecular forces. Stronger forces mean more energy is needed to vaporize the liquid.\n\nNow, when comparing substances, all these properties can give insights into the relative strengths of their intermolecular forces. However, vapor pressure is a bit different because it's not just a single value but depends on temperature. Boiling points, heat of fusion, and heat of vaporization are properties that are specific to a substance at a particular condition (e.g., standard pressure), making them more straightforward for comparison.\n\nVapor pressure, on the other hand, changes with temperature, so to compare vapor pressures between substances, you have to specify the same temperature. Without specifying the temperature, vapor pressure isn't as directly comparable as the other properties.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Vapor pressures, because without specifying a particular temperature, vapor pressure isn't a consistent measure for comparing the relative strengths of intermolecular forces across different substances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
