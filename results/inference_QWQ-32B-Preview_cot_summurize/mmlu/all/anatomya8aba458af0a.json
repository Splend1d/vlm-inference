                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which cells in the blood don't have a nucleus. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nFirst, lymphocytes. I know that lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell, and I think they do have a nucleus. In fact, one way to identify them under a microscope is by their large, round nucleus. So, I don't think they're the answer.\n\nNext, monocytes. Monocytes are also white blood cells, and I believe they too have a nucleus. In fact, their nucleus is usually oval-shaped. So, probably not monocytes.\n\nNow, erythrocytes. These are red blood cells. I remember that red blood cells have hemoglobin, which carries oxygen, but I'm not sure about their nucleus. Come to think of it, in some biology classes, I've heard that red blood cells lose their nucleus as they mature. Is that right? I think in mammals, including humans, erythrocytes don't have a nucleus. Yes, that sounds familiar.\n\nLastly, basophils. Basophils are another type of white blood cell, known for their role in inflammatory responses. I believe they have a nucleus, usually divided into two lobes. So, probably not basophils.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to this. Let me double-check. I recall that in some organisms, red blood cells do have a nucleus, like in birds and reptiles, but in humans, they don't. So, for human blood, erythrocytes don't have a nucleus.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other blood cells without a nucleus. Platelets come to mind. Platelets are cell fragments involved in blood clotting, and they don't have a nucleus. But platelets aren't listed in the options here. The options are lymphocyte, monocyte, erythrocyte, and basophil, all of which are types of white blood cells except for erythrocytes, which are red blood cells.\n\nSo, among these options, erythrocytes are the ones that lack a nucleus. I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure. Maybe there's a trick here. Are there any stages in which these cells lack a nucleus? For example, during cell division, nuclei might be less distinct, but that's not typically the case in circulating blood cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in certain conditions or diseases, nuclei are absent, but that seems unlikely.\n\nNo, I think it's straightforward. In normal human blood, erythrocytes do not have a nucleus, while lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils do.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Erythrocyte.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
