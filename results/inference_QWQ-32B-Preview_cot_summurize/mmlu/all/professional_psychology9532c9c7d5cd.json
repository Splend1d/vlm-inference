So, the options are:\n\nA. developing laws that govern the practice of psychology.\n\nB. providing sanctions for unethical and illegal behavior on the part of psychologists.\n\nC. protecting the public welfare.\n\nD. accrediting graduate programs in psychology.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a licensing board does in the context of psychology. I know that licensing boards are responsible for regulating the profession to ensure that only qualified individuals practice psychology and that they do so in an ethical and professional manner.\n\nOption A says that the primary function is developing laws that govern the practice of psychology. While licensing boards do establish rules and regulations for practicing psychology, I'm not sure if \"developing laws\" is the most accurate description. Laws are typically made by legislative bodies, and licensing boards may operate under those laws but might not be the ones creating them.\n\nOption B mentions providing sanctions for unethical and illegal behavior. This seems important because licensing boards do handle complaints and discipline psychologists who violate ethical standards or laws. However, I wonder if this is their primary function or more of a part of their overall role.\n\nOption C is protecting the public welfare. This feels like a fundamental purpose of licensing boards. By ensuring that only competent and ethical psychologists practice, the board is safeguarding the well-being of the public who seeks psychological services.\n\nOption D is accrediting graduate programs in psychology. I think accreditation is more related to educational institutions and program standards, which might be handled by separate bodies like the American Psychological Association's Commission on Accreditation.\n\nConsidering these points, I think the primary function of a psychology licensing board is to protect the public welfare by ensuring that psychologists are qualified and practice ethically. So, I would go with option C.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider this another way. If I think about the main reason why licensing boards exist, it's to regulate the profession in the interest of protecting the public. They set standards for education, experience, and ethics that psychologists must meet to be licensed. They also have processes to investigate complaints and take action against those who violate these standards.\n\nSo, while developing regulations (option A) and providing sanctions (option B) are part of their activities, these seem like means to achieve the end goal of protecting the public. Similarly, accrediting programs (option D) is more about ensuring educational quality, which is related but perhaps not the direct responsibility of a licensing board.\n\nTherefore, I believe that protecting the public welfare is the best description of the primary function of a psychology licensing board.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
