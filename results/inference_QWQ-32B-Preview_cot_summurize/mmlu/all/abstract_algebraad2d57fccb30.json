                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** If H and K are subgroups of G and one of H or K is a normal subgroup of G, then HK is a subgroup of G.\n\nFirst, recall that for two subgroups H and K of a group G, their product HK is defined as the set {hk | h \u2208 H, k \u2208 K}. For HK to be a subgroup of G, it must satisfy the subgroup criteria: closure, identity, inverses, and associativity (which is inherited from G).\n\nNow, if one of H or K is normal in G, say H is normal, then for any k \u2208 K and h \u2208 H, we have k hk^{-1} \u2208 H. This normality condition helps in showing that HK is closed under the group operation and inverses.\n\nLet's check closure: Take elements h1k1 and h2k2 in HK. Their product is h1k1h2k2. Since H is normal, we can write k1h2k1^{-1} as some element h3 in H, so k1h2 = h3k1. Thus, h1k1h2k2 = h1h3k1k2, which is in HK because h1h3 \u2208 H and k1k2 \u2208 K.\n\nFor inverses: If hk \u2208 HK, then its inverse is k^{-1}h^{-1}. Since H is normal, k^{-1}h^{-1}k \u2208 H, so k^{-1}h^{-1} = (k^{-1}h^{-1}k)k^{-1}, which is in HK.\n\nTherefore, HK is indeed a subgroup of G if one of H or K is normal in G. So, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** All groups of order p^2, where p is prime, are Abelian.\n\nThis is a well-known result in group theory. Let's recall the proof sketch.\n\nLet G be a group of order p^2, where p is prime.\n\nFirst, by the class equation or using the fact that the center of a p-group is non-trivial, we know that the center Z(G) of G is non-trivial, meaning |Z(G)| is either p or p^2.\n\nIf |Z(G)| = p^2, then G is Abelian.\n\nIf |Z(G)| = p, then G/Z(G) is a group of order p, which is cyclic. It is a standard result that if G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is Abelian.\n\nWait, actually, if G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is Abelian. But in this case, if |Z(G)| = p and G/Z(G) is cyclic of order p, then G is indeed Abelian.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory to what I just said. Let me correct myself.\n\nIf G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is Abelian. This is a standard result. So, if |Z(G)| = p and G/Z(G) is cyclic of order p, then G is Abelian.\n\nBut actually, in this case, if |Z(G)| = p and G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is Abelian, which would imply that Z(G) = G, meaning |Z(G)| = p^2, which contradicts |Z(G)| = p.\n\nThis suggests that the assumption |Z(G)| = p leads to a contradiction, hence |Z(G)| must be p^2, meaning G is Abelian.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the possible structures of G. By the fundamental theorem of finite Abelian groups, the only groups of order p^2 up to isomorphism are Z_{p^2} and Z_p \u00d7 Z_p, both of which are Abelian.\n\nTherefore, all groups of order p^2 are Abelian. So, Statement 2 is true.\n\nGiven that both statements are true, the correct choice is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
