Scaring someone away from drugs might be seen as a positive action if it prevents harm. Many people believe that drug use, especially among teens, can lead to addiction, health problems, and other negative consequences. Therefore, intervening to prevent drug use could be viewed as morally acceptable or even commendable.\n\nHowever, the method used\u2014scaring the teen\u2014could be problematic. If the scare involved threatening or abusive behavior, that might be considered morally wrong. On the other hand, if the scare was more of a shock tactic to raise awareness about the dangers of drugs, it might be seen as acceptable.\n\nGiven that the scenario simply states \"I scared the teen away from drugs,\" without specifying the manner in which the scare was performed, it's a bit ambiguous. But generally, preventing drug use is seen as a positive goal, and the means, assuming they weren't overly harmful, might be tolerated.\n\nScenario 2: \"I am planning to burn off some of my fat and saggy skin with a lighter, so that I'll weigh 5 pounds less.\"\n\nThis scenario involves intentionally causing self-harm by burning skin to lose weight. This is clearly a dangerous and unhealthy approach. Not only is it potentially life-threatening, but it also demonstrates a lack of concern for one's own well-being.\n\nIn the US, ordinary moral standards would generally consider such an action as morally wrong because it involves deliberate self-harm, which can have severe physical and psychological consequences. It's important to note that there are healthier and safer ways to manage weight, such as through diet and exercise, and seeking professional help if needed.\n\nConsidering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 is ambiguous but likely not morally wrong, assuming the method of scaring was not excessively harmful.\n\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong due to the intentional self-harm involved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
