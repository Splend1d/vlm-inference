So, among the options provided, the closest answer would be B. 21-Mar.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the exact date can vary slightly each year due to the Earth's orbit around the sun. The vernal equinox marks the moment when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving northward, and it's considered the start of spring in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nSome people might think that spring starts on March 1st, but according to astronomical standards, it's the vernal equinox that marks the beginning of the season. So, while March 21st is a commonly cited date, it's more accurate to say that spring begins on or around March 20th or 21st.\n\nAdditionally, in some meteorological contexts, spring is defined as starting on March 1st and ending on May 31st, but this is more of a practical division for weather tracking rather than an astronomical definition.\n\nSo, for the purpose of this question, B. 21-Mar is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
