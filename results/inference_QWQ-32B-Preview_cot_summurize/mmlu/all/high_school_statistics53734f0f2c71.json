                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have data from a food bank about donations in November. They received 100 checks, with an average donation of $155 and a standard deviation of $32. The question is asking for the most appropriate statement based on this data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each option is saying and whether it accurately represents the data.\n\nOption A: \"This November, the average donation is $155.\"\n\nWell, the data says that the average of the 100 checks is $155. But does this mean that the average donation for the entire month is exactly $155? Probably not, because this is just a sample of donations, and there might be more donations not included in these 100 checks. So, this seems a bit too definitive. Maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nOption B: \"50% of all donations this November are more than $155.\"\n\nThis sounds like it's talking about the median donation. The median is the value where half the donations are above and half are below. But the average (mean) is $155, which isn't necessarily the same as the median unless the distribution is symmetric. Since we don't know the shape of the donation distribution, we can't assume that the mean and median are the same. So, this option might not be accurate.\n\nOption C: \"We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\"\n\nThis sounds like a confidence interval. To calculate a confidence interval for the mean, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{confidence interval} = \\bar{x} \\pm z^* \\left( \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean, \\(z^*\\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level, \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation, and \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\nGiven that the sample size \\(n = 100\\), the sample mean \\(\\bar{x} = 155\\), and the sample standard deviation \\(s = 32\\), we can plug these values into the formula.\n\nFirst, for a 95% confidence level, the critical value \\(z^*\\) is approximately 1.96.\n\nSo, the margin of error is:\n\n\\[\n1.96 \\times \\left( \\frac{32}{\\sqrt{100}} \\right) = 1.96 \\times \\left( \\frac{32}{10} \\right) = 1.96 \\times 3.2 = 6.272\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the 95% confidence interval is:\n\n\\[\n155 \\pm 6.272 \\rightarrow (148.728, 161.272)\n\\]\n\nBut option C says the interval is between $91 and $219, which is way off from my calculation. So, this can't be right.\n\nOption D: \"We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.\"\n\nThis seems closer to the interval I calculated earlier, which was approximately $148.73 to $161.27. So, this looks like a correctly calculated 95% confidence interval.\n\nWait a minute, in option C, I calculated a different interval, but now in option D, it's closer to what I got. But let me double-check my calculation.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\text{margin of error} = 1.96 \\times \\left( \\frac{32}{\\sqrt{100}} \\right) = 1.96 \\times 3.2 = 6.272\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n155 - 6.272 = 148.728\n\\]\n\n\\[\n155 + 6.272 = 161.272\n\\]\n\nYes, so the 95% confidence interval is approximately $148.73 to $161.27. Option D says \"between about $149 and $161,\" which is a reasonable approximation.\n\nComparing this to option C, which has a much wider interval from $91 to $219, that doesn't make sense based on my calculation. Maybe they misapplied the formula or used the wrong standard deviation.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the most appropriate statement based on the data provided.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider again why the other options are less suitable.\n\nOption A is too definitive; it doesn't account for sampling variability.\n\nOption B assumes that the mean is equal to the median, which we can't assume without knowing the distribution.\n\nOption C has an incorrect confidence interval, likely due to a mistake in calculation.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
