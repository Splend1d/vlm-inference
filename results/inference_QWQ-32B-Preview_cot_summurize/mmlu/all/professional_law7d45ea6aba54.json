                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. So, there's a bicycle rider who's new to biking, and she takes her bike for a test ride. At an intersection, she can't stop for a red light and ends up going into the intersection, where she slips off her bike. While she's trying to get back on, a car comes in with a green light and hits her, causing serious injuries. The car driver was distracted by his cell phone and got a careless driving ticket from the police.\n\nThe woman is filing a claim for damages and says that the car driver was negligent per se. She also claims that this negligence per se prevents the driver from using comparative negligence as a defense, based on a state statute. Now, the question is whether the trial court will likely grant her motion to preclude the man's comparative negligence defense.\n\nLet's break this down. First, what is negligence per se? It's a type of negligence that occurs when someone violates a law that's designed to protect against the kind of harm that happened. In this case, the driver was distracted by his cell phone and received a careless driving ticket, so it seems like he violated a law meant to prevent accidents.\n\nNow, comparative negligence is a legal concept that allows the court to apportion fault between the plaintiff and the defendant. So, if both parties are at fault to some degree, the damages can be divided accordingly.\n\nThe woman is arguing that because the driver was negligent per se, he can't use comparative negligence as a defense. She wants to prevent him from arguing that she was also at fault because she ran the red light.\n\nOption A says yes, the court will grant her motion because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident, which abrogates the comparative negligence law. I'm not sure about this. Last clear chance is a different doctrine that sometimes allows a plaintiff to recover even if they were negligent, if the defendant had the last opportunity to avoid the accident. But here, the woman is trying to prevent the defendant from using comparative negligence, not necessarily invoking last clear chance herself.\n\nOption B says yes, because negligence per se is a final judgment of total negligence against the driver and it cannot be modified or rebutted. This seems too absolute. Negligence per se is a presumption of negligence, but it doesn't necessarily mean total negligence, and it can sometimes be rebutted depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nOption C says no, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute. This seems plausible. Even if the driver is negligent per se, the comparative negligence statute might still allow for apportioning fault between both parties.\n\nOption D says no, because she entered the intersection knowing it was a red light, thereby putting herself voluntarily and knowingly in danger, and she assumed the risk. This seems similar to contributory negligence, which is different from comparative negligence. In comparative negligence systems, the plaintiff's own negligence can reduce their damages, but doesn't bar recovery completely unless they're more at fault than the defendant.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option C is the most likely correct answer. Negligence per se is a presumption, but it doesn't necessarily prevent the application of comparative negligence statutes. The court would likely allow the defendant to present evidence of the plaintiff's contributory negligence.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's think about the specifics of the case. The woman ran a red light, which is a clear violation of traffic laws. The driver was distracted and driving carelessly, which also violates traffic laws. Both parties seem to have contributed to the accident.\n\nIn a comparative negligence jurisdiction, the damages would be apportioned based on the percentage of fault of each party. So, if the plaintiff is found to be 40% at fault and the defendant 60% at fault, the plaintiff would recover 60% of the damages.\n\nThe woman is trying to prevent the defendant from using comparative negligence by arguing negligence per se. However, negligence per se is usually just a presumption that the defendant was negligent, and it doesn't necessarily preclude the defendant from presenting evidence of the plaintiff's negligence.\n\nMoreover, many statutes that allow for comparative negligence are designed to be broad and to apply even in cases where negligence per se is found. The legislature likely intended to allow for apportionment of fault in most situations, unless specifically excepted.\n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that the trial court would grant the woman's motion to preclude the man's comparative negligence defense. The court would probably allow the defense to argue that the woman's own negligence contributed to the accident.\n\nSo, the answer is C. No, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
