                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which biome the researcher is most likely in based on the information that she found 35 percent more species than in any other biome she's studied. The options are tundra, taiga, tropical rainforest, and temperate deciduous forest.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic facts about each of these biomes and particularly focus on their biodiversity, since the number of species is the key here.\n\nStarting with the tundra: I know that tundras are found in the Arctic and alpine regions. They have low temperatures and a short growing season, which limits the variety of species that can survive there. So, probably not the biome with the highest species diversity.\n\nNext, the taiga, also known as the boreal forest, is found in the subarctic regions. It's characterized by coniferous forests and has a colder climate than the temperate forests. While it does have a variety of species, it's still colder than other biomes and might not have as high biodiversity as some others.\n\nThe tropical rainforest is known for having the highest biodiversity on Earth. It's located near the equator, has high temperatures and rainfall, which supports a vast array of plant and animal species. This seems like a strong candidate for having more species than other biomes.\n\nLastly, the temperate deciduous forest is found in regions with four distinct seasons, including warm summers and cold winters. It has a good variety of species, but generally not as high as the tropical rainforest.\n\nGiven that the researcher found 35 percent more species in this biome compared to any other she's studied, it suggests that this biome has significantly higher biodiversity. Among the options provided, the tropical rainforest is renowned for its exceptional biodiversity.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is C. Tropical rainforest.\n\nTo double-check, I can consider that the tundra and taiga are both located in colder climates, which typically support less biodiversity due to harsh conditions. The temperate deciduous forest has more species than the tundra and taiga but still less than the tropical rainforest.\n\nHence, the tropical rainforest is the biome with the highest species richness, making it the most probable answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
