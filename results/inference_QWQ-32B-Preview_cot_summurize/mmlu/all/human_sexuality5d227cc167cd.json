                    "text": "This question is about understanding different terms related to gender identity and expression. Let's break down each option to see which one best describes Bill's situation.\n\nA. Female Impersonator: This term usually refers to someone who dresses as a woman for entertainment purposes, like in theater or comedy shows. They typically do this on stage and it's part of their performance art.\n\nB. Drag Queen: A drag queen is a man who dresses in women's clothing and often exaggerates feminine characteristics for entertainment or self-expression. Drag is often associated with the LGBTQ+ community and can involve performing in shows or at events.\n\nC. Transsexual: This term is used to describe someone who identifies with a gender different from their assigned sex at birth and may seek medical interventions like hormones or surgery to align their physical appearance with their gender identity.\n\nD. Transvestite: This term generally refers to a man who enjoys wearing women's clothing for sexual arousal or other personal reasons, but does not necessarily identify as female or seek to live as a woman.\n\nNow, looking at Bill's description: He is a successful ad executive, married with two children, and engages in cross-dressing when his wife is not home. He puts on her clothes, becomes sexually excited, and masturbates. There's no mention of him identifying as female or seeking to live as a woman beyond these private moments.\n\nGiven this information, option D, transvestite, seems to fit best. He enjoys wearing women's clothing for sexual arousal and does so in private, without any indication of wanting to transition or present as female in public.\n\nOption A, female impersonator, doesn't fit because there's no mention of him performing or entertaining others.\n\nOption B, drag queen, also doesn't apply because there's no indication that he exaggerates feminine characteristics or performs for entertainment.\n\nOption C, transsexual, isn't appropriate here because there's no suggestion that Bill identifies as female or wants to live as a woman beyond his private cross-dressing.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description for Bill is D, transvestite.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
