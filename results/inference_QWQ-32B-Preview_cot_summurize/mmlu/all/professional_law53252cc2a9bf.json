Two years later, at trial, the defense called another doctor as an expert witness.

On cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney brings out the fact that, one week before trial, the expert witness and the surgeon signed an agreement to become partners in an outpatient plastic surgery clinic. The plaintiff's attorney suggests that the expert's testimony was awfully convenient and likely motivated by his desire to maintain a good relationship with the defendant. The defendant then calls another surgeon at the hospital as a witness. He is asked to tell the jury about a conversation he had with the expert inunediately following the patient's death. The witness stated that \"the expert told me the patient's death was a textbook example of a freak accident and there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it. \"On objection to this testimony, defendant's attorney seeks a ruling on the admissibility of this question and answer.

                    "text": "So in this case, we have a medical malpractice lawsuit where a patient died during plastic surgery, and the husband is suing the surgeon. Two years later, at trial, the defense calls another doctor as an expert witness, who testifies that the death was a freak accident and that the surgeon's performance met high medical standards. During cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney reveals that the expert witness and the surgeon became partners in a plastic surgery clinic just a week before the trial, suggesting that the expert's testimony was influenced by this relationship.\n\nThen, the defendant calls another surgeon from the hospital to testify about a conversation he had with the expert witness immediately following the patient's death. The witness says that the expert told him the death was a textbook example of a freak accident and that nothing could have been done to prevent it. The plaintiff's attorney objects to this testimony, and now the court needs to decide whether to allow it.\n\nThe question is asking what the trial judge should do: sustain the objection (meaning agree with the plaintiff's attorney that the testimony shouldn't be allowed), or overrule the objection (allow the testimony). The options are:\n\nA. Sustain the objection, because the testimony is hearsay.\n\nB. Overrule the objection, because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.\n\nC. Sustain the objection, because a prior consistent statement cannot be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony.\n\nD. Overrule the objection, because the expert's statement is a statement against interest.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening here. The expert witness testified in court, and during cross-examination, his credibility was attacked by suggesting that his partnership with the surgeon influenced his testimony. Now, the defense is trying to bolster the expert's credibility by introducing a prior statement from him that is consistent with his trial testimony.\n\nThis seems like an attempt to rehabilitate the witness's credibility after it was impeached during cross-examination.\n\nLet's look at the concept of hearsay. Hearsay is generally defined as an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the witness is testifying about what the expert told him immediately after the patient's death. This is an out-of-court statement (since it was said after the death but before the trial) being offered to prove that the patient's death was a freak accident, which is the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule, and one of them is for prior consistent statements used to rehabilitate a witness's credibility.\n\nSo, option A says to sustain the objection because it's hearsay. But, if the statement qualifies as a prior consistent statement used for rehabilitation, it might be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nOption B says to overrule the objection because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement. This seems plausible.\n\nOption C says to sustain the objection because a prior consistent statement cannot be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony. This directly contradicts option B.\n\nOption D says to overrule the objection because the expert's statement is a statement against interest. A statement against interest is another hearsay exception, but in this case, the statement is that the death was a freak accident and nothing could have been done, which might not be against the expert's interest, especially if he's being sued for malpractice.\n\nWait, actually, in this scenario, the expert is testifying on behalf of the surgeon who is being sued. So, saying that it was a freak accident and nothing could have been done might be consistent with the defense's position but not necessarily against the expert's own interest, unless there's potential liability involved.\n\nBut the key here is that the plaintiff's attorney impeached the expert's testimony by suggesting that his partnership with the surgeon influenced his testimony. So, now the defense is trying to show that the expert had already expressed the same opinion immediately after the event, before any partnership was in place, which could support the idea that his current testimony is not influenced by the partnership.\n\nIn evidence law, prior consistent statements can be used to rebut charges of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive. Here, the plaintiff's attorney is suggesting that the expert's testimony is a recent fabrication influenced by the partnership. Therefore, introducing a prior consistent statement made before the partnership was formed could be relevant to show that his current testimony is consistent with what he said earlier, before any alleged influence.\n\nSo, under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B), a statement is not hearsay if it is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive, and it is consistent with the declarant's testimony and is offered to rebut the charge.\n\nIn this case, the expert's prior statement to the other surgeon immediately after the patient's death is consistent with his trial testimony and is offered to rebut the charge that his testimony is a recent fabrication influenced by the partnership.\n\nTherefore, this prior consistent statement should be admissible to rehabilitate the expert's credibility.\n\nSo, option B seems correct: overrule the objection, because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, in fact, prior consistent statements can be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony under certain circumstances, as described.\n\nOption D is not applicable here because the statement doesn't seem to be against the expert's interest. It's supporting the defense's position, which the expert is already aligning with by testifying on their behalf.\n\nTherefore, the trial judge should overrule the objection and allow the testimony.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
