So, it's 142.76 minus 16.5.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the decimal points are aligned correctly. Sometimes, if I don't line up the decimals, I can make a mistake in subtracting the digits.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n```\n\n 142.76\n\n-  16.50\n\n--------\n\n```\n\nI added an extra zero to 16.5 to make it 16.50. This doesn't change the value but helps me align the decimals properly and keep track of the places.\n\nNow, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n- Hundredths place: 6 minus 0 is 6.\n\n- Tenths place: 7 minus 5 is 2.\n\n- Units place: 2 minus 6. Hmm, 2 is less than 6, so I need to borrow from the tens place.\n\nLet's borrow 1 from the tens place. The 2 becomes 12, and the tens place (which is 4) becomes 3.\n\nNow, subtracting:\n\n- Units place: 12 minus 6 is 6.\n\n- Tens place: 3 minus 1 is 2.\n\n- Hundreds place: 1 minus 0 is 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I get 126.26.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 159.26\n\nB. 2.224\n\nC. 14,111\n\nD. 126.26\n\nOption D matches my answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can check my answer by adding 126.26 and 16.5 to see if I get back to 142.76.\n\nLet's try that:\n\n```\n\n 126.26\n\n+  16.50\n\n--------\n\n 142.76\n\n```\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the correct answer is D. 126.26.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
