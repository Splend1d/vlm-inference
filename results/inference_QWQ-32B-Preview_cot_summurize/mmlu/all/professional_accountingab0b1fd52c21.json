                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the company's new time clock system. So, the system requires hourly employees to select an ID number and then choose whether they're clocking in or out. There's also a video camera that captures an image of the employee using the system. The question is asking which exposure\u2014the options are A, B, C, and D\u2014the new system is expected to change the least.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each exposure means:\n\nA. Fraudulent reporting of employees' own hours.\n\nThis likely refers to employees lying about their own working hours, maybe clocking in early or clocking out late when they haven't actually worked those hours.\n\nB. Errors in employees' overtime computation.\n\nThis is about mistakes in calculating overtime hours for employees, which could lead to incorrect pay.\n\nC. Inaccurate accounting of employees' hours.\n\nThis is similar to A but might include both intentional and unintentional errors in recording hours worked.\n\nD. Recording of other employees' hours.\n\nThis probably refers to employees clocking in or out for their coworkers, which is a form of fraud.\n\nNow, let's think about how the new system addresses each of these issues.\n\nThe new system requires employees to select their ID and choose clock-in or clock-out, with a video capture of the employee using the system.\n\nFor option A, fraudulent reporting of their own hours: The video capture should help verify that the employee is actually present when clocking in or out, which should reduce the likelihood of them clocking in early or out late falsely. So, this should change or reduce this exposure.\n\nOption B, errors in overtime computation: The system is about recording hours, but computing overtime correctly would depend on how the system integrates with the payroll system. If the system accurately records hours, then the payroll system should compute overtime correctly, assuming it's programmed properly. So, this new system should help reduce errors in overtime computation.\n\nOption C, inaccurate accounting of employees' hours: Similar to A, the video capture should ensure that only the actual employee is clocking in or out, reducing inaccuracies in hour recording, both intentional and unintentional.\n\nOption D, recording of other employees' hours: With the video capture, it should be easy to detect if someone is clocking in or out for another employee, as the image would show who actually used the system. This should significantly reduce this type of fraud.\n\nThe question is asking for which exposure the new system can be expected to change the least. Given that all options seem to be addressed by the new system, I need to find which one is likely to be affected the least.\n\nLet's consider each one again:\n\nA. Fraudulent reporting of own hours: The video should deter and catch employees who try to clock in early or out late falsely.\n\nB. Errors in overtime computation: This seems more related to the accuracy of the system's integration with payroll rather than the time clocking process itself. If the system accurately records hours, then overtime computation should be accurate, assuming the payroll system is correctly set up.\n\nC. Inaccurate accounting of hours: Similar to A, the video should ensure that only the actual employee clocks in and out, reducing inaccuracies.\n\nD. Recording of other employees' hours: The video should make it easy to identify if someone is clocking in for another employee.\n\nComparing these, options A, C, and D are all related to fraud or errors in recording hours, and the video capture should significantly impact these.\n\nOption B, errors in overtime computation, seems a bit different. It's more about the accuracy of the payroll system's calculation based on the hours recorded. The time clock system ensures that the hours recorded are accurate, but the computation of overtime depends on how the payroll system processes those hours.\n\nSo, perhaps the new time clock system would change this exposure the least, assuming that the payroll system is already accurate and the main issue was inaccurate hour recording, which the new system addresses.\n\nWait, but if the time clock system accurately records hours, then overtime computation should be more accurate. So, it should change this exposure for the better.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the new system focuses on ensuring that the right employee is recording their own hours accurately, but it may not directly address errors in overtime computation that could arise from how the payroll system interprets those hours.\n\nFor example, if the payroll system has bugs or incorrect rules for calculating overtime, the time clock system wouldn't fix that.\n\nSo, in that case, while the time clock system improves the accuracy of hour recording, it may not necessarily improve the accuracy of overtime computation if the issue lies in the payroll system's algorithms.\n\nTherefore, among the options, errors in employees' overtime computation (option B) might be the exposure that the new system changes the least, because it's more dependent on the payroll system's functionality rather than the time clocking process.\n\nLet me check the other options again to confirm.\n\nOption A: Fraudulent reporting of own hours. The video capture should significantly reduce this by ensuring the employee is present when clocking in or out.\n\nOption C: Inaccurate accounting of employees' hours. Similar to A, the video should make this more accurate.\n\nOption D: Recording of other employees' hours. The video should make it easy to detect and prevent this.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the one that the new system would change the least, as it's more about the payroll system's computation rather than the time clocking process.\n\nSo, my answer is B._errors in employees' overtime computation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
