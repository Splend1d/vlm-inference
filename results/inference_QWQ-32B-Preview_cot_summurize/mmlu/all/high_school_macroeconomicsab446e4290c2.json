                    "text": "So, I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure out the best fiscal policy for the U.S. economy when it's in a recession and there's a budget deficit. I need to understand how this policy affects the market for loanable funds, the interest rate, and the market for the U.S. dollar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a recessionary gap is. A recessionary gap occurs when the economy's output is below its potential GDP. This usually means there's high unemployment and businesses aren't operating at full capacity. So, the government needs to implement fiscal policies to stimulate the economy and close this gap.\n\nFiscal policy refers to the government's decisions about taxing and spending. There are two main tools: taxes and government spending. During a recession, the government can either increase spending or decrease taxes to boost economic activity.\n\nNow, considering there's already a budget deficit, which means government spending exceeds tax revenues, the government has to be careful about how it proceeds. Increasing spending or cutting taxes would likely worsen the deficit, but sometimes it's necessary to stimulate the economy.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Tax increase - Demand rises - Falling - Demand falls\n\nB. Tax cut - Supply rises - rising - Demand rises\n\nC. Tax cut - Demand rises - rising - Demand rises\n\nD. Tax increase - Supply falls - Falling - Demand rises\n\nHmm, these options are a bit confusing because they mix different effects. I need to think about what each fiscal policy action would do in this scenario.\n\nLet's consider a tax cut first. If the government cuts taxes, individuals and businesses have more disposable income. This should increase consumption and investment, which are components of aggregate demand. So, aggregate demand should rise. That makes sense for closing a recessionary gap.\n\nNow, how does a tax cut affect the market for loanable funds? The market for loanable funds is where savers supply funds, and borrowers demand funds for investment. If the government cuts taxes, people have more money to save, which could increase the supply of loanable funds. However, at the same time, the government might need to borrow more because of the reduced tax revenues, which would increase the demand for loanable funds.\n\nSo, the net effect on the supply and demand in the loanable funds market isn't straightforward. But perhaps in the short run, the increase in government borrowing due to the tax cut would dominate, leading to an increase in demand for loanable funds.\n\nIf demand for loanable funds increases, and supply remains constant or increases less than demand, the interest rate should rise.\n\nNow, how does this affect the market for the U.S. dollar? If interest rates rise, it makes holding U.S. assets more attractive to foreign investors, which increases the demand for the U.S. dollar. So, the demand for the dollar should rise.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C says:\n\nC. Tax cut - Demand rises - rising - Demand rises\n\nThis seems to align with what I just thought: a tax cut leads to an increase in demand for loanable funds, which causes the interest rate to rise, and the demand for the dollar to rise.\n\nOption B says:\n\nB. Tax cut - Supply rises - rising - Demand rises\n\nBut I was thinking that a tax cut might increase the supply of loanable funds, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a matter of perspective.\n\nWait, perhaps the tax cut increases disposable income, which could lead to both increased consumption (demand) and increased savings (supply). But in the context of stimulating the economy, the focus might be on the increased consumption, which boosts demand.\n\nOption A says:\n\nA. Tax increase - Demand rises - Falling - Demand falls\n\nThis seems counterintuitive. If the government increases taxes, people have less disposable income, which should decrease consumption and shift aggregate demand to the left, worsening the recession. So, this doesn't make sense as a response to a recessionary gap.\n\nOption D says:\n\nD. Tax increase - Supply falls - Falling - Demand rises\n\nAgain, a tax increase would typically reduce disposable income, which might reduce savings, decreasing the supply of loanable funds. But I'm not sure about the logic here.\n\nGiven that, option C seems the most plausible. A tax cut boosts aggregate demand, increases the demand for loanable funds, raises interest rates, and increases the demand for the dollar.\n\nBut wait, I should consider the budget deficit aspect. If the government cuts taxes, and doesn't cut spending, the deficit increases. To finance the deficit, the government has to borrow more, which increases the demand for loanable funds, leading to higher interest rates. This is known as the crowding out effect, where government borrowing crowds out private investment.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Fiscal policy: tax cut to stimulate the economy.\n\n- Loanable funds: demand rises due to government borrowing.\n\n- Interest rate: rises.\n\n- Market for the dollar: demand rises due to higher interest rates.\n\nTherefore, option C seems correct.\n\nHowever, option B has \"supply rises\" instead of \"demand rises\" for loanable funds. That doesn't align with the crowding out effect I just mentioned.\n\nOption C has \"demand rises\" for loanable funds and \"rising\" interest rates, which matches my reasoning.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the government cuts taxes, it has less revenue, leading to a larger deficit. To finance this deficit, it needs to borrow more in the loanable funds market, increasing the demand for loanable funds. This shifts the demand curve to the right, leading to higher interest rates, assuming supply remains constant.\n\nHigher interest rates make the U.S. dollar more attractive to foreign investors, increasing the demand for the dollar in the foreign exchange market.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
