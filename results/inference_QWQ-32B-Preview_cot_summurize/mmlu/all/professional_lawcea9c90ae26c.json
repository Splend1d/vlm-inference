                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a man who got frostbite from spilling a soft drink he bought from a restaurant. He's suing the restaurant for negligence and wants damages. At the trial, his lawyer wants to call another witness who also got frostbite from spilling a soft drink from the same restaurant two weeks earlier. This witness also told the restaurant about her injury right away.\n\nNow, the restaurant's lawyer objects to this testimony. The question is, what should the judge rule? The options are:\n\nA. Let the testimony in to show the restaurant was negligent, but tell the jury not to consider it for damages.\n\nB. Let the testimony in to show the restaurant should have known about the danger of frostbite from their soft drinks.\n\nC. Don't let the testimony in because it's not relevant to a fact in question.\n\nD. Don't let the testimony in because it's about separate, unrelated things with a third party.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's being testified here. The witness is saying that she also got frostbite from spilling a soft drink from the same restaurant two weeks before. And she told the restaurant about it right away.\n\nSo, the man who's suing wants to use this testimony to help his case. But the restaurant's lawyer is objecting, probably saying it's not relevant or it's prejudicial or something.\n\nIn law, especially in trials, there are rules about what evidence can be admitted. One key rule is about the relevance of evidence. Evidence has to be relevant to the case, meaning it has to have some bearing on a fact that's in question.\n\nIn this case, the man is suing for negligence. Negligence generally requires that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, breached that duty, and that the breach caused harm to the plaintiff.\n\nSo, for the man's case, he needs to show that the restaurant had a duty to ensure their soft drinks weren't dangerously cold, that they failed in that duty, and that their failure caused his frostbite.\n\nNow, the witness is saying that she had a similar experience two weeks earlier and told the restaurant about it. So, this could be relevant to show that the restaurant knew or should have known about the potential danger of their soft drinks being too cold.\n\nIf the restaurant knew about the previous incident and didn't do anything to prevent it from happening again, that could show they were negligent in not taking steps to fix the problem.\n\nSo, option B seems plausible: the testimony is admissible to prove that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger.\n\nOption A says it's admissible to prove negligence, which is similar to B, but it also mentions giving a cautionary instruction about damages. Maybe the court would do that, but B seems more directly related to the issue of the restaurant's knowledge.\n\nOption C says the testimony is not probative of a fact in issue. But, as I just thought, it seems relevant to the restaurant's knowledge and thus their negligence. So, C might not be the best choice.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible because it's about separate, unrelated transactions with a third party. But the witness is also a customer of the restaurant, just like the man who's suing. So, it's not exactly a third party, and the transactions are related in that they both involve soft drinks from the same restaurant that caused frostbite.\n\nSo, between A and B, I think B is a better answer because it specifically addresses the issue of the restaurant's knowledge, which is crucial for establishing negligence.\n\nWait, but maybe A is also acceptable because it allows the testimony to prove negligence, with a caution about damages. Maybe the court would admit it for that purpose but warn the jury not to consider it for damages.\n\nHowever, damages are a separate issue from liability. The jury first decides if the restaurant is liable, and then, if they are, determines the amount of damages.\n\nSo, perhaps the testimony is relevant to show negligence, and the court can instruct the jury to consider it only for that purpose, not for damages.\n\nBut option B seems more precise because it focuses on the restaurant's awareness of the danger, which is a key element in negligence.\n\nLet me think about this differently. In negligence cases, one element is whether the defendant had knowledge or should have had knowledge of the dangerous condition.\n\nIf the restaurant knew about the previous incident and didn't fix the problem, that suggests they should have foreseen the risk and taken steps to prevent harm.\n\nTherefore, the witness's testimony about her own experience and informing the restaurant about it is directly relevant to that issue.\n\nSo, I think the judge should rule that the testimony is admissible to prove that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger posed by its soft drinks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
