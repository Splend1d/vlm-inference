                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a grocery store sells a bag of 5 lemons for $2.00, and I need to find out the unit cost of each lemon. The options are A) $2.50, B) $0.60, C) $0.40, and D) $0.10. Hmm, unit cost means the cost per lemon, right? So, I need to figure out how much one lemon costs if 5 lemons cost $2.00.\n\nAlright, let's think about this. If 5 lemons cost $2.00, then to find the cost of one lemon, I should divide the total cost by the number of lemons. So, that would be $2.00 divided by 5.\n\nLet me do that calculation: $2.00 \u00f7 5. Well, 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. So, $0.40 per lemon. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Suppose I consider the total cost and see how much each lemon contributes to that cost. If five lemons together cost $2.00, then each lemon should cost a fifth of that amount.\n\nYes, that again leads me to $2.00 divided by 5, which is $0.40. Okay, so option C) $0.40 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other factor I should consider, like tax or something? The problem doesn't mention any tax, so I think it's safe to assume that the $2.00 is the total cost for the bag of 5 lemons.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, let's consider if the question was asking for something else, like the cost of a single lemon if the bag price includes some discount or something. But again, the problem seems straightforward: it's simply a bag of 5 lemons for $2.00, and I need the unit cost.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if 5 lemons cost $2.00, then 1 lemon would cost $0.40. If I multiply $0.40 by 5, I get $2.00, which matches the total cost. So, that makes sense.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's look at the other options. Option A is $2.50, which is more than the total cost of the bag. That can't be right. Option B is $0.60, which is more than $0.40, but less than $0.75, which would be $3.75 for 5 lemons, way above $2.00. Doesn't make sense. Option D is $0.10, which would mean 5 lemons cost $0.50, but the problem says they cost $2.00. So, that's too low.\n\nTherefore, the only logical answer is C) $0.40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
