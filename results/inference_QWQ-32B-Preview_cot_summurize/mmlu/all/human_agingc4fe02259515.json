Increased disability and declining health.\n\nMorbidity is a term used in epidemiology to refer to the presence of disease, the incidence of disease, or the amount of disease within a population, often expressed as prevalence or incidence rates. It is often used in contrast to mortality, which refers to death rates.\n\nSo, in this context:\n\nA. Death - This is actually mortality, not morbidity.\n\nB. Social and emotional isolation - While this can be a factor affecting health, it is not the direct definition of morbidity.\n\nC. Increased disability and declining health - This aligns closely with the concept of morbidity, as it refers to the presence and impact of disease or health conditions.\n\nD. A period of intense personal loss - This could be a consequence of morbidity or mortality but is not directly\u5b9a\u4e49 morbidity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Increased disability and declining health."
