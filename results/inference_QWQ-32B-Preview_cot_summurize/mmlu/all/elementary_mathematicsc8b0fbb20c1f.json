                    "text": "So Ms. Perez drove a total of 40 miles over 5 days, and she drove the same number of miles each day. We need to find out how many miles she drove each day.\n\nTo solve this, I think we need to divide the total miles by the number of days to find the daily mileage. So, that would be 40 miles divided by 5 days.\n\nLet me do the calculation: 40 divided by 5 equals 8. So, she drove 8 miles each day.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. 7\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 9\n\nThe correct answer should be C. 8.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. If she drove 8 miles each day for 5 days, that would be 8 times 5, which equals 40 miles. That matches the total miles given.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the other options:\n\nA. 5 miles per day for 5 days would be 25 miles, which is less than 40.\n\nB. 7 miles per day for 5 days would be 35 miles, still less than 40.\n\nC. 8 miles per day for 5 days is 40 miles, which matches.\n\nD. 9 miles per day for 5 days would be 45 miles, which is more than 40.\n\nSo, again, 8 miles per day is the only option that fits the total of 40 miles in 5 days.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to set up an equation. Let\u2019s let m be the miles driven each day. Then, 5m = 40. Solving for m, we get m = 40 / 5 = 8.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 8 miles per day.\n\nI think that\u2019s straightforward. Is there any other way this problem could be interpreted?\n\nWell, maybe if the miles weren't exactly the same each day, but the problem specifically says she drove the same number of miles each day. So, we can definitely use division to find the daily mileage.\n\nAlso, 40 divided by 5 is a basic division fact that equals 8, so it\u2019s pretty straightforward.\n\nI don\u2019t see any tricks or extra steps in this problem. It\u2019s a direct division problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
