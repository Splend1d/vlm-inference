                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a widower, his niece, and his daughter, and there's a dispute over a quarry. Let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the widower owned a 10-acre quarry in fee simple absolute, which means he had complete ownership of it. On August 1, he gave a deed conveying the quarry to his niece to his friend and instructed him to give it to his niece. But, unknown to the widower, his niece was in Africa at the time.\n\nThen, a week later, the friend recorded the deed with the Recorder's Office. A month after that, the widower died, and in his will, he devised the quarry to his daughter. After that, the niece came back from Africa, and there was a dispute over who owns the quarry.\n\nThey went to court to quiet title, which is a legal proceeding to determine who has the rightful ownership of a piece of property. The court ruled in favor of the niece. Now, we need to figure out why the court ruled in her favor based on the options given.\n\nOption A says there was an effective \"causa mortis\" gift. A causa mortis gift is a transfer of property made by someone who is expecting to die imminently, and it's conditional on death. However, in this case, there's no indication that the widower was expecting to die soon or that the gift was conditional on his death. He just handed the deed to his friend to give to his niece. So, this might not be the reason.\n\nOption B says the delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to his friend. In property law, for a deed to be effective, there needs to be delivery and acceptance. Delivery means the grantor intends to transfer title and hands over the deed to the grantee or someone acting on behalf of the grantee. Here, the widower gave the deed to his friend with instructions to give it to his niece. So, it seems like he intended to deliver the deed to his niece through his friend.\n\nBut, the niece was not present, and she was in Africa. So, did the delivery happen when the widower gave it to his friend? Or does it require the friend to actually give it to the niece?\n\nOption C says the delivery was effective when the friend recorded the deed. Recording a deed generally puts others on notice that someone claims ownership of the property, but recording doesn't necessarily complete the delivery of the deed. Delivery typically requires physical transfer from the grantor to the grantee or someone acting on behalf of the grantee.\n\nOption D says the deed was recorded before the devise was effectuated. The devise in the will wouldn't take effect until the widower's death, which was a month later. So, yes, the deed was recorded before the devise took effect. But does that mean the deed takes priority over the will?\n\nLet's think about the timing and the effects of each transaction.\n\n1. On August 1: Widower gives deed to friend to give to niece.\n\n2. A week later: Friend records the deed.\n\n3. One month later: Widower dies, and his will devises the quarry to his daughter.\n\n4. After that: Niece returns from Africa, and there's a dispute.\n\nNow, in property law, generally, a deed that is properly delivered and accepted passes title to the grantee immediately, regardless of recording. However, recording provides public notice and can affect the rights of subsequent purchasers.\n\nIn this case, the widower intended to convey the property to his niece and gave the deed to his friend with instructions to give it to her. Even though the niece was in Africa and didn't physically receive the deed, the widower's intent was to deliver it to her through his friend.\n\nSo, arguably, the delivery was effective when he gave the deed to his friend with instructions to give it to his niece. This would mean that the niece became the owner of the property at that time, August 1.\n\nThen, when the widower died a month later and tried to devise the property to his daughter in his will, but since he had already conveyed the property to his niece, he no longer owned it to devise in his will.\n\nTherefore, the court likely ruled in favor of the niece because the delivery of the deed to her through his friend was effective, and she became the owner before the widower died and tried to devise it to his daughter.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the most plausible reason: the delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to his friend.\n\nOption D might also have some merit because the deed was recorded before the devise in the will took effect, but the key is probably the delivery itself, not just the recording.\n\nWait a minute, but in some jurisdictions, there might be requirements for acceptance by the grantee. Since the niece was in Africa and didn't know about the deed, did she need to accept it?\n\nThis complicates things. Maybe the court considered that the niece, upon returning, accepted the deed by claiming ownership, ratifying the previous acts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recording of the deed served as constructive notice to the world that the niece was the owner, and therefore, the will devise was ineffective.\n\nBut I think the core issue is the effectiveness of the delivery through the friend.\n\nLet me consider the legal principles involved.\n\nIn property law, delivery of a deed requires:\n\n- Intent to convey\n\n- Transfer of the deed to the grantee or someone acting on behalf of the grantee\n\n- Acceptance by the grantee\n\nHere, the widower had the intent to convey the property to his niece and gave the deed to his friend with instructions to give it to her. So, he intended to deliver it to his niece through his friend.\n\nAs for acceptance, perhaps the niece's actions upon returning and claiming ownership constitute acceptance.\n\nMoreover, the friend recorded the deed, which gives public notice of the niece's claim to ownership.\n\nWhen the widower died and tried to devise the property to his daughter, but since he had already conveyed it to his niece, he no longer had ownership to devise.\n\nTherefore, the court correctly ruled in favor of the niece.\n\nSo, among the options, B seems the most accurate: the delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to his friend.\n\nOption A about causa mortis is less likely because there's no indication that the gift was conditional on his death or that he was in imminent peril.\n\nOption C suggests that recording the deed effected the delivery, but recording is separate from delivery; delivery is the transfer of the deed, while recording is notifying the public.\n\nOption D notes that the deed was recorded before the devise was effectuated, which is true, but the key is whether the delivery occurred before the devise.\n\nTherefore, the ruling was most likely based on option B: the delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to his friend.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
