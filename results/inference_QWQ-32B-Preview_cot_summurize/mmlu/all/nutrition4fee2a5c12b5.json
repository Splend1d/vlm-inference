A reduction in physical activity\n\nC. A reduction in basal metabolic rate\n\nD. All of the above\n\nSo, I need to think about what affects how much energy older adults use. Let's start by understanding what energy expenditure means. It's basically the amount of energy, or calories, that a person burns in a day through various activities and bodily functions.\n\nFirst, lean body mass. That's the part of your body that's not fat, like muscles and organs. As people age, they often lose muscle mass, a condition called sarcopenia. Muscles are pretty active tissues; they burn calories even when you're not exercising. So, if you have less lean body mass, you're burning fewer calories at rest. That makes sense, so option A seems likely to contribute to reduced energy expenditure.\n\nNext, physical activity. Older adults often become less active due to various reasons like health issues, mobility problems, or just a more sedentary lifestyle. When you're less active, you burn fewer calories through movement and exercise. That definitely contributes to reduced energy expenditure. So, option B also seems correct.\n\nNow, basal metabolic rate, or BMR. That's the rate at which your body uses energy to maintain basic functions like breathing, heart rate, and temperature, even when you're at rest. There's some evidence that BMR decreases with age. Maybe because of changes in metabolic processes or loss of muscle mass, which, as I mentioned earlier, is part of lean body mass. So, a reduction in BMR would also lead to lower energy expenditure.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that not all studies agree on whether BMR necessarily decreases with age. Some suggest that while lean body mass decreases, BMR might not change as much when adjusted for lean mass. Maybe I need to look deeper into this.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of this question, it seems that all three options\u2014reduction in lean body mass, reduction in physical activity, and reduction in basal metabolic rate\u2014can contribute to reduced energy expenditure in older adults.\n\nBut let's think about it again. If older adults have less lean body mass and are less physically active, and if their BMR has also decreased, all these factors would indeed lead to burning fewer calories overall.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be D. All of the above.\n\nStill, it's important to note that individual experiences can vary. Some older adults remain very active and maintain their muscle mass through exercise, which might mitigate some of these effects.\n\nOverall, though, generally speaking, all three options contribute to reduced energy expenditure in older adults.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
