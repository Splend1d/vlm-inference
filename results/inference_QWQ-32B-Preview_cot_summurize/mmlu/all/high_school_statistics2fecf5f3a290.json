So, the question is: \"Sampling error occurs\n\nA. when interviewers make mistakes resulting in bias.\n\nB. because a sample statistic is used to estimate a population parameter.\n\nC. when interviewers use judgment instead of random choice in picking the sample.\n\nD. when samples are too small.\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what sampling error is. Sampling error happens because we're using a subset of a population (a sample) to make inferences about the entire population. It's the difference between the sample statistic and the actual population parameter that arises from the fact that the sample might not perfectly represent the population.\n\nOption A says: \"when interviewers make mistakes resulting in bias.\" Now, interviewer mistakes can certainly lead to bias, but that's more about data collection errors rather than sampling error. Sampling error is specifically about the variability that comes from using a sample instead of the whole population. So, I think A might not be the best answer here.\n\nOption B says: \"because a sample statistic is used to estimate a population parameter.\" Hmm, that sounds spot on to me. Sampling error is inherently tied to the use of sample statistics to estimate population parameters. It's expected that there will be some discrepancy between the sample statistic and the population parameter just because we're not measuring the entire population.\n\nOption C says: \"when interviewers use judgment instead of random choice in picking the sample.\" Again, this can lead to bias, but it's more about the sampling method than the sampling error itself. Sampling error can occur even with random sampling, so I don't think C is the best answer.\n\nOption D says: \"when samples are too small.\" Small samples can certainly increase sampling error because there's more variability, but sampling error can occur with any sample size, even large ones. It's just that larger samples tend to have smaller sampling errors. So, D is partially correct but not entirely accurate.\n\nComparing all these options, I think B is the most accurate description of sampling error. It directly addresses the core issue of using a sample statistic to estimate a population parameter, which inherently involves some error due to sampling variability.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider what sampling error isn't. It's not just about interviewer mistakes (A), which can cause bias but are separate from sampling error. It's not solely about non-random sampling methods (C), though those can exacerbate sampling error. And it's not only about small sample sizes (D), as sampling error exists regardless of sample size, though it's generally larger with smaller samples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: because a sample statistic is used to estimate a population parameter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
