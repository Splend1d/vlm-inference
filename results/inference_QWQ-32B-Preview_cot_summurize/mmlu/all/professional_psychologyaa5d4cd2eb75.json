Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and D. Raven's Progressive Matrices. I need to figure out which one of these was the first standardized measure of assessment.\n\nOkay, let's start by understanding what a standardized measure of assessment is. It's a test that's designed to be administered and scored in a consistent manner, so that the results can be compared across different individuals or groups. Intelligence tests are a common type of standardized assessment, designed to measure cognitive abilities.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Stanford-Binet: I know that the Stanford-Binet is an intelligence test, but I think it's a revision of an earlier test. I think it was developed by Lewis Terman at Stanford University, building on earlier work.\n\nB. Binet-Simon Scale: This one sounds familiar. I recall that Alfred Binet and Th\u00e9odore Simon developed a test in France in the early 1900s to identify children who needed special educational assistance. It was called the Binet-Simon Scale.\n\nC. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale: This is another well-known intelligence test, developed by David Wechsler. I believe it was introduced later than the Binet-Simon Scale.\n\nD. Raven's Progressive Matrices: This is a non-verbal reasoning test, also used to assess intelligence. I think it was developed in the 1930s by John Raven.\n\nGiven this, it seems like the Binet-Simon Scale was developed first, around 1905, and then later, the Stanford-Binet was a revision of that, developed in 1916. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale came much later, in the 1950s, and Raven's Progressive Matrices in the 1930s.\n\nSo, if I'm thinking correctly, the first standardized measure of assessment was the Binet-Simon Scale.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should double-check the dates.\n\nAccording to my memory, the Binet-Simon Scale was published in 1905. The Stanford-Binet was a revision in 1916. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale was introduced in 1955, and Raven's Progressive Matrices in 1938.\n\nSo, yes, the Binet-Simon Scale predates the others by quite a bit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Binet-Simon Scale.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
