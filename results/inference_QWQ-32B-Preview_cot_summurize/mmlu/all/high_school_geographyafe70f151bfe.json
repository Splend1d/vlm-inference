Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A is \"A central park.\" Now, central parks are pretty common in many cities around the world, not just in East Europe. For example, Central Park in New York, Hyde Park in London, and many others. So, having a central park doesn't seem too unique to East European cities.\n\nOption B is \"Prominent religious buildings.\" Again, prominent religious buildings are a feature of many cities worldwide. Think about the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame in Paris, or the Cathedral in Barcelona. Religious buildings are important in many cultures and are often central landmarks. So, this doesn't seem distinctly East European either.\n\nOption C is \"A large central square surrounded by government and administrative buildings.\" Hmm, this sounds interesting. In East European cities, especially those with a history influenced by the Soviet Union, you often see large squares that serve as focal points for government buildings, administrative offices, and sometimes important historical monuments. For example, Moscow's Red Square is a famous central square surrounded by significant government and historical buildings. Similarly, in Prague, there's Old Town Square, which, while more focused on history and culture, also has elements of government presence. So, this seems like a plausible answer.\n\nOption D is \"Luxury apartment buildings.\" Luxury apartments can be found in many global cities, not just in East Europe. Cities like London, New York, Singapore, and many others have luxury apartment buildings. So, this doesn't seem like a distinct characteristic specific to East European cities.\n\nComparing all these options, option C seems to be the most distinct characteristic of an East European city, especially considering the historical context of Soviet influence and the architectural styles that came with it. So, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
