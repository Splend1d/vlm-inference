                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Fiedler\u2019s contingency model of leadership, and it's asking about high LPC leaders. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, I remember that LPC stands for Least Preferred Coworker. It's a scale developed by Fiedler to measure a leader's style. High LPC leaders are those who rate their least preferred coworker more favorably, which supposedly means they have a more relationship-oriented leadership style. On the other hand, low LPC leaders are more task-oriented.\n\nNow, the question is:\n\n\"According to Fiedler\u2019s contingency model of leadership, high LPC leaders:\n\nA. are always more effective than low LPC leaders.\n\nB. are more effective than low LPC leaders in moderately favorable situations.\n\nC. elicit less trust from supervisees than do low LPC leaders.\n\nD. elicit less intrinsic motivation from supervisees than do low LPC leaders.\"\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that high LPC leaders are always more effective than low LPC leaders. But from what I know about Fiedler's model, it's not about one being always better than the other; it's about which style is more effective depending on the situation. So, this seems too absolute. Fiedler believed that the best leadership style depends on the situation or context.\n\nOption B says that high LPC leaders are more effective than low LPC leaders in moderately favorable situations. Hmm, Fiedler's model suggests that there is an interaction between leadership style and situational favorableness. According to him, there are three levels of situational control: high, medium, and low. He proposed that in very favorable and very unfavorable situations, task-oriented leaders (low LPC) are more effective, while in moderately favorable situations, relationship-oriented leaders (high LPC) are more effective.\n\nWait a minute, that seems to contradict option B. Option B says high LPC leaders are more effective in moderately favorable situations, which aligns with Fiedler's model. But let me double-check. Yes, Fiedler argued that in situations where the leader has positional power and task structure is high, but leader-member relations are neither extremely good nor poor, high LPC leaders perform better. So, option B seems correct based on Fiedler's contingency model.\n\nOption C says that high LPC leaders elicit less trust from supervisees than do low LPC leaders. I don't recall any specific information suggesting that high LPC leaders are less trusted. In fact, since high LPC leaders are more relationship-oriented, one might expect them to build more trust with their supervisees. So, this option seems unlikely.\n\nOption D says that high LPC leaders elicit less intrinsic motivation from supervisees than do low LPC leaders. Again, I don't remember any direct link between LPC scores and intrinsic motivation. Fiedler's model is more about the fit between leadership style and situational favorableness, not specifically about motivation types.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option B seems to be the correct answer. High LPC leaders are more effective than low LPC leaders in moderately favorable situations, according to Fiedler\u2019s contingency model.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A is too general and doesn't account for the situational dependency that Fiedler emphasized.\n\nOption C isn't supported by Fiedler's model, which doesn't make claims about trust levels associated with different LPC scores.\n\nOption D also isn't directly addressed by Fiedler's model, which focuses on effectiveness in different situations rather than the type of motivation elicited.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
