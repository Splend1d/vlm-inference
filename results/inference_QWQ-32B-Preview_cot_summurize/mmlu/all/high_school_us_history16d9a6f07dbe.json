The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing\u2026the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack\u2026.The attack yesterday\u2026has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas\u2026.As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.\"\nPresident Franklin D.

                    "text": "Let's see what this is about. There's an excerpt from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's radio address on December 8, 1941, right after the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan. He's describing the surprise attack and how it affected the U.S., mentioning damages to naval and military forces and loss of American lives.\n\nThe question is asking for the most immediate consequence of these events. So, I need to think about what happened right after the attack.\n\nOption A is trade embargoes with Japan extending up through the 1980s. Hmm, trade embargoes were actually in place before the attack, leading up to it. In 1940 and 1941, the U.S. imposed embargoes on strategic materials like oil and scrap metal in response to Japan's aggression in Asia. So, these embargoes were a cause of tension between the U.S. and Japan, but they weren't a consequence of the attack. Plus, it says they extended through the 1980s, which seems way too long. So, probably not the immediate consequence.\n\nOption B is the Battle of Normandy. That was in 1944, which is a few years after the attack on Pearl Harbor. So, that's not immediate; it's a significant time later. The Battle of Normandy was part of the broader World War II, but it wasn't an immediate consequence of the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\nOption C is the internment of Japanese-Americans. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, there was a lot of fear and racism towards Japanese-Americans. In February 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which led to the forced relocation and internment of around 120,000 Japanese-Americans on the West Coast to camps inland. This happened quite soon after the attack, so this seems like a very immediate consequence.\n\nOption D is the bombing of Nagasaki. That occurred on August 9, 1945, which is towards the end of World War II, long after the Pearl Harbor attack. So, that's not immediate either.\n\nComparing all these options, the internment of Japanese-Americans was the most immediate consequence of the events described in the excerpt. It happened shortly after the attack, driven by fear and racism, whereas the other options are either before the event or much later.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. The internment of Japanese-Americans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
