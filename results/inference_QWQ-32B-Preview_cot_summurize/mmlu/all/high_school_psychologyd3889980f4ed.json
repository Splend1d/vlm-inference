                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about Mr. Gordon's brain injury. So, he had damage to the back of his right frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is involved in a lot of higher cognitive functions, like decision making, problem solving, and movement control. Since it's the right side, and the brain is divided into left and right hemispheres, each controlling different functions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the right frontal lobe is responsible for. I think the right side of the brain is more involved in spatial awareness, attention, and some aspects of emotion processing. The frontal lobe, in general, is crucial for motor functions, particularly the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary movements.\n\nNow, the question says the \"back of his right frontal lobe.\" So, it's not the very front, which might be more involved in planning and executive functions, but slightly back from that. I wonder if it's near the motor cortex.\n\nOption A is about understanding information he hears. That sounds like it might be related to auditory processing or language comprehension. I think understanding what you hear is more associated with the temporal lobe and perhaps Wernicke's area, which is typically in the left hemisphere for right-handed people.\n\nOption B is about understanding information he reads. Reading comprehension would also involve language processing, so again, probably more related to areas like Wernicke's area in the left hemisphere.\n\nOption C is about speaking intelligibly. That sounds like it could be related to Broca's area, which is involved in speech production and is usually located in the left frontal lobe.\n\nOption D is about moving his left hand. Since the motor cortex controls the opposite side of the body, damage to the right frontal lobe could affect movement on the left side of the body.\n\nWait a minute, but the question specifies the \"back of his right frontal lobe.\" If the primary motor cortex is towards the back of the frontal lobe, then damage there could indeed affect movement, specifically of the opposite side of the body.\n\nLet me think about this. If someone has damage to the motor cortex on the right side, it should affect the movement of the left side of the body, because the motor cortex controls the opposite side.\n\nSo, option D seems plausible. But let's consider the other options again to make sure.\n\nOption A: Understanding information he hears. That seems more related to auditory processing and language comprehension, which are typically handled by different areas of the brain, like the temporal lobe and Wernicke's area.\n\nOption B: Understanding information he reads. Reading comprehension also involves language processing, so again, likely related to areas like Wernicke's area and other language comprehension areas.\n\nOption C: Speaking intelligibly. Speech production is typically controlled by Broca's area, which is in the left frontal lobe for most right-handed people.\n\nGiven that Mr. Gordon's injury is to the right frontal lobe, it's less likely to affect his speech production or language comprehension, unless he's left-handed, in which case language areas might be organized differently.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify handedness, so I'll assume he's right-handed, which is common.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence of damage to the back of his right frontal lobe would be difficulty moving his left hand, since the motor cortex controls opposite-side movement.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. Move his left hand.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other functions that could be affected by damage to that specific area.\n\nThe frontal lobe also contains areas involved in planning, decision making, and emotional regulation, but those seem less directly related to the options provided.\n\nOption D seems the most directly related to motor function, which is likely impaired due to damage to the motor cortex in the right frontal lobe.\n\nTherefore, my answer is D. Move his left hand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
