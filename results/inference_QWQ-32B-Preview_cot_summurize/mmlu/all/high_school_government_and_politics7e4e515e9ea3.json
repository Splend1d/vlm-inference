Minnesota and New York Times v. Sullivan\n\nB. Texas v. Johnson and Morse v. Frederick\n\nC. Thornhill v. Alabama and Cox v. New Hampshire\n\nD. Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade\n\nHmm, I need to recall which of these cases deal with the right to privacy. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Near v. Minnesota and New York Times v. Sullivan. I remember that Near v. Minnesota was about prior restraint in journalism, and New York Times v. Sullivan was about libel and the freedom of the press. Both seem related to the First Amendment and freedom of speech, but not directly about privacy.\n\nOption B: Texas v. Johnson and Morse v. Frederick. Texas v. Johnson was about burning the American flag as symbolic speech, and Morse v. Frederick was about speech rights of students. Again, these seem more about free speech than privacy.\n\nOption C: Thornhill v. Alabama and Cox v. New Hampshire. Thornhill v. Alabama was about labor picketing and free speech, and Cox v. New Hampshire was about the regulation of parades and free speech. Once more, these cases are about free speech and assembly, not privacy.\n\nOption D: Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade. Now, Griswold v. Connecticut was about the right to use birth control, and Roe v. Wade was about abortion rights. Both of these cases are famously associated with the right to privacy, particularly the right to make personal decisions about one's body and family without government interference.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, option D seems to be the correct answer because both cases deal with privacy rights, whereas the others are more about free speech and expression.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. In Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court struck down a state law banning the use of contraceptives, finding that it violated the right to privacy. Similarly, in Roe v. Wade, the Court ruled that a woman has a constitutional right to choose to have an abortion, again under the umbrella of privacy rights.\n\nThe other options don't focus on privacy to the same extent. So, I'm confident that D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
