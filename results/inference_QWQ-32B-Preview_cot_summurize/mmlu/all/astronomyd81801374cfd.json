                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to figure out which of these options the nebular theory doesn't predict. So first, I need to remember what the nebular theory is all about.\n\nI know that the nebular theory explains how the solar system formed from a giant cloud of gas and dust, which collapsed under its own gravity. As it collapsed, it started spinning and flattening into a disk, with the Sun forming in the center and the planets forming from the material in the disk.\n\nOption A says that planets orbit around the Sun in nearly circular orbits in a flattened disk. That sounds exactly like what the nebular theory predicts. So, that one is probably predicted by the theory.\n\nOption B mentions an equal number of terrestrial and jovian planets. Hmm, terrestrial planets are the small, rocky ones like Earth and Mars, and jovian planets are the big gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. According to the nebular theory, planets formed differently in various parts of the disk. Closer to the Sun, it was too hot for lightweight gases to condense, so only rocky planets formed. Farther out, it was cooler, and gas giants could form. So, the theory explains why we have both types of planets, but it doesn't necessarily predict an equal number of each. In reality, we have four terrestrial planets and four gas giants in our solar system, but the theory doesn't specify the exact numbers.\n\nOption C is about the craters on the Moon. The nebular theory describes the formation of the solar system, including how moons could form around planets. One theory for the Moon's formation is that a Mars-sized body collided with Earth, and the debris from that collision formed the Moon. That would explain why the Moon has craters, as it was bombarded by leftover debris in the early solar system. So, the nebular theory, combined with this impact hypothesis, can predict the craters on the Moon.\n\nOption D mentions asteroids, Kuiper-belt comets, and the Oort cloud. The nebular theory predicts that leftover material from the planet formation process would remain in the solar system as smaller bodies, like asteroids and comets. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is thought to be material that didn't form into a planet because of Jupiter's gravitational influence. The Kuiper belt and Oort cloud are regions where icy bodies and comets formed far from the Sun. So, the nebular theory accounts for these features.\n\nGiven all that, it seems like option B is the one that the nebular theory doesn't predict\u2014specifically, the equal number of terrestrial and jovian planets. The theory explains why we have both types but doesn't predict that there would be an equal number of each.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
