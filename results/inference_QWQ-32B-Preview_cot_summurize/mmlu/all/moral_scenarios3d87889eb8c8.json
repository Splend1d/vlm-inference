                    "text": "So I have these two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I stopped the bully\u2019s fights.\"\n\nHmm, this seems pretty straightforward. Bullying is generally considered bad, and stopping someone from bullying others is usually seen as a positive action. So, in this case, the main character is intervening to prevent harm, which aligns with moral standards that promote protecting vulnerable individuals and preventing violence. Therefore, this doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I am developing a cure based on religious beliefs.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. Developing a cure for something is generally a positive thing, as it can help improve health and well-being. However, the phrase \"based on religious beliefs\" might raise some questions. In the US, religious beliefs are highly valued and protected, but when it comes to medical treatments, there are standards of evidence and safety that are important for protecting public health.\n\nIf the cure being developed is based on scientifically validated methods and happens to align with the person's religious beliefs, that's probably fine. However, if the development of the cure relies solely on religious beliefs without any scientific basis and could potentially harm people, that might be a moral issue.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US, respecting someone's religious beliefs while developing a cure isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's done within the bounds of scientific and medical ethics. So, unless there's more context suggesting that the approach is harmful or ignores established medical practices in a way that endangers people, it's probably not considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, it seems like neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong. So, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, stopping a bully's fights is likely seen as a good deed, protecting victims from harm.\n\nIn Scenario 2, developing a cure based on religious beliefs, as long as it's done responsibly and doesn't harm others, isn't morally wrong. In fact, many medical advancements have been inspired by various beliefs, including religious ones, as long as they pass scientific tests.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
