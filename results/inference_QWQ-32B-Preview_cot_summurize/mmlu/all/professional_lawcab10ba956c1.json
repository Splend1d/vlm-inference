So, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the defendant was booked on a commercial airline flight and arrived at the airport. Two undercover police narcotics agents observed him and thought he matched the profile of a drug courier. They approached him and told him they wanted to detain him for questioning. The defendant asked what for, and they identified themselves as narcotics agents and explained that he fit the profile of a drug courier.\n\nThen, the officers asked the defendant to hand over his overnight bag. The defendant refused. At this point, the officers said that he wouldn't be permitted to board the plane unless they inspected the contents of his bag. The defendant then decided not to fly that day and handed over his bag to the officers. After that, he was allowed to leave the airport.\n\nThe next day, the police had a dog sniff the bag for narcotics, and based on the dog's reaction, they suspected that the bag contained narcotics. They then opened the bag and found heroin inside. The defendant was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics.\n\nNow, at trial, the defendant's attorney is moving to prevent the introduction of the heroin as evidence. We need to determine whether this motion will most likely be granted or denied, and why.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Granted, because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search.\n\nB. Granted, because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.\n\nC. Denied, because the defendant fit the predetermined profile of a narcotics courier.\n\nD. Denied, because the search resulted from a lawful airport detention.\n\nOkay, so we need to consider whether the detention and the subsequent search of the bag were lawful.\n\nFirst, was the detention lawful?\n\nThe officers approached the defendant and told him they wanted to detain him for questioning, saying he fit the profile of a drug courier. They identified themselves as narcotics agents. The defendant asked what for, and they explained. Then, they asked for his bag, and when he refused, they said he couldn't board the plane without them inspecting it.\n\nThe defendant then decided not to fly and handed over his bag, after which he was allowed to leave.\n\nSo, was this detention lawful?\n\nIn the context of airports, the law allows for certain levels of scrutiny due to security concerns. However, detaining someone based solely on a profile, especially a racial or ethnic profile, can be problematic.\n\nBut in this case, it's a profile of a drug courier, which might include behavioral or other characteristics.\n\nStill, for a detention to be lawful, it usually requires reasonable suspicion, which is a level of suspicion beyond mere speculation but less than probable cause.\n\nDid the officers have reasonable suspicion to detain the defendant?\n\nThey observed him and thought he fit the profile of a drug courier. However, profiles can be vague and might not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion.\n\nBut in practice, courts have sometimes allowed stops based on profiles, especially in high-security areas like airports.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the officers didn't seem to have specific articulable facts beyond the profile to suggest that the defendant was engaged in criminal activity.\n\nSo, perhaps the detention was questionable.\n\nBut let's assume for a moment that the detention was lawful.\n\nWhat about the request to hand over the bag?\n\nThe officers said that the defendant couldn't board the plane without them inspecting his bag. Was this true?\n\nIn general, passengers have the right to board planes without submitting to bag searches unless there is reasonable suspicion or consent.\n\nHere, the officers were trying to create a situation where the defendant felt he had no choice but to allow the search.\n\nThe defendant initially refused but then decided not to fly and handed over the bag.\n\nSo, was this consent voluntary?\n\nIt seems coerced because the officers essentially told him he couldn't fly without allowing the search.\n\nCoerced consent may not be valid.\n\nTherefore, the seizure of the bag might not have been lawful.\n\nThen, the next day, the police had a dog sniff the bag and based on that, opened it and found heroin.\n\nNow, the question is whether the initial detention and seizure of the bag were lawful, which would affect the admissibility of the heroin as evidence.\n\nGiven that the detention might not have been based on reasonable suspicion and the seizure of the bag may have been coerced, it's possible that the evidence is the fruit of an illegal detention and seizure.\n\nTherefore, the motion to suppress the heroin might be granted.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Granted, because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search.\n\nWell, probable cause is usually required for a search or arrest, but in this case, it's about holding the bag overnight for a search.\n\nPerhaps, but the issue might be the initial seizure without proper justification.\n\nB. Granted, because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.\n\nThis seems plausible. If the detention was unlawful, then the subsequent search might be seen as fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\nC. Denied, because the defendant fit the predetermined profile of a narcotics courier.\n\nBut fitting a profile might not be enough for a lawful detention. This seems like an insufficient justification.\n\nD. Denied, because the search resulted from a lawful airport detention.\n\nBut as we've considered, the detention might not have been lawful.\n\nTherefore, option B seems most likely correct: the motion will be granted because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that legal standards can vary, and courts might interpret the circumstances differently.\n\nBut based on the information provided, I think B is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
