The options are Kinsey, Freud, Masters and Johnson, or Kaplan. I think Masters and Johnson did a lot of research on human sexuality, so maybe it was them. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this.\n\nAlfred Kinsey was a pioneer in sex research, and he published the Kinsey Reports, which were influential in the mid-20th century. He studied human sexual behavior, but I'm not sure if he specifically focused on multiple orgasms in women.\n\nSigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, had theories about sexuality, but I don't recall him specifically addressing multiple orgasms in women. His work was more focused on psychosexual development and the role of sexuality in mental health.\n\nMasters and Johnson, on the other hand, are famous for their groundbreaking research on human sexuality, including the physiological responses during sexual activity. They conducted extensive studies on both men and women, and I believe they were among the first to document the physical responses associated with female orgasm.\n\nMary Jane Sherfey and Helen Singer Kaplan also contributed to the understanding of female sexuality, but I think Masters and Johnson were earlier in terms of documenting multiple orgasms in women.\n\nLet me check some references to confirm. According to my knowledge, Masters and Johnson's work in the 1960s revolutionized the understanding of human sexuality. They used scientific methods to observe and measure physical responses during sexual activity, which was a significant departure from the more theoretical approaches of their predecessors.\n\nIn their book \"Human Sexual Response,\" published in 1966, they described the sexual response cycle, which includes excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution phases. They noted that women could experience multiple orgasms because they do not have a refractory period like men do.\n\nFreud, while influential in psychology, had limited understanding of female sexuality, and his views are now considered outdated. Kinsey's work was more about sexual behavior and frequency, but perhaps not as detailed in the physiological aspects of orgasm.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. Masters and Johnson.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
