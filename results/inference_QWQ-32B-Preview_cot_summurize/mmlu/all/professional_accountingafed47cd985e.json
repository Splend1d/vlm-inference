                    "text": "Let's tackle this stock dividend question step by step. I need to figure out which adjustments should be made when recording a 30% common stock dividend for a company with stock trading at $10 per share, having 1,000 shares of $1 par common stock outstanding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a stock dividend is. A stock dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders in the form of additional shares of stock rather than cash. It's a way to distribute value to shareholders without distributing cash, which can help preserve the company's cash reserves.\n\nNow, the company has 1,000 shares outstanding, and it's declaring a 30% stock dividend. That means they're giving existing shareholders additional shares equal to 30% of their current holdings.\n\nLet me calculate how many new shares are being issued:\n\nNumber of new shares = 1,000 shares * 30% = 300 shares\n\nSo, 300 new shares are being issued as a dividend.\n\nNext, I need to determine the value associated with these new shares. Since the stock is trading at $10 per share, the market value of the dividend is:\n\nMarket value of dividend = 300 shares * $10 per share = $3,000\n\nHowever, when recording the stock dividend, the transaction is based on the par value of the stock, not the market value. The par value is $1 per share, as stated in the question.\n\nSo, the par value of the new shares is:\n\nPar value of new shares = 300 shares * $1 par value = $300\n\nNow, let's think about the journal entries involved in recording a stock dividend.\n\nTypically, when a company declares a stock dividend, it transfers value from retained earnings to paid-in capital. Specifically, the amount transferred is based on the par value of the shares issued.\n\nSo, the entry would involve:\n\n1. Debiting Retained Earnings for the market value of the dividend.\n\n2. Crediting Common Stock for the par value of the new shares.\n\n3. Crediting Additional Paid-in Capital for the difference between the market value and the par value.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that for small stock dividends (usually less than 20-25% of outstanding shares), the market value is used, and for large stock dividends, the par value is used. Here, the dividend is 30%, which might be considered large.\n\nActually, the treatment can vary based on the percentage, but in many cases, even for larger stock dividends, the market value is used.\n\nLet me check my understanding.\n\nIn general:\n\n- For small stock dividends (less than 20-25% of outstanding shares), the market value of the shares is transferred from retained earnings to paid-in capital.\n\n- For large stock dividends (more than 20-25%), the par value of the shares is transferred from retained earnings to paid-in capital.\n\nIn this case, 30% is above the threshold, so it's a large stock dividend, and we should use the par value.\n\nTherefore, the entry would be:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings $300 (par value of new shares)\n\nCredit Common Stock $300\n\nWait, but option D says Common Stock is debited for $3,000, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's additional paid-in capital involved.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nActually, when issuing stock dividends, the entry typically involves:\n\n1. Debiting Retained Earnings for the market value of the shares issued.\n\n2. crediting Common Stock for the par value of the shares.\n\n3. Crediting Additional Paid-in Capital for the difference.\n\nBut if it's a large stock dividend, some textbooks suggest using the par value instead of market value.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me look up the general journal entry for a large stock dividend.\n\nUpon reviewing, for large stock dividends (typically over 20-25% of outstanding shares), the transaction is recorded based on the par value of the stock.\n\nSo, the entry would be:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings (for the par value of the shares issued)\n\nCredit Common Stock (for the par value of the shares issued)\n\nIn this case:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings $300\n\nCredit Common Stock $300\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly match this.\n\nOption C says: Retained earnings is debited for $300.\n\nThat seems to align with what I just said.\n\nBut option D says: Common stock is debited for $3,000.\n\nThat doesn't match; according to my calculation, Common Stock should be credited for $300.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the market value approach.\n\nIf we consider the market value, the entry would be:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings $3,000\n\nCredit Common Stock $300\n\nCredit Additional Paid-in Capital $2,700\n\nThis seems to match option B: Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.\n\nAnd option C: Retained earnings is debited for $300.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that for large stock dividends, we use par value, not market value.\n\nHowever, some sources suggest that for large stock dividends, the market value is still used, but the entry is adjusted.\n\nI need to clarify this.\n\nLet me consider the textbook treatment.\n\nIn many accounting textbooks, for large stock dividends, the entry is:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings (at market value)\n\nCredit Common Stock (at par value)\n\nCredit Additional Paid-in Capital (for the difference)\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings $3,000\n\nCredit Common Stock $300\n\nCredit Additional Paid-in Capital $2,700\n\nThis would mean that both options B and C are correct.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest selecting one adjustment.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer.\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. Treasury stock is debited for $300.\n\nB. Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.\n\nC. Retained earnings is debited for $300.\n\nD. Common stock is debited for $3,000.\n\nGiven the entry I just outlined, options B and C seem correct.\n\nBut maybe the question is about a specific aspect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total par value.\n\nOriginally, there are 1,000 shares at $1 par value, so Common Stock has a balance of $1,000.\n\nAfter issuing 300 new shares at $1 par value, Common Stock should increase by $300 to $1,300.\n\nThe Additional Paid-in Capital would be increased by the difference between the market value and the par value of the shares issued.\n\nMarket value is $3,000, par value is $300, so Additional Paid-in Capital increases by $2,700.\n\nTherefore, the entry should be:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings $3,000\n\nCredit Common Stock $300\n\nCredit Additional Paid-in Capital $2,700\n\nThis matches options B and C.\n\nBut perhaps the question is about a different approach or a specific adjustment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company is using the par value method for large stock dividends.\n\nIn that case, the entry would be:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings $300\n\nCredit Common Stock $300\n\nThis would only involve option C.\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the market value approach.\n\nI need to determine which method is appropriate.\n\nUpon further research, for large stock dividends, it's more appropriate to use the market value method, transferring the market value from retained earnings to paid-in capital.\n\nTherefore, the correct entry should be:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings $3,000\n\nCredit Common Stock $300\n\nCredit Additional Paid-in Capital $2,700\n\nThis means that options B and C are correct.\n\nBut the question seems to be designed to have only one correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation in the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the market value.\n\nStock price is $10 per share, and 300 new shares are issued, so market value is indeed $3,000.\n\nPar value is $1 per share, so par value is $300.\n\nTherefore, Additional Paid-in Capital should be credited for $2,700.\n\nThus, options B and C seem correct.\n\nBut perhaps the question is considering that the entry only affects Retained Earnings and Additional Paid-in Capital, with Common Stock being credited for par value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different perspective.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Treasury stock is debited for $300.\n\nThis seems unrelated, as treasury stock accounts for shares reacquired by the company, not for stock dividends.\n\nB. Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.\n\nThis aligns with the calculation.\n\nC. Retained earnings is debited for $300.\n\nThis does not align with the market value approach; it should be debited for $3,000.\n\nD. Common stock is debited for $3,000.\n\nThis is incorrect; Common Stock should be credited for $300.\n\nGiven this, option B seems correct, assuming that the entry is:\n\nDebit Retained Earnings $3,000\n\nCredit Common Stock $300\n\nCredit Additional Paid-in Capital $2,700\n\nHowever, option C is incorrect because Retained Earnings should be debited for $3,000, not $300.\n\nWait, but according to the market value approach, Retained Earnings should be debited for the market value of the shares issued, which is $3,000.\n\nBut option C says Retained earnings is debited for $300, which is the par value.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nSo, only option B is correct.\n\nUnless there's a different approach, perhaps based on the par value method for large stock dividends.\n\nIn some cases, for large stock dividends, companies might use the par value method, debiting Retained Earnings only for the par value of the shares issued.\n\nBut according to standard accounting practices, for large stock dividends, the market value method is preferred.\n\nTherefore, the correct entry should reflect the market value, meaning Retained Earnings is debited for $3,000, Common Stock is credited for $300, and Additional Paid-in Capital is credited for $2,700.\n\nGiven this, option B is correct, and option C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
