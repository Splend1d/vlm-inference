                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"How many $100 bills does it take to equal one million dollars?\" And there are options: A) one thousand, B) five thousand, C) ten thousand, D) one hundred thousand. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to find out how many $100 bills make up $1,000,000. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nI know that each bill is $100, and I need to reach $1,000,000. So, I think I need to divide the total amount by the denomination of the bill. That is, $1,000,000 divided by $100.\n\nLet me write that down: 1,000,000 \u00f7 100.\n\nNow, dividing by 100 is the same as moving the decimal point two places to the left. So, 1,000,000 becomes 10,000. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. If I have 10,000 bills of $100, that would be 10,000 \u00d7 100 = 1,000,000. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLet me check again. 10,000 bills \u00d7 $100 = $1,000,000. Perfect.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) one thousand\n\nB) five thousand\n\nC) ten thousand\n\nD) one hundred thousand\n\nSo, according to my calculation, it should be C) ten thousand.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Perhaps considering the value of the bills or something else. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of multiplication. If I have x number of $100 bills, and their total value is $1,000,000, then:\n\n100x = 1,000,000\n\nTo find x, I divide both sides by 100:\n\nx = 1,000,000 \u00f7 100\n\nx = 10,000\n\nAgain, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me consider another approach. I know that 1,000 $100 bills would be $100,000. So, to get to $1,000,000, which is ten times $100,000, I would need ten times as many bills. That would be 1,000 \u00d7 10 = 10,000 bills.\n\nOkay, that lines up with my previous answers.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about place values, $1,000,000 is one million dollars, and $100 is one hundred dollars. So, one million divided by one hundred is ten thousand.\n\n\u53c8\u6bd4\u5982\uff0c100\u4e58\u4ee510,000\u7b49\u4e8e1,000,000\u3002\n\n\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u7b54\u6848\u662fC\uff0c\u4e00\u4e07\u5f20\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u518d\u770b\u770b\u5176\u4ed6\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6ca1\u6709\u9009\u9519\u3002\n\n\u9009\u9879A\uff0c\u4e00\u5343\u5f20\uff0c\u90a3\u4e00\u5343\u5f20\u4e00\u767e\u5757\u662f100,000\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u8fdc\u4e0d\u5230\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u3002\n\n\u9009\u9879B\uff0c\u4e94\u5343\u5f20\uff0c\u4e94\u5343\u4e58\u4ee5\u4e00\u767e\u662f500,000\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u5230\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u3002\n\n\u9009\u9879C\uff0c\u4e00\u4e07\u5f20\uff0c\u4e00\u4e07\u4e58\u4ee5\u4e00\u767e\u662f\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u6b63\u597d\u3002\n\n\u9009\u9879D\uff0c\u5341\u4e07\u5f20\uff0c\u90a3\u5341\u4e07\u4e58\u4ee5\u4e00\u767e\u662f\u4e00\u5343\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u663e\u7136C\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4e5f\u8bb8\u51fa\u9898\u4eba\u60f3\u8003\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u5927\u6570\u5b57\u7684\u628a\u63e1\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u5bb9\u6613\u9009\u5341\u4e07\u5f20\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u6839\u636e\u6211\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u4e00\u4e07\u5f20\u4e00\u767e\u5757\u7b49\u4e8e\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u653e\u5fc3\u9009C\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
