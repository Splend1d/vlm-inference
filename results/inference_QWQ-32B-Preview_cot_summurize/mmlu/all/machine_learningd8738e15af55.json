                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. Starting with Statement 1: \"The SVM learning algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis with respect to its objective function.\"\n\nSo, SVM stands for Support Vector Machine, and it's a popular algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The core idea of SVM is to find a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes, and it does this by maximizing the margin between the classes.\n\nNow, about the statement: Is SVM guaranteed to find the global optimum? Well, SVM is based on convex optimization, which means that the objective function is convex, and in convex optimization problems, any local optimum is also a global optimum. So, under standard settings, yes, SVM is guaranteed to find the global optimum.\n\nBut, there are some caveats here. The guarantee holds for the primal and dual formulations of the SVM problem when using linear kernels. However, when using non-linear kernels, like the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, the feature space becomes infinite-dimensional, and the optimization is still convex in the dual form, which is what is typically solved. So, in practice, SVM with non-linear kernels should still find the global optimum in the dual formulation.\n\nBut, in reality, numerical issues or implementation details might lead to slight deviations, but generally, we can consider that SVM is designed to find the global optimum.\n\nSo, Statement 1 seems to be True.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"After being mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, a Perceptron may be able to achieve better classification performance than in its original space (though we can\u2019t guarantee this).\"\n\nAlright, so a Perceptron is a simple linear classifier that draws a linear decision boundary in the input space. When we talk about mapping data into a higher-dimensional feature space using a kernel function, like the RBF kernel, we're trying to make the data linearly separable in that higher-dimensional space, even if it wasn't in the original space.\n\nThe RBF kernel effectively maps the input data into an infinite-dimensional space, where it's more likely that the data becomes linearly separable.\n\nSo, if we apply the RBF kernel to the Perceptron, it should be able to capture more complex decision boundaries, potentially leading to better classification performance compared to its original linear form.\n\nHowever, the statement says \"may be able to achieve better classification performance,\" which is cautious because it depends on the specific dataset and the nature of the classification problem. In some cases, the Perceptron might already perform well in the original space, and the kernel trick might not necessarily improve performance.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the Perceptron algorithm itself is not typically used with kernel functions in the same way SVMs are. SVMs have a natural extension to kernel methods because of their dual formulation, but Perceptrons are usually applied in the original input space.\n\nThat being said, it is possible to kernelize the Perceptron algorithm, meaning to apply it in the feature space induced by a kernel function. This would involve using kernel functions to compute the dot products in the high-dimensional space without explicitly mapping the data there.\n\nSo, in theory, if we kernelize the Perceptron using an RBF kernel, it could achieve better classification performance on non-linearly separable data.\n\nBut, in practice, the Perceptron is a single-layer model, and while kernelizing it might help, it's still a linear model in the feature space, which might not be as powerful as other kernel-based methods like SVMs or kernelized logistic regression.\n\nMoreover, the Perceptron is known for its simplicity and speed, but it may not converge if the data is not linearly separable, even in the feature space. In contrast, SVMs can handle non-separable cases more gracefully by introducing slack variables.\n\nGiven all that, Statement 2 seems plausible, but with reservations. The Perceptron may achieve better performance after being mapped into a higher-dimensional space via an RBF kernel, but it's not guaranteed, and there are better algorithms designed for non-linear classification.\n\nSo, I would say Statement 2 is also True, but with the understanding that it's not always the best approach.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
