                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question from 1996. So, there's an investor who bought a 100-acre tract in a northern county of a state. The next year, in 1997, they made a subdivision plan dividing it into 100 one-acre residential lots and recorded it with the county recorder's office. Over the next few years, they sold all 100 lots to individual buyers, and each deed had a clause saying the lot could only be used for residential purposes.\n\nFast forward to 2009, and the area around the subdivision has been rezoned for commercial and business uses. Now, one of the lot owners wants to run a small beauty parlor in the basement of her home, and the other homeowners are suing to stop her from doing that because of the residential use restriction in the deed.\n\nThe question is, what will the court most likely decide?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The residency restriction is no longer enforceable because of the change in the character of the neighborhood surrounding the development.\n\nB. The residency restriction is no longer enforceable because the area surrounding the development was rezoned for commercial use.\n\nC. The residency restriction is enforceable, thus preventing any commercial use.\n\nD. The operation of a beauty parlor would not constitute a violation of the residency restriction.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about how restrictive covenants work in real estate, especially regarding land use.\n\nFirst, restrictive covenants are private agreements that limit how land can be used, and they're usually included in deeds when properties are sold. In this case, each deed had a clause specifying that the lot could only be used for residential purposes.\n\nNow, the area around the subdivision has been rezoned for commercial use, which is a public action by the local government changing the zoning classification of the land.\n\nI need to consider whether this rezoning affects the enforceability of the private restrictive covenant.\n\nI remember that zoning and private restrictions are two different things. Zoning is a public regulation, while restrictive covenants are private agreements between parties.\n\nGenerally, a change in zoning doesn't automatically invalidate private restrictive covenants, unless there's a specific law saying so or unless the zoning change renders the covenant impossible to perform.\n\nIn this case, even if the area is now zoned for commercial use, the private covenant in the deed still exists and binds the lot owners.\n\nSo, option A says the residency restriction is no longer enforceable because of the change in the character of the neighborhood. That might be relevant in some cases, but I think the key here is the specific language in the deed.\n\nOption B says it's no longer enforceable because of the rezoning for commercial use. Again, while rezoning can affect land use, it doesn't necessarily override private covenants.\n\nOption C says the residency restriction is enforceable, preventing any commercial use. This seems plausible because the deed specifically says the lot shall be used only for residential purposes.\n\nOption D says operating a beauty parlor wouldn't violate the residency restriction. Hmm, maybe if the beauty parlor is part of a residential use, like a home-based business.\n\nBut let's look closer. The lot is being used as a residence, and the beauty parlor is in the basement. Is this still considered residential use, or is it a commercial use?\n\nIn many places, home-based businesses are allowed in residential areas, provided they meet certain conditions, like not having customer traffic or signage that would disrupt the neighborhood.\n\nSo, perhaps operating a beauty parlor in the basement could be considered a residential use if it's a small, non-disruptive operation.\n\nBut according to the deed, \"no lot shall be used except for residential purposes.\" That seems pretty clear.\n\nHowever, what constitutes \"residential purposes\"? Does it include home-based businesses, or is it strictly living space with no commercial activity?\n\nI think it depends on how strictly the court interprets \"residential purposes.\" If it means solely for dwelling and no commercial activity, then the beauty parlor would be a violation.\n\nBut if \"residential purposes\" is interpreted more broadly to include certain home-based businesses, then maybe it's allowed.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if there have been any changes in how courts view home-based businesses in residential areas, especially with the increase in remote work and small businesses operating from homes.\n\nBut given that the deed is from 1997, and the activity is in 2009, I need to think about whether courts back then would have considered a small beauty parlor in a basement as a residential use.\n\nI recall that in many jurisdictions, small, home-based businesses that don't disrupt the neighborhood are permitted in residential areas.\n\nSo, perhaps operating a beauty parlor in the basement wouldn't necessarily violate the residential use restriction, especially if it's a small operation that doesn't involve a lot of customer traffic or alterations to the property.\n\nOn the other hand, if the operation is substantial and affects the character of the neighborhood, it might be considered a commercial use.\n\nBut in this case, it's described as a \"small\" beauty parlor, which suggests it's not a large, disruptive operation.\n\nTherefore, maybe option D is correct: the operation of a beauty parlor would not constitute a violation of the residency restriction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court would strictly enforce the deed's terms, prohibiting any commercial use, even if it's a small, home-based business.\n\nGiven that, option C seems plausible as well.\n\nWait, but the area has been rezoned for commercial use. Might that influence the court's decision?\n\nProbably not directly, because zoning and private covenants are separate. Zoning regulates land use at the municipal level, while the deed restriction is a private agreement.\n\nHowever, the change in zoning might indicate a change in the neighborhood's character, which could be relevant if the court considers whether the original purpose of the restriction is still applicable.\n\nBut in general, a change in zoning doesn't affect the enforceability of private covenants unless specified otherwise.\n\nMoreover, in real estate law, restrictive covenants are generally enforceable as long as they're not contrary to public policy or unlawful.\n\nIn this case, the covenant is to use the lot only for residential purposes, which isn't unlawful.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to enforce the covenant and prevent commercial use.\n\nSo, option C seems most likely correct.\n\nOption A suggests the restriction is no longer enforceable due to the change in neighborhood character, but typically, private covenants are enforceable regardless of such changes, unless there's a specific legal doctrine that says otherwise.\n\nI don't recall any such doctrine that would make a private restrictive covenant unenforceable solely based on a change in neighborhood character.\n\nSimilarly, option B mentions that the restriction is no longer enforceable because of rezoning, but again, zoning and private covenants are separate, and one doesn't necessarily override the other.\n\nOption D might be tempting, but given that the deed explicitly says \"no lot shall be used except for residential purposes,\" and a beauty parlor is a commercial activity, it's likely that the court would consider this a violation of the restriction.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the court interprets \"residential purposes\" broadly to include certain home-based businesses.\n\nBut given the strict language of the deed, it's possible that the court would take a narrow interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court would consider the size and impact of the beauty parlor operation. If it's small and doesn't disrupt the neighborhood, perhaps it could be allowed.\n\nBut since the question is about what the court \"will most likely hold,\" and given the explicit language in the deed, I think the court is more likely to enforce the residential use restriction strictly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is probably C: the residency restriction is enforceable, thus preventing any commercial use.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
