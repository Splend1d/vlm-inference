                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question. It's about a philosopher named Norcross and his view on moral standing in relation to animals. The question is asking which argument he considers a significant challenge to any criterion that tries to grant full moral standing to humans but not to animals.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"full moral standing\" means. Generally, it refers to the idea that an entity has moral rights and deserves moral consideration in its own right. So, if someone is trying to set criteria for full moral standing that excludes animals, they're likely arguing that humans have certain qualities or characteristics that animals lack, and these qualities are what grant us full moral standing.\n\nNow, the question is asking about an argument that challenges this view. The options are:\n\nA. the ontological argument\n\nB. the argument from cosmology\n\nC. the argument from marginal cases\n\nD. none of the above\n\nI need to think about what each of these arguments entails.\n\nStarting with option A, the ontological argument. I know that the ontological argument is a philosophical argument for the existence of God, based on the concept of a being than which no greater can be conceived. It's primarily associated with St. Anselm and has been discussed and debated by many philosophers. I don't see an immediate connection between the ontological argument and the issue of moral standing for animals. It seems like a stretch to think that Norcross would consider this a challenge to criteria excluding animals from full moral standing.\n\nOption B is the argument from cosmology. Cosmology is the study of the origin and development of the universe. I'm not sure how an argument from cosmology would relate to moral standing for animals. Maybe someone could argue that humans have a unique place in the universe, but I don't recall Norcross discussing this in particular. It doesn't seem directly relevant to the criteria for moral standing based on characteristics like rationality or self-awareness.\n\nOption C is the argument from marginal cases. This seems more promising. The argument from marginal cases is a common argument in animal ethics. It points out that there are humans who don't possess certain characteristics to the same degree as typical adults\u2014for example, very young children, elderly people with dementia, or individuals with severe cognitive impairments. If the criterion for full moral standing is based on certain cognitive abilities, then these marginal human cases might not meet that criterion, which would mean they wouldn't have full moral standing either. This creates a problem because most people intuitively think that all humans, including these marginal cases, deserve full moral standing.\n\nSo, if someone is trying to exclude animals from full moral standing based on certain capacities, the argument from marginal cases challenges this by showing that the same criterion would also exclude some humans. This is a significant challenge because it forces those who want to grant full moral standing only to humans to either extend it to animals as well or to find a different justification for why marginal human cases still deserve full moral standing.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which I'll consider if none of the other options seem suitable.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think option C, the argument from marginal cases, is the most plausible answer. Norcross, being a philosopher concerned with animal ethics, would likely consider this argument a formidable challenge to any criterion that excludes animals from full moral standing.\n\nTo double-check, I should consider if Norcross has specifically discussed this argument in his work. I recall that Norcross is known for his work in applied ethics, including animal rights and euthanasia. In his writings on animal ethics, he does discuss the argument from marginal cases, emphasizing that if we grant full moral standing to all humans based on certain capacities, we must also consider animals that possess similar or higher levels of those capacities.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C, the argument from marginal cases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
