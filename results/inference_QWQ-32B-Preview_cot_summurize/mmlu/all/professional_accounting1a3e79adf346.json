                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Dodd Co. has some available-for-sale debt securities, and at the end of the year, December 31, their cost basis is $24,000 and their fair value is $30,000. The company's income tax rate is 20%. We need to figure out what amount of unrealized gain or loss Dodd should recognize in its income statement at December 31.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what available-for-sale securities are. These are investments that are reported at fair value on the balance sheet, and any unrealized gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders' equity, not in the income statement. However, there might be a tax implication here, so I have to be careful.\n\nThe cost basis is $24,000 and the fair value is $30,000, so there's an unrealized gain of $6,000 ($30,000 - $24,000). Normally, for available-for-sale securities, this unrealized gain would go directly to other comprehensive income, bypassing the income statement.\n\nBut, there's an income tax rate of 20% mentioned. I recall that for available-for-sale securities, the unrealized gains and losses are considered temporary differences for tax purposes, and they give rise to deferred tax liabilities or assets.\n\nSo, the unrealized gain of $6,000 would result in a deferred tax liability of 20% of $6,000, which is $1,200. This deferred tax liability would be recognized in the balance sheet, but again, the unrealized gain itself should go to other comprehensive income, not the income statement.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the amount of unrealized gain or loss that Dodd should recognize in its income statement at December 31. According to what I just thought, it should be $0, because available-for-sale securities' unrealized gains and losses are reported in other comprehensive income, not in the income statement.\n\nLet me double-check this. In financial accounting, available-for-sale securities are marked to market through other comprehensive income, and only realized gains or losses are reported in the income statement. Unrealized gains and losses remain in shareholders' equity until the securities are sold.\n\nSo, if that's the case, the answer should be B. $0.\n\nBut let's look at the options again:\n\nA. $6,000 loss.\n\nB. $0\n\nC. $4,800 gain.\n\nD. $6,000 gain.\n\nOption D is $6,000 gain, which would be the unrealized gain, but as I said, it should go to other comprehensive income, not the income statement.\n\nOption C is $4,800 gain. Maybe this is the after-tax amount? If the unrealized gain is $6,000 and the tax rate is 20%, then the tax on the gain would be $1,200, so $6,000 - $1,200 = $4,800. But again, for available-for-sale securities, the unrealized gain goes to other comprehensive income, and the deferred tax liability is recognized separately.\n\nOption A is $6,000 loss, which doesn't make sense because it's a gain, not a loss.\n\nSo, why is $0 the correct answer? Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If Dodd Co. had trading securities, then unrealized gains and losses on those would be recognized in the income statement. But in this case, it's available-for-sale securities, which treatment is different.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a reclassification adjustment if some of the securities are sold. But in this problem, it's only December 31, and there's no mention of any sales. It's just about the year-end reporting.\n\nAnother thought: if the securities were classified as held-to-maturity, they would be reported at amortized cost, and there wouldn't be any unrealized gains or losses recognized. But they are available-for-sale, so that's not the case.\n\nI think I need to refer to the authoritative literature here. According to GAAP, specifically ASC 320, Investments\u2014Debt and Equity Securities, for available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are reported in other comprehensive income and are part of accumulated other comprehensive income.\n\nTherefore, in the income statement, there should be no recognition of the unrealized gain or loss from available-for-sale securities. Any changes in fair value affect shareholders' equity, not net income.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. $0.\n\nBut maybe there's a twist here. Perhaps the question is referring to the effect of the unrealized gain on comprehensive income, but the question specifically asks about the income statement.\n\nComprehensive income includes both net income and other comprehensive income. Net income is what's reported in the income statement, while other comprehensive income is presented separately, usually in the equity section of the balance sheet or in a separate statement of comprehensive income.\n\nTherefore, the unrealized gain would be included in comprehensive income but not in the net income reported in the income statement.\n\nHence, the amount of unrealized gain or loss that Dodd should recognize in its income statement is $0.\n\nI think the answer is B. $0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nB. $0"
