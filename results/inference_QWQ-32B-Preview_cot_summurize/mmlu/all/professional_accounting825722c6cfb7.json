                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. Adam Smith is looking to automate his pin factory by buying a machine that costs $475,000, plus $5,000 for shipping and installation. So, the total initial investment is $475,000 + $5,000 = $480,000.\n\nNow, automation will save him $45,000 per year in reduced scrap and $65,000 per year in reduced labor costs, totaling $110,000 in annual savings.\n\nThe machine has a useful life of 4 years and falls under the 3-year property class for MACRS depreciation. The Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) is a method for depreciating the cost of assets over time for tax purposes. For a 3-year property class, the depreciation rates are as follows:\n\n- Year 1: 33.33%\n- Year 2: 44.45%\n- Year 3: 14.81%\n- Year 4: 7.41%\n\nThe salvage value at the end of 4 years is $120,000, and the firm's marginal tax rate is 34%.\n\nWe need to find the incremental cash outflow at time period 0, which is essentially the initial investment adjusted for any tax implications.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the total initial investment:\n\nPurchase cost: $475,000\nShipping and installation: $5,000\nTotal initial investment: $475,000 + $5,000 = $480,000\n\nNow, we need to consider the tax shield from depreciation. Under MACRS, the depreciation expense in each year reduces taxable income, providing a cash flow benefit equal to the depreciation amount multiplied by the tax rate.\n\nHowever, since we're only asked for the incremental cash outflow at time period 0, we don't need to calculate the depreciation tax shield for each year yet. The initial cash outflow is simply the cost of the machine plus any additional costs to get it ready for use, which we've already calculated as $480,000.\n\nBut, we should check if there's any other cash flow impact at time 0. For example, if the automation leads to an immediate change in working capital or if there are any other initial costs.\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any changes in working capital or other initial costs beyond the purchase and installation of the machine. Therefore, the incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is $480,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $280,000.00\nB. $380,000.00\nC. $480,000.00\nD. $580,000.00\n\nThe closest answer is C. $480,000.00.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check if there's anything else we need to consider. Perhaps the salvage value or the tax implications on it, but since salvage value is a cash inflow at the end of the machine's life, it affects the cash flows in year 4, not at time period 0.\n\nSimilarly, the annual savings of $110,000 are cash inflows that occur\u6bcf\u5e74 over the 4-year period, but again, they don't affect the initial cash outflow.\n\nTherefore, the incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is indeed the initial investment of $480,000.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. $480,000.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
