Louie and Dewey\n\nI think I've heard of The Attractions before, but I'm not sure if that's his band. Maybe The Silver Bullet Band? I remember that Huey Lewis had a popular band in the 80s, and I think their name was something catchy. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I know Huey Lewis is a musician known for his music in films like \"Back to the Future\" and for songs like \"Hip to be Square\" and \"Sports.\" So, his band must have been pretty famous during that time.\n\nLet me eliminate some options. The News was a band from the 70s, but I'm not sure if Huey Lewis was associated with them. The Attractions, I believe, was Steve Norman's backing band, who played with various artists, but I'm not sure about Huey Lewis. Louie and Dewey sounds familiar, but I think that might be a different act.\n\nI think The Silver Bullet Band is the correct answer. I recall seeing that name on album covers and in credits. Yes, Huey Lewis and the Silver Bullet Band is the name of the group.\n\nTo confirm, Huey Lewis and the Silver Bullet Band was active from the late 70s through the 90s, producing several hit songs and albums. So, the correct answer should be C. The Silver Bullet Band.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
