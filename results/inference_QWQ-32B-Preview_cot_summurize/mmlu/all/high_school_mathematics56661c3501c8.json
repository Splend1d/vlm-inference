                    "text": "Let's tackle this system of equations. We have:\n\n\\[\n\n725x + 727y = 1500 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n729x + 731y = 1508 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\n\\]\n\nAnd we need to find the value of \\( x - y \\). Hmm, looking at the coefficients, they're pretty close to each other. Maybe there's a way to simplify this system to make it easier to solve.\n\nFirst, I'll try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's see if I can eliminate \\( y \\) by making the coefficients of \\( y \\) in both equations the same.\n\nThe coefficients of \\( y \\) are 727 and 731. The difference between them is 4. Similarly, the coefficients of \\( x \\) are 725 and 729, which also differ by 4. And the right-hand sides are 1500 and 1508, differing by 8.\n\nThis pattern makes me think that perhaps subtracting the first equation from the second could simplify things.\n\nSo, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n\\[\n\n(729x + 731y) - (725x + 727y) = 1508 - 1500\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n(729x - 725x) + (731y - 727y) = 8\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n4x + 4y = 8\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\nx + y = 2 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\n\\]\n\nOkay, that gives us a relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Now, I need another equation to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) individually or to find \\( x - y \\) directly.\n\nLet me see if I can find another way to relate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Maybe I can try to express one variable in terms of the other using equation (3) and substitute back into one of the original equations.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\n\\[\n\nx = 2 - y \\quad \\text{(4)}\n\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute equation (4) into equation (1):\n\n\\[\n\n725(2 - y) + 727y = 1500\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n1450 - 725y + 727y = 1500\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n1450 + 2y = 1500\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n2y = 50\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\ny = 25\n\n\\]\n\nNow, plug \\( y = 25 \\) back into equation (4):\n\n\\[\n\nx = 2 - 25 = -23\n\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( x = -23 \\) and \\( y = 25 \\). Therefore, \\( x - y = -23 - 25 = -48 \\).\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's check if these values satisfy both original equations.\n\nFirst, equation (1):\n\n\\[\n\n725(-23) + 727(25) = -16675 + 18175 = 1500\n\n\\]\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nNow, equation (2):\n\n\\[\n\n729(-23) + 731(25) = -16767 + 18275 = 1508\n\n\\]\n\nPerfect, that works too.\n\nSo, the value of \\( x - y \\) is -48.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option D is -48. But option B is -2, which is the value of \\( x + y \\), wait no, equation (3) is \\( x + y = 2 \\), but we just found \\( x - y = -48 \\).\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n\\[\n\n725x + 727y = 1500\n\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\n\\[\n\n729x + 731y = 1508\n\n\\]\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n\\[\n\n4x + 4y = 8 \\implies x + y = 2\n\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( x = 2 - y \\).\n\nSubstitute into equation (1):\n\n\\[\n\n725(2 - y) + 727y = 1500\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n1450 - 725y + 727y = 1500\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n1450 + 2y = 1500\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n2y = 50 \\implies y = 25\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\nx = 2 - 25 = -23\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\nx - y = -23 - 25 = -48\n\n\\]\n\nEverything seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be -48, which is option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps by eliminating \\( x \\) instead of \\( y \\).\n\nMultiply equation (1) by 729 and equation (2) by 725 to make the coefficients of \\( x \\) the same:\n\n\\[\n\n729(725x + 727y) = 729 \\times 1500\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n725(729x + 731y) = 725 \\times 1508\n\n\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[\n\n528025x + 529563y = 1,093,500 \\quad \\text{(5)}\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n528025x + 530,575y = 1,093,500 \\quad \\text{(6)}\n\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems complicated and might not be the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the differences in coefficients to find a pattern.\n\nLooking back, perhaps there's a simpler way to find \\( x - y \\) directly without solving for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) individually.\n\nLet me consider adding or subtracting the equations in a way that isolates \\( x - y \\).\n\nLet me try to manipulate the equations to directly find \\( x - y \\).\n\nLet's denote equation (1) as:\n\n\\[\n\na x + b y = c\n\n\\]\n\nAnd equation (2) as:\n\n\\[\n\nd x + e y = f\n\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( a = 725 \\), \\( b = 727 \\), \\( c = 1500 \\), \\( d = 729 \\), \\( e = 731 \\), \\( f = 1508 \\).\n\nI need to find an linear combination of these equations that results in \\( x - y \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of determinants or Cramer's rule to find \\( x - y \\) directly, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since I already have \\( x + y = 2 \\), and I need \\( x - y = -48 \\), I can solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) using these two equations.\n\nSo, from \\( x + y = 2 \\) and \\( x - y = -48 \\), I can add these two equations to eliminate \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 2 + (-48)\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n2x = -46 \\implies x = -23\n\n\\]\n\nThen, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n\\[\n\n(x + y) - (x - y) = 2 - (-48)\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n2y = 50 \\implies y = 25\n\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( x - y \\) is indeed -48.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-48} \\]"
