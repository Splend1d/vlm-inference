This process generates heat, which drives various geological activities such as plate tectonics, volcanic eruptions, and the movement of tectonic plates.\n\nWhile tidal friction, gravitational pressure, and solar radiation do play roles in Earth's energy balance, they are not the principal sources of its internal energy.\n\n- **Tidal friction** affects the Earth's rotation and contributes to the heating of the Earth's interior, but its contribution is minor compared to radioactivity.\n\n- **Gravitational pressure** is important in the Earth's core, contributing to its high temperature and pressure, but it is not a source of energy in the same way that radioactivity is.\n\n- **Solar radiation** is the primary source of energy for the Earth's atmosphere and hydrosphere, driving weather patterns and the water cycle, but it does not significantly contribute to the Earth's internal energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. radioactivity."
