                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out how many cups of coffee were consumed in the United States in the past week back in 2013. The options are:\n\nA. 300 million cups per week\n\nB. 1 billion cups per week\n\nC. 3 billion cups per week\n\nD. 9 billion cups per week\n\nHmm, I don't remember the exact statistics for coffee consumption in the US from 2013, but I can try to reason this out.\n\nFirst, I know that coffee is very popular in the US, and a lot of people drink it regularly. According to some general knowledge, around 64% of adults in the US drink coffee daily. But I need to find out the total consumption per week.\n\nLet me think about the population of the US in 2013. I think the population was around 315 million people. But that includes everyone, including children who probably don't drink much coffee.\n\nSo, maybe I should look at the adult population. If I assume that adults are about 75% of the population, that would be around 236 million adults.\n\nBut actually, I recall that the drinking age is 21, so perhaps I should consider the population over 21 years old. According to some data, in 2013, about 242 million people were over 21 in the US.\n\nIf about 64% of adults drink coffee daily, that would be roughly 154 million coffee drinkers.\n\nBut the question is about weekly consumption, not daily. So, if these people drink coffee every day, that would be 154 million cups per day.\n\nWait, but maybe not everyone drinks coffee every single day. Maybe some people drink it a few times a week.\n\nI recall that some studies show that the average coffee drinker consumes about 3 cups per day. But again, that's average, so maybe some drink more, some less.\n\nIf I take 154 million drinkers and assume each drinks 3 cups per day, that would be 462 million cups per day.\n\nBut that seems too high. Maybe the percentage of coffee drinkers is lower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average consumption is lower.\n\nLet me try to find another approach.\n\nI know that in 2013, the US coffee market was quite mature, and consumption patterns were relatively stable.\n\nPerhaps I can look at annual consumption and then divide by 52 weeks to get weekly consumption.\n\nI recall that annually, the US consumes around 400 million cups per day, but I'm not sure about the source.\n\nIf that's the case, then weekly consumption would be around 2.8 billion cups per week.\n\nBut that doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nWait, let's check the options again:\n\nA. 300 million\n\nB. 1 billion\n\nC. 3 billion\n\nD. 9 billion\n\n2.8 billion is closest to 3 billion, so maybe the answer is C.\n\nBut I need to verify this.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to look at coffee sales.\n\nIn 2013, the coffee industry was dominated by chains like Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, and others.\n\nMaybe I can find out how many cups these chains sell per week.\n\nBut that would only account for a portion of total consumption, as many people also drink coffee at home.\n\nAccording to a report, in 2013, Americans consumed an average of 3.1 cups of coffee per day.\n\nIf I take the adult population as 242 million, then total daily consumption would be around 750 million cups per day.\n\nWait, 242 million adults times 3.1 cups per day equals roughly 750 million cups per day.\n\nThen, weekly consumption would be about 5.25 billion cups per week.\n\nBut that's higher than any of the options.\n\nHmm, maybe my assumption about the adult population is incorrect.\n\nLet me check the total population in 2013.\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, the estimated population in 2013 was about 316 million.\n\nIf I assume that only adults drink coffee, and adults are about 78% of the population, that would be around 247 million adults.\n\nAt 3.1 cups per day, that's about 765 million cups per day, or about 5.355 billion cups per week.\n\nStill higher than the options given.\n\nMaybe the average consumption is lower.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not all adults drink coffee.\n\nIf only 64% of adults drink coffee, then the number of coffee drinkers would be about 158 million.\n\nAt 3.1 cups per day, that's about 490 million cups per day, or about 3.43 billion cups per week.\n\nThat's closer to option C, 3 billion cups per week.\n\nBut still a bit higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average consumption is lower than 3.1 cups per day.\n\nI might be misremembering the figure.\n\nLet me try to recall: I think the average coffee consumption per capita is about 2.6 cups per day in the US.\n\nIf that's the case, then for 158 million coffee drinkers, total daily consumption would be about 410 million cups per day, or about 2.87 billion cups per week.\n\nThat's closest to option C, 3 billion cups per week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total consumption includes both adults and children, but since children likely consume very little coffee, it's probably safe to consider only the adult population.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that some coffee is consumed in larger servings, like lattes or cappuccinos, which might be equivalent to more than one cup of coffee.\n\nBut I think the standard measurement is based on an 8-ounce cup.\n\nMoreover, home consumption should also be included, which might be higher or lower than restaurant consumption.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look for a simpler approach.\n\nIf I consider that the US consumes about 20 billion pounds of coffee per year, and each cup is about 12 ounces, then:\n\nFirst, convert pounds to ounces: 20 billion pounds * 16 ounces per pound = 320 billion ounces.\n\nThen, divide by 12 ounces per cup: 320 billion ounces / 12 ounces per cup = about 26.67 billion cups per year.\n\nThen, divide by 52 weeks: 26.67 billion cups per year / 52 weeks = about 513 million cups per week.\n\nBut that seems way too low compared to my earlier estimates.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion.\n\nLet me check:\n\n1 pound = 16 ounces\n\nSo, 20 billion pounds * 16 ounces = 320 billion ounces\n\nA standard cup of coffee is about 8 ounces, not 12.\n\nSo, 320 billion ounces / 8 ounces per cup = 40 billion cups per year.\n\nThen, 40 billion cups per year / 52 weeks = about 769 million cups per week.\n\nThat's still much lower than my previous estimates.\n\nThis inconsistency is confusing.\n\nMaybe the annual consumption figure is incorrect.\n\nI recall that the US is one of the largest coffee consumers in the world, so 40 billion cups per year seems too low.\n\nWait, according to the International Coffee Organization, the US consumes about 400 million cups per day, which would be about 146 billion cups per year.\n\nIf that's the case, then weekly consumption would be about 2.8 billion cups per week, which aligns with option C, 3 billion cups per week.\n\nBut I need to verify the source.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 400 million cups per day is only for commercial consumption, not including home consumption.\n\nHome consumption could be significant.\n\nAccording to the National Coffee Association, in 2013, the average daily consumption was about 3.1 cups per consumer, and there were about 150 million coffee drinkers in the US.\n\nSo, 150 million drinkers * 3.1 cups per day = 465 million cups per day, or about 3.255 billion cups per week.\n\nThat's still close to option C, 3 billion cups per week.\n\nBut my earlier calculation based on annual consumption from the International Coffee Organization suggests about 2.8 billion cups per week.\n\nConsidering these estimates, option C, 3 billion cups per week, seems the most plausible.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
