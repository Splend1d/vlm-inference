                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this educational psychologist who's giving a basic skills exam to second-graders in two different schools: Antrim School and Barton School. She gives the test in the morning to one school and in the afternoon to the other, both on the same Wednesday. Now, the question is asking about a confounding variable in this research setup. A confounding variable is something that could influence the outcome of the experiment and might trick the researcher into thinking that the difference in results is due to the schools themselves, when really it's because of this other variable.\n\nSo, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The psychologist is comparing two different schools.\n\nWell, yeah, that's the point\u2014she's comparing the two schools. But is this a confounding variable? Not really, because the whole purpose is to see if there's a difference between the schools.\n\nB. The psychologist is comparing the same grade in each school.\n\nAgain, that's the intention\u2014to compare second-graders from both schools. This shouldn't be a confounding variable because it's controlled; it's the same grade in both places.\n\nC. The psychologist is testing the students in the two schools at two different times.\n\nHmm, this seems interesting. One group is tested in the morning, and the other in the afternoon. Could time of day affect performance? Maybe students are more alert in the morning or more tired in the afternoon. That could influence how well they do on the exam, right? So, if one group does better or worse, is it because of the school or because of the time of day they took the test?\n\nD. The psychologist is testing the students in the two schools on the same day.\n\nTesting on the same day might control for some variables, like daily news events or something, but it doesn't seem like a confounding variable here. In fact, testing on the same day might help minimize differences due to time passing.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think option C is the best answer. The different times of day when the test is administered could affect the students' performance, making it a confounding variable. The psychologist should probably consider testing both groups at the same time to ensure that any differences in scores are due to the schools and not to the time of day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
