This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n\u2014Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nThe situation faced by the young women in the passage above is most directly comparable to which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see. I have this passage from Jacob Riis's \"How the Other Half Lives\" from 1890. It's about a young woman working in a manufacturing department of a Broadway house, making only three dollars a week. She can barely afford one meal a day, and the conditions are so harsh that she's considering less desirable options just to have enough to eat. It's really sad.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options\u2014American revolutionaries in the 1770s, slaves in the antebellum South, Populist farmers in the 1890s, or Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s\u2014is most directly comparable to the situation of these young women.\n\nFirst, let's think about the context of each option.\n\nA. American revolutionaries in the 1770s: These were people fighting for independence from British rule. They were motivated by political freedoms and rights, not exactly by economic exploitation or poor working conditions like the woman in the passage. So, this seems less comparable.\n\nB. Slaves in the antebellum South: Slaves were owned by their masters, forced to work without pay, and had no control over their lives. The woman in the passage is working for wages, albeit very low wages, and has some degree of freedom. So, while both are exploited, the slavery comparison might be too extreme.\n\nC. Populist farmers in the 1890s: Populists were farmers who felt exploited by banks, railroads, and other powerful interests. They faced economic hardships and sought political solutions. The woman in the passage is also facing economic hardship, but she's a factory worker, not a farmer. There might be some similarities in their struggles for better conditions, but they're not directly comparable.\n\nD. Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s: In the 1930s, autoworkers in Detroit were fighting for better wages, working conditions, and union rights. They faced tough conditions and often low pay, similar to the woman in the passage. However, the time period is different; the passage is from 1890, and the autoworkers are in the 1930s.\n\nHmm, so none of the options is a perfect match, but I need to choose the one most directly comparable.\n\nLet me consider the level of exploitation, the economic hardship, and the lack of basic necessities like proper meals.\n\nSlaves in the antebellum South were severely exploited and had no control over their lives, but they were provided with basic necessities by their owners, albeit in a subsistence manner.\n\nThe Populist farmers owned their land but were indebted to banks and struggled economically. They had more autonomy than the woman in the passage but perhaps less security.\n\nDetroit autoworkers in the 1930s were fighting for better conditions, which is similar to what the woman might need, but again, the time period and industry are different.\n\nThe American revolutionaries were fighting for political freedoms, which isn't directly comparable to the economic struggles described in the passage.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm overthinking this. The question is about the situation being most directly comparable to one of these options.\n\nThe woman is a low-wage worker in a manufacturing job, facing extreme poverty and barely able to afford food. She's considering less desirable options just to eat properly.\n\nAmong the options, slaves in the antebellum South were also severely exploited and had no control over their lives. While their living conditions were different, the level of exploitation is high.\n\nPopulist farmers faced economic hardships but had more autonomy and owned their farms, even if they were in debt.\n\nDetroit autoworkers in the 1930s were fighting for better conditions, which is similar, but again, the time period and industry differ.\n\nAmerican revolutionaries were fighting for political rights, not economic conditions.\n\nSo, considering the level of exploitation and lack of control over their lives, slaves in the antebellum South might be the most directly comparable, even if their situations aren't identical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Populist farmers, as they were struggling economically and seeking political solutions to their problems.\n\nBut I think the slavery comparison is stronger because of the severe exploitation and lack of autonomy.\n\nWait, but slavery is a very extreme comparison. The woman in the passage is being paid, no matter how little, and has some degree of freedom.\n\nPerhaps there's a better answer.\n\nLet me look back at the passage. It mentions that the woman is young and pretty, and implies that her circumstances might lead her to make poor choices, like early and improvident marriage.\n\nIt also mentions that two young sewing-girls sought domestic service just to get three meals a day, because they were barely eating otherwise.\n\nSo, the situation is one of extreme poverty and lack of basic necessities, leading to difficult choices.\n\nComparing this to the options:\n\n- American revolutionaries were fighting for political freedoms, not economic conditions.\n\n- Slaves were severely exploited but provided with basic subsistence.\n\n- Populist farmers were economically struggling but owned their farms.\n\n- Detroit autoworkers were fighting for better wages and working conditions in the 1930s.\n\nPerhaps the Detroit autoworkers are more comparable because they were industrial workers fighting for better conditions, similar to what the woman in the passage might need.\n\nBut the time period is different, and autoworkers in the 1930s had different issues compared to factory workers in the 1890s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Populist farmers are more comparable because they were struggling economically and seeking political solutions, similar to how the woman might need societal changes to improve her condition.\n\nBut again, farmers and factory workers are different.\n\nWait, maybe none of the options are perfectly comparable, and I need to choose the closest one.\n\nGiven that, slaves in the antebellum South were severely exploited, similar to the woman in the passage.\n\nHowever, slavery is a completely different institution, and the comparison might not be accurate.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is D, Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s, because they were industrial workers fighting for better conditions, which is similar to what the woman in the passage needs.\n\nBut again, the time period and specific industries differ.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me consider the level of poverty and exploitation.\n\nThe woman in the passage is making only three dollars a week, which in 1890 would be very little.\n\nSlaves were not paid but were provided with subsistence.\n\nPopulist farmers owned their land but were in debt.\n\nDetroit autoworkers in the 1930s were paid workers but sought better wages and conditions.\n\nAmerican revolutionaries were fighting for political freedoms.\n\nPerhaps the slaves are the closest in terms of severe exploitation, but it's not a perfect comparison.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Populist farmers, as they were struggling economically and needed political solutions, similar to the woman needing societal changes to improve her situation.\n\nBut again, it's not a direct comparison.\n\nI think the best answer is B, slaves in the antebellum South, because both groups were severely exploited and had limited control over their lives.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit uneasy with that choice because slavery is an extreme institution.\n\nMaybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps the situation of the woman is most directly comparable to that of slaves because of the severity of her exploitation and the desperation she feels, leading her to consider poor choices just to survive.\n\nBut again, it's not a perfect comparison.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Populist farmers are more comparable because they were fighting for economic reforms, similar to what the woman might need.\n\nBut they had more autonomy and owned their farms, even if they were in debt.\n\nI guess it comes down to which group faced the most severe economic hardship and lack of control over their lives.\n\nSlaves had no control and were severely exploited, but were provided with subsistence.\n\nThe woman in the passage is working for wages but not even earning enough to feed herself properly.\n\nSo, in terms of economic hardship, they might be comparable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Slaves in the antebellum South.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
