                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"The simplest alkene has...\" and then it lists a few options. Let's see, alkene is a type of hydrocarbon that contains at least one double bond between carbon atoms. So, the simplest alkene would be the one with the fewest carbon atoms possible, right?\n\nOkay, starting with the basics. The smallest alkane is methane, which is CH4, but that doesn't have any double bonds. To have a double bond, I need at least two carbon atoms, so that would be ethene, which is C2H4.\n\nSo, ethene has two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms, with a double bond between the two carbons. Now, let's think about the bonds involved.\n\nFirst, a double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. So, in ethene, there's one sigma bond and one pi bond between the two carbon atoms. And then, each carbon is bonded to two hydrogen atoms with sigma bonds.\n\nSo, total bonds: one sigma C-C, one pi C=C, and four sigma C-H bonds. So, in total, there are five sigma bonds and one pi bond in ethene.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. at least two pi bonds\n\nBut in ethene, there's only one pi bond. So, that can't be right.\n\nB. at least four sigma bonds\n\nEthene has five sigma bonds, so that's true.\n\nC. a tetrahedral configuration\n\nWait, ethene isn't tetrahedral. In alkanes like methane, each carbon is sp3 hybridized and has a tetrahedral shape around it. But in alkene, the carbon atoms are sp2 hybridized, which is trigonal planar, not tetrahedral.\n\nD. cis-trans isomers\n\nEthene doesn't have cis-trans isomers because there's only one way to arrange the hydrogen atoms around the double bond. Cis-trans isomerism comes into play when there are different groups attached to the double-bonded carbons.\n\nSo, considering that, option B seems correct because ethene has at least four sigma bonds, which it does.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's a simpler alkene than ethene that defies this.\n\nWait, can there be an alkene with just one carbon? No, because a double bond requires at least two carbon atoms.\n\nSo, ethene is indeed the simplest alkene, with five sigma bonds and one pi bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: at least four sigma bonds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
