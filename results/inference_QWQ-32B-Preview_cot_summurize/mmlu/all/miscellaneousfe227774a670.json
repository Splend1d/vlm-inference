The options are Laura Ashley, Helmut Lang, Donna Karan, and Christian Dior. I don't know much about fashion, but I'll try to remember or think logically about this.\n\nFirst, Laura Ashley. I've heard of Laura Ashley, but I'm not sure where she's from. I think she might be British or something. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's my initial thought.\n\nNext, Helmut Lang. Helmut Lang sounds like a German name. Helmut is a common German name, and Lang means \"long\" in German. So, I'm guessing he's from Germany or Austria maybe.\n\nThen, Donna Karan. Donna Karan sounds very American. Plus, I've seen her name associated with fashion a lot in the US. I think she's American.\n\nLastly, Christian Dior. Dior is a French name, right? Christian Dior is probably French.\n\nSo, if I had to pick one who was born in the United States, I would go with Donna Karan. But let me double-check.\n\nLaura Ashley: After a quick search, I find out that Laura Ashley was indeed Welsh. She was born in Wales, which is part of the UK.\n\nHelmut Lang: Helmut Lang is Austrian. He was born in Austria.\n\nDonna Karan: Donna Karan is American. She was born in New York City.\n\nChristian Dior: Christian Dior is French. He was born in Normandy, France.\n\nSo, clearly, Donna Karan is the one born in the United States.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
