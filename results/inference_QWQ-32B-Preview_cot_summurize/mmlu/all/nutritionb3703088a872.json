                    "text": "Let's see. I have these options here about infant feeding recommendations, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Okay, first, I know that breastfeeding is really important for babies, so option A says that all babies should be exclusively breastfed until around 6 months. That sounds familiar; I think I've heard that before. Maybe that's the right one.\n\nOption B says that solids should be introduced at 4 months of age. Hmm, but I thought babies are usually ready for solids around 6 months. Isn't 4 months a bit early? I think there might be some guidelines about that.\n\nOption C says that cow's milk is appropriate for all children from 6 months. Wait, I'm pretty sure that's not right. I think whole milk is recommended for babies after a certain age, but I'm not sure if it's okay from 6 months. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nOption D says that bottle feeding is more appropriate for babies than breastfeeding. That seems opposite to what I've always thought. I thought breastfeeding was generally recommended over bottle feeding, unless there are specific reasons why breastfeeding isn't possible.\n\nLet me try to recall what the standard recommendations are. I remember that the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have guidelines on infant feeding. According to them, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first 6 months of life. That would support option A.\n\nOption B suggests introducing solids at 4 months, but I think the standard recommendation is to start solids around 6 months, when babies show signs of being ready, like being able to sit up and showing interest in food. Starting too early might not be beneficial and could even be harmful.\n\nOption C mentions cow's milk from 6 months. I believe that whole milk can be introduced after 12 months of age, not 6 months. Before that, babies' digestive systems might not be ready for cow's milk, and it doesn't provide the right balance of nutrients for infants under one year old.\n\nOption D says that bottle feeding is more appropriate than breastfeeding. But actually, breastfeeding is recommended whenever possible because it provides numerous health benefits for both the baby and the mother. Bottle feeding is often necessary or chosen in certain situations, but it's not generally considered more appropriate than breastfeeding.\n\nSo, based on what I recall, option A seems to be the correct recommendation. Let me just make sure there isn't any confusion here. Exclusive breastfeeding until around 6 months, with solids introduced around 6 months, cow's milk after 12 months, and breastfeeding being preferred over bottle feeding when possible.\n\nI think that's the standard advice. Maybe I should look it up to confirm, but since this seems like a straightforward question, I'll go with option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
