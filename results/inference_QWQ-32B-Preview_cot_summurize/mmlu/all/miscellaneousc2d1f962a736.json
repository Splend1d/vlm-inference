Cantilevering, B. Contrapposto, C. Sfumato, and D. Foreshortening. I think this has something to do with art techniques, maybe related to perspective or drawing.\n\nLet me start by understanding what each term means. I'll look at them one by one.\n\nFirst, cantilevering. I've heard this term in architecture and engineering. A cantilever is a beam or structure that's supported on only one end, and it extends out into space. So, it's more about physical structures rather than artistic techniques. Maybe not the right answer here.\n\nNext, contrapposto. I think this is an art term, specifically related to sculpture and painting. Contrapposto is a pose where the figure stands with most of its weight on one foot, causing the hips and shoulders to tilt differently. It's a way to create a more natural, relaxed pose. But I don't think this is about creating the illusion of depth or space.\n\nThen, sfumato. I know this is an artistic technique, particularly associated with Leonardo da Vinci. Sfumato is a blending of colors and tones to create a soft, hazy transition between areas, which can give a sense of depth. But I'm not sure if \"distortion\" is the right word for what sfumato does. It's more about blending and fading edges.\n\nFinally, foreshortening. This sounds familiar. Foreshortening is a technique used in drawing and painting to create the illusion that an object is extending into space, often by making parts of the object appear shorter than they are in reality. It's a way to represent three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface.\n\nLet me think about foreshortening a bit more. When artists draw a figure lying down or a limb extending towards or away from the viewer, they use foreshortening to make it look like it's receding into the distance. This often involves distorting the proportions of the object to match how our eyes perceive it in space.\n\nComparing this with the other options, foreshortening seems to be the technique that involves distortion to create the illusion of depth or extension into space. Cantilevering is about physical structures, contrapposto is about pose, and sfumato is about blending tones.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is D. Foreshortening.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
