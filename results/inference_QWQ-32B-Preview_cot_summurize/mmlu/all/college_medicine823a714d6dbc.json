                    "text": "I've got this question about blood glucose during high-intensity exercise. It's asking about the concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise. The options are:\n\nA. frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM.\n\nB. remains relatively unchanged.\n\nC. frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM.\n\nD. falls to hypoglycaemic levels.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how exercise affects blood glucose levels. I know that during exercise, the body uses glucose for energy, so intuitively, I might think that blood glucose levels would decrease. But I also remember that during high-intensity exercise, adrenaline and other hormones are released, which can have different effects on glucose metabolism.\n\nLet me think about the different phases of exercise. In the initial phase, there's a surge in adrenaline, which can cause glycogenolysis\u2014breakdown of glycogen to release glucose\u2014so that might cause a temporary rise in blood glucose. But over time, as the body continues to use glucose, the levels might drop.\n\nGiven that this is intermittent high-intensity exercise lasting 80-90 minutes, it's a significant duration. So, probably, any initial rise would be followed by a sustained use of glucose, leading to a overall decrease in blood glucose levels.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the magnitude of the change. Option A says it frequently rises by 1-3 mM, which seems counterintuitive if the body is using glucose. Option B says it remains relatively unchanged, which might be possible if the release and use of glucose balance each other. Option C says it frequently falls by 1-3 mM, which aligns with my initial thought that prolonged exercise would deplete glucose stores. Option D says it falls to hypoglycaemic levels, which might be too extreme for 80-90 minutes of exercise, unless the individual has insulin-dependent diabetes or something like that.\n\nI need to consider that this is intermittent high-intensity exercise, which might involve both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism. Anaerobic metabolism can lead to lactate production, which might affect glucose regulation.\n\nMaybe I should look up some research or recall specific studies about blood glucose responses to high-intensity intermittent exercise.\n\nI recall that in high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which is similar to intermittent high-intensity exercise, there are both periods of intense exertion and recovery. During the intense exertion, there's a high demand for glucose, but during recovery periods, the demand might decrease.\n\nPerhaps the overall effect is a net decrease in blood glucose levels, but not necessarily to hypoglycaemic levels in healthy individuals.\n\nAlso, the duration is 80-90 minutes, which is long enough for the body to start using other energy sources like fats, but glucose is still an important fuel during high-intensity efforts.\n\nI think the most plausible answer is C. frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM. This suggests that during prolonged high-intensity exercise, blood glucose levels tend to decrease due to increased utilization by the muscles.\n\nOption D seems too extreme unless specified that the individuals are fasting or have some condition that makes them susceptible to hypoglycaemia.\n\nSo, I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
