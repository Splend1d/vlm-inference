Essentially, it's when we stop noticing something that's constant in our environment because our senses adjust to it.\n\nLet's look at each option to see which one best exemplifies this concept.\n\nOption A: Enjoying a song the more you hear it.\n\nThis seems more related to familiarity and preference rather than sensory adaptation. When you enjoy a song more over time, it's likely because you grow accustomed to its melody, lyrics, or other features, but this isn't directly about sensory adaptation.\n\nOption B: Responding immediately every time the fire alarm is sounded.\n\nThis suggests that the person reacts promptly each time the alarm goes off, without getting used to it or ignoring it. Sensory adaptation would actually be the opposite\u2014where repeated exposure to the alarm might lead to a decreased response over time.\n\nOption C: Not realizing how cold the pool is after you are under the water for a few minutes.\n\nThis is a classic example of sensory adaptation. When you first enter the pool, the water feels cold because your skin's temperature receptors are responding to the difference in temperature. However, after a few minutes, you stop noticing the cold as much because your receptors have adapted to the new temperature, reducing their response.\n\nOption D: Relying heavily on your hearing when you are walking down a dark corridor.\n\nThis is more about sensory compensation, where you rely more on one sense when another is impaired or less useful. In this case, in the dark, vision is limited, so you might rely more on hearing to navigate. It's not about adaptation to a constant stimulus.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C best exemplifies sensory adaptation because it shows how our senses adjust to a constant stimulus (the cold water), reducing our perception of it over time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
