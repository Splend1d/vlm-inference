                    "text": "Let's see which statement is false. I remember that there were war crimes trials after World War II, like the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials. So, let's check statement A: \"The war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo took place immediately after the First World War.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound right. World War I was a long time before World War II, and Nuremberg and Tokyo trials were about WWII crimes. So, maybe statement A is false.\n\nNow, statement B says: \"The war crimes trials introduced a 'crime against humanity' as an offence.\" I think that's correct. The Nuremberg trials did establish \"crimes against humanity\" as a legal category, which includes atrocities like genocide and persecution.\n\nStatement C: \"The war crimes trials held individuals legally responsible for acts such as war crimes and crimes against humanity.\" That seems accurate too. One of the key aspects of these trials was to hold individual leaders accountable for their actions during the war.\n\nStatement D: \"The war crimes trials found that \"superior orders\" could not be used as a defence for war crimes or crimes against humanity.\" Yes, that's another important principle established by these trials. Just following orders wasn't accepted as a valid defense for committing war crimes.\n\nSo, considering all that, statement A seems to be the false one because the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials were after World War II, not World War I.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
