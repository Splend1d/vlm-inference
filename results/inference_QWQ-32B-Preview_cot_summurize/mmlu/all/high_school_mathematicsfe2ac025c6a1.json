                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"If the ratio of \\(2x - y\\) to \\(x + y\\) is 2 to 3, what is the ratio of \\(x\\) to \\(y\\)? And we have to express the answer as a common fraction.\" Okay, let's see. The options are \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\), \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\), and \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have two expressions, \\(2x - y\\) and \\(x + y\\), and their ratio is given as 2 to 3. So, that means \\(\\frac{2x - y}{x + y} = \\frac{2}{3}\\). My goal is to find the ratio of \\(x\\) to \\(y\\), which is \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\).\n\nAlright, so I have this equation: \\(\\frac{2x - y}{x + y} = \\frac{2}{3}\\). I need to solve for \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\). Hmm, maybe I can cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions. Let's try that.\n\nCross-multiplying, I get: \\(3(2x - y) = 2(x + y)\\).\n\nNow, let's expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\(3 \\times 2x = 6x\\), and \\(3 \\times (-y) = -3y\\), so \\(6x - 3y\\).\n\nRight side: \\(2 \\times x = 2x\\), and \\(2 \\times y = 2y\\), so \\(2x + 2y\\).\n\nSo, the equation is \\(6x - 3y = 2x + 2y\\).\n\nNow, I can simplify this equation. Let's move all terms involving \\(x\\) to one side and terms involving \\(y\\) to the other side.\n\nSubtract \\(2x\\) from both sides: \\(6x - 2x - 3y = 2y\\), which simplifies to \\(4x - 3y = 2y\\).\n\nNow, add \\(3y\\) to both sides: \\(4x = 2y + 3y\\), which is \\(4x = 5y\\).\n\nOkay, so \\(4x = 5y\\). Now, I need to find \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\). From this equation, I can solve for \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\) by dividing both sides by \\(y\\), and then dividing both sides by 4.\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{4x}{y} = 5\\), which means \\(\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{4}\\).\n\nWait a minute, that's one of the options: \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\). But let me double-check if I did everything correctly.\n\nStarting again: \\(\\frac{2x - y}{x + y} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nCross-multiplying: \\(3(2x - y) = 2(x + y)\\).\n\nExpanding: \\(6x - 3y = 2x + 2y\\).\n\nSubtract \\(2x\\) from both sides: \\(4x - 3y = 2y\\).\n\nAdd \\(3y\\) to both sides: \\(4x = 5y\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{4}\\).\n\nSeems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can express \\(2x - y\\) in terms of \\(x + y\\). Given that their ratio is 2 to 3, perhaps I can set up proportions or something.\n\nLet me think. Let\u2019s denote \\(a = 2x - y\\) and \\(b = x + y\\), and we know that \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nBut I think the cross-multiplication method is straightforward and less error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nFrom \\(4x = 5y\\), I can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\): \\(x = \\frac{5}{4}y\\).\n\nSo, the ratio \\(\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{4}\\).\n\nAlternatively, I could express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\): \\(y = \\frac{4}{5}x\\), which would give the same ratio when expressed as \\(\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{4}\\).\n\nI think this is solid. But to be extra sure, maybe I can plug in some values to check.\n\nSuppose \\(y = 4\\), then \\(x = 5\\), based on \\(\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{4}\\).\n\nNow, let's check the original ratio: \\(\\frac{2x - y}{x + y} = \\frac{2(5) - 4}{5 + 4} = \\frac{10 - 4}{9} = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nYes, that matches the given ratio. So, it seems correct.\n\nMaybe I should try another set of values to confirm.\n\nLet\u2019s choose \\(y = 8\\), then \\(x = 10\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\frac{2(10) - 8}{10 + 8} = \\frac{20 - 8}{18} = \\frac{12}{18} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nAgain, it matches. Okay, I'm confident now.\n\nI don't see any flaws in my reasoning, and the answer seems consistent across different methods and checks.\n\nSo, the ratio of \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) is \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\), which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{4}} \\]\n\n"
