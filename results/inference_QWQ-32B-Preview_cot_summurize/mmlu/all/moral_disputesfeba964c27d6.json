The options are consequentialism, natural law theory, rights-based theory, or virtue ethics. I think I should start by recalling what Aquinas is known for in moral philosophy.\n\nI remember that Aquinas was a medieval philosopher and theologian who integrated Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology. His moral theory is deeply rooted in both classical philosophy and religious doctrine. So, perhaps natural law theory is the way to go here.\n\nLet me think about consequentialism first. Consequentialism is an ethical theory that argues the best action is the one that maximizes good consequences. So, it's all about the outcomes. Aquinas, however, emphasizes the importance of the nature of the action itself and the intentions behind it, not just the results. So, I don't think consequentialism fits well with Aquinas's views.\n\nNext, natural law theory. This seems promising because Aquinas is famous for his theory of natural law. He believed that moral principles are based on the nature of human beings and can be discovered through reason. So, according to natural law theory, certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. This aligns with Aquinas's emphasis on the moral object, intention, and circumstances in his theory of moral action.\n\nNow, rights-based theory. This is an ethical framework that focuses on the rights of individuals. It suggests that actions are moral if they respect and protect individual rights. While Aquinas does discuss the rights of individuals, his moral theory is more comprehensive and grounded in the natural purposes and ends of human actions. So, while there might be some overlap, rights-based theory doesn't seem to capture the essence of Aquinas's moral thought.\n\nLastly, virtue ethics. This is an approach that emphasizes the character and virtues of the moral agent rather than specific rules or consequences. Aristotle is a prominent proponent of virtue ethics, and Aquinas was influenced by Aristotle. However, Aquinas's moral theory is more structured around natural law and the hierarchy of goods leading to the ultimate end, which is God. So, while virtue is important in Aquinas's ethics, it's not the central focus in the same way it is in Aristotle's virtue ethics.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is B. natural law theory. Aquinas's moral theory is fundamentally based on natural law, which provides a rational foundation for moral principles that are in accord with human nature and the purpose of human life.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
