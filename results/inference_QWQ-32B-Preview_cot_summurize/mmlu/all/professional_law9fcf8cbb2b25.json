At trial, the jury found each of the drivers liable for negligence. The jury found that the amount of the truck driver's injuries was $10,000, and the amount of the car driver's injuries was $8,000. The jury assigned 50 percent of the fault for the accident to the truck driver and 50 percent of the fault to the car driver. Assume that the jurisdiction has a statute in effect that provides: \"Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action to recover damages for negligence resulting in injury to person or property if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person from whom recovery is sought. Any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. \"Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?\n\nA. The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.\nB. The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.\nC.

                    "text": "This question is about how damages are apportioned in a situation where both parties are at fault, and it involves understanding the concept of contributory negligence. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the jurisdiction's statute on contributory negligence. The statute states that contributory negligence shall not bar recovery if the negligence of the plaintiff is not greater than that of the defendant. In other words, if the plaintiff is less negligent than the defendant, they can still recover damages, but those damages will be reduced by the percentage of their own negligence.\n\nIn this case, both the truck driver and the car driver are found liable for negligence, each with 50% fault. So, each driver is suing the other for their injuries.\n\nLet's look at the truck driver's claim first:\n\n- The truck driver's injuries amount to $10,000.\n\n- The truck driver is 50% at fault, and the car driver is 50% at fault.\n\nAccording to the statute, since the truck driver's negligence is not greater than that of the car driver, the truck driver can recover damages, but they will be diminished in proportion to the truck driver's own negligence.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\nTotal damages: $10,000\n\nTruck driver's negligence: 50%\n\nTherefore, recoverable damages: $10,000 - ($10,000 * 50%) = $10,000 - $5,000 = $5,000\n\nNow, let's look at the car driver's claim:\n\n- The car driver's injuries amount to $8,000.\n\n- The car driver is 50% at fault, and the truck driver is 50% at fault.\n\nAgain, since the car driver's negligence is not greater than that of the truck driver, the car driver can recover damages, diminished by their own negligence.\n\nCalculation:\n\nTotal damages: $8,000\n\nCar driver's negligence: 50%\n\nRecoverable damages: $8,000 - ($8,000 * 50%) = $8,000 - $4,000 = $4,000\n\nSo, the truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.\n\nThis would be the case if there was no contributory negligence, which is not the situation here.\n\nB. The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.\n\nThis matches our calculations.\n\nC. The truck driver recovers $1,000, and the car driver recovers nothing.\n\nThis doesn't make sense based on the statute and the fault percentages.\n\nD. Neither party recovers anything from the other.\n\nThis would be the case if contributory negligence completely barred recovery, but the statute specifies that it doesn't if the plaintiff's negligence is not greater than the defendant's.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate judgment is option B: The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.\n\nHowever, there is a potential complication here. Since both are suing each other, and both have recoverable claims, the net recovery might be different. Let's consider that.\n\nIf the truck driver owes the car driver $4,000 and the car driver owes the truck driver $5,000, then the net effect is that the truck driver pays the car driver $5,000 minus $4,000, which is $1,000.\n\nBut the question is asking for the appropriate judgment in the case, and the options provided seem to be about the gross recovery amounts, not the net effect.\n\nTherefore, based on the calculations, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
