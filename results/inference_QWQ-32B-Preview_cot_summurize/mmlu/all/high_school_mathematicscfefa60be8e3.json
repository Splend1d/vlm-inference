                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a sequence of three real numbers that form an arithmetic progression (AP) with the first term being 9. Let's denote the common difference of the AP as \\(d\\). Therefore, the three terms of the AP can be expressed as:\n\n1. First term: \\(a_1 = 9\\)\n\n2. Second term: \\(a_2 = 9 + d\\)\n\n3. Third term: \\(a_3 = 9 + 2d\\)\n\nNow, according to the problem, if we add 2 to the second term and add 20 to the third term, the resulting numbers form a geometric progression (GP). So, the modified terms are:\n\n1. First term: \\(9\\)\n\n2. Second term: \\((9 + d) + 2 = 11 + d\\)\n\n3. Third term: \\((9 + 2d) + 20 = 29 + 2d\\)\n\nFor these three numbers to form a GP, the square of the second term must equal the product of the first and third terms. In other words:\n\n\\[(11 + d)^2 = 9 \\times (29 + 2d)\\]\n\nLet's expand and simplify this equation to find the value of \\(d\\).\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n\\[(11 + d)^2 = 121 + 22d + d^2\\]\n\nNow, expand the right side:\n\n\\[9 \\times (29 + 2d) = 261 + 18d\\]\n\nSet the left side equal to the right side:\n\n\\[121 + 22d + d^2 = 261 + 18d\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[d^2 + 22d + 121 - 261 - 18d = 0\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0\\]\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in terms of \\(d\\). Let's solve for \\(d\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[d = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 4\\), and \\(c = -140\\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[d = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-140)}}{2 \\times 1}\\]\n\\[d = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}\\]\n\\[d = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2}\\]\n\\[d = \\frac{-4 \\pm 24}{2}\\]\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for \\(d\\):\n\n1. \\(d = \\frac{-4 + 24}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\\)\n\n2. \\(d = \\frac{-4 - 24}{2} = \\frac{-28}{2} = -14\\)\n\nNow, we need to find the third term of the geometric progression for each value of \\(d\\) and determine the smallest possible value.\n\nFirst, let's consider \\(d = 10\\):\n\nThe third term of the GP is:\n\n\\[29 + 2d = 29 + 2 \\times 10 = 29 + 20 = 49\\]\n\nNext, let's consider \\(d = -14\\):\n\nThe third term of the GP is:\n\n\\[29 + 2d = 29 + 2 \\times (-14) = 29 - 28 = 1\\]\n\nComparing the two possible third terms, 49 and 1, the smallest possible value is 1.\n\nHowever, let's verify if both values of \\(d\\) indeed lead to a valid geometric progression.\n\nFirst, for \\(d = 10\\):\n\nThe modified terms are:\n\n1. 9\n\n2. \\(11 + 10 = 21\\)\n\n3. \\(29 + 20 = 49\\)\n\nCheck if they form a GP:\n\nThe common ratio \\(r\\) should be the same between consecutive terms:\n\n\\[r = \\frac{21}{9} = \\frac{7}{3}\\]\n\n\\[r = \\frac{49}{21} = \\frac{7}{3}\\]\n\nSince both ratios are equal, it's a valid GP.\n\nNow, for \\(d = -14\\):\n\nThe modified terms are:\n\n1. 9\n\n2. \\(11 + (-14) = -3\\)\n\n3. \\(29 + 2*(-14) = 29 - 28 = 1\\)\n\nCheck if they form a GP:\n\nThe common ratio \\(r\\):\n\n\\[r = \\frac{-3}{9} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\n\\[r = \\frac{1}{-3} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\nAgain, both ratios are equal, so it's a valid GP.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]\n"
