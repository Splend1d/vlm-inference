Z_24 is the set of integers modulo 24. So, when we're multiplying two numbers in Z_24, we multiply them as usual integers and then take the remainder when divided by 24.\n\nSo, let's multiply 12 and 16 first: 12 * 16 = 192.\n\nNow, I need to find 192 modulo 24. That means I divide 192 by 24 and see what the remainder is.\n\n192 divided by 24 is 8, because 24 * 8 = 192. So, 192 - 192 = 0.\n\nTherefore, 192 modulo 24 is 0.\n\nSo, the product (12)(16) in Z_24 is 0.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. 0 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nAlternatively, in modular arithmetic, sometimes there are different ways to approach the problem.\n\nLet me see: another way is to reduce each number modulo 24 first, and then multiply.\n\n12 modulo 24 is 12, and 16 modulo 24 is 16.\n\nThen, 12 * 16 = 192, and 192 modulo 24 is 0.\n\nYes, that matches my first calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nWell, in Z_24, the element 24 is equivalent to 0, so any multiple of 24 will be 0 in Z_24.\n\nSince 12 * 16 = 192, and 192 is a multiple of 24 (24 * 8 = 192), so indeed, 192 is 0 in Z_24.\n\nSo, I think it's confirmed: the answer is A. 0.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any property of Z_24 that I might be missing that could affect the multiplication.\n\nZ_24 is a ring, and in rings, multiplication is associative and distributive over addition, but I don't think that affects this straightforward multiplication.\n\nAlso, in Z_24, there are zero divisors, which are pairs of non-zero elements whose product is zero.\n\nIn this case, 12 and 16 are both non-zero in Z_24, and their product is zero, so they are zero divisors.\n\nBut that's just additional information; it doesn't change the calculation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is A. 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
