                    "text": "Let's see. I'm a bit fuzzy on cointegration, but I remember that it has something to do with non-stationary time series. So, let's tackle each statement one by one.\n\nStatement (i): \"x_t and y_t must both be stationary.\"\n\nI think this is not necessarily true. From what I recall, cointegration applies to non-stationary series that share a common stochastic trend. So, if two series are cointegrated, they don't have to be stationary themselves; in fact, they're often integrated of the same order, usually I(1). So, I think statement (i) is false.\n\nStatement (ii): \"Only one linear combination of x_t and y_t will be stationary.\"\n\nHmm, this seems familiar. In cointegration, if two series are cointegrated, there exists at least one linear combination of them that is stationary. But is it only one? Or could there be more? I think in the case of two variables, there's only one possible cointegrating relationship. So, maybe this is true.\n\nStatement (iii): \"The cointegrating equation for x_t and y_t describes the short-run relationship between the two series.\"\n\nI think this is incorrect. Actually, the cointegrating relationship describes the long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables. Any deviations from this equilibrium are supposed to be temporary, and the series tend to move back towards this equilibrium over time. So, this should be false.\n\nStatement (iv): \"The residuals of a regression of y_t on x_t must be stationary.\"\n\nThis sounds right. In the context of cointegration, if you regress one non-stationary variable on another and find that the residuals from this regression are stationary, that suggests the presence of cointegration. So, this seems true.\n\nAlright, summarizing my thoughts:\n\n- (i) False\n\n- (ii) True\n\n- (iii) False\n\n- (iv) True\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. (ii) and (iv) only.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Is it possible for more than one linear combination to be stationary when you have only two variables? I think not. For two variables, there can only be one cointegrating relationship. But if there were more variables, say three or more, then you could have multiple cointegrating relationships. So, for two variables, (ii) should be true.\n\nAlso, confirming that cointegration implies that some linear combination of the variables is stationary, which is reflected in statement (iv).\n\nAnd indeed, the cointegrating relationship describes the long-run relationship, not the short-run one, so (iii) is wrong.\n\nAnd finally, the individual series don't need to be stationary; they can be non-stationary, as long as there's a stationary linear combination between them.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. (ii) and (iv) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
