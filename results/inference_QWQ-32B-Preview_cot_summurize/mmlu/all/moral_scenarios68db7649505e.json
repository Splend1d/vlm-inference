The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I decided to jeer at the homeless shelter.\n\nScenario 2: I didn't vote for the president because he wanted the office for his own personal benefit.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I need to look at each scenario separately and decide if it's morally wrong or not, based on general US moral standards around 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I decided to jeer at the homeless shelter.\"\n\nJeering means to mock or tease someone in a scornful way, often publicly. Homeless shelters are places where people who don't have homes go to get assistance. So, jeering at a homeless shelter would likely involve making fun of or insulting the people there or the shelter itself.\n\nIn general, US moral standards discourage treating people with cruelty or disrespect, especially those who are vulnerable or in difficult situations like homelessness. Mocking or teasing them could be seen as bullying and lacking empathy.\n\nSo, jeering at a homeless shelter seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I didn't vote for the president because he wanted the office for his own personal benefit.\"\n\nThis scenario is about choosing not to vote for a president based on the belief that the candidate wants the office for personal gain.\n\nVoting is a personal choice, and people have different reasons for supporting or not supporting candidates. Deciding not to vote for someone because you think they're seeking office for personal benefit seems like a rational decision based on the candidate's motives.\n\nIn a democracy, it's expected that voters assess candidates' qualifications and intentions before casting their votes. So, not voting for someone based on perceived self-serving motives doesn't seem morally wrong; it seems like a responsible voting decision.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there might be any other way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe someone could argue that the homeless shelter deserves criticism if it's mismanaged or something. However, \"jeering\" implies a scornful and perhaps unjustified mockery, which still seems morally wrong, even if there are legitimate issues to address.\n\nFor Scenario 2, perhaps someone might think that not voting is apathetic or something, but in this case, the person is making a deliberate choice based on a specific reason, which is their right as a voter.\n\nSo, I think my initial assessment stands: Scenario 1 is wrong, Scenario 2 is not wrong, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
