Europe and North Africa\n\nB. Asia and Latin America\n\nC. Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania\n\nD. Central Europe and Australia\n\nI need to think about which regions have been sending the most immigrants to the US in this time period.\n\nFirst, I know that in the past, a lot of immigrants came from Europe, like in the late 1800s and early 1900s. But this is asking about 1980 to the present, so things might have changed since then.\n\nI've heard that a lot of immigrants nowadays are from Latin America, especially Mexico. Also, I think Asia is a big source too, particularly countries like China and India. So, option B seems plausible.\n\nLet me consider option A: Europe and North Africa. While there are still immigrants from Europe, I think the numbers have decreased compared to earlier centuries. North Africa might have some immigration, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other regions.\n\nOption C is Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. I know that there is immigration from Africa, but I'm not sure if it's a major source compared to Asia and Latin America. Oceania would include countries like Australia and New Zealand, but I don't think they make up a large portion of US immigrants.\n\nOption D is Central Europe and Australia. Again, Central Europe might have some immigration, but I think it's not as substantial as from Asia and Latin America.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any statistics or trends. I remember reading that the largest group of new immigrants to the US is from Mexico, followed by other Latin American countries like El Salvador, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. Also, there's a significant number from Asia, particularly China and India.\n\nIn fact, in recent years, more immigrants to the US have come from Asia than from any other region. So, combining Asia and Latin America makes sense as the primary sources of immigration to the US since 1980.\n\nLet me double-check with what I know about immigration patterns. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a significant influx of immigrants from Latin America, driven by factors like economic opportunities and political instability in their home countries.\n\nAt the same time, immigration from Asia has been growing steadily, with many coming for education and employment opportunities.\n\nComparatively, immigration from Europe has slowed down, although there are still Europeans moving to the US.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa has seen increased immigration, but it's still smaller in numbers compared to Asia and Latin America.\n\nOceania is even smaller, though there might be some immigration from Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that the correct answer is B: Asia and Latin America.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there have been any major shifts in immigration patterns recently that might affect this answer.\n\nFor example, in the 2010s, there was a lot of talk about immigration from Central America, particularly from the Northern Triangle countries like Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.\n\nAlso, there has been an increase in immigration from Africa in recent years, but still, it's not on par with Asia and Latin America.\n\nMoreover, the US has seen an increase in diversity in immigration sources, but Asia and Latin America remain the top regions.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is B: Asia and Latin America.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
