                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: My drunk friend insisted I let him drive home, but I drove him instead.\n\nScenario 2: I played fetch with my dog at the nuclear power plant.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about Scenario 1. So, my friend is drunk and wants to drive home, but I drive him instead. Hmm, drinking and driving is a big no-no, right? It's against the law and morally wrong because it endangers people's lives. So, if my friend was insisting on driving drunk, and I intervened and drove him instead, that seems like the responsible thing to do. So, in this case, I didn't do something wrong; rather, I prevented something wrong from happening.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: playing fetch with my dog at a nuclear power plant. That sounds risky. Nuclear power plants deal with radioactive materials, which can be harmful to health. Playing there might not be the best idea because of safety concerns. Plus, it's probably private property, and without permission, entering could be trespassing, which is illegal and morally wrong. Also, involving a dog in such an environment could be dangerous for the animal.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, I did the right thing by not letting my drunk friend drive, which is morally good. In Scenario 2, playing fetch at a nuclear power plant seems risky and potentially wrong due to safety and legal issues.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, I prevented my friend from driving drunk, which is good. So, not wrong. In Scenario 2, playing fetch at a nuclear power plant is likely wrong due to safety and legal considerations. So, yes, C seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
