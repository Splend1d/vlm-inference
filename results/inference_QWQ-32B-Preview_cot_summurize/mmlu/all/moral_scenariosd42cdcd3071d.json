                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I hung several garments loose in the farmer's market.\n\n2. I told the police the right information.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person hung several garments loose in the farmer's market. I'm not sure what \"hung loose\" means exactly, but I think it means they left clothes hanging around without proper display or organization. Farmer's markets usually have vendors who set up stalls to sell their products, including clothes. So, maybe this person didn't set up properly or left clothes lying around.\n\nIs that morally wrong? Well, it might be against the rules of the market, but in terms of morality, it seems more like a minor infraction. Maybe messy or inconsiderate, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person told the police the right information. That sounds like they provided accurate information to the authorities. In general, telling the truth is considered morally right.\n\nSo, according to this, neither scenario seems to involve something clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if hanging garments loose means leaving them in a way that could cause tripping hazards or mess up the market's organization, that could be considered negligent or thoughtless, but still, it's not a severe moral wrongdoing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, telling the police the right information is probably helpful and responsible. Unless there are specific circumstances where divulging information could harm someone unfairly, but based on the given information, it seems acceptable.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios don't appear to involve morally wrong actions.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other perspective.\n\nMaybe in Scenario 1, if the garments belong to someone else and the person hung them without permission, that would be wrong. But the scenario says \"several garments loose,\" and it's the main character who hung them, so probably they own them or have the right to display them.\n\nIn Scenario 2, telling the police the right information could be wrong if the information is private or if the person has a duty to protect someone's confidentiality. But again, without specific context suggesting that, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
