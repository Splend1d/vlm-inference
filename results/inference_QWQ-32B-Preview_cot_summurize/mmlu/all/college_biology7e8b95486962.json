                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about bird songs and how they develop, especially when a young male bird is raised in isolation and only hears the song of a different species. The result is that his adult song doesn't have some typical characteristics of his own species. So, the question is trying to figure out whether the song is learned, instinctive, both, or dependent on hormones.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"instinctive\" and \"learned\" mean in this context. Instinctive behaviors are those that are innate, meaning the animal is born with the ability to perform them without any learning or experience. Learned behaviors, on the other hand, are acquired through experience or imitation.\n\nIn the case of birdsong, it's known that many birds have a combination of innate and learned components in their songs. For example, some species have a basic song structure that's genetically programmed, but they also learn specific variations from other birds, often their fathers or other adults in the flock.\n\nNow, the experiment mentioned here involves a young male bird raised in isolation, meaning he doesn't have the opportunity to learn from other birds of his own species. Instead, he only hears the song of a different species. As a result, his adult song doesn't have certain typical characteristics of his own species.\n\nIf the song were entirely instinctive (option B), meaning completely hardwired genetically, then he should develop the typical song of his own species regardless of what he hears during his development. But that's not what happened; his song lacks certain characteristics, so it's not entirely instinctive.\n\nOption A says \"entirely learned during development.\" If that were the case, then the bird would only sing the song he heard during his development, which is that of a different species. So, his song would resemble the other species' song completely. But the question says that his song \"lacks certain characteristics typical of his species,\" which implies that some aspects of his own species' song are still present, just not fully developed or are altered.\n\nOption C is \"both instinctive and learned.\" This suggests that while there is an innate component to the song, there's also a learned component. So, the bird might have an innate template or structure that guides how his song should sound, but he also needs to hear and imitate songs from his own species to fine-tune it.\n\nGiven that the bird was raised in isolation and only heard another species' song, his own song ends up lacking certain typical characteristics of his own species. This suggests that while there is an innate basis (instinctive part), there's also a learned component that requires exposure to his own species' song for full development.\n\nOption D mentions that the song is \"dependent upon hormones for proper development.\" While it's true that hormones play a role in the development and production of birdsong, this option doesn't directly address whether the song is learned, instinctive, or both.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems the most comprehensive because it acknowledges both the innate and learned aspects of song development. The bird has an innate ability to produce songs of his own species but needs exposure to those songs during a sensitive period of development to fully acquire the typical characteristics.\n\nTo further solidify this, I can think about other examples in nature. For instance, in some bird species, like the song sparrow, young males learn their songs by imitating their fathers or other tutors. If they don't hear the song of their own species during a critical period, their own songs can be abnormal or show deficiencies.\n\nAdditionally, some species have dialects, where slight variations in song occur in different populations. This also suggests that there's a learned component, as birds are picking up local variations in addition to the innate structure.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is that the song is both instinctive and learned.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
