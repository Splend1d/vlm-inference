We need to compare them and arrange them from least to greatest. The options are:\n\nA. Binary 1100, Decimal 11, Hexadecimal D\n\nB. Decimal 11, Binary 1100, Hexadecimal D\n\nC. Decimal 11, Hexadecimal D, Binary 1100\n\nD. Hexadecimal D, Decimal 11, Binary 1100\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these numbers represents in a common base so that I can compare them easily. The easiest way is to convert all of them to decimal, since that's the base we're most familiar with.\n\nLet's start with the binary number 1100.\n\nBinary is base 2, so each digit represents a power of 2. Starting from the right:\n\n- The rightmost digit is 2^0 = 1\n\n- The next digit is 2^1 = 2\n\n- Then 2^2 = 4\n\n- And 2^3 = 8\n\nSo, 1100 in binary is:\n\n(1 * 8) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 1) = 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 12 in decimal.\n\nNext, we have the decimal number 11. Since it's already in decimal, we don't need to convert it. It's just 11.\n\nFinally, we have the hexadecimal number D. Hexadecimal is base 16, where digits go from 0 to 15, and letters A to F represent 10 to 15. So, D in hexadecimal is 13 in decimal.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- Binary 1100 = 12 decimal\n\n- Decimal 11 = 11 decimal\n\n- Hexadecimal D = 13 decimal\n\nNow, we need to arrange these numbers from least to greatest:\n\n11, 12, 13\n\nSo, in terms of the original numbers:\n\nDecimal 11, Binary 1100, Hexadecimal D\n\nLooking back at the options, this matches option B.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure.\n\nOption A: Binary 1100 (12), Decimal 11 (11), Hexadecimal D (13). That would be 12, 11, 13, which is not in order from least to greatest.\n\nOption B: Decimal 11 (11), Binary 1100 (12), Hexadecimal D (13). That's 11, 12, 13, which is correct.\n\nOption C: Decimal 11 (11), Hexadecimal D (13), Binary 1100 (12). That's 11, 13, 12, which is not in order.\n\nOption D: Hexadecimal D (13), Decimal 11 (11), Binary 1100 (12). That's 13, 11, 12, which is not in order.\n\nSo, the correct answer is Option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
