Together, they started developing software, and in 1975, they officially founded Microsoft. Paul Allen served as the company's chief technical officer and later as a chairman of the company's board. He left Microsoft in 1983 due to health issues but remained involved in various technology and philanthropic ventures until his passing in 2018.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Steve Jobs: Steve Jobs was the co-founder of Apple Inc., not Microsoft. He was involved in the development of the Apple I and II computers and later returned to Apple to lead the development of products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.\n\nB. Steve Wozniak: Steve Wozniak, along with Steve Jobs, co-founded Apple Inc. He is known for his engineering skills and designing the Apple I and Apple II computers.\n\nC. Paul Williams: This option seems to be a confusion between Paul Allen and Paul Williams, who is a different person. Paul Williams is a musician and songwriter, best known for his work in the 1970s and 1980s, including writing songs for the Osmonds and the Jackson 5.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Paul Allen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
