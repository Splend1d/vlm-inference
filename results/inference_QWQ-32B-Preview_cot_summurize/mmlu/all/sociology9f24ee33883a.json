So, here are the options:\n\nA. the formation of an attachment bond between an infant and its carer\n\nB. a tendency of social theorists to explain everything in terms of social causes\n\nC. the process of becoming part of a society by learning its norms and values\n\nD. the historical process by which societies change from traditional to modern\n\nOption A sounds more like bonding or attachment theory, which is important, but I think socialization is broader than just the infant-caregiver relationship.\n\nOption B seems to be critiquing social theorists, but that doesn't sound right. Socialization shouldn't be about criticizing theorists; it's more about how people learn to behave in society.\n\nOption C feels right. Socialization is about learning the norms and values of society. That makes sense because it's through socialization that we learn how to act appropriately in different social situations.\n\nOption D sounds more like social change or modernization. While socialization can play a role in how societies change, it doesn't seem to capture the essence of what socialization is.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C: the process of becoming part of a society by learning its norms and values.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. Socialization is indeed the process through which individuals learn the expectations and habits of a society by interacting with others. It's how we learn to behave in ways that are acceptable and expected in our culture.\n\nOption A is more about early emotional bonding, which is a part of socialization but not the whole picture. Option B seems off-base, and Option D is about societal change over time, which is different from socialization.\n\nTherefore, C is the most accurate definition of socialization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
