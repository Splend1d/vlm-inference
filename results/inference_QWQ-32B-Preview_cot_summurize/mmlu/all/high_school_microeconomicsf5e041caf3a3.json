                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about perfectly competitive employers and how they decide how much labor to hire. The options are:\n\nA. Wage equals marginal factor cost.\n\nB. Wage equals marginal product of labor.\n\nC. Wage equals marginal revenue.\n\nD. Wage equals marginal revenue product of labor.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a perfectly competitive employer is. In perfect competition, firms are price takers, meaning they have no control over the market price of their product. They also take the wage rate as given because there are many firms hiring labor in the market.\n\nSo, the firm will hire labor up to the point where the benefit of hiring one more unit of labor equals the cost of that labor. The benefit is the additional revenue generated by that extra unit of labor, and the cost is the wage paid to that labor.\n\nLet me think about the terms here:\n\n- Wage: This is the cost of hiring one more unit of labor.\n\n- Marginal factor cost: This is the increase in total cost from using one more unit of a factor of production, which in this case is labor.\n\n- Marginal product of labor: This is the additional output produced by hiring one more unit of labor.\n\n- Marginal revenue: This is the additional revenue from selling one more unit of output.\n\n- Marginal revenue product of labor: This is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more unit of labor. It's calculated as the marginal product of labor multiplied by the marginal revenue.\n\nIn perfect competition, since the firm is a price taker, marginal revenue equals the price of the product. So, marginal revenue is constant and equal to the price.\n\nNow, the marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL) is the extra revenue generated by hiring one more worker. It's the marginal product of labor (MPL) times the marginal revenue (MR). Since MR equals price in perfect competition, MRPL = MPL * P.\n\nThe firm will hire labor up to the point where the marginal revenue product of labor equals the wage rate. In other words, it hires until MRPL = Wage.\n\nLet me see which option matches this.\n\nOption D says: Wage = Marginal revenue product of labor.\n\nThat seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: Wage = Marginal factor cost.\n\nIn perfect competition, the marginal factor cost is equal to the wage rate because the firm is a wage taker. So, Wage = MFC. But this is not the condition for hiring labor. The firm hires where MRPL = Wage, not where Wage = MFC.\n\nSo, option A is not correct.\n\nOption B: Wage = Marginal product of labor.\n\nThis doesn't make much sense because wage is a monetary value, and marginal product of labor is in units of output. They are not directly comparable unless you multiply MPL by the price, which would give you MRPL.\n\nSo, option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: Wage = Marginal revenue.\n\nAgain, wage is the cost of labor, and marginal revenue is the revenue from selling one more unit of output. These two are not directly related in the hiring decision. The firm cares about the revenue generated by the additional labor, which is MRPL, not just MR.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nSo, indeed, option D is the correct answer: Wage = Marginal revenue product of labor.\n\nTo summarize, in perfect competition, firms hire labor up to the point where the marginal revenue product of labor equals the wage rate. This ensures that the last unit of labor hired adds value equal to its cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
