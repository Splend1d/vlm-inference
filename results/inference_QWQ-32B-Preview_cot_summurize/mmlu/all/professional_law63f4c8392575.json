The statute contains express findings that, when combined, the wages received by dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce.

A small dry cleaning store operates exclusively within a community in the center of a geographically large state. It has no customers from outside the state. It employs three workers, each of whom is paid less than the federal minimum wage. Must this dry cleaning store comply with the statute imposing the federal minimum wage requirements on all dry cleaning stores?\n\nA. No, because the store does no business in interstate commerce.\nB. No, because the wages of the store's three workers do not have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because the commerce clause vests Congress with plenary legislative authority over labor relations.\nD.

The statute has findings that the wages of dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and interstate commerce, and these findings are backed by information from congressional hearings.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Federal Statute**: Extends federal minimum wage requirements to all dry cleaning stores.\n\n2. **Express Findings**: Combined wages of dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and interstate commerce.\n\n3. **Support**: Information presented during congressional hearings.\n\n4. **Store in Question**: Operates exclusively within one community, no out-of-state customers, employs three workers paid below federal minimum wage.\n\nThe question is whether this store must comply with the federal minimum wage requirements.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. No, because the store does no business in interstate commerce.\n\nB. No, because the wages of the store's three workers do not have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\nC. Yes, because the commerce clause vests Congress with plenary legislative authority over labor relations.\n\nD. Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the basis for federal regulation here, which is the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states.\n\nOver the years, the interpretation of the Commerce Clause has evolved. Initially, it was understood to apply only to activities that directly involved interstate commerce. However, over time, the Supreme Court has broadened its interpretation to include activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\n\nKey cases to consider:\n\n- **Wickard v. Filburn** (1942): Held that even local activity, like growing wheat for personal consumption, could be regulated if it had a substantial effect on interstate commerce when considered cumulatively.\n\n- **Gonzales v. Raich** (2005): Extended this logic to include home-grown marijuana for personal medical use.\n\nIn both cases, the Court upheld federal regulation based on the cumulative effect of similar activities nationwide.\n\nApplying this to the dry cleaning store:\n\n- Although the store has no out-of-state customers and operates solely within one community, the statute is based on the cumulative impact of wages in the dry cleaning industry nationwide.\n\n- The statute has express findings supported by congressional hearings that the wages of dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and interstate commerce.\n\nGiven this, even though the individual store's wages may seem insignificant on their own, when combined with the wages of other dry cleaning workers across the country, they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\n\nTherefore,\u9009\u9879D seems most accurate: Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, despite the store having no out-of-state customers, the regulation is based on the cumulative effect of the industry.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it ignores the cumulative impact; individually, the three workers may not have a substantial impact, but collectively, their wages do.\n\nOption C is too broad. While the Commerce Clause does give Congress broad authority, it's not plenary over all labor relations; there are limits, although they are narrow.\n\nHence, the best answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce."
