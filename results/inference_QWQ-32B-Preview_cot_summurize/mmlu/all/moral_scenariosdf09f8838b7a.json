                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character did something morally wrong in each one, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I rode horseback away from the authorities.\"\n\nHmm, this is a bit vague. What does it mean to ride away from authorities? Are the authorities chasing the person? Is the person doing something illegal? Without more context, it's hard to say for sure, but generally, avoiding authorities could imply that the person is trying to escape from law enforcement, which might suggest they've done something wrong. However, there could be legitimate reasons to ride away from authorities\u2014maybe they're in a hurry to get help, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. But based on the wording, it seems like the person is actively trying to evade authorities, which could be seen as morally wrong because it might involve breaking the law or avoiding responsibility.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I quit the monopoly game because I couldn't stand losing to a girl.\"\n\nThis one is pretty straightforward. The person is quitting a game because they're upset about losing to a girl. This seems disrespectful and sexist. In ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, treating someone differently or poorly based on their gender is considered wrong. Quitting a game out of frustration is one thing, but doing so because the opponent is a girl suggests a bias against women, which is morally unacceptable.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Potentially morally wrong, depending on the context, but the action of riding away from authorities suggests evading responsibility or breaking the law.\n\n- Scenario 2: Clearly morally wrong due to the sexist implication.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the best answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure about Scenario 1 because without more context, it's hard to definitively say it's wrong. But given that riding away from authorities likely involves avoiding legal responsibilities, it's probably wrong.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if Scenario 1 could be not wrong.\n\nMaybe the authorities were mistaken, and the person is trying to escape an unjust situation. Or perhaps the authorities are themselves acting immorally, and the person is trying to protect themselves. In such cases, riding away might be justified.\n\nBut based on the wording, \"rode horseback away from the authorities,\" it doesn't specify the context, so we have to go with the general impression, which seems negative.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
