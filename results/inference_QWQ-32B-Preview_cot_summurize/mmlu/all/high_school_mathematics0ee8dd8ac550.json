                    "text": "So John has five children, and I need to find the probability that at least half of them are girls. Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, which is 1/2 for each.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least half are girls\" means in this context. Since there are five children, half of five is 2.5. But since we can't have half a child, at least half would mean at least three girls (since 2.5 rounds up to 3).\n\nSo, I need to find the probability of having 3, 4, or 5 girls out of 5 children.\n\nThis sounds like a binomial probability problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (children), which is 5.\n\n- k is the number of successes (girls), which is 3, 4, or 5.\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (having a girl), which is 1/2.\n\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nSo, I need to calculate P(3) + P(4) + P(5).\n\nFirst, let's calculate each term separately.\n\nStarting with P(3):\n\nC(5, 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^(5-3) = C(5, 3) * (1/2)^5\n\nSimilarly for P(4):\n\nC(5, 4) * (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^(5-4) = C(5, 4) * (1/2)^5\n\nAnd for P(5):\n\nC(5, 5) * (1/2)^5 * (1/2)^(5-5) = C(5, 5) * (1/2)^5\n\nNow, I need to know the values of C(5, 3), C(5, 4), and C(5, 5).\n\nC(n, k) is calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nSo:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = (120) / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = 10\n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * 1!) = 120 / (24 * 1) = 120 / 24 = 5\n\nC(5, 5) = 5! / (5! * 0!) = 120 / (120 * 1) = 1\n\nSo, P(3) = 10 * (1/2)^5 = 10 * 1/32 = 10/32\n\nP(4) = 5 * 1/32 = 5/32\n\nP(5) = 1 * 1/32 = 1/32\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nP(at least 3 girls) = P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = 10/32 + 5/32 + 1/32 = 16/32 = 1/2\n\nWait, that's one of the options. But let me double-check if I did this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, since the probability of having a girl is 1/2, and each child is independent, the probabilities should be symmetric around 2.5.\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 3 girls should be the same as having at least 3 boys, and since these two events cover all possibilities except having exactly 2 girls and 3 boys or 2 boys and 3 girls, which overlap.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the total probability.\n\nTotal probability is 1, and the probability of having at least 3 girls is the same as 1 minus the probability of having 0, 1, or 2 girls.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = 16/32 = 1/2.\n\nLet me calculate it the other way to verify.\n\nP(at least 3 girls) = 1 - P(0 girls) - P(1 girl) - P(2 girls)\n\nSo, P(0) = C(5, 0) * (1/2)^5 = 1 * 1/32 = 1/32\n\nP(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/2)^5 = 5 * 1/32 = 5/32\n\nP(2) = C(5, 2) * (1/2)^5 = 10 * 1/32 = 10/32\n\nSo, P(at least 3 girls) = 1 - (1/32 + 5/32 + 10/32) = 1 - 16/32 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nOkay, both ways give me 1/2, so the answer should be A. 1/2.\n\nBut let me think if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nAnother way is to consider that the number of girls follows a binomial distribution with n=5 and p=1/2.\n\nThe expected number of girls is n*p = 5*(1/2) = 2.5.\n\nSince the distribution is symmetric around the mean, the probability of having at least 3 girls should be equal to the probability of having at least 3 boys, which is the same as having 2 or fewer girls.\n\nSince these two probabilities cover all possibilities except for having exactly 2.5 girls, which isn't possible, they must each be 1/2.\n\nTherefore, P(at least 3 girls) = 1/2.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
