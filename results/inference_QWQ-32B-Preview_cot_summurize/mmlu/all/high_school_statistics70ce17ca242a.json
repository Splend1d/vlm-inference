                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about random variables X and Y. It says that \u03bcx is 32, \u03c3x is 5, \u03bcy is 44, and \u03c3y is 12. And they're independent. I need to find the mean and standard deviation of the random variable X + Y. There are four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens when you add two independent random variables. I think that the mean of the sum is just the sum of the means. So, \u03bcx+y should be \u03bcx plus \u03bcy. Let me check that.\n\nYes, for any two random variables, whether dependent or independent, the mean of their sum is the sum of their means. So, \u03bcx+y = \u03bcx + \u03bcy. Given that \u03bcx is 32 and \u03bcy is 44, that would make \u03bcx+y = 32 + 44 = 76.\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. Now, for the standard deviation. I know that standard deviation is related to variance, and for independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. So, maybe \u03c3x+y squared equals \u03c3x squared plus \u03c3y squared.\n\nLet me write that down: \u03c3x+y\u00b2 = \u03c3x\u00b2 + \u03c3y\u00b2.\n\nGiven that \u03c3x is 5, \u03c3x\u00b2 is 25. \u03c3y is 12, so \u03c3y\u00b2 is 144. Therefore, \u03c3x+y\u00b2 = 25 + 144 = 169.\n\nThen, \u03c3x+y would be the square root of 169, which is 13.\n\nSo, putting it all together, \u03bcx+y is 76 and \u03c3x+y is 13.\n\nLooking back at the options, that matches option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a chance that independence affects the mean as well, but I don't think so. The mean of the sum should always be the sum of the means, regardless of dependence.\n\nAnd for the standard deviation, I recall that for dependent variables, there's a covariance term that comes into play, but since they're independent, the covariance is zero, so indeed, the variance of the sum is just the sum of the variances.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe if X and Y weren't independent, but the problem states they are independent, so I should stick with that.\n\nAlso, maybe there's a trick with the options, but I don't see it. It seems pretty straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: \u03bcx+y = 76, \u03c3x+y = 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
