During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race.

                    "text": "So this question is about an excerpt from a historian named John S. C. Abbott, and it's from his work \"Napoleon at St. Helena\" published in 1855. The excerpt talks a lot about Napoleon's genius and his conversations at St. Helena, where he was exiled after his defeat. It seems like the historian is really impressed by Napoleon's intellect and the breadth of his knowledge.\n\nThe question is: \"Napoleon helped make the French Revolution an international movement in the areas he conquered.\" And then it gives four options:\n\nA. By imposing a universal currency based on the French franc\n\nB. By the brutal suppression of guerrilla resistance\n\nC. By abolishing feudalism and manorialism\n\nD. By encouraging the use of French as the universal language\n\nSo, I need to figure out which of these options best explains how Napoleon made the French Revolution an international movement in the areas he conquered.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the French Revolution was about. The French Revolution started in 1789 and was a period of radical social and political change in France. It led to the collapse of the Bourbon monarchy and the rise of Napoleon. The revolution promoted ideas like liberty, equality, and fraternity, and it aimed to eliminate the privileges of the aristocracy and the absolute power of the monarchy.\n\nNapoleon came to power in 1799 through a coup d'\u00e9tat and later declared himself Emperor of the French in 1804. During his rule, he conquered much of Europe, and in doing so, he spread many of the ideas and reforms of the French Revolution to the regions he conquered.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Imposing a universal currency based on the French franc.\n\nWhile Napoleon did introduce the French franc as the standard currency in many of the territories he conquered, I'm not sure if this is the best example of making the French Revolution an international movement. Currency standardization is important, but it might not directly relate to the ideological aspects of the revolution.\n\nB. The brutal suppression of guerrilla resistance.\n\nThis option seems more related to Napoleon's military tactics rather than spreading the ideas of the revolution. Suppressing guerrilla resistance was necessary for maintaining control over conquered territories, but it doesn't directly promote the principles of the French Revolution.\n\nC. Abolishing feudalism and manorialism.\n\nThis seems like a strong candidate. One of the key achievements of the French Revolution was the abolition of feudalism and manorialism within France. These were systems that granted the aristocracy and the church extensive privileges and control over the peasantry. By abolishing these systems in the regions he conquered, Napoleon would have been extending the revolutionary ideals of equality and the elimination of feudal privileges beyond France's borders.\n\nD. Encouraging the use of French as the universal language.\n\nPromoting the French language could be seen as a way to spread French culture and ideas, including those of the revolution. However, I'm not sure if this was the primary way Napoleon made the revolution international. While language can be a vehicle for ideas, it might not be as directly impactful as abolishing feudal institutions.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems the most directly aligned with the principles of the French Revolution and Napoleon's efforts to spread those principles internationally.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
