I remember that it's a concept introduced by Garret Hardin in an essay where he discusses how individuals, acting in their own self-interest, can deplete shared resources, leading to negative consequences for the whole group. So, option C seems relevant here.\n\nNow, looking at option A: \"it is anti-Christian.\" I don't recall Hardin making any direct connections to Christianity in his discussion of sharing ethics. It seems out of place compared to the other options, which are more aligned with his economic and environmental perspectives.\n\nOption B: \"it would require a stronger system of taxation for the affluent.\" This seems related to how to manage or prevent the tragedy of the commons. Perhaps through taxation, the affluent could be made to contribute more to the maintenance of common resources. But I'm not sure if this is directly stated by Hardin as the fundamental error of sharing ethics.\n\nOption D says \"all of the above,\" but given that option A seems less relevant, maybe D isn't the best choice.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The question is asking for the fundamental error of sharing ethics according to Hardin. If sharing ethics promotes the idea that resources should be shared communally, Hardin might argue that this leads to overuse and depletion of those resources, hence the tragedy of the commons.\n\nOption C directly refers to this concept, so it's likely the primary answer. Option B might be a potential solution to mitigate the tragedy, but it's not the fundamental error itself. Option A seems unrelated to Hardin's main arguments.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: it would lead to a \"tragedy of the commons.\"\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there's any connection between sharing ethics and being anti-Christian, as option A suggests. But I don't recall any religious undertones in Hardin's essay. It seems more focused on economic and environmental principles.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe the correct answer is C. The fundamental error of sharing ethics, according to Hardin, is that it would lead to a tragedy of the commons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
