                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about triangular or recursive systems in econometrics. I need to determine which statements are true regarding these systems and then choose the correct option from A to D.\n\nFirst off, what is a triangular or recursive system? It's a type of simultaneous equations model where the equations are arranged in a way that the endogenous variables appear only in a lower triangular fashion. This means that each equation includes some endogenous variables from previous equations as exogenous variables, and there are no feedback loops from later equations to earlier ones. This structure allows for a sequential estimation approach.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement (i): The parameters can be validly estimated using separate applications of OLS to each equation.**\n\nIn a recursive system, because of the triangular structure, the error terms are assumed to be uncorrelated with the exogenous variables in all equations. This is a key feature that allows us to use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for estimation without worrying about simultaneity biases. So, yes, OLS can be validly applied to each equation separately in a recursive system.\n\n**Statement (ii): The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in other equations.**\n\nIn a recursive system, the error terms are uncorrelated across equations. This is part of the definition of a recursive system. Therefore, independent variables in one equation cannot be correlated with the error terms in other equations, because the errors are uncorrelated. So, this statement seems false.\n\nWait a minute, but in simultaneous equations models, generally, endogenous variables in one equation can be correlated with errors in other equations due to the interdependence. However, in a recursive system, the triangular structure breaks this correlation. So, I think statement (ii) is actually false.\n\n**Statement (iii): An application of 2SLS would lead to unbiased but inefficient parameter estimates.**\n\nTwo-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) is a method used to estimate parameters in simultaneous equations models where there might be endogeneity issues. In a recursive system, since OLS is valid due to the lack of correlation between errors and exogenous variables, using 2SLS would still give unbiased estimates, but it would be less efficient than OLS because 2SLS introduces additional variation by using instruments.\n\nHowever, in a recursive system, OLS is already consistent and efficient, so using 2SLS would indeed be unbiased but less efficient than OLS. So, statement (iii) seems true.\n\n**Statement (iv): The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in the equations in which they appear as independent variables.**\n\nIn standard regression models, one of the key assumptions is that independent variables are uncorrelated with the error term to ensure unbiased estimates. In a recursive system, because of the triangular structure, the exogenous variables are uncorrelated with the error terms in all equations, and the endogenous variables are treated as exogenous in the equations where they appear.\n\nWait, but in simultaneous equations models, endogenous variables can be correlated with errors, but in a recursive system, the triangular structure ensures that this correlation doesn't occur across equations. Within an equation, if a variable is exogenous, it's uncorrelated with the error term in that equation.\n\nActually, in a recursive system, all exogenous variables are uncorrelated with all error terms, and endogenous variables are only correlated with their own equation's error term, not with others. But in the equation where an endogenous variable appears as an independent variable, it should be uncorrelated with the error term in that equation because of the recursive structure.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. In a recursive system, each endogenous variable is determined sequentially, depending only on exogenous variables and endogenous variables from previous equations. Therefore, in each equation, the independent variables (which are either exogenous or predetermined endogenous variables) should be uncorrelated with the error term in that equation.\n\nSo, statement (iv) suggests that independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in the equations in which they appear. But in a recursive system, this shouldn't be the case. Therefore, statement (iv) seems false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let's consider an example.\n\nSuppose we have a system of two equations:\n\nEquation 1: Y1 = \u03b20 + \u03b21*Y2 + \u03b22*X1 + \u03b51\n\nEquation 2: Y2 = \u03b30 + \u03b31*X2 + \u03b52\n\nIn a recursive system, Y1 depends on Y2 and X1, and Y2 depends only on X2. There's no feedback from Y1 to Y2.\n\nIn this case, in Equation 1, Y2 and X1 are independent variables and should be uncorrelated with \u03b51. In Equation 2, X2 is the independent variable and should be uncorrelated with \u03b52.\n\nSo, in this setup, there's no correlation between independent variables and their own equation's error term.\n\nTherefore, statement (iv) seems false.\n\nGiven this analysis, statements (i) and (iii) are true, while statements (ii) and (iv) are false.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nBased on my evaluation, the correct answer should be B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\nHowever, I need to double-check because the question is about triangular or recursive systems, and I might have missed some nuances.\n\nLet me verify statement (ii) again.\n\nStatement (ii): The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in other equations.\n\nIn a recursive system, the error terms are assumed to be uncorrelated across equations. Therefore, independent variables in one equation cannot be correlated with the error terms in other equations, because the errors are uncorrelated.\n\nSo, statement (ii) is false.\n\nAnd statement (iv): The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in the equations in which they appear as independent variables.\n\nAgain, in a recursive system, independent variables should be uncorrelated with their own equation's error term.\n\nTherefore, statement (iv) is also false.\n\nHence, the correct answer is B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\nWait, but option B says \"(i) and (iii) only\", which aligns with my conclusion.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some texts, recursive systems might allow for certain correlations, but based on my understanding and the standard definitions, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
