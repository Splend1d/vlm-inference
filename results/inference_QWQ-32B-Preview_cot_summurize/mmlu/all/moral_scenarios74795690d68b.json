The options are:\n\n1. I memorized all the ways to cheat on math problems.\n\n2. I drove above the speed limit to get to the strip club.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if it's morally wrong or not, based on general US standards in 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: I memorized all the ways to cheat on math problems.\n\nCheating is generally considered morally wrong because it's dishonest and unfair to others who are playing by the rules. Memorizing ways to cheat suggests that the person is preparing to act dishonestly, which aligns with intent to do something wrong. So, this seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I drove above the speed limit to get to the strip club.\n\nDriving above the speed limit is speeding, which is against the law. Generally, breaking the law is considered morally wrong, especially when it endangers oneself or others. Additionally, speeding to go to a strip club might be seen as prioritizing personal pleasure over safety, which could be considered morally irresponsible.\n\nHowever, the destination\u2014 a strip club\u2014might be seen as morally questionable by some, but in itself, it's not necessarily morally wrong, as adult entertainment establishments are legal in many places in the US, provided certain regulations are followed.\n\nBut the speeding part is clearly against the law and could be dangerous, so that seems like the main moral issue here.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe someone could argue that memorizing ways to cheat doesn't necessarily mean you're going to cheat; you might just be curious or studying about different methods without intending to use them. But I think memorizing them suggests an intent to use them, especially since it's all about cheating.\n\nAs for speeding to get to a strip club, again, speeding is clearly wrong, regardless of the destination.\n\nSo, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
