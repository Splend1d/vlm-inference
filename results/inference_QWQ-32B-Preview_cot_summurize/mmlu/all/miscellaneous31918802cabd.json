I have this question here: \"In which of these sports do competitors use a 'funny car'?\" and the options are A. supercross, B. dogsledding, C. gymnastics, and D. drag racing. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these sports involves something called a 'funny car.'\n\nFirst off, I know what supercross is. It's like motorcycle racing, right? Riders on motorcycles jumping over obstacles and stuff. I don't think they use funny cars there. So, maybe A isn't the answer.\n\nNext, dogsledding. That's where people drive sleds pulled by dogs, like in the Iditarod. No cars involved there, funny or otherwise. So, probably not B.\n\nGymnastics is all about athletes doing flips and balances on mats and beams. No vehicles there, so C doesn't seem likely.\n\nLastly, drag racing. I think that's where cars compete to see who can go from point A to point B the fastest, in a straight line. I've heard of funny cars in that context before. I think they are specially modified cars used in drag racing.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check what a funny car actually is. From what I recall, funny cars are altered, or \"altered\" vehicles used in drag racing. They are known for their humorous, often exaggerated designs, which might be where the name comes from.\n\nLet me make sure. Is there such a thing as a funny car in supercross? I don't think so. In supercross, they use motorcycles, not cars. Dogsledding is all about dogs pulling sleds. Gymnastics is human performance without any vehicles. So, that leaves drag racing as the most probable answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any of these sports use cars in general. Well, supercross uses motorcycles, which are cars, but not exactly. Wait, motorcycles aren't cars; they're motorcycles. So, perhaps in supercross, they don't use cars at all.\n\nDrag racing, on the other hand, is all about cars. They have different classes, and one of those classes is funny cars. So, it makes sense that in drag racing, competitors would use funny cars.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer should be D, drag racing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
