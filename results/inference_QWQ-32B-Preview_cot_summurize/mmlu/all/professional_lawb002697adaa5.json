                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this problem about a company that makes metal sidings and a builder who ordered some. So, on February 15, the builder orders 300 sheets of 1/4-inch refabricated aluminum siding, with a delivery by April 1. Then, on March 8, the company ships 300 sheets, but they're 1/2-inch instead of 1/4-inch, and the builder receives them on March 10. The next day, the builder faxes the company saying the shipment is rejected because it's nonconforming\u2014it's 1/2-inch instead of 1/4-inch.\n\nNow, the question is: Did the builder properly reject the shipment delivered on March 10? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nOption A says yes, because the aluminum sheets were nonconforming goods. That seems straightforward\u2014the sheets are supposed to be 1/4-inch, but they sent 1/2-inch, so they don't meet the specifications. So, according to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs sales of goods, a buyer has the right to reject goods that don't conform to the contract.\n\nOption B says yes, but adds that the company didn't notify the builder that the 1/2-inch sheets were for accommodation only. I'm not sure what \"accommodation only\" means in this context. Maybe it means that the company was trying to accommodate the builder by sending a different thickness, but without notifying the builder, the builder isn't bound to accept it. So, perhaps the builder is still within rights to reject it.\n\nOption C says no, because the builder waived its right to reject the nonconforming goods by not returning them promptly to the company. This seems interesting. Under UCC \u00a72-602(1), the buyer must notify the seller of rejection within a reasonable time after discovery of the nonconformity. Also, the buyer is required to hold the goods for a reasonable time to allow the seller to come and take them back.\n\nIn this case, the builder sent a fax rejecting the shipment the day after receiving it, which seems prompt. However, option C mentions that the builder didn't ship the nonconforming sheets back to the company. But according to UCC \u00a72-602(2), the buyer is required to hold the goods for a reasonable time to permit the seller to remove them. The buyer isn't required to ship them back unless otherwise agreed.\n\nSo, in this case, the builder notified the seller of the rejection promptly and didn't ship the goods back, which seems acceptable under the UCC, as the builder is only required to hold them for a reasonable time.\n\nOption D says no, because the company could accept the builder's offer by prompt shipment of either conforming or nonconforming goods. This one is a bit confusing. I think it's related to the acceptance of an offer in contract law. Generally, acceptance must mirror the terms of the offer. If there are changes, it's considered a counteroffer.\n\nIn this case, the builder ordered 1/4-inch sheets, and the company shipped 1/2-inch sheets. This seems like a material alteration of the terms, which would make it a counteroffer rather than an acceptance. However, since the builder promptly rejected the shipment, it seems like they didn't accept the counteroffer.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option A is the correct answer. The builder properly rejected the shipment because the goods were nonconforming, and they notified the seller promptly upon discovery of the nonconformity.\n\nBut let me double-check. Option B mentions that the company didn't notify the builder that the 1/2-inch sheets were for accommodation only. Maybe if the company had notified the builder that they were sending a different thickness as an accommodation, the builder might have had to accept it or reject it promptly. However, since they didn't notify, perhaps the builder is still within rights to reject it.\n\nBut in this case, the company didn't send any notification along with the shipment indicating that it was an accommodation. So, the builder was right to reject it based on nonconformity.\n\nOption C suggests that the builder waived its right to reject by not returning the goods promptly. But, as per UCC \u00a72-602(2), the builder is only required to hold the goods for a reasonable time, not to ship them back. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption D seems unclear to me. The company shipped nonconforming goods, and the builder rejected them. It doesn't seem relevant that the company could accept the builder's offer by shipping either conforming or nonconforming goods.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A: Yes, because the aluminum sheets were nonconforming goods, and the builder properly rejected them by notifying the seller promptly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
