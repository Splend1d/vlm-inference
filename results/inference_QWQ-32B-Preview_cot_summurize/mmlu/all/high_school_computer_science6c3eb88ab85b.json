                    "text": "Let's analyze this procedure step by step to understand what it's supposed to do and where it might go wrong.\n\nThe procedure is called `FindName` and it takes two parameters: `nameList`, which is a list of unique names, and `targetName`, which is the name we're searching for in the list. The goal is to display the index of `targetName` in `nameList` if it exists, and 0 if it doesn't.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\n```\nPROCEDURE FindName (nameList, targetName)\n{\n    index \u2190 0\n    FOR EACH name IN nameList\n    {\n        index \u2190 index + 1\n        IF (name = targetName)\n        {\n            foundIndex \u2190 index\n        }\n        ELSE\n        {\n            foundIndex \u2190 0\n        }\n    }\n    DISPLAY (foundIndex)\n}\n```\n\nFirst, it initializes `index` to 0. Then, for each `name` in `nameList`, it increments `index` by 1. If the current `name` equals `targetName`, it sets `foundIndex` to the current `index`. If not, it sets `foundIndex` to 0.\n\nThe problem here is that `foundIndex` is being reset to 0 for every name that doesn't match `targetName`. So, even if a match is found, if there are more names after that match, `foundIndex` could be reset to 0 in subsequent iterations.\n\nLet's consider an example to see this in action.\n\nTake option A: `FindName([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\"], \"Ben\")`\n\n- Start with index = 0\n\n- First name: \"Andrea\"\n\n- index = 1\n\n- \"Andrea\" != \"Ben\" \u2192 foundIndex = 0\n\n- Second name: \"Ben\"\n\n- index = 2\n\n- \"Ben\" == \"Ben\" \u2192 foundIndex = 2\n\n- But then, since there are no more names, it displays foundIndex = 2\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nOption B: `FindName([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\"], \"Diane\")`\n\n- index = 0\n\n- First name: \"Andrea\"\n\n- index = 1\n\n- \"Andrea\" != \"Diane\" \u2192 foundIndex = 0\n\n- Second name: \"Ben\"\n\n- index = 2\n\n- \"Ben\" != \"Diane\" \u2192 foundIndex = 0\n\n- Displays foundIndex = 0\n\nCorrect again.\n\nOption C: `FindName([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\", \"Chris\"], \"Ben\")`\n\n- index = 0\n\n- First name: \"Andrea\"\n\n- index = 1\n\n- \"Andrea\" != \"Ben\" \u2192 foundIndex = 0\n\n- Second name: \"Ben\"\n\n- index = 2\n\n- \"Ben\" == \"Ben\" \u2192 foundIndex = 2\n\n- Third name: \"Chris\"\n\n- index = 3\n\n- \"Chris\" != \"Ben\" \u2192 foundIndex = 0\n\n- Displays foundIndex = 0\n\nWait a minute, \"Ben\" is in the list at index 2, but because \"Chris\" comes after it and doesn't match, foundIndex is reset to 0. So, it displays 0 instead of 2. This is incorrect.\n\nOption D: `FindName([\"Andrea\", \"Chris\", \"Diane\"], \"Ben\")`\n\n- index = 0\n\n- First name: \"Andrea\"\n\n- index = 1\n\n- \"Andrea\" != \"Ben\" \u2192 foundIndex = 0\n\n- Second name: \"Chris\"\n\n- index = 2\n\n- \"Chris\" != \"Ben\" \u2192 foundIndex = 0\n\n- Third name: \"Diane\"\n\n- index = 3\n\n- \"Diane\" != \"Ben\" \u2192 foundIndex = 0\n\n- Displays foundIndex = 0\n\nThis is correct because \"Ben\" is not in the list.\n\nSo, the procedure doesn't work as intended when the target name is present but not the last name in the list. In such cases, the foundIndex is overwritten with 0 during the iteration over subsequent names.\n\nTherefore, option C demonstrates that the procedure does not work as intended.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
