                    "text": "As of 2015, agriculture made up about 16% of total Indian GDP.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 16%.\n\nTo give you a bit more context, agriculture has been a cornerstone of India's economy for centuries. It not only contributes to the GDP but also employs a significant portion of the country's workforce. However, its share in the GDP has been declining over the years as the industrial and service sectors have grown. Despite this, agriculture remains crucial for India's food security and economic stability.\n\nIn 2015, when agriculture accounted for around 16% of the GDP, the industrial sector contributed approximately 29%, and the service sector made up about 55%. These figures highlight the diversification of India's economy, with services becoming the largest contributor.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the agricultural sector in India is diverse, encompassing crops, livestock, forestry, and fisheries. The government has implemented various policies and programs to support farmers and enhance agricultural productivity, such as the Green Revolution, which significantly increased food grain production in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nMoreover, the agricultural sector faces several challenges, including outdated farming practices, dependence on monsoon rains, small landholdings, and limited access to technology and credit. Efforts are being made to modernize agriculture through initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (Prime Minister's Crop Insurance Scheme) and the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (Prime Minister's Irrigation Scheme), aimed at providing insurance coverage and improving irrigation facilities, respectively.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a push towards sustainable and organic farming practices to ensure environmental sustainability and improve farmer incomes. The organic farming movement in India has gained momentum, with the government setting targets to increase the area under organic farming.\n\nAdditionally, the agricultural sector plays a vital role in poverty alleviation, as a majority of the poor in India reside in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Therefore, any improvements in agricultural productivity and farmer incomes can have a significant impact on reducing poverty and improving living standards in rural India.\n\nIn conclusion, while agriculture's share in India's GDP has decreased over time, it remains a critical sector for the country's economy and social fabric. Continued efforts to modernize and support the agricultural sector are essential for India's overall development and prosperity.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- World Bank data and various reports by the Indian government and agricultural research institutions."
