Pennsylvania.\" I need to figure out which one uses the smallest map scale. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a map scale is. Map scale refers to the ratio between a distance on the map and the corresponding distance in the real world. So, a large scale map shows a smaller area in more detail, while a small scale map shows a larger area with less detail.\n\nWait, that might be confusing. Let me get this straight. Actually, a large scale map has a larger ratio, meaning that the denominator is smaller, so more of the real world is represented by each unit on the map. For example, a scale of 1:10,000 is larger than 1:100,000 because it represents a smaller area in more detail.\n\nOn the other hand, a small scale map has a smaller ratio, meaning the denominator is larger, so less detail is shown over a larger area. So, 1:1,000,000 would be a smaller scale than 1:100,000.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The world - this would cover the entire globe, which is a massive area.\n\nB. Atlanta, Georgia - this is a city, so it's smaller than the whole world but still covers a relatively large area.\n\nC. Main Street, Small Town, Ohio - this is a very specific and small area, probably just a street or a few blocks.\n\nD. Pennsylvania - this is a state, which is larger than a city but smaller than a whole continent.\n\nSo, considering that smaller scale maps cover larger areas, the map of the world would need to use a smaller scale compared to the map of a single state or a city.\n\nWait, but let's think about it again. If I have a map of the world, it has to fit the entire globe onto a sheet of paper, so it has to compress a lot of distance, meaning that the scale would be small, like 1:100,000,000 or something like that.\n\nOn the other hand, a map of a city like Atlanta would use a larger scale, say 1:10,000, to show more detail within the city.\n\nSimilarly, a map of Main Street in Small Town, Ohio, would use an even larger scale, maybe 1:1,000, to show individual buildings and streets in detail.\n\nAnd a map of Pennsylvania would be somewhere in between, perhaps 1:500,000.\n\nSo, in ascending order of scale size: world (smallest scale), Pennsylvania, Atlanta, Main Street.\n\nTherefore, the map using the smallest map scale would be the map of the world.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Is there any chance that the map of Pennsylvania could use a smaller scale than the map of the world? That doesn't make sense because Pennsylvania is smaller than the world, so its map would need a larger scale to show more detail.\n\nSimilarly, Atlanta is smaller than Pennsylvania, so its map would have an even larger scale.\n\nAnd Main Street is the smallest area, so it would have the largest scale.\n\nSo, yes, the map of the world would indeed use the smallest scale.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. the world.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
