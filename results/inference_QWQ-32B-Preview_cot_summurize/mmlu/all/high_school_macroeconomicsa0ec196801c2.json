                    "text": "So I have this problem about exchange rates and the cost of Big Macs in different countries. I need to figure out in which country the Big Mac is most expensive when compared using dollars. The exchange rates given are:\n\n- 0.5 British Pound per dollar\n\n- 10 Mexican Pesos per dollar\n\n- 100 Chinese Yuan per dollar\n\nAnd the costs are:\n\n- America: $3\n\n- England: 2 pounds\n\n- Mexico: 50 pesos\n\n- China: 200 yuan\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. It wants to know in which country the Big Mac is most expensive when we convert all the prices into dollars. So, I need to convert the prices in England, Mexico, and China into dollars and then compare them to the American price.\n\nLet's start with England. The Big Mac costs 2 pounds there. The exchange rate is 0.5 pounds per dollar. To find out how many dollars that is, I can set up the conversion like this:\n\n2 pounds * (1 dollar / 0.5 pounds) = 2 / 0.5 = $4\n\nSo, in England, the Big Mac costs $4.\n\nNext, Mexico. The Big Mac costs 50 pesos there. The exchange rate is 10 pesos per dollar. Converting that:\n\n50 pesos * (1 dollar / 10 pesos) = 50 / 10 = $5\n\nSo, in Mexico, the Big Mac costs $5.\n\nNow, China. The Big Mac costs 200 yuan there. The exchange rate is 100 yuan per dollar. Converting that:\n\n200 yuan * (1 dollar / 100 yuan) = 200 / 100 = $2\n\nSo, in China, the Big Mac costs $2.\n\nFinally, in America, it's directly given as $3.\n\nNow, comparing all the prices in dollars:\n\n- America: $3\n\n- England: $4\n\n- Mexico: $5\n\n- China: $2\n\nSo, the most expensive Big Mac is in Mexico at $5.\n\nWait a minute, but the options provided are:\n\nA. America ($3).\n\nB. England ($4).\n\nC. Mexico ($5).\n\nD. China ($2).\n\nSo, according to my calculations, the answer should be Mexico. But let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the exchange rates:\n\n- 0.5 British Pound per dollar means that 1 dollar = 0.5 pounds, so to find dollars, I divide pounds by 0.5, which is the same as multiplying by 2. So, 2 pounds * (1 dollar / 0.5 pounds) = $4. That seems correct.\n\n- 10 Mexican Pesos per dollar means that 1 dollar = 10 pesos, so to find dollars, I divide pesos by 10. So, 50 pesos / 10 = $5. That seems correct.\n\n- 100 Chinese Yuan per dollar means that 1 dollar = 100 yuan, so to find dollars, I divide yuan by 100. So, 200 yuan / 100 = $2. That seems correct.\n\n- America is already in dollars, so $3 is straightforward.\n\nTherefore, indeed, the most expensive Big Mac is in Mexico at $5.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the exchange rates. Sometimes exchange rates can be expressed differently, like dollars per pound instead of pounds per dollar. But in this case, the problem clearly states the rates as pounds per dollar, pesos per dollar, and yuan per dollar, so my approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could check if the Big Mac prices are indeed correct, but since they are given in the problem, I have to assume they are accurate.\n\nSo, based on the given information and my calculations, the answer is Mexico ($5).\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C is Mexico ($5), which matches my conclusion.\n\nWait, but the user seems to think that the answer is A (America, $3), but according to my calculations, it's C (Mexico, $5). Maybe there's a mistake in the user's solution.\n\nLet me check the user's solution:\n\nUser's solution:\n\nFirst, convert the prices of Big Macs in England, Mexico, and China into dollars.\n\nEngland: 2 pounds / 0.5 pounds per dollar = 4 dollars\n\nMexico: 50 pesos / 10 pesos per dollar = 5 dollars\n\nChina: 200 yuan / 100 yuan per dollar = 2 dollars\n\nAmerica: 3 dollars\n\nSo, the prices in dollars are:\n\nAmerica: 3\n\nEngland: 4\n\nMexico: 5\n\nChina: 2\n\nTherefore, Mexico has the most expensive Big Mac at 5 dollars.\n\nBut the user marked option A (America, 3 dollars) as the answer, which is incorrect based on these calculations.\n\nMaybe there's a misunderstanding in the exchange rates. Let's consider the exchange rates again.\n\nThe exchange rates are given as:\n\n- 0.5 British Pound per dollar\n\n- 10 Mexican Pesos per dollar\n\n- 100 Chinese Yuan per dollar\n\nThis means:\n\n- 1 dollar = 0.5 pounds\n\n- 1 dollar = 10 pesos\n\n- 1 dollar = 100 yuan\n\nTherefore, to convert from pounds to dollars, we divide pounds by 0.5 (or multiply by 2).\n\nSimilarly, to convert from pesos to dollars, we divide pesos by 10.\n\nAnd to convert from yuan to dollars, we divide yuan by 100.\n\nSo, the conversions are correct as per my earlier calculations.\n\nAlternatively, if the exchange rates were given differently, say dollars per pound, it might change the approach, but in this case, they are given as pounds, pesos, and yuan per dollar.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider how many dollars you get for each local currency unit.\n\nFor England:\n\n0.5 pounds per dollar means that 1 pound = 1 / 0.5 = 2 dollars\n\nSo, 2 pounds = 2 * 2 = 4 dollars\n\nSimilarly for Mexico:\n\n10 pesos per dollar means that 1 peso = 1 / 10 = 0.1 dollars\n\nSo, 50 pesos = 50 * 0.1 = 5 dollars\n\nFor China:\n\n100 yuan per dollar means that 1 yuan = 1 / 100 = 0.01 dollars\n\nSo, 200 yuan = 200 * 0.01 = 2 dollars\n\nAgain, this confirms my earlier calculations.\n\nTherefore, the most expensive Big Mac is in Mexico at $5.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option C, not A.\n\nMaybe there was a mistake in the user's solution or in the way the options are presented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem or the options.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. America ($3).\n\nB. England ($4).\n\nC. Mexico ($5).\n\nD. China ($2).\n\nAnd according to the user's solution, they have:\n\nAnswer is: A\n\nBut according to my calculations, it should be C.\n\nPerhaps there's a misinterpretation of the exchange rates.\n\nLet me try converting dollars to pounds, pesos, and yuan.\n\nGiven:\n\n- 0.5 pounds per dollar, so 1 dollar = 0.5 pounds\n\n- 10 pesos per dollar, so 1 dollar = 10 pesos\n\n- 100 yuan per dollar, so 1 dollar = 100 yuan\n\nNow, to find out how much each Big Mac costs in dollars, we need to see how many dollars are equivalent to the local currency price.\n\nFor England:\n\n2 pounds * (1 dollar / 0.5 pounds) = 2 / 0.5 = $4\n\nFor Mexico:\n\n50 pesos * (1 dollar / 10 pesos) = 50 / 10 = $5\n\nFor China:\n\n200 yuan * (1 dollar / 100 yuan) = 200 / 100 = $2\n\nAgain, the same results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exchange rates are meant to be dollars per foreign currency.\n\nWait, maybe the exchange rates are meant differently.\n\nSometimes exchange rates are expressed as the amount of foreign currency per dollar, or dollars per foreign currency.\n\nLet me consider the alternative interpretation.\n\nSuppose the exchange rates are:\n\n- 0.5 dollars per British Pound\n\n- 10 dollars per Mexican Peso\n\n- 100 dollars per Chinese Yuan\n\nThen, the conversions would be different.\n\nBut according to the problem, it says \"exchange rates are 0.5 British Pound per dollar; 10 Mexican Pesos per dollar; and 100 Chinese Yuan per dollar.\"\n\nSo, it's pounds per dollar, pesos per dollar, and yuan per dollar.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the user's solution.\n\nUser's solution:\n\nFirst, convert the prices of Big Macs in England, Mexico, and China into dollars.\n\nEngland: 2 pounds / 0.5 pounds per dollar = 4 dollars\n\nMexico: 50 pesos / 10 pesos per dollar = 5 dollars\n\nChina: 200 yuan / 100 yuan per dollar = 2 dollars\n\nAmerica: 3 dollars\n\nSo, the prices in dollars are:\n\nAmerica: 3\n\nEngland: 4\n\nMexico: 5\n\nChina: 2\n\nTherefore, Mexico has the most expensive Big Mac at 5 dollars.\n\nBut the user marked option A (America, 3 dollars) as the answer, which contradicts this.\n\nPerhaps there was a typo in the options or the user misread them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is actually asking where the Big Mac is cheapest, not most expensive.\n\nWait, looking back at the question:\n\n\"In which country is a Big Mac most expensive?\"\n\nBut the user's solution says:\n\n\"Answer is: A\"\n\nWhich is America at $3, but according to the calculations, Mexico at $5 is more expensive.\n\nUnless there's a mistake in the user's solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exchange rates are meant to be dollars per foreign currency.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- 0.5 dollars per British Pound\n\n- 10 dollars per Mexican Peso\n\n- 100 dollars per Chinese Yuan\n\nThen, the conversions would be:\n\nEngland: 2 pounds * (0.5 dollars / 1 pound) = 1 dollar\n\nMexico: 50 pesos * (10 dollars / 1 peso) = 500 dollars\n\nChina: 200 yuan * (100 dollars / 1 yuan) = 20,000 dollars\n\nAmerica: 3 dollars\n\nThis doesn't make sense, as the Mexican and Chinese prices would be extremely high, which is not realistic.\n\nTherefore, the initial interpretation is correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be Mexico at $5.\n\nTherefore, the user's solution is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the exchange rates provided.\n\nWait, maybe the exchange rates are meant to be dollars per foreign currency, not foreign currency per dollar.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- 0.5 dollars per British Pound\n\n- 10 dollars per Mexican Peso\n\n- 100 dollars per Chinese Yuan\n\nThen, the conversions would be:\n\nEngland: 2 pounds * 0.5 dollars/pound = 1 dollar\n\nMexico: 50 pesos * 10 dollars/peso = 500 dollars\n\nChina: 200 yuan * 100 dollars/yuan = 20,000 dollars\n\nAmerica: 3 dollars\n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense, as the Mexican and Chinese prices would be excessively high.\n\nTherefore, the initial interpretation is correct.\n\nSo, the most expensive Big Mac is in Mexico at $5.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C.\n\nPerhaps there was a mistake in the user's solution or in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the least expensive Big Mac, not the most expensive.\n\nLet me check the question again:\n\n\"In which country is a Big Mac most expensive?\"\n\nSo, it's asking for the most expensive.\n\nGiven that, Mexico at $5 is the most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nUnless there's a mistake in the exchange rates or the Big Mac prices, but as per the given data, Mexico is the most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the user's solution is incorrect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
