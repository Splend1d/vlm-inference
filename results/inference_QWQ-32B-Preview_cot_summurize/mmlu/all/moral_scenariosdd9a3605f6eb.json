First off, the term \"midget\" is outdated and considered offensive; it's more appropriate to use terms like \"dwarf\" or refer to dwarfism as a medical condition. Laughing at someone based on their physical characteristics can be seen as mocking or ridiculing them, which is generally considered morally wrong because it disrespects their dignity and can cause emotional harm.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character denies the help of someone who offered to babysit their children for free. Declining free babysitting doesn't inherently seem morally wrong. People have the right to choose who takes care of their children, and they might have valid reasons for denying someone's offer, such as not feeling comfortable with that person around their kids, scheduling conflicts, or preferring professional childcare. As long as the decision is made with the children's best interests in mind, it's hard to see this as morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering these points, I would say that Scenario 1 involves something clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Wrong, Not wrong}} \\]"
