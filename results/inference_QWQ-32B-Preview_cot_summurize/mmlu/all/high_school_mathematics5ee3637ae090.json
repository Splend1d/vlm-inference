                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have information about three tubes of toothpaste: Bright, Fresh, and Glow. We need to find the cost per unit of volume of Glow in cents.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n1. Bright is 60% more expensive than Fresh.\n\n2. Bright has 25% less volume than Glow.\n\n3. Glow is 25% less expensive than Bright.\n\n4. Glow has 33 1/3% more volume than Fresh.\n\n5. Fresh costs $1.00 per unit of volume.\n\nOur goal is to find the cost per unit of volume of Glow in cents.\n\nLet's start by defining some variables to make this easier.\n\nLet:\n\n- \\( V_f \\) = volume of Fresh\n\n- \\( V_b \\) = volume of Bright\n\n- \\( V_g \\) = volume of Glow\n\n- \\( C_f \\) = cost of Fresh\n\n- \\( C_b \\) = cost of Bright\n\n- \\( C_g \\) = cost of Glow\n\nWe know that Fresh costs $1.00 per unit of volume, so:\n\n\\( C_f = V_f \\times 1 \\)\n\nBut since we're dealing with cost per unit of volume, and Fresh is $1.00 per unit, we can think of \\( C_f = 1 \\) dollar per unit volume.\n\nWait, but actually, \\( C_f = V_f \\times 1 \\), so \\( C_f = V_f \\) dollars.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of cost per unit volume.\n\nLet's define:\n\n- \\( p_f = \\) price per unit volume of Fresh = $1.00\n\n- \\( p_b = \\) price per unit volume of Bright\n\n- \\( p_g = \\) price per unit volume of Glow\n\nWe need to find \\( p_g \\) in cents.\n\nGiven that Bright is 60% more expensive than Fresh, we can write:\n\n\\( C_b = C_f + 0.60 \\times C_f = 1.60 \\times C_f \\)\n\nBut since \\( C_f = V_f \\times p_f = V_f \\times 1 = V_f \\), then:\n\n\\( C_b = 1.60 \\times V_f \\)\n\nAlso, Bright has 25% less volume than Glow:\n\n\\( V_b = V_g - 0.25 \\times V_g = 0.75 \\times V_g \\)\n\nGlow is 25% less expensive than Bright:\n\n\\( C_g = C_b - 0.25 \\times C_b = 0.75 \\times C_b \\)\n\nAnd Glow has 33 1/3% more volume than Fresh:\n\n\\( V_g = V_f + \\frac{1}{3} \\times V_f = \\frac{4}{3} \\times V_f \\)\n\nNow, let's substitute the expressions.\n\nFirst, from \\( V_g = \\frac{4}{3} V_f \\), we can express \\( V_f \\) in terms of \\( V_g \\):\n\n\\( V_f = \\frac{3}{4} V_g \\)\n\nNow, \\( C_b = 1.60 \\times V_f = 1.60 \\times \\frac{3}{4} V_g = 1.60 \\times 0.75 V_g = 1.20 V_g \\)\n\nThen, \\( C_g = 0.75 \\times C_b = 0.75 \\times 1.20 V_g = 0.90 V_g \\)\n\nNow, the price per unit volume of Glow is:\n\n\\( p_g = \\frac{C_g}{V_g} = \\frac{0.90 V_g}{V_g} = 0.90 \\) dollars per unit volume.\n\nTo convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:\n\n\\( p_g = 0.90 \\times 100 = 90 \\) cents per unit volume.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 cents per unit volume.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nGiven:\n\n- Bright is 60% more expensive than Fresh: \\( C_b = 1.60 C_f \\)\n\n- Bright has 25% less volume than Glow: \\( V_b = 0.75 V_g \\)\n\n- Glow is 25% less expensive than Bright: \\( C_g = 0.75 C_b \\)\n\n- Glow has 33 1/3% more volume than Fresh: \\( V_g = \\frac{4}{3} V_f \\)\n\n- Fresh costs $1.00 per unit volume: \\( p_f = 1.00 \\) dollar per unit volume.\n\nSo, \\( C_f = V_f \\times 1 = V_f \\)\n\nThen, \\( C_b = 1.60 V_f \\)\n\nAnd \\( V_b = 0.75 V_g \\)\n\nBut also, \\( V_g = \\frac{4}{3} V_f \\), so \\( V_f = \\frac{3}{4} V_g \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( V_f \\) in \\( C_b \\):\n\n\\( C_b = 1.60 \\times \\frac{3}{4} V_g = 1.20 V_g \\)\n\nThen, \\( C_g = 0.75 \\times C_b = 0.75 \\times 1.20 V_g = 0.90 V_g \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( p_g = \\frac{C_g}{V_g} = \\frac{0.90 V_g}{V_g} = 0.90 \\) dollars per unit volume, which is 90 cents.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
