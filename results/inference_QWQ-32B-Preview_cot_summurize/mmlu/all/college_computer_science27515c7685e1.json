                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that a defective computer chip came from Company Y, given that one chip is chosen at random from all the chips shipped by both companies and it turns out to be defective. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's summarize the information given:\n\n- Company X shipped 5 computer chips, 1 of which is defective.\n\n- Company Y shipped 4 computer chips, 2 of which are defective.\n\n- Total chips: 5 + 4 = 9.\n\n- Total defective chips: 1 (from X) + 2 (from Y) = 3.\n\n- One chip is chosen at random from these 9 chips, and it's found to be defective. We need to find the probability that this defective chip came from Company Y.\n\nThis sounds like a job for conditional probability. Specifically, it seems like we should use Bayes' theorem here. Bayes' theorem allows us to find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.\n\nLet's define the events for clarity:\n\n- Let D be the event that the chosen chip is defective.\n\n- Let Y be the event that the chosen chip came from Company Y.\n\nWe are asked to find P(Y|D), the probability that the chip came from Company Y given that it is defective.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(Y|D) = [P(D|Y) * P(Y)] / P(D)\n\nSo, we need to find P(D|Y), P(Y), and P(D).\n\nLet's find each of these probabilities one by one.\n\nFirst, P(Y), the probability that a randomly chosen chip came from Company Y.\n\nCompany Y shipped 4 out of 9 chips, so:\n\nP(Y) = 4/9\n\nNext, P(D|Y), the probability that a chip is defective given that it came from Company Y.\n\nCompany Y shipped 4 chips, 2 of which are defective, so:\n\nP(D|Y) = 2/4 = 1/2\n\nNow, P(D), the probability that a randomly chosen chip is defective.\n\nWe know there are 3 defective chips out of 9, so:\n\nP(D) = 3/9 = 1/3\n\nNow, plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(Y|D) = [(1/2) * (4/9)] / (1/3)\n\nLet's calculate the numerator:\n\n(1/2) * (4/9) = 4/18 = 2/9\n\nNow, divide by P(D):\n\n(2/9) / (1/3) = (2/9) * (3/1) = 6/9 = 2/3\n\nSo, the probability that the defective chip came from Company Y is 2/3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this in terms of counting.\n\nTotal defective chips: 3 (1 from X and 2 from Y).\n\nGiven that the chosen chip is defective, the probability that it came from Company Y is the number of defective chips from Y divided by the total number of defective chips.\n\nSo, P(Y|D) = (number of defective chips from Y) / (total number of defective chips) = 2/3\n\nYeah, that matches the result I got using Bayes' theorem.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2/3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2/9\n\nB. 4/9\n\nC. 1/2\n\nD. 2/3\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 2/3\n\nI think that's the answer. It makes sense both through Bayes' theorem and through straightforward counting.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
