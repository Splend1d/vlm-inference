                    "text": "So I have this case here about an 18-year-old primigravid woman who's come in for her first prenatal visit at 16 weeks gestation. She's not sure about her last menstrual period but thinks the pregnancy started right after she stopped taking oral contraceptives five months ago. And now her maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level is increased to three times the median. The question is asking what the most appropriate next step in management should be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what MSAFP is and why it's important in pregnancy. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetus, and measuring it in the mother's blood can give us some information about the health of the baby. Elevated levels of MSAFP can be associated with certain conditions, such as neural tube defects, abdominal wall defects, or even multiple pregnancies.\n\nIn this case, the MSAFP is increased to three multiples of the median. The median is used as a reference point, and multiples of the median help categorize the results. Typically, levels above a certain multiple (often 2 or 2.5) are considered elevated and may indicate a need for further evaluation.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration.\n\nB. Triple screening for MSAFP, serum \u03b2-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations.\n\nC. Ultrasonography.\n\nD. Amniocentesis for measurement of \u03b1-fetoprotein concentration.\n\nOption A suggests repeating the MSAFP measurement. Sometimes, lab errors can cause abnormal results, so repeating the test can confirm whether the initial result was accurate. However, in this case, since the patient is already at 16 weeks and it's her initial prenatal visit, it might not be the most efficient next step. Also, if the level is consistently high, we'd still need to investigate further.\n\nOption B proposes triple screening, which includes MSAFP, serum \u03b2-hCG, and serum estriol. This is a more comprehensive screening test that can provide risk assessments for conditions like Down syndrome and neural tube defects. However, since the MSAFP is already elevated, and the patient is specifically concerned about that, perhaps a more targeted approach would be better.\n\nOption C is ultrasonography. This is a non-invasive way to visualize the fetus and can help confirm the gestational age, look for structural abnormalities, and check for multiple pregnancies, all of which can affect MSAFP levels. Given that the patient is unsure about her last menstrual period and thinks the pregnancy started after stopping contraceptives five months ago, there might be uncertainty about the actual gestational age. Ultrasonography can help clarify that and look for any physical abnormalities that could explain the elevated MSAFP.\n\nOption D is amniocentesis to measure \u03b1-fetoprotein concentration in the amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is an invasive procedure that carries a small risk of complications, such as miscarriage. It's usually reserved for higher-risk cases or when there's a strong indication based on previous test results. Given that this is the patient's initial visit and the only abnormal result is the elevated MSAFP, it might be premature to proceed directly to amniocentesis.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that ultrasonography (option C) would be the most appropriate next step. It can help confirm the gestational age, look for structural abnormalities, and assess for multiple pregnancies, all of which are relevant given the elevated MSAFP and the patient's uncertainty about her last menstrual period.\n\nAdditionally, ultrasonography is a safe and non-invasive procedure, making it a logical choice before considering more invasive options like amniocentesis.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. Ultrasonography.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
