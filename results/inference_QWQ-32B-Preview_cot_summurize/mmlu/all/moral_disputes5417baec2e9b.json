I remember that Kass is known for his concerns about cloning and its ethical implications. The despotism argument, I think, is about how cloning could allow parents to exert too much control over their children's lives.\n\nOption A says that cloning is inherently morally wrong. That sounds like a general moral objection to cloning, but I'm not sure if it's specifically part of the despotism argument. Maybe it's more of a general premise in Kass's overall view on cloning.\n\nOption B says that in reproductive cloning, one seeks to impose one's will on a child's future. This sounds a lot like the despotism argument. If parents clone themselves to create a child who is genetically identical, maybe they have certain expectations or plans for that child's life, which could be seen as imposing their will on the child's future. So, this seems like a strong candidate for a premise in the despotism argument.\n\nOption C says that the permissibility of cloning depends on the parent's intent to raise the child. Hmm, this seems a bit different. It's about the parent's intention to raise the child, which might be relevant, but I'm not sure if it directly relates to the despotism argument. Maybe it's more about the responsibility of parents towards their cloned children.\n\nOption D says that we have a good reason not to clone. This is very general and could be considered a conclusion or a summary of various arguments against cloning, including the despotism argument. But as a premise, it seems too broad.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think option B is the most directly related to the despotism argument. It specifically ties into the idea that cloning allows for an unhealthy level of control over a child's life, which aligns with the concept of despotism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
