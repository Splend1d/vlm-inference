Let me think about each option:\n\nOption A says that morality plays no role in the concept of law. That doesn't sound right for Dworkin. I think he actually argued that law and morality are interconnected, so this might be incorrect.\n\nOption B mentions that moral arguments operate only in hard cases. Hmm, Dworkin did discuss the role of moral reasoning in legal decisions, especially in cases where the law is unclear or indeterminate. But I think he might have a broader view than just hard cases.\n\nOption C states that the law dictates what moral values should affect our ethical behavior. That seems to suggest that law has precedence over morality, which doesn't align with Dworkin's perspective. He, I believe, thought that morality informs the law, not the other way around.\n\nOption D says that moral values are both independent and objective. This sounds more like Dworkin's view. He argued that moral principles are objective and have independent existence, and they play a crucial role in legal interpretation and application.\n\nLet me double-check. Dworkin is known for his theory of law as integrity, where he posits that judges should interpret the law in light of moral principles that provide the best justification for the legal system as a whole. This suggests that moral values are objective and independent of individual judgments.\n\nAlso, in \"Justice for Hedgehogs,\" Dworkin presents a unified theory of ethics and politics, emphasizing that moral questions are interconnected and should be addressed holistically. This aligns with the idea that moral values are objective and independent.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: Moral values are both independent and objective.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
