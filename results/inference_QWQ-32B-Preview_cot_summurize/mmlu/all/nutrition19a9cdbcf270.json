                    "text": "Leptin resistance is a condition where the body's cells do not respond properly to the hormone leptin, which is produced by fat cells and helps regulate appetite and energy balance. In leptin resistance, even though there are high levels of leptin in the bloodstream, the brain does not receive the signal to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure. This can lead to continued feelings of hunger and overeating, contributing to weight gain and obesity.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Deficiency of leptin caused by a mutation in the leptin gene - This describes leptin deficiency, not resistance.\n\nB. Lack of leptin release from the adipose tissue - Again, this refers to leptin deficiency.\n\nC. High concentrations of leptin without reduction in energy intake - This aligns with leptin resistance, where high leptin levels fail to reduce energy intake.\n\nD. Low concentrations of leptin with increased energy intake - This might suggest leptin deficiency, where low leptin levels fail to curb appetite, leading to increased energy intake.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. High concentrations of leptin without reduction in energy intake.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- Considine, R. V., et al.
