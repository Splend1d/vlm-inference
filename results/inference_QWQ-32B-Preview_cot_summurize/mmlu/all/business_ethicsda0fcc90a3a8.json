                    "text": "Let's tackle this multiple-choice question about consumer rights. I need to choose the correct options to fill in the blanks. The question is talking about traditional consumer rights based on certain notions and how these have changed over time due to increased regulation at various levels.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"caveat emptor\" means. I think it's a Latin phrase that translates to \"let the buyer beware.\" It's a principle in law that places the responsibility on the buyer to be cautious and informed when purchasing goods or services. So, in this context, it makes sense that consumer rights were traditionally based on the notion of caveat emptor, meaning the buyer had to be careful to avoid subpar products.\n\nNow, the next blank is likely to be related to the first one. Since caveat emptor is about the buyer being cautious, the second notion might be something similar or complementary. Option A has \"company responsibility,\" which seems contradictory to caveat emptor because if the company is responsible, then the burden isn't on the buyer. Option B has \"buyer beware,\" which is essentially the same as caveat emptor. Option C has \"cementor eaveat,\" which seems like a typo; perhaps it's meant to be caveat emptor again. Option D has \"company responsibility\" again. Considering that traditional consumer rights placed the burden on the buyer, I think \"buyer beware\" is the appropriate choice here, matching caveat emptor.\n\nSo, for the first two blanks, I'm leaning towards \"caveat emptor\" and \"buyer beware.\"\n\nNext, the question mentions that this traditional approach has \"gradually eroded due to increased ________ at a ________, EU, and UN level.\" This suggests that there has been more regulation or oversight at national, EU, and UN levels, which has diminished the reliance on caveat emptor.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Informal codes, International\n\nB. Regulation, National\n\nC. Informal codes, National\n\nD. Informal codes, International\n\nOption A mentions \"informal codes\" and \"international,\" but informal codes don't typically erode the principle of caveat emptor; formal regulations would be more likely to do so.\n\nOption B mentions \"regulation\" and \"national,\" which aligns with the idea that increased regulation at national, EU, and UN levels has lessened the reliance on caveat emptor.\n\nOption C has \"informal codes\" and \"national,\" which again seems less impactful than formal regulations.\n\nOption D has \"informal codes\" and \"international,\" which also doesn't carry the same weight as formal regulations.\n\nTherefore, I believe that \"regulation\" at the \"national\" level, along with EU and UN levels, is the correct choice here.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be:\n\nB. Caveat emptor, Buyer beware, Regulation, National\n\nThis makes sense because traditionally, consumer rights were based on the principles of caveat emptor and buyer beware, but over time, increased regulation at national, EU, and UN levels has diminished the reliance on these principles by imposing more responsibilities on sellers and manufacturers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
