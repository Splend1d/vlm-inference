                    "text": "Let's see. I'm looking at Sutherland's study on the 'professional thief.' I remember that Sutherland was a sociologist who came up with differential association theory, which is about how people learn deviant behavior through their interactions with others. So, option A says that people are socialized into a life of crime by associating with others who define it in positive terms. That sounds a lot like differential association theory.\n\nOption B says that the majority of crime is committed by middle-class people in professional occupations. Hmm, that doesn't really align with Sutherland's theory. I think Sutherland focused more on how criminal behavior is learned through interaction, regardless of social class.\n\nOption C says that those who were arrested and charged with theft did not define themselves as thieves. I'm not sure about that. Maybe some criminals don't identify themselves as thieves, but I don't recall that being a main point of Sutherland's study.\n\nOption D says that the most dangerous criminals on the street were those who were highly skilled thieves. Again, I don't recall that being a central point in Sutherland's work.\n\nLet me think again. Sutherland's differential association theory suggests that criminal behavior is learned through interaction with others who define it favorably. So, it's about the socialization process into crime. That aligns closely with option A.\n\nOption B seems to be making a statement about who commits most crimes, which isn't directly related to Sutherland's theory. Sutherland was more concerned with how criminal behavior is learned, not necessarily who commits the majority of crimes.\n\nOption C is about how criminals perceive themselves, which might be interesting, but I don't think that was the main focus of Sutherland's study.\n\nOption D is about the skill level of dangerous criminals, which again doesn't directly relate to Sutherland's theory of differential association.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A: people are socialized into a life of crime by associating with others who define it in positive terms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
