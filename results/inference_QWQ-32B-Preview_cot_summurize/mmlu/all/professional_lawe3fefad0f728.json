                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here. A worker gets hurt on the job because a machine malfunctions. He sues both the manufacturer and the maintenance company in federal court under diversity jurisdiction. At trial, he proposes a jury instruction on negligence, but the court doesn't use it and gives what his attorney thinks is a less favorable and legally incorrect instruction instead. The attorney didn't object to this instruction before it was given, and the jury ends up ruling for the defendants. Now, the worker is moving for a new trial based on the claimed improper negligence instruction.\n\nI need to figure out which argument has the best chance of persuading the court to grant the motion for a new trial. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Issues of law can be raised at any time.\n\nB. The court's negligence instruction was incorrect and the worker's objection to it was preserved when he submitted his proposed negligence instruction.\n\nC. The court's negligence instruction was plain error that affected the worker's substantial rights.\n\nD. The need for a formal objection to a judicial ruling in order to preserve an argument has been eliminated in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nOkay, let's break these down one by one.\n\nOption A says that issues of law can be raised at any time. That sounds too broad. Generally, in litigation, there are rules about when you can raise objections or arguments, and not all issues can be raised at any time. There are concepts like waiver and preservation of error. So, this seems unlikely to be the strongest argument.\n\nOption B argues that the court's instruction was incorrect and that the worker's objection was preserved by submitting a proposed instruction. This seems promising. In federal court, parties often submit proposed jury instructions, and if the court doesn't use them and gives an instruction that the party thinks is incorrect, they might preserve the objection by submitting their own proposed instruction. However, the problem states that the attorney did not object to the instruction before it was given. So, even though the proposed instruction was submitted, perhaps that's not enough to preserve the objection. I need to recall the rules on preserving objections to jury instructions.\n\nOption C brings up \"plain error.\" This is a doctrine that allows appellate courts to correct errors that were not properly preserved at trial if they are clear or obvious and affect the party's substantial rights. So, if the court's instruction was indeed erroneous and it had a significant impact on the trial's outcome, this could be a strong argument. The worker is moving for a new trial, which is somewhat analogous to an appeal, so perhaps this argument could persuade the court.\n\nOption D suggests that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have eliminated the need for formal objections to judicial rulings to preserve arguments. I don't recall any such change. In fact, I think there are specific rules about preserving objections, including the need to make timely objections on the record. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that, option C seems the most plausible. The worker can argue that the court's negligence instruction contained plain error, which affected his substantial rights, and thus, a new trial should be granted. The fact that he didn't object at trial wouldn't preclude him from raising this on a motion for a new trial if it constitutes plain error.\n\nBut let me double-check. In federal practice, Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure deals with jury instructions. It states that to preserve a claim of error in an instruction, a party must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds therefor before the jury retires to deliberate. If not, the objection is waived unless the court commits plain error.\n\nIn this case, the attorney did not object to the instruction before it was given, so the objection is waived unless plain error applies. Therefore, arguing plain error under option C seems like the way to go.\n\nOption B might not hold because simply submitting a proposed instruction doesn't necessarily preserve the objection; an explicit objection is typically required.\n\nSo, I think the best argument is C: The court's negligence instruction was plain error that affected the worker's substantial rights.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
