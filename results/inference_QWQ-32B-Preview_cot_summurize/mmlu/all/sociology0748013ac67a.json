                    "text": "Let's see. I'm looking at this question about Brown and Harris's 1978 study on depression. I need to pick the correct statement based on their findings. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support.\" Hmm, I recall that social support is important for mental health, and maybe Brown and Harris found that women who have more social support are less likely to become depressed when faced with stress. So, this might be a possible answer.\n\nOption B says: \"self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent.\" Wait, I think depression is more commonly reported in women, not men. And I'm not sure about the affiliation part. Maybe I'm misremembering. I should be careful here.\n\nOption C says: \"men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression.\" Again, I thought depression was more common in women, but maybe that's not what Brown and Harris found. I need to recall their specific findings.\n\nOption D says: \"men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles.\" This seems plausible because gender roles can be stressful, and maybe men have more pressure in certain areas, but I'm not sure if that was their main finding.\n\nLet me think back to what I learned about Brown and Harris's study. I remember that they did a study on depression in women, specifically looking at the role of life events and social support. They found that women who experienced multiple life events and had low social support were more likely to develop depression.\n\nSo, option A seems consistent with that. It says that women's susceptibility to stress depends on their levels of social support, which aligns with the idea that social support can buffer the impact of stressors.\n\nOption B mentions self-reported depression being highest among men and the relatively affluent. But from what I know, depression is more commonly reported in women, especially in certain age groups. So, this seems contradictory to general knowledge, unless Brown and Harris found something different.\n\nOption C says that men and women have similar levels of diagnosed depression. Again, my understanding is that women are diagnosed with depression more often than men, so this might not be accurate.\n\nOption D suggests that men are more vulnerable to depression because of gender roles. While gender roles can affect mental health, I don't recall Brown and Harris focusing specifically on men's vulnerability due to gender roles.\n\nWait a minute, Brown and Harris's study was titled \"Social Origins of Depression: A Study of Psychiatric Disorder in Women.\" So, it primarily focused on women. Maybe option A is the most accurate reflection of their findings.\n\nLet me double-check. They investigated how social factors, particularly life events and social support, relate to the onset of depression in women. They found that the number of life events and the lack of social support increased the risk of depression.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that women's susceptibility to stress depends on their levels of social support, which is option A.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But to be thorough, let's consider the other options again.\n\nOption B: Self-reported depression highest among men and the relatively affluent. This seems counterintuitive because depression is often associated with lower socioeconomic status and women. Maybe in their study, they found something different, but based on general knowledge, this seems less likely.\n\nOption C: Similar levels of diagnosed depression in men and women. Again, research generally shows higher rates in women, so this might not be accurate.\n\nOption D: Men more vulnerable to depression because of gender roles. While gender roles can affect mental health, I don't think this was the main finding of Brown and Harris's study, which focused on women.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option A is the correct answer: \"women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
