And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him.

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Bernal Diaz del Castillo's memoirs about the conquest of Mexico, and there's a question about the economic policy that drove the conquistadores' search for gold. The options are protectionism, laissez-faire, mercantilism, and supply-side. I need to figure out which one fits best based on what's described in the text.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these economic policies is about.\n\nProtectionism is when a country tries to limit imports to protect its own industries, often through tariffs or quotas.\n\nLaissez-faire is a hands-off approach to the economy, where the government doesn't interfere much in business and trade.\n\nMercantilism was a policy where nations tried to accumulate wealth by exporting more than they imported, and they closely controlled their colonies to get resources and markets.\n\nSupply-side economics is about stimulating production and investment to drive economic growth, often by reducing taxes and regulations.\n\nNow, looking back at the passage, it seems like the conquistadores were primarily interested in acquiring gold, and there's mention of dividing up the gold and even taking fifths for the emperor and Cort\u00e9s. It also talks about taking Indian females, which seems related to labor and perhaps population control.\n\nGiven that, mercantilism seems like the most fitting option. During the time of the conquest, Spain was practicing mercantilism, where the colony was seen as a source of resources and wealth to be extracted and sent back to the mother country. Gold was a key resource, and controlling it would be crucial for both the Spanish crown and the conquistadores themselves.\n\nAlso, the way Cort\u00e9s is managing the distribution of gold and even coercing the soldiers to hand over more of it, under the threat of punishment, suggests a centralized control over resources, which aligns with mercantilist practices.\n\nProtectionism doesn't seem directly relevant here, as the text isn't discussing trade barriers or protecting local industries.\n\nLaissez-faire would suggest that the conquistadores were operating without much oversight or control, but the emperor's share and Cort\u00e9s's management of the gold indicate a more controlled system.\n\nSupply-side economics doesn't really fit the context, as it's a modern economic theory and the passage is describing events in the 16th century.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, mercantilism seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
