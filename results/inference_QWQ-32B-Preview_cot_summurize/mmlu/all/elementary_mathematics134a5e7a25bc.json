I think I need to use the distributive property here, where you multiply the number outside the parentheses by each term inside the parentheses and then add those products together.\n\nSo, 9(9m + 3t) means I need to multiply 9 by 9m and then 9 by 3t, and then add those two results.\n\nLet me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 9 times 9m. 9 times 9 is 81, and since there's an m there, it's 81m.\n\nNext, 9 times 3t. 9 times 3 is 27, and with the t, it's 27t.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it should be 81m + 27t.\n\nLooking back at the options, that matches option D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check just to be sure.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe by factoring or something, but I don't think that's necessary here since the question is asking for equivalence through distribution.\n\nAlternatively, I could plug in some values for m and t to see which one equals the original expression.\n\nLet's say m = 1 and t = 1.\n\nThen the original expression is 9(9(1) + 3(1)) = 9(9 + 3) = 9(12) = 108.\n\nNow, let's check option D: 81(1) + 27(1) = 81 + 27 = 108.\n\nThat matches.\n\nLet's quickly check one of the other options to see why they're wrong.\n\nOption A: 18m + 3t. With m=1, t=1, that's 18 + 3 = 21, which is not equal to 108.\n\nOption B: 81m + 3t. That's 81 + 3 = 84, not 108.\n\nOption C: 18m + 12t. That's 18 + 12 = 30, not 108.\n\nSo, definitely, option D is the correct one.\n\nI think I've got it. The key was to apply the distributive property correctly and then verify by plugging in some values.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
