                    "text": "This question is about contract law, specifically dealing with the concepts of impossibility and frustration of purpose as defenses to non-performance. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a contract where a lumber mill agrees to deliver 1,000 8-foot sheets of plywood to a home improvement store on the first of each month for 10 consecutive months starting in June. The deliveries for June, July, and August were made on time and paid for. However, on August 16, the lumber mill informs the store that it cannot meet the September 1 delivery date because its lumber reserve has been destroyed by a forest fire. The mill asks to be excused from further performance, but the store refuses and demands that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. When the September shipment doesn't arrive, the store sues for breach of contract.\n\nNow, we need to determine how the court would likely rule in this scenario. The options are:\n\nA. Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.\n\nB. Judgment for the store, because the mill should have foreseen such a contingency occurring.\n\nC. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.\n\nD. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.\n\nLet's look at each option.\n\nOption A suggests that the mill's duties cannot be excused, meaning the mill is still obligated to perform despite the fire. This could be based on the idea that natural disasters or acts of God don't necessarily excuse performance unless specified in the contract.\n\nOption B implies that since the mill should have foreseen the possibility of a forest fire, they can't use it as an excuse for non-performance. This seems to relate to the concept of foreseeability in contract law.\n\nOption C argues that the mill's performance is excused due to impossibility caused by the destruction of their lumber reserve by the fire.\n\nOption D suggests that the purpose of the contract is frustrated because the mill can no longer perform due to the fire, thus discharging their obligations.\n\nIn contract law, impossibility of performance is a defense to non-performance when the performance required by the contract becomes objectively impossible due to an event beyond the control of the party. In this case, the destruction of the lumber reserve by a forest fire could be considered an act of God, making it impossible for the mill to fulfill its obligation to deliver the plywood.\n\nFrustration of purpose, on the other hand, occurs when an event undermines the fundamental purpose of the contract, but the contract still remains performable. However, in this scenario, the mill cannot perform due to the destruction of its lumber reserve, so impossibility seems more applicable.\n\nForeseeability is relevant in determining whether a party should be excused from performance. If the event was foreseeable, the party may still be held liable for non-performance. In this case, forest fires might be foreseeable in certain areas, but the law generally doesn't require parties to anticipate and guard against every possible contingency, especially natural disasters.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems the most appropriate. The mill's performance is discharged by impossibility because the lumber reserve, necessary for fulfilling the contract, was destroyed by a forest fire, an event beyond their control.\n\nOption A is incorrect because impossibility can be a valid defense in contract law.\n\nOption B is flawed because even if the mill should have foreseen the possibility of a forest fire, the destruction of the lumber reserve might still be considered an extraordinary event that excuses performance.\n\nOption D is less suitable because frustration of purpose typically applies when the contract can still be performed, but the reason for entering into the contract has been destroyed. Here, performance is impossible due to the destruction of the lumber reserve.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
