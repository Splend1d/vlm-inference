                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these disorders doesn't follow X-linked inheritance. So, first, I should recall what X-linked inheritance means. X-linked inheritance is when a gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the sex chromosomes. Since males have one X and one Y chromosome, and females have two X chromosomes, the expression of X-linked disorders can differ between males and females.\n\nOkay, so let's look at each option:\n\nA. Duchenne muscular dystrophy: I think this is an X-linked recessive disorder. Males are more frequently and severely affected because they have only one X chromosome. If they inherit the defective gene, they will express the disease. Females, having two X chromosomes, would usually need to inherit two defective genes to express the disease, which is less common.\n\nB. Tay-Sachs disease: Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. I think Tay-Sachs is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that it's not linked to the sex chromosomes. It's caused by a mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15. So, if this is correct, it wouldn't be X-linked.\n\nC. Hemophilia A: I believe this is X-linked recessive as well. It's a blood clotting disorder where the lack of a certain clotting factor leads to prolonged bleeding. Since it's on the X chromosome, males are more likely to express it.\n\nD. Hemophilia B: Similar to Hemophilia A, this is also X-linked recessive. It's another blood clotting disorder, this time due to deficiency in a different clotting factor.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Tay-Sachs disease is the one that doesn't show X-linked inheritance. But I should double-check to make sure.\n\nLet me confirm the inheritance patterns:\n\n- Duchenne muscular dystrophy: X-linked recessive\n\n- Tay-Sachs disease: autosomal recessive\n\n- Hemophilia A: X-linked recessive\n\n- Hemophilia B: X-linked recessive\n\nYes, Tay-Sachs is indeed autosomal recessive, meaning it's not linked to the X chromosome. Therefore, it doesn't follow X-linked inheritance.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Tay-Sachs disease.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
