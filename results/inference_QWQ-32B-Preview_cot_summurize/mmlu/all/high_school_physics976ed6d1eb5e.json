                    "text": "So I've got this question here: an object carries a charge of -1 Coulomb. I need to find out how many excess electrons it contains. The options are A) 6.25 \u00d7 10^18, B) 8.00 \u00d7 10^18, C) 1.60 \u00d7 10^19, and D) 3.20 \u00d7 10^19.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that charge is quantized, meaning it comes in discrete packets, and the smallest unit of charge is that of an electron, which is approximately -1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 Coulombs.\n\nSo, if the object has a charge of -1 Coulomb, that means it has an excess of electrons compared to protons. To find out how many excess electrons, I can divide the total charge by the charge of one electron.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of excess electrons = Total charge / Charge per electron\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nNumber of excess electrons = -1 C / (-1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 C)\n\nThe negative signs cancel out, so:\n\nNumber of excess electrons = 1 / 1.60 \u00d7 10^-19\n\nNow, to divide 1 by 1.60 \u00d7 10^-19, that's the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, which is 1 / (1.60 \u00d7 10^-19) = 1 \u00d7 (1 / 1.60) \u00d7 10^19\n\n1 divided by 1.60 is 0.625, so:\n\nNumber of excess electrons = 0.625 \u00d7 10^19\n\nBut 0.625 \u00d7 10^19 is the same as 6.25 \u00d7 10^18.\n\nWait, let me check that. Moving the decimal one place to the right increases the exponent by one, so 0.625 \u00d7 10^19 is indeed 6.25 \u00d7 10^18.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 6.25 \u00d7 10^18, which matches what I just calculated.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nNumber of electrons = total charge / charge per electron\n\nNumber of electrons = -1 C / (-1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 C) = 1 / 1.60 \u00d7 10^-19\n\nNow, 1 divided by 1.60 is 0.625, and 10^0 divided by 10^-19 is 10^19, so 0.625 \u00d7 10^19 = 6.25 \u00d7 10^18.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that 1 Coulomb is the charge of 1 / 1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 electrons.\n\nSo, 1 / 1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 = 6.25 \u00d7 10^18 electrons.\n\nTherefore, the object has 6.25 \u00d7 10^18 excess electrons.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A) 6.25 \u00d7 10^18.\n\nBut wait, let me see why the other options are there. Maybe there's a different way to interpret this.\n\nOption B is 8.00 \u00d7 10^18, which is higher than what I calculated.\n\nOption C is 1.60 \u00d7 10^19, which is even higher.\n\nOption D is 3.20 \u00d7 10^19, which is higher still.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the units more carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the elementary charge e = 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C.\n\nUsing more precise value:\n\nNumber of electrons = -1 C / (-1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C) \u2248 1 / 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 \u2248 6.242 \u00d7 10^18\n\nWhich rounds to 6.25 \u00d7 10^18, so A is still correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me by providing a negative charge, but since charge per electron is also negative, they cancel out, and I'm left with a positive number of electrons.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding about what \"excess electrons\" means.\n\nWait, if the object has a negative charge, that means it has more electrons than protons. So, the excess electrons are the number beyond what the protons can balance.\n\nSo, indeed, the number of excess electrons is equal to the total negative charge divided by the charge of one electron.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The answer should be A) 6.25 \u00d7 10^18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
