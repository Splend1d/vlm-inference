                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Ashford's argument regarding our duties to donate to aid agencies and how it relates to effective altruism and global poverty. The options are a bit tricky, and I need to think carefully about what each one is saying.\n\nFirst, let's recall what effective altruism is. It's a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others. Often, this involves donating to charities that have been shown to make a significant impact, especially in areas like global health and poverty reduction.\n\nNow, the criticism mentioned in option A is that effective altruism is at best a band-aid approach to global poverty. This suggests that while donating to aid agencies can provide immediate relief, it doesn't address the root causes of poverty, which might require more systemic changes.\n\nAshford is arguing that by recognizing we have backup duties to donate to aid agencies, we can somehow acknowledge this criticism while also diffusing it. So, maybe he's saying that even if effective altruism is just a band-aid, it's still important and valuable to apply that band-aid because it helps alleviate suffering in the short term, even if it doesn't solve everything.\n\nOption B says that acknowledging backup duties would mean admitting that effective altruism fails to be the right response to global poverty. This seems contrary to what Ashford might be arguing, as he's likely defending the importance of donating to aid agencies.\n\nOption C suggests that feeling relieved about our duties to the global poor is a result of backup duties not being morally urgent. But if backup duties are about donating to aid agencies, which is a key part of effective altruism, it's probably still considered morally important, just maybe not the ultimate solution.\n\nOption D is a fallback, but I'd like to see if one of the first three makes more sense.\n\nLet me consider the concept of \"backup duties.\" It seems like these are secondary moral responsibilities that come into play when primary duties are not being met. So, if the primary duty is to address global poverty through systemic changes, then the backup duty might be to provide immediate relief through donations to aid agencies.\n\nIn that case, acknowledging backup duties would mean recognizing that while we should be working on systemic changes, in the meantime, it's crucial to support aid agencies to help those in need now. This could acknowledge the criticism that effective altruism is a band-aid approach but also diffuse it by saying that band-aids are necessary and valuable in certain contexts.\n\nSo, option A seems plausible. It suggests that we can acknowledge the limitation of effective altruism (that it's just a band-aid) while still maintaining its importance and deflecting the criticism that it's insufficient.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, suggests that acknowledging backup duties would mean admitting that effective altruism isn't the right response. But that doesn't align with the idea that backup duties are important and should be recognized.\n\nOption C implies that recognizing backup duties makes us feel relieved about our duties to the global poor, perhaps because these duties are not as urgent. But in reality, supporting aid agencies is still a morally significant act, and it's not clear that backup duties would lead to relief in the sense of reduced moral obligation.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the most appropriate choice. It allows us to recognize the limitations of effective altruism while still valuing the immediate impact it can have through donations to aid agencies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
