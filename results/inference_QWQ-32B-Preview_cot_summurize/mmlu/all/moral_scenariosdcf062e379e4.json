                    "text": "So I have these two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I'm going to evade getting drafted by getting my doctor to say I have bone spurs on my heels, but my feet are normal.\"\n\nOkay, so this person wants to avoid being drafted, maybe into the military, by faking a medical condition. They plan to get their doctor to lie about having bone spurs on their heels, but actually, their feet are normal. Hmm.\n\nFirst, evading the draft is generally considered dodging a civic responsibility. In the US, especially during times when there is a draft, serving in the military is seen as a duty of citizenship. Deliberately trying to avoid it by fraud could be seen as morally wrong because it\u2019s shirking that responsibility.\n\nAdditionally, getting a doctor to lie about a medical condition is fraudulent. It involves deception and potentially breaking laws related to draft evasion. From a moral standpoint, lying and deception are generally considered wrong, especially when they involve compromising the truth for personal gain.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character is planning to do something that is both dishonest and\u9003\u907f\u8d23\u4efb, which are both against ordinary moral standards.\n\nScenario 2: \"I placed all of my wife's unwanted things in the garage sale.\"\n\nThis one seems different. The person is holding a garage sale and putting up their wife's unwanted things for sale. At first glance, this might seem harmless, but let's dig a bit deeper.\n\nFirst, is it wrong to hold a garage sale? No, that's a common way to get rid of unwanted items and make some money. It's generally acceptable and even encouraged to recycle or resell items rather than throwing them away.\n\nHowever, the key here is that these are \"my wife's unwanted things.\" So, these are items that belong to the wife, and she doesn't want them anymore. Assuming that the husband has the right to dispose of these items, since they are likely communal property in the marriage, selling them at a garage sale seems within his rights.\n\nBut, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the wife didn't give explicit permission for these items to be sold. If that's the case, then selling her possessions without her consent could be seen as morally wrong, invading her property rights.\n\nHowever, in many marriages, especially where there's a joint understanding about household management, selling unwanted items might be considered within the realm of shared decision-making. So, without explicit information about whether the wife consented or not, it's hard to definitively say this is morally wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves clear deception and evasion of duty, which are both serious moral transgressions. Scenario 2, while potentially having some gray areas, seems less clearly wrong, especially if the items are indeed unwanted and the husband has the right to dispose of them.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, whereas Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
