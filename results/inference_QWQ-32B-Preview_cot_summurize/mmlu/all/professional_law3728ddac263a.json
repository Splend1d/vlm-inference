                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this products liability case. So, a consumer bought a lawn mower from a department store, and there's a big notice that says not to use it on a steep hill. But the consumer didn't read the notice and used it on a steep hill anyway. The lawn mower fell over and crushed him, so he's suing the manufacturer under strict liability, saying there was a defect in the manufacture of the product. The manufacturer is defending by saying the consumer misused the product, and they're asking for summary judgment because the consumer didn't read the warning, which they think makes the lawsuit invalid as a matter of law.\n\nOkay, so I need to decide whether the court is likely to grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on this indisputable fact that the consumer didn't read the warning.\n\nLet's recall what summary judgment is. Summary judgment is when a court decides a case without a trial because there's no dispute about the facts, and one party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. So, in this case, the manufacturer is arguing that even if everything the plaintiff says is true, including that the product was defective, the plaintiff's own actions in not reading the warning and misusing the product should bar his claim as a matter of law.\n\nNow, in products liability cases, there are different theories under which a plaintiff can sue, like negligence, breach of warranty, and strict liability. In this case, the plaintiff is suing under strict liability, which generally holds that if a product is defective and unreasonably dangerous, the manufacturer can be liable even without fault, as long as the product caused harm to the user.\n\nBut here, the manufacturer is arguing that the consumer misused the product by using it on a steep hill despite the warning, and that this misuse should be a defense to the strict liability claim.\n\nSo, I need to think about whether misuse is a defense in strict liability cases.\n\nI remember that in strict liability cases, defenses like contributory negligence and assumption of risk don't apply in the same way as they do in negligence cases. In other words, even if the consumer was negligent or assumed the risk, the manufacturer can still be liable if the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\n\nBut, there is an exception for misuse of the product. Some jurisdictions recognize that if the consumer misuses the product in a way that the manufacturer couldn't have foreseen, then the manufacturer shouldn't be liable.\n\nHowever, in this case, the lawn mower had a prominent notice not to use it on a steep hill. So, the manufacturer did warn against using it in that manner. Therefore, they likely did foresee that someone might use it on a steep hill, which is why they put the warning there.\n\nSo, perhaps the misuse defense wouldn't apply here because the manufacturer warned against it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that the consumer didn't read the warning could still be considered misuse, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case.\n\nThis seems relevant because the manufacturer might be trying to use the consumer's negligence (not reading the warning) as a defense, but in strict liability cases, contributory negligence isn't a defense.\n\nBut, is misuse the same as contributory negligence? Maybe not entirely. Misuse might be seen as a separate issue.\n\nB. No, because the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\n\nWell, the plaintiff is alleging that the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous, but the manufacturer is arguing that even if that's true, the consumer's actions in misusing the product should bar the claim.\n\nSo, this option seems to be focusing on the fact that the product was defective, but it doesn't directly address the misuse issue.\n\nC. Yes, because the consumer assumed the risk of the danger when he used the product on a steep hill.\n\nAssumption of risk is generally not a defense in strict liability cases, but perhaps misuse could be considered a form of assumption of risk.\n\nHowever, I think assumption of risk requires that the consumer knew about the risk and voluntarily chose to take it, which might not be the case here if the consumer didn't read the warning.\n\nD. Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.\n\nThis seems similar to option C, but more specific about the misuse.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether the court is likely to grant summary judgment based on this.\n\nGiven that in strict liability cases, the manufacturer's liability is based on the product being defective and unreasonably dangerous, and that defenses like contributory negligence and assumption of risk don't bar the claim, I'm leaning towards option A: No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure if misuse falls under contributory negligence or if it's a separate defense.\n\nMaybe I should think about it differently. Perhaps the manufacturer could argue that the consumer's misuse was the cause of the injury, not any defect in the product.\n\nBut, in strict liability, if the product is defective and that defect causes harm, the manufacturer is liable, even if other factors contributed to the injury.\n\nHowever, if the misuse was so significant that it was the sole cause of the injury and not any defect in the product, then maybe the manufacturer could argue that there's no liability.\n\nBut in this case, the plaintiff is alleging that there was a defect in the manufacture that caused the lawn mower to fall over and crush him.\n\nSo, even if he misused the product by using it on a steep hill, if there was a defect that made it more likely to fall over, then the manufacturer should still be liable.\n\nAdditionally, since the manufacturer warned against using it on a steep hill, it suggests that using it on a steep hill could be dangerous, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the product shouldn't be used on a steep hill at all if it's designed to be used there.\n\nMaybe the warning was there because even a properly functioning lawn mower could be dangerous on a steep hill, but if there's a defect that makes it more dangerous, then the manufacturer should still be liable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the warning was sufficient, and the consumer's failure to read it means that they can't hold the manufacturer liable.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with the idea of strict liability, where the manufacturer is strictly responsible for defects in the product.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try to find some case law or legal principles that might apply.\n\nIn strict products liability, the general rule is that a manufacturer is liable for defects that make a product unreasonably dangerous, and this liability is strict, meaning that the manufacturer is liable even if they were careful in manufacturing the product.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule, and one of them is misuse of the product.\n\nMisuse can be defined as using the product in a way that is not intended or foreseeable by the manufacturer.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if the consumer misuses the product in an unforeseeable way, the manufacturer may not be liable.\n\nBut in this case, the manufacturer foresaw that someone might use the product on a steep hill, which is why they put a warning on it.\n\nTherefore, using it on a steep hill was a foreseeable misuse, and the manufacturer may still be liable.\n\nFurthermore, in some jurisdictions, failure to read warnings doesn't relieve the manufacturer of liability if the product is defective.\n\nThe reasoning is that the warning might not make the product safe enough, or that the defect overrides any warning.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff is alleging that there was a defect in the manufacture that caused the lawn mower to fall over, regardless of whether the consumer read the warning or not.\n\nSo, even if the consumer misused the product by using it on a steep hill, if there was a defect that made it more likely to fall over, the manufacturer should still be liable.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case.\n\nOption B: No, because the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous, also seems plausible, but it doesn't directly address the misuse issue.\n\nOption C: Yes, because the consumer assumed the risk of the danger when he used the product on a steep hill, might be tempting, but assumption of risk isn't typically a defense in strict liability cases.\n\nOption D: Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product, suggests that misuse is a complete defense, but in strict liability, misuse may not necessarily bar the claim if there's a defect that caused the injury.\n\nTherefore, I believe the court is unlikely to grant summary judgment to the defendant based on the consumer's failure to read the warning, because in strict liability cases, the manufacturer's liability isn't barred by the consumer's contributory negligence or assumption of risk.\n\nSo, the answer should be A: No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
