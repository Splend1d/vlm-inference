Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following motives for exploration is de las Casas most likely to think is most important in Source 2?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I have this question here that refers to two excerpts, one from Christopher Columbus and the other from Bartholomew de las Casas. The question is asking about de las Casas's perspective in Source 2 and which motive for exploration he most likely thinks is the most important. The options are converting natives to Christianity, financial gain, personal glory, or finding new mates.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each source is saying. Source 1 is from Columbus's letter in 1493, where he describes the natives trading their valuable items for trivial European goods. He mentions that he gave them many beautiful articles without expecting anything in return to win their favor, hoping they would become Christians and be inclined towards the Spanish crown.\n\nSource 2 is from de las Casas's \"A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies\" in 1542. He portrays the Spanish treatment of the natives as extremely brutal and motivated by a thirst for gold, leading to the near-extermination of the native population on Hispaniola.\n\nSo, de las Casas is criticizing the Spanish for their cruel treatment of the natives, attributing it to their greed for gold and quick wealth. He mentions that the ultimate aim is to acquire gold and swell themselves with riches in a very brief time, leading to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\nGiven this context, when the question asks which motive de las Casas most likely thinks is the most important in Source 2, it's clear that he emphasizes financial gain as the primary motive. He describes the Spanish as killing and destroying natives to acquire gold quickly and to become wealthy rapidly.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Converting natives to Christianity: While Columbus mentions this in Source 1, de las Casas in Source 2 focuses more on the brutal treatment for gold. Although conversion might have been a stated goal, de las Casas seems to prioritize the greed for wealth as the driving force.\n\nB. Financial gain: This aligns directly with de las Casas's description of the Spanish actions being driven by the desire for gold and quick riches.\n\nC. Personal glory: There's no direct mention of personal glory in Source 2. De las Casas talks about the Spanish wanting to rise to a high estate, but this seems linked to their wealth acquisition rather than personal fame or glory.\n\nD. Finding new mates: This option isn't mentioned or implied in Source 2. De las Casas discusses the brutal treatment and murder of natives for gold, not about finding new mates.\n\nTherefore, based on de las Casas's account, the motive he most likely considers the most important is financial gain.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
