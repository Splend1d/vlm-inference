                    "text": "So I've got this question here about measures of central tendency and outliers. The question is: \"If a distribution of scores includes one or more outliers, which of the following measures of central tendency should be used?\" And then it lists options A through D: standard deviation, range, median, and mean.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what central tendency means. Central tendency refers to the typical or central value in a dataset. The main measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode. So, looking at the options, A is standard deviation, which is actually a measure of dispersion, not central tendency. Similarly, B is range, which is also a measure of dispersion, indicating the spread of the data. So, options A and B aren't measures of central tendency, which means they probably aren't the right answers here.\n\nThat leaves me with C, median, and D, mean. Both of these are measures of central tendency. Now, the question is about dealing with outliers. Outliers are extreme values that differ significantly from other observations in the dataset. They can skew the results of certain statistical measures.\n\nI recall that the mean is sensitive to outliers because it takes into account every value in the dataset. So, if there's an outlier, it can pull the mean in its direction, making it less representative of the typical value in the dataset.\n\nOn the other hand, the median is the middle value when the data is ordered. It's less affected by outliers because it only depends on the position of the values, not their actual values. So, even if there are extreme values, the median remains the same as long as the middle position doesn't change.\n\nGiven that, in the presence of outliers, the median is generally a better measure of central tendency because it doesn't get influenced by those extreme values.\n\nLet me think about an example to illustrate this. Suppose I have a dataset: 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 100. Here, 100 is an outlier. The mean would be (2+3+3+4+5+5+6+7+100)/9 = 135/9 = 15. That's pretty high compared to most of the data points, which are in the 2-7 range. The median is the middle value, which is 5. That seems more representative of the typical value in this dataset.\n\nSo, based on this understanding, in the presence of outliers, the median is a better choice for measuring central tendency.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. median makes sense.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where mean might still be preferred. Well, in some cases, if the outliers are valid data points and are part of the natural variation in the data, some analysts might still use the mean, especially if the distribution is symmetric. However, the question specifies that there are one or more outliers, which typically suggests that the median is a more appropriate measure.\n\nAlso, mode is another measure of central tendency, but it's not listed in the options. Mode is the most frequent value and can be useful in certain distributions, but it's not directly relevant here.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the best answer is C. median.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
