                    "text": "I'm trying to answer a question about Watson and Noble's five-step model for circular evaluation. The question is: \"At which step should pre-testing of strategy and tactics be carried out?\" and the options are steps 1 through 4.\n\nFirst, I need to recall or look up what Watson and Noble's five-step model for circular evaluation entails. I don't have the specific paper in front of me, but I remember that circular evaluation is a approach that emphasizes the continuous and iterative nature of evaluation in public relations.\n\nLet me try to outline the five steps as I recall them:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** This is where you assess the current environment, identify stakeholders, and understand the context in which the PR activities will take place.\n\n2. **Strategy Development:** Here, you would define the overall goals and objectives of the PR campaign, and outline the broad approaches to achieve them.\n\n3. **Tactic Implementation:** This step involves planning and executing specific tactics that support the strategies outlined in step 2.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Measurement:** In this phase, you track the progress of the campaign, collect data on outcomes, and assess whether the tactics are effective.\n\n5. **Feedback and Adjustment:** Based on the monitoring and measurement, you provide feedback to refine strategies and tactics, and make necessary adjustments.\n\nNow, the question is about pre-testing of strategy and tactics. Pre-testing generally refers to the process of testing elements of a campaign before full-scale implementation to identify potential issues or areas for improvement.\n\nGiven this, I would think that pre-testing should occur before the full implementation of strategies and tactics. So, it might make sense for pre-testing to happen in step 3, right before or during the planning of specific tactics.\n\nBut let me think again. If I consider that strategies are more broad and tactics are more specific, perhaps pre-testing could involve both.\n\nWait, maybe it's step 2. If you're developing strategies, you might want to pre-test those strategies to see if they resonate with stakeholders or if they are likely to achieve the desired outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, pre-testing tactics in step 3 would make sense because tactics are more concrete and actionable, and you can more easily test specific messages or approaches.\n\nLet me consider the circular nature of the model. Since it's called \"circular evaluation,\" it probably emphasizes ongoing testing and adjustment. So, pre-testing might be integrated throughout the steps, but the question seems to specify at which step it should be carried out.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is step 1, B is step 2, C is step 3, and D is step 4.\n\nIf I had to choose, I would lean towards step 3, as that's when tactics are being implemented, and pre-testing tactics before fully rolling them out would be crucial to ensure they are effective.\n\nBut perhaps step 2 is also a viable option if you're pre-testing strategies to see if they are aligned with stakeholder expectations and likely to achieve objectives.\n\nMaybe I should consider that pre-testing could occur at both steps 2 and 3, but since the question asks for one step, I need to choose the most appropriate one.\n\nPerhaps step 3 is the best answer because tactics are more specific and directly actionable, making them more amenable to pre-testing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe step 4, where monitoring and measurement occur, is where pre-testing is integrated. But that seems off because monitoring and measurement typically happen during and after implementation, not before.\n\nWait, perhaps pre-testing is considered part of the monitoring and measurement phase, but that doesn't make complete sense to me.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe pre-testing is done in step 1, as part of the situation analysis, to test assumptions about the environment or stakeholder perceptions.\n\nBut that also seems a bit early for pre-testing of strategies and tactics.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I need to look up the specific model as described by Watson and Noble in their 2005 work to get a precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can eliminate some options.\n\nStep 4 is monitoring and measurement, which comes after implementation. Pre-testing should happen before implementation, so D is probably not the correct answer.\n\nStep 1 is situation analysis, which is more about understanding the context rather than testing strategies and tactics.\n\nStep 2 is strategy development, where you might test the viability of different strategies.\n\nStep 3 is tactic implementation, where you can test specific tactics.\n\nSo, between steps 2 and 3, which is more appropriate for pre-testing?\n\nI think pre-testing strategies in step 2 is important to ensure that the chosen strategies are aligned with objectives and likely to be effective.\n\nSimilarly, pre-testing tactics in step 3 is crucial to refine messages and approaches before full implementation.\n\nBut since the question asks for one step, and considering that tactics are more specific and directly implementable, pre-testing tactics in step 3 might be the most logical choice.\n\nMoreover, in PR practice, pre-testing often involves testing messages or creative materials, which fall under tactics.\n\nTherefore, I will go with option C, step 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
