                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution is all about. There are four options here, and I need to pick the one that best describes its purpose.\n\nOption A says it allows for trial by jury in common-law cases. Hmm, I think I've heard about trial by jury in other amendments, maybe the Sixth or Seventh Amendment. I'm not sure if it's the Tenth.\n\nOption B mentions granting voting rights to all American women. That sounds familiar, like the 19th Amendment, right? So, probably not the Tenth.\n\nOption C is about lowering the voting age from 21 to 18. I think that's the 26th Amendment. Again, not the Tenth.\n\nOption D says it reserves powers to the states. Now, that rings a bell. I think the Tenth Amendment has something to do with states' rights or powers reserved to the states.\n\nLet me recall what I know about the Tenth Amendment. I remember that the Constitution divides powers between the federal government and the state governments. The Tenth Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights, and it's supposed to clarify which powers belong to the states.\n\nLooking back at the text of the Tenth Amendment, it says: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\"\n\nSo, it's essentially saying that any powers that aren't given to the federal government by the Constitution, and aren't forbidden to the states, belong to the states or to the people.\n\nThis seems to align with option D, which says it reserves powers to the states.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nOption A: Trial by jury in common-law cases. I think the Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial in civil cases where the value in controversy exceeds a specified amount. So, that's not the Tenth Amendment.\n\nOption B: Voting rights for women. That's definitely the 19th Amendment, which was ratified in 1920, giving women the right to vote.\n\nOption C: Lowering the voting age to 18. That's the 26th Amendment, ratified in 1971.\n\nSo, none of these seem to relate to the Tenth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: It reserves powers to the states.\n\nI think that makes sense because the Tenth Amendment is about limiting the powers of the federal government and ensuring that states retain certain powers.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other amendment that might relate to reserving powers to the states. But I don't think so; the Tenth Amendment is specifically about that.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
