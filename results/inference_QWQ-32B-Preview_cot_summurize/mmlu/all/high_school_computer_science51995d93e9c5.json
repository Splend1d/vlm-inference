Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Python, operators have specific precedence. I think exponentiation comes first, then multiplication and division, and then addition and subtraction. But wait, there's a modulo operator here, which is %. I'm not entirely sure where that fits in the order of operations.\n\nLet me look it up. According to Python's operator precedence, exponentiation is first, then multiplication (*), division (/), floor division (//), and modulo (%) are all at the same level, and they are evaluated from left to right. Then come addition (+) and subtraction (-), which are also evaluated from left to right.\n\nSo in this expression, 4 + 3 % 2, the modulo operation 3 % 2 should be evaluated before the addition because modulo has higher precedence than addition.\n\nAlright, let's calculate 3 % 2. The modulo operator returns the remainder of the division of 3 by 2. So, 2 goes into 3 once, that's 2, and the remainder is 1. So, 3 % 2 equals 1.\n\nNow, the expression becomes 4 + 1, which equals 5.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5, which is option D.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again. Is there any chance that the addition could be performed before the modulo operation? I don't think so, because modulo has higher precedence. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if the expression had parentheses, like 4 + (3 % 2), that would definitely make it clear that the modulo should be done first. But even without parentheses, since modulo has higher precedence, it should still be evaluated first.\n\nLet me check with another example. Suppose I have 5 + 4 % 3. What's 4 % 3? Well, 3 goes into 4 once with a remainder of 1, so 4 % 3 is 1. Then, 5 + 1 equals 6. So, 5 + 4 % 3 equals 6, not 9, which would be the case if addition was performed before the modulo.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, in the original expression, 4 + 3 % 2, it's 4 + (3 % 2) = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
