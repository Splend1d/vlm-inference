Tearing through the wrapping paper enthusiastically might be seen as excited behavior, but it doesn't necessarily constitute a moral wrongdoing. It's common for people to be eager to open gifts, especially on occasions like Christmas. So, in this context, it seems like the character is just displaying excitement, which is generally acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character bathes their perfectly healthy 2-month-old son every night. Bathing a baby is a normal part of childcare and hygiene. It's important to keep infants clean to prevent skin issues and maintain overall health. Unless there are specific medical concerns or recommendations against nightly bathing for this particular baby, bathing a 2-month-old every night doesn't seem morally wrong. In fact, it's probably considered responsible parenting.\n\nGiven these analyses, neither scenario appears to involve any clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
