                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about mass spectrometry, and it gives us three statements, I, II, and III, and asks which of them are characteristics of mass spectrometry. Then it gives options A through D to choose from.\n\nSo, first, I need to recall what mass spectrometry is. I know that mass spectrometry is an analytical technique used to identify compounds based on their mass-to-charge ratio. It's widely used in chemistry, biology, and materials science to determine the composition of a sample.\n\nStatement I says: \"Analyte molecules are converted to gaseous ions.\" Hmm, that sounds right. In mass spectrometry, the sample, which is the analyte, is first vaporized and then ionized. This means that the molecules are turned into gaseous ions, which can then be manipulated and measured by the mass spectrometer.\n\nStatement II says: \"The ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio.\" Yes, that's a fundamental part of mass spectrometry. After ionization, the ions are separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). This separation is achieved by using electric and magnetic fields within the mass spectrometer. The result is a mass spectrum, which is a plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio.\n\nStatement III says: \"In addition to compound identification, mass spectra can be utilized to determine precise isotopic masses and isotopic ratios.\" I think this is also true. Mass spectrometry can not only identify compounds but also provide information about the isotopes present in the sample. By analyzing the mass spectrum, one can determine the masses of different isotopes and their relative abundances, which can be crucial for various applications, such as tracing chemical reactions or understanding the origin of materials.\n\nSo, all three statements seem to be correct characteristics of mass spectrometry. If that's the case, then the answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any possibility that one of these statements isn't always true or isn't a characteristic of mass spectrometry?\n\nLooking back at statement I: \"Analyte molecules are converted to gaseous ions.\" This seems essential to mass spectrometry. Without ionization, mass spectrometry couldn't work as it relies on the interaction of ions with electric and magnetic fields.\n\nStatement II: \"The ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio.\" Again, this is a defining feature of mass spectrometry. The entire purpose is to separate ions based on their m/z to create a mass spectrum that can be analyzed.\n\nStatement III: \"In addition to compound identification, mass spectra can be utilized to determine precise isotopic masses and isotopic ratios.\" This is also accurate. Mass spectrometry is often used to study isotopes because it can distinguish between different masses with high precision.\n\nTherefore, all three statements are correct characteristics of mass spectrometry, and the answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
