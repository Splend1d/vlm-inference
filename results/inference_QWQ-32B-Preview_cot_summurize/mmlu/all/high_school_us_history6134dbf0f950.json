Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nHow did President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the Civil War?\n\nA.

                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation. So, first, I need to understand what the Emancipation Proclamation did and how it changed the Civil War.\n\nFrom what I remember, the Emancipation Proclamation was issued by President Lincoln during the Civil War, and it declared that slaves in the Confederate states \"shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.\" But I also recall that it didn't immediately free all slaves; it only applied to the states that were in rebellion against the Union.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA says that the war came to a swift conclusion because the Confederacy realized it was futile. But I don't think that's accurate. The war actually continued for over a year and a half after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says that the war grew in scope because Great Britain joined the fight on the side of the Union. Hmm, I don't think Britain joined the war on the Union's side. In fact, Britain had been considering recognizing the Confederacy, but the Emancipation Proclamation shifted the narrative away from states' rights and toward abolition, which might have deterred Britain from supporting the Confederacy because slavery was illegal in British territories. So, maybe the Proclamation influenced Britain not to join, but it didn't make them join the Union.\n\nOption C says that President Jefferson Davis vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves. Well, I'm sure he did, but that seems more like a reaction than a change in the course of the war. I think the question is asking how the Proclamation altered the war's course, not just how the Confederacy reacted.\n\nOption D says that the war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on preserving the Union. That sounds interesting. Before the Proclamation, the main goal was to preserve the Union, and the issue of slavery was somewhat secondary, at least in the official war aims. But with the Proclamation, freeing slaves became an official war aim. So, the war's purpose expanded beyond just preserving the Union; it was now also about ending slavery.\n\nLooking back at the quote provided, it says that Lincoln was strongly anti-slavery but not an abolitionist or a Radical Republican. He made a distinction between his personal wishes for freedom and his official duties within the legal and constitutional system. Even after the Proclamation, he still preferred gradual abolition.\n\nSo, the Emancipation Proclamation was a significant shift because it turned the war into a fight not just for Union but also for freedom. It changed the meaning and purpose of the war.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider why the other options are less suitable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the war did not end swiftly after the Proclamation. It was issued in 1863, and the war didn't end until 1865.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Great Britain did not join the war on the Union's side. In fact, they remained neutral, and the Proclamation may have influenced them to stay out of the war or not to recognize the Confederacy.\n\nOption C describes a likely reaction from the Confederacy but doesn't capture how the Proclamation altered the war's course in terms of Union war aims and the international perception of the war.\n\nSo, D seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
