                    "text": "So I've got this question here about fitness in organisms, and I need to choose the best definition from these options. Let's see:\n\nA. Lives longer than others of its species.\n\nB. Competes for resources more successfully than others of its species.\n\nC. Mates more frequently than others of its species.\n\nD. Leaves more viable offspring than others of its species.\n\nHmm, fitness is a term that's pretty central in evolutionary biology, right? I remember that it's not just about being strong or healthy, but more about reproductive success. So, maybe option D is the best choice because it directly relates to passing on genes to the next generation.\n\nBut let's think about the other options too. Option A says living longer. While living longer might give an organism more time to reproduce, it's not necessarily directly related to fitness. Some organisms might have short lifespans but still produce a lot of offspring.\n\nOption B is about competing for resources more successfully. That sounds important because resources like food and mates are crucial for survival and reproduction. But is it the best definition of fitness? Maybe not, because an organism could be good at competing for resources but still not necessarily produce more offspring if it doesn't translate into reproductive success.\n\nOption C is about mating more frequently. That seems related to reproductive success, but is it the whole picture? Maybe not, because mating frequency doesn't guarantee the production of viable offspring. There could be other factors like sperm competition or the quality of the offspring.\n\nSo, coming back to option D, leaving more viable offspring, that seems to encompass the idea that not only does the organism reproduce, but its offspring are able to survive and potentially reproduce themselves. That sounds like a good indicator of fitness.\n\nBut wait, I've heard about different types of fitness, like absolute fitness and relative fitness. Absolute fitness is the ratio of an individual's offspring to the rest of the population, while relative fitness is compared to the fittest individual in the population. Maybe the question is referring to relative fitness?\n\nActually, the question is about an individual having greater fitness than another individual, so perhaps relative fitness is what's being referred to here. In that case, it's about how successfully one individual reproduces compared to others in the population.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to align best with this concept because it directly compares the number of viable offspring an individual leaves compared to others of its species.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there a specific context in which one of these options might be considered correct? The question is quite general, so I'm assuming it's in the context of evolutionary biology and natural selection.\n\nIn evolutionary terms, fitness is often defined as an organism's ability to pass on its genes to the next generation. So, the key is really about reproductive success.\n\nOption A, living longer, could be a component of fitness if longevity leads to more reproduction opportunities, but it's not the defining characteristic.\n\nOption B, competing for resources more successfully, is probably important for survival and potentially reproduction, but again, it's not the direct measure of fitness.\n\nOption C, mating more frequently, is closer, but as I thought earlier, it doesn't guarantee the production of viable offspring.\n\nOption D directly ties into the concept of reproductive success by mentioning viable offspring, which are able to potentially contribute to the gene pool of future generations.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: leaves more viable offspring than others of its species.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any of the other options could be partially correct or if there's an argument to be made for them.\n\nFor example, option B, competing for resources more successfully, could lead to better health, which in turn could lead to greater reproductive success. But that's somewhat indirect. Fitness is more directly about reproduction.\n\nOption C, mating more frequently, could be a indicator of higher fitness, but it's not the same as actually producing more offspring. After all, mating frequency doesn't guarantee successful conception or the survival of offspring.\n\nOption A, living longer, could allow for more opportunities to reproduce, but again, it's not the same as actually producing more offspring.\n\nSo, overall, option D seems to be the most accurate definition of greater fitness in this context.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The key is understanding that fitness in evolutionary biology is primarily about reproductive success, which is best represented by leaving more viable offspring.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
