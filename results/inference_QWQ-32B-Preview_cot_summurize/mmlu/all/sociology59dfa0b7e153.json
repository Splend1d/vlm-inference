The sociologist is working at the hospital for a few weeks, taking notes on what's happening. The question is asking about the method of research being used here. The options are experimentation, secondary data analysis, participant observation, and survey administration.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these methods entails.\n\nExperimentation is when researchers manipulate variables to see cause and effect. Like, if you want to see if a new drug works, you give it to one group and a placebo to another and compare the results. But in this case, the sociologist is just observing and recording data, not manipulating any variables, so I don't think it's experimentation.\n\nSecondary data analysis is when researchers use data that someone else has already collected. For example, using census data or previous study results to analyze a new question. But here, the sociologist is collecting their own data through field notes, so that doesn't fit.\n\nParticipant observation is a method where the researcher participates in the group or setting they're studying while also observing and recording data. This sounds a lot like what's happening here. The sociologist is on staff at the hospital, so they're part of the hospital environment, and they're recording field notes based on what they observe and perhaps experience.\n\nSurvey administration is when researchers collect data through surveys or questionnaires. But there's no mention of surveys in this scenario; it's all about recording field notes.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like participant observation is the method being used here. The sociologist is participating in the hospital environment as staff and observing the power relations between different institutions.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The question says the sociologist is \"on staff at the hospital for several weeks, recording data as field notes.\" Being on staff suggests that they are part of the hospital's operations, which aligns with participant observation because they are both participating and observing.\n\nExperimentation involves manipulation, which isn't mentioned here. Secondary data analysis uses existing data, but here the data is being collected anew. Survey administration isn't relevant because there are no surveys mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. participant observation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
