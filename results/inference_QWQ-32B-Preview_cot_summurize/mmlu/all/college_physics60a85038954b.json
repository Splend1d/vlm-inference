                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement is true about bosons and fermions. I remember that particles are classified into these two categories based on their spin, but I need to recall the specifics.\n\nFirst, bosons are particles with integer spin, like photons or gluons, and fermions have half-integer spin, like electrons, protons, and neutrons.\n\nNow, about wave functions. I think bosons have symmetric wave functions, meaning that if you swap two bosons, the wave function stays the same or changes by a positive sign. On the other hand, fermions have antisymmetric wave functions, so swapping two fermions changes the sign of the wave function.\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This is why electrons in atoms have different energy levels and why matter has the properties it does. But bosons don't obey this principle; in fact, they can all occupy the same quantum state, which is why you get phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensates.\n\nLet me look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Bosons have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\" Hmm, I think bosons do have symmetric wave functions, but they do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle. In fact, it's the fermions that obey this principle. So this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says: \"Bosons have antisymmetric wave functions and do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\" Wait, if bosons have symmetric wave functions, then this option is wrong because it says antisymmetric.\n\nOption C says: \"Fermions have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\" But I recall that fermions have antisymmetric wave functions, so this can't be right.\n\nOption D says: \"Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\" This seems correct. Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is it possible that bosons have symmetric wave functions and fermions have antisymmetric ones, and only fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle?\n\nYes, that sounds right. Bosons can occupy the same quantum state, which is consistent with them having symmetric wave functions. Fermions can't, which is why their wave functions are antisymmetric.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct statement.\n\nI think the other options are incorrect because they mix up the properties of bosons and fermions. Bosons don't obey the Pauli exclusion principle, and fermions have antisymmetric wave functions.\n\nIt's important to keep these straight because these properties are fundamental to understanding the behavior of particles in quantum mechanics and how they interact in various systems, from atoms to solids to the early universe.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
