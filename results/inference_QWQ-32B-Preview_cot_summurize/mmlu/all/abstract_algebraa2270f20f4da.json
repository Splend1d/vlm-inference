                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** The external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a cyclic group is. A cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. So, if G is a cyclic group, there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be written as g^n for some integer n.\n\nNow, the external direct product of two groups G and H, denoted G \u00d7 H, consists of ordered pairs (g, h) where g is in G and h is in H, with component-wise operation.\n\nIf both G and H are cyclic, generated by g and h respectively, is G \u00d7 H cyclic? That is, does there exist an element (a, b) in G \u00d7 H such that every element (g, h) can be written as (a, b)^n for some integer n?\n\nLet's consider an example. Take G = Z_2 (cyclic of order 2) and H = Z_3 (cyclic of order 3). Their direct product Z_2 \u00d7 Z_3 should have order 6. Is this product cyclic? Well, Z_6 is cyclic, and by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since 2 and 3 are coprime, Z_2 \u00d7 Z_3 is isomorphic to Z_6, which is cyclic.\n\nBut does this always hold? What if the orders are not coprime? Let's take G = Z_2 and H = Z_2. The direct product Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 has four elements: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Is this cyclic? Let's check:\n\n- (0,0) is the identity.\n\n- (0,1)^2 = (0,0)\n\n- (1,0)^2 = (0,0)\n\n- (1,1)^2 = (0,0)\n\nNone of these elements generate the whole group, so Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 is not cyclic.\n\nTherefore, the external direct product of cyclic groups is not always cyclic. It depends on the orders of the groups. If the orders are coprime, then the product is cyclic, but if they share a common divisor greater than 1, it's not.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what D_n is. D_n is the dihedral group of order 2n, representing the symmetries of a regular n-gon, including rotations and reflections.\n\nSo, D_3 is the symmetries of an equilateral triangle, which has 6 elements (3 rotations and 3 reflections). D_4 is the symmetries of a square, with 8 elements (4 rotations and 4 reflections). Therefore, the external direct product D_3 \u00d7 D_4 should have order 6 * 8 = 48.\n\nNow, D_12 would be the dihedral group of a dodecagon, which has 24 elements (12 rotations and 12 reflections). So, D_12 has order 24.\n\nBut the direct product D_3 \u00d7 D_4 has order 48, which is not equal to the order of D_12 (24). Since group isomorphism preserves the order of the group, these two groups cannot be isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the answer is B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
