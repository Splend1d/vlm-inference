                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about the Osman test from the European Court, and I need to figure out which statement isn't part of that test. The options are:\n\nA. The risk must emanate from a state agent\n\nB. If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm)\n\nC. A state should take reasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring\n\nD. A state knows or ought to have known\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Osman test is all about. I remember that Osman v UK was a case in 1998 where the European Court of Human Rights talked about the positive obligations of states to protect individuals under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is the right to life.\n\nSo, the Osman test is used to determine when a state has a duty to step in and prevent harm to an individual. It's about when the state must act to protect someone's life or prevent harm.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"The risk must emanate from a state agent.\" Hmm, I think this might not be correct. In Osman, the court actually considered a situation where the threat came from a private individual, not a state agent. So, the test is supposed to apply even when the risk isn't coming from the state itself but from someone else. Therefore, this might not be a part of the Osman test.\n\nOption B says, \"If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm).\" Yeah, that sounds familiar. In Osman, the court mentioned that there needs to be a real and immediate risk to the individual's life for the state to have a positive obligation to intervene. So, this seems to be part of the test.\n\nOption C says, \"A state should take reasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring.\" That also sounds right. The state is expected to take appropriate measures that are reasonable in the circumstances to protect the individual. So, this appears to be included in the Osman test.\n\nOption D says, \"A state knows or ought to have known.\" I believe this is also part of the test. The state's knowledge or what it ought to have known about the risk is crucial in determining whether it has fulfilled its obligations. So, this seems to be included as well.\n\nBased on this, it looks like option A is the one that's not part of the Osman test because the test applies regardless of whether the risk comes from a state agent or a private individual.\n\nTo make sure, maybe I should look back at the actual judgment or find a summary of the Osman test.\n\nOkay, according to my notes, in Osman, the European Court held that the positive obligation requires that where the authorities know or ought to know at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third party, they must take measures within the scope of their powers which are appropriate to the risk.\n\nSo, it mentions:\n\n- Know or ought to know\n\n- Real and immediate risk\n\n- Identified individual\n\n- Criminal acts of a third party\n\n- Take measures within the scope of their powers which are appropriate to the risk\n\nComparing this to the options:\n\nA. The risk must emanate from a state agent \u2013 This isn't mentioned. In fact, the risk is from a third party, not the state.\n\nB. If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm) \u2013 This matches \"real and immediate risk\"\n\nC. A state should take reasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring \u2013 This aligns with \"take measures within the scope of their powers which are appropriate to the risk\"\n\nD. A state knows or ought to have known \u2013 This is directly stated in the test\n\nTherefore, option A is not part of the Osman test.\n\nI think that's the answer, but just to be thorough, maybe I should check another source or see if there's any qualification to this.\n\nLooking online, I find summaries of the Osman test that confirm this. For example, one source says that the Osman test applies when there is a real and immediate risk to an identified individual's life, and the state knows or ought to have known about it. The risk can be from a private individual, not necessarily from a state agent.\n\nSo, yes, option A is not part of the Osman test because the test is designed to cover situations where the threat comes from a third party, not from the state itself.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
