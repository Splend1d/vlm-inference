                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about Parfit's critique of Taurek and Lewis. So, the question is: According to Parfit, both Taurek and Lewis assume that for there to be a \"sum of pain,\" it must be:\n\nA. all felt at a single time.\n\nB. all felt by a single person.\n\nC. all be caused by a single source.\n\nD. all of the above.\n\nI need to recall what Parfit says about how Taurek and Lewis view the aggregation of pain. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, I remember that Taurek argues against aggregating utilities or harms when making decisions about who to save or help. He thinks that each person's interests are separate and shouldn't be totaled up. So, in a situation where you can save one person or five, Taurek would say you shouldn't just pick the larger number because their pains aren't comparable in a way that allows summation.\n\nLewis, on the other hand, seems to accept that utilities can be summed up, at least in certain contexts. He might be more inclined to think that greater overall good or lesser overall bad is what we should aim for, even if it means overriding the interests of some individuals.\n\nNow, Parfit is critiquing both of them for assuming something about the nature of the \"sum of pain.\" So, I need to figure out what that assumption is.\n\nOption A says that the sum of pain must be all felt at a single time. I'm not sure if that's the assumption Parfit is attributing to both Taurek and Lewis. Taurek might focus more on the separateness of persons and their interests, regardless of when the pain is felt. Lewis might consider temporal aspects, but I don't recall him specifically requiring that the sum be felt at a single time.\n\nOption B says that the sum of pain must be all felt by a single person. Hmm, that seems plausible. Maybe Parfit is saying that both Taurek and Lewis assume that only pains felt by one person can be meaningfully added up, and that aggregating pains across different people is problematic because their experiences are separate.\n\nOption C says that all the pain must be caused by a single source. I don't recall Parfit discussing this specific point in relation to Taurek and Lewis. It seems like an unlikely assumption for both of them to share regarding the summation of pain.\n\nOption D is all of the above, but since I'm not fully convinced about options A and C, maybe that's not the right choice.\n\nLet me look back at some of Parfit's arguments. In \"Reasons and Persons,\" Parfit discusses the ethics of aggregation and critiquing both consequentialist and non-consequentialist views. He might be pointing out that both Taurek and Lewis implicitly assume that pains can only be summed within a single person's experience, not across different persons.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Parfit argues that both are making a mistake by assuming that sums of pain require certain conditions to be met, such as being experienced at the same time or by the same person.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider each option separately.\n\nOption A: all felt at a single time. This might relate to the idea of temporal aggregation. If you're summing pains, do they need to be co-temporal? I don't think that's a necessary assumption for either Taurek or Lewis.\n\nOption B: all felt by a single person. This seems more likely. Taurek emphasizes the separateness of persons, suggesting that pains of different people can't be directly compared or added. Lewis, while possibly more accepting of aggregation, might still hold that sums of pain make most sense when they refer to a single individual's experience.\n\nOption C: all be caused by a single source. I don't recall this being a central assumption in either Taurek's or Lewis's positions.\n\nGiven this, option B seems the most plausible. Parfit might be arguing that both Taurek and Lewis assume that sums of pain are only meaningful when referring to a single person's experiences, thereby failing to consider the possibility of interpersonally comparing and aggregating pains.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Parfit is critiquing them for assuming that sums of pain require some sort of temporal or causal unity, but among the options provided, B seems the best fit.\n\nI think I'll go with B: all felt by a single person.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
