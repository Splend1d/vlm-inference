Play is generally considered a voluntary activity that is intrinsically motivating and often done for enjoyment. But how does it differ between adults and children?\n\nOption A says that play for children serves to relieve stress. While play can certainly help children manage stress, I think this might not be the primary purpose compared to adults. Adults often engage in play or leisure activities specifically to relieve stress after a hard day's work. So, maybe for children, play has a different primary function.\n\nOption B suggests that play for children is more structured. Actually, I think children's play is often less structured than adults'. Children tend to engage in free play, where they create their own rules and objectives, whereas adult play might be more rule-based, like in sports or games with set regulations.\n\nOption C states that play for children serves mostly for entertainment. While entertainment is certainly a part of children's play, I feel like there's more to it. Children learn a lot through play\u2014they develop social skills, understand their environment, and build cognitive abilities. So, while entertainment is there, it might not be the sole purpose.\n\nOption D says that play for children aids in mastering the environment. This sounds promising. Piaget, a renowned developmental psychologist, emphasized that play is essential for children to make sense of the world around them. Through play, children experiment, explore, and learn about cause and effect, social interactions, and more. So, in a way, play helps them master their environment.\n\nComparing this to adult play, adults might engage in play for relaxation, socializing, or personal enjoyment, but not primarily for mastering their environment, as they presumably already have a good grasp of it.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best answer is D. Play activities for children aid in mastering the environment, unlike those for adults.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
