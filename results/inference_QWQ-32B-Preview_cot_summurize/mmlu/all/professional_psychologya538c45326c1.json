                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Conduct Disorder, and I need to figure out which option is the essential feature of it. The options are:\n\nA. Lack of appropriate guilt or remorse\n\nB. Major rule or norm violations\n\nC. Aggression\n\nD. Impulsivity\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Conduct Disorder actually is. I remember it's a behavioral disorder where children and teens repeatedly display harmful actions and have difficulty following rules. It's more than just occasional naughty behavior; it's a pattern of violating the rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms.\n\nNow, looking at option A: Lack of appropriate guilt or remorse. I think this is related to Conduct Disorder because one of the signs is that the individual doesn't seem to feel bad about hurting others or breaking rules. So, this could be an essential feature.\n\nOption B: Major rule or norm violations. This seems directly in line with the definition I just recalled. Conduct Disorder is characterized by persistent disregard for rules and social norms. So, this is probably a key aspect.\n\nOption C: Aggression. Aggressive behavior is often a part of Conduct Disorder, like bullying, fighting, or being physically harmful to others. But is this the essential feature, or is it more about the overall pattern of rule-breaking?\n\nOption D: Impulsivity. Impulsivity can be a part of Conduct Disorder, as individuals may act without thinking about the consequences. However, impulsivity is also seen in other disorders like ADHD, so it might not be specific enough to be the essential feature.\n\nI need to think about which one is the core characteristic that defines Conduct Disorder. Is it the lack of guilt, the rule-breaking, the aggression, or the impulsivity?\n\nLet me consider the diagnostic criteria for Conduct Disorder. I think it's listed in the DSM-5, the diagnostic manual for mental disorders. According to DSM-5, Conduct Disorder is diagnosed based on a persistent pattern of behavior that violates the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal rules. The specific criteria include things like aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, and serious violations of rules.\n\nSo, it seems like the core is these repetitive, harmful behaviors and rule violations. Now, among the options, B. Major rule or norm violations seems to directly match this description.\n\nOption A, lack of appropriate guilt or remorse, might be associated with Conduct Disorder, especially in the more severe cases or in older adolescents and adults, where it might be referred to as callous-unemotional traits. But is this the essential feature, or is it more of an associated feature?\n\nSimilarly, aggression is a common behavior in Conduct Disorder, but not all individuals with Conduct Disorder are aggressive; they might engage in other types of rule-breaking behaviors.\n\nImpulsivity is also common but, as I thought earlier, it's not unique to Conduct Disorder.\n\nTherefore, I think the essential feature is B. Major rule or norm violations, as this captures the core of the disorder\u2014 the persistent disregard for rules and the rights of others.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check some resources or see if there's more to consider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the essential feature is a combination of these traits, but since I have to choose one, I think B is the most accurate.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that rule violations are the behavioral manifestations, while lack of guilt, aggression, and impulsivity are underlying traits or tendencies that may contribute to the behavior.\n\nSo, in that case, the essential feature would be the observable behavior, which is the rule violations.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is B. Major rule or norm violations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
