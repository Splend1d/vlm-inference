                    "text": "So I have this logic problem to solve using indirect truth tables. The argument is:\n\nH \u2261 (~I \u2228 J)\n\nH \u2228 ~J\n\nTherefore, ~I\n\nAnd I need to determine if this argument is valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an indirect truth table is. I recall that it's a method to test the validity of an argument without constructing a full truth table, which can be time-consuming, especially with multiple variables.\n\nIn indirect truth tables, the idea is to assume that the argument is invalid and see if that leads to a contradiction. If it does, then the argument is actually valid. If not, then it's invalid, and the assignment of truth values that doesn't lead to a contradiction is a counterexample.\n\nSo, for this argument, I have three variables: H, I, and J.\n\nThe argument is:\n\n1. H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J)\n\n2. H \u2228 ~J\n\nTherefore, ~I\n\nTo use the indirect truth table method, I'll assume that the argument is invalid. That means that there is at least one row where both premises are true, and the conclusion is false.\n\nSo, I need to find an assignment of truth values to H, I, and J where:\n\n- Premise 1 (H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J)) is true\n\n- Premise 2 (H \u2228 ~J) is true\n\n- Conclusion (~I) is false\n\nSince ~I is false, that means I is true.\n\nSo, I is true.\n\nNow, let's write down what we have:\n\nI = T\n\nNow, let's look at premise 1: H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J)\n\nSince I is true, ~I is false.\n\nSo, ~I \u2228 J is false \u2228 J, which is equal to J.\n\nTherefore, premise 1 becomes: H \u2261 J\n\nSo, H and J must have the same truth value for this equivalence to hold.\n\nNow, premise 2: H \u2228 ~J\n\nSince I is true, and we're trying to find a case where premise 2 is true.\n\nBut wait, I is true, but that doesn't directly affect premise 2.\n\nWait, premise 2 is H \u2228 ~J.\n\nWe need this to be true.\n\nGiven that H \u2261 J, from premise 1.\n\nSo, if H is true, then J is true.\n\nIf H is false, then J is false.\n\nLet's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: H is true, hence J is true.\n\nThen, premise 2: H \u2228 ~J = T \u2228 ~T = T \u2228 F = T\n\nSo, premise 2 is true.\n\nAnd conclusion ~I is false, as we assumed.\n\nSo, this seems to be a possible counterexample.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's any contradiction in this case.\n\nWait, no contradiction yet.\n\nCase 2: H is false, hence J is false.\n\nThen, premise 2: H \u2228 ~J = F \u2228 ~F = F \u2228 T = T\n\nSo, premise 2 is true.\n\nAgain, no contradiction.\n\nSo, both cases seem possible.\n\nBut in both cases, I is true, as we assumed for the counterexample.\n\nWait, but in option D, it says:\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and H and J are false\n\nWhich matches case 2.\n\nOption C says:\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when H and I are true and J is false\n\nBut in case 1, H is true and J is true, since H \u2261 J.\n\nWait, but in case 1, if H is true, then J is true.\n\nSo, option C has J as false, which would contradict H \u2261 J.\n\nBecause if H is true and J is false, then H \u2261 J is false, which contradicts premise 1.\n\nSo, option C cannot be a counterexample because it makes premise 1 false.\n\nSimilarly, option B says:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and J are false\n\nSo, H = F, I = F, J = F\n\nBut, in this case, ~I is T, so conclusion ~I is T, which doesn't match our assumption that conclusion is false.\n\nBecause for a counterexample, conclusion must be false, which means I must be true.\n\nSo, option B is invalid because it has I = F, but we need I = T for the conclusion to be false.\n\nOption A is \"Valid\", but we're trying to see if there's a counterexample.\n\nOption D is:\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and H and J are false\n\nWait, but as per premise 1, H \u2261 J.\n\nIf H is false and J is false, then H \u2261 J is T.\n\nPremise 2: H \u2228 ~J = F \u2228 ~F = F \u2228 T = T\n\nConclusion ~I is F, since I is T.\n\nSo, this satisfies both premises being true and conclusion being false.\n\nTherefore, this is a valid counterexample.\n\nSo, the argument is invalid, and option D is the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there are any other possible counterexamples.\n\nIs there any other combination where premises are true and conclusion is false?\n\nFrom our earlier analysis, there are two cases:\n\n1. H = T, J = T, I = T\n\n2. H = F, J = F, I = T\n\nIn the first case:\n\nPremise 1: H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J) \u2192 T \u2261 (F \u2228 T) \u2192 T \u2261 T \u2192 T\n\nPremise 2: H \u2228 ~J \u2192 T \u2228 ~T \u2192 T \u2228 F \u2192 T\n\nConclusion: ~I \u2192 ~T \u2192 F\n\nSo, premises true, conclusion false.\n\nSimilarly, in the second case:\n\nPremise 1: F \u2261 (F \u2228 F) \u2192 F \u2261 F \u2192 T\n\nPremise 2: F \u2228 ~F \u2192 F \u2228 T \u2192 T\n\nConclusion: ~T \u2192 F\n\nAgain, premises true, conclusion false.\n\nSo, there are two possible counterexamples.\n\nBut among the options, only option D matches one of them.\n\nOption C does not match because it has H = T, I = T, J = F, which makes premise 1 false, as H \u2261 J would be F \u2261 T, which is F.\n\nTherefore, option C is invalid.\n\nOption B has H = F, I = F, J = F, but this makes conclusion ~I = T, which doesn't fit our requirement for a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
