The options are:\n\nA. Multiplier effect\n\nB. Rank-size rule\n\nC. Central place theory\n\nD. Burgess's sector model\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with option A, the multiplier effect. I think this has to do with how an initial change in spending leads to a larger total increase in economic activity. For example, if a new factory is built in a town, it not only provides jobs for the people working there but also creates demand for local services, leading to more jobs and income in the area. So, it's more about economic impact rather than urban hierarchy or population ranking.\n\nOption B is the rank-size rule. I've heard of this in the context of city sizes. It suggests that the population of a city is inversely proportional to its rank in the hierarchy of cities. So, the biggest city is about twice as large as the second biggest, three times as large as the third, and so on. This seems to fit the description in the question.\n\nOption C, central place theory, is a model developed by Walter Christaller to explain the size and distribution of cities and towns. It suggests that settlements form in a hierarchical pattern based on the range of goods and services they provide, with larger cities fewer and farther apart than smaller towns. While it does deal with urban hierarchy, it doesn't specifically state that population is inversely proportional to rank.\n\nOption D, Burgess's sector model, is a model of urban structure that suggests cities grow in sectors rather than in concentric zones. It was proposed by Ernest Burgess as an alternative to the concentric zone model. This model is more about the spatial arrangement of different land uses within a city rather than the hierarchy of cities themselves.\n\nGiven these definitions, it seems like option B, the rank-size rule, best describes the urban hierarchy model where population is inversely proportional to rank. The multiplier effect is about economic impacts, central place theory is about the hierarchy based on goods and services, and Burgess's sector model is about urban structure.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check if there's another term that might fit better. For instance, is there something called Zipf's law related to city sizes? A quick recall tells me that Zipf's law is often associated with the rank-size rule, where the population of a city is inversely proportional to its rank. So, that reinforces that option B is the correct choice.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that none of the other options indirectly relate to this concept. For example, could the central place theory incorporate the rank-size rule? While central place theory does deal with urban hierarchy, its focus is more on the functions and services provided by cities rather than their population sizes in relation to their rank.\n\nSimilarly, the multiplier effect is economi"
