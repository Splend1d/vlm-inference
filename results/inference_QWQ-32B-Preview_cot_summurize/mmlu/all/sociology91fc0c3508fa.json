The options given are:\n\nA. movement into a different occupational category over a person's lifetime\n\nB. movement into different occupational categories between generations\n\nC. movement into a higher occupational category\n\nD. movement into an occupation that generates a lower income\n\nFirst, I need to know what \"inter-generational\" means. I think \"inter-\" means between, and \"generational\" refers to generations, so it's about changes between generations. Mobility probably refers to movement or changes in status.\n\nOption A talks about movement within a person's lifetime, but that sounds like intra-generational mobility, not inter-generational. Intra- means within, so that would be changes happening during one person's life.\n\nOption B says movement between generations, which matches the definition of inter-generational. So, it's about how occupations change from parents to children or across generations.\n\nOption C is about moving into a higher occupational category, which could be a type of mobility, but it's specifically upward mobility. Inter-generational mobility isn't just about moving up; it could be moving up or down.\n\nOption D is about moving into a lower-income occupation, which is downward mobility. Again, inter-generational mobility isn't limited to just downward movement.\n\nSo, considering that inter-generational mobility refers to changes in occupation or social status between generations, option B seems the most accurate.\n\nBut let me double-check. I recall that social mobility can be intra-generational or inter-generational. Intra-generational is about changes during one's lifetime, like starting as a clerk and becoming a manager. Inter-generational is about comparisons between parents and children or between different generations of a family.\n\nFor example, if parents are farmers and their children become teachers, that's inter-generational mobility because there's a change in occupation from one generation to the next.\n\nOption A describes intra-generational mobility because it's about changes within a person's working life.\n\nOption C is partial; it only describes upward mobility, but inter-generational mobility can be upward or downward.\n\nOption D only describes downward mobility in terms of income, but again, mobility can go both ways.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive and accurate definition is option B: movement into different occupational categories between generations.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, inter-generational mobility is about the differences in occupation or social status between parents and their children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
