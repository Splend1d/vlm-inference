I remember it has something to do with income distribution, but I need to recall exactly what it measures.\n\nOption A says it measures the ratio of income to wealth in different countries. Hmm, that sounds interesting, but I think income and wealth are different things. Income is what you earn, and wealth is what you own. So, maybe it's not directly about the ratio of income to wealth.\n\nOption B mentions the ratio of public goods to private goods in different countries. Public goods are things like parks and defense, while private goods are things like cars and houses. I don't think the Lorenz Curve is about that. It seems more focused on income distribution.\n\nOption C says it measures the ratio of income inequality to income equality in different countries. Now, this sounds promising. I know that the Lorenz Curve is used to represent income distribution and inequality. So, maybe this is the correct answer.\n\nOption D is about the ratio of the working poor to the non-working poor. While this is also related to economics and poverty, I don't recall the Lorenz Curve being used specifically for this purpose.\n\nLet me think again. The Lorenz Curve is a graphical representation of income distribution, where the x-axis represents the cumulative percentage of the population, and the y-axis represents the cumulative percentage of income. The curve shows how income is distributed across the population, and the further it is from the 45-degree line (which represents perfect equality), the greater the inequality.\n\nSo, given that, it's clearly about income inequality, which aligns with option C.\n\nWait a minute, option C says \"the ratio of income inequality to income equality.\" Is that accurate? Income inequality and equality are kind of opposites, so maybe it's not phrased perfectly. But overall, it's about measuring inequality in income distribution.\n\nI think among the given options, C is the closest to what the Lorenz Curve actually measures.\n\nLet me just double-check. Is there any other curve or index that measures the ratio of public goods to private goods, for example? I don't think so; that seems like a different concept.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of income to wealth is perhaps measured by something else, maybe a wealth-to-income ratio or something like that.\n\nAnd the ratio of working poor to non-working poor might be measured in some specific economic studies, but I don't think the Lorenz Curve is used for that purpose.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: The ratio of income inequality to income equality in different countries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
