                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which expression shows a prime factorization?\" And there are four options:\n\nA. 2 \u2022 9 \u2022 11\n\nB. 2.5 \u2022 7 \u2022 3\n\nC. 1 \u2022 11 \u2022 13\n\nD. 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 3 \u2022 11\n\nI need to figure out which one correctly represents a prime factorization. Let me start by understanding what a prime factorization is.\n\nPrime factorization means expressing a number as a product of prime numbers. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, in the factorization, all the factors should be prime.\n\nLet's look at option A: 2 \u2022 9 \u2022 11\n\nI know that 2 and 11 are prime numbers, but 9 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 1, 3, and 9. So, this isn't a complete prime factorization because 9 is not prime.\n\nOption B: 2.5 \u2022 7 \u2022 3\n\nHere, 7 and 3 are prime numbers, but 2.5 is not an integer, and prime factorization involves only integers. So, this can't be a correct prime factorization.\n\nOption C: 1 \u2022 11 \u2022 13\n\n11 and 13 are prime numbers, but 1 is not a prime number. In fact, 1 is not considered a prime number because it has only one positive divisor, which is itself. Prime numbers need to have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. So, including 1 in the factorization makes it incorrect for prime factorization.\n\nOption D: 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 3 \u2022 11\n\nAll of these numbers\u20142, 3, and 11\u2014are prime numbers. So, this seems like a valid prime factorization.\n\nBased on this analysis, it looks like option D is the correct one.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any other consideration I should be making here?\n\nI think I've covered the main points: all factors must be prime numbers, and they should be integers. Option D satisfies both of these conditions.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 3 \u2022 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
