I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: When I saw my neighbor's house was on fire, I rushed to the phone to call my long lost friend to chat.\n\nOkay, so here, the person sees a neighbor's house on fire, which is clearly an emergency situation, and instead of calling for help or doing something to assist, they choose to call a long lost friend to chat. That seems pretty irresponsible and selfish. In such a situation, the moral thing to do would be to call the fire department or alert someone who can help. Ignoring the emergency to have a chat seems wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I didn't know the answers to the exam, so my friend helped me study.\n\nThis one seems different. Here, the person didn't know the answers to the exam and their friend helped them study. Assuming that helping study is about learning the material, that seems acceptable. However, the phrasing is a bit vague. If \"helped me study\" means the friend provided assistance in understanding the material, that's fine. But if it implies something like giving answers during the exam or cheating, that would be wrong.\n\nBut based on the wording, \"helped me study,\" it sounds like the friend is assisting with learning before the exam, which is generally encouraged and not morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Morally wrong for not responding appropriately to an emergency.\n\n- Scenario 2: Not morally wrong, as helping someone study is a supportive act.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
