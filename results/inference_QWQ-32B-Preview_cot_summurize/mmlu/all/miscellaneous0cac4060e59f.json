                    "text": "The largest animal ever to live on Earth is the blue whale (option A). Blue whales can grow up to 100 feet (30 meters) in length and weigh as much as 200 tons (180 metric tons). They are even larger than the largest known dinosaur, the Argentinosaurus, which is estimated to have weighed around 77 tons (70 metric tons).\n\nGiant squids (option B) are indeed large creatures, reaching lengths of up to 43 feet (13 meters), but they are not as massive as blue whales. Woolly mammoths (option C) were large prehistoric elephants, standing about 10 to 12 feet (3 to 3.7 meters) tall at the shoulder and weighing up to 6 tons (5.4 metric tons). While impressive, they are much smaller than blue whales.\n\nTyrannosaurus (option D), often referred to as T. rex, was one of the largest land predators, measuring up to 40 feet (12 meters) in length and weighing up to 9 tons (8.2 metric tons). Again, this is significantly smaller than the blue whale.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. blue whale.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
