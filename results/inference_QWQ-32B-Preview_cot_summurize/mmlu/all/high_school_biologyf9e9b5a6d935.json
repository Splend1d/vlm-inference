                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about the endosymbiotic theory. I need to identify which option doesn't support the idea that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent, free-living prokaryotes that later became part of eukaryotic cells.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the endosymbiotic theory is all about. It suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated from ancient prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by a larger cell without being digested. Over time, these prokaryotes formed a symbiotic relationship with the host cell, eventually becoming organelles.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently of the eukaryotic host cell by a process similar to binary fission.\n\nI know that binary fission is how prokaryotes reproduce, so if mitochondria and chloroplasts divide in a similar way, that suggests they have retained their prokaryotic division mechanism, supporting the endosymbiotic theory.\n\nB. Mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes that more closely resemble those of bacteria than of eukaryotic cells.\n\nRibosomes in prokaryotes are different from those in eukaryotes, so if mitochondria and chloroplasts have bacterial-like ribosomes, that's another piece of evidence supporting their prokaryotic origin.\n\nC. Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.\n\nHmm, this one seems a bit tricky. The endosymbiotic theory suggests that these organelles have become integrated into the eukaryotic cell and depend on each other. While they do have some independent functions, they are also dependent on the host cell for certain processes, and the host cell relies on them for energy production and other functions. So, saying they function completely independently might not be accurate.\n\nD. Mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria have a single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins.\n\nProkaryotes typically have a single, circular chromosome without histones, and if mitochondria and chloroplasts also have this feature, it's another similarity supporting their prokaryotic origin.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems to be the one that doesn't fully align with the endosymbiotic theory. The theory proposes that these organelles have become integrated into the eukaryotic cell over time, retaining some independence but also developing interdependence with the host cell. So, saying they function completely independently doesn't accurately reflect their relationship with the host cell.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
