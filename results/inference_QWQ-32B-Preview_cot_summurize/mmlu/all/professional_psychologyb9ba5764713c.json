                    "text": "Let's see, I need to figure out which option describes a child with an insecure/anxious-avoidant pattern of attachment. I remember that attachment styles are categorized based on how children respond to separation and reunion with their primary caregivers, usually mothers.\n\nOption A says the child is very distressed when separated and remains anxious even when the mother returns. That sounds like they're having a hard time being soothed by the mother's return, which might be characteristic of an anxious-resistant or ambivalent attachment style, not avoidant.\n\nOption B says the child is more anxious when the mother is present than absent and resists contact when she returns. That seems unusual. Typically, children might be more anxious when the mother is absent. Resisting contact upon return could be a sign of distress, but \"more anxious when present than absent\" sounds like the child is stressed by the mother's presence. I'm not sure if that fits with avoidant attachment.\n\nOption C says the child is very distressed when separated but pulls away from the mother when she returns. This seems contradictory. If the child is distressed by separation but then avoids the mother when she comes back, it might indicate that the child wants comfort but also has some avoidance towards the mother. That could be a sign of an ambivalent or resistant attachment, but maybe not purely avoidant.\n\nOption D says the child shows little distress when separated and turns away from the mother when she returns. This sounds like the child isn't overly bothered by the separation and doesn't seek comfort or show much interest in the mother upon her return. That seems consistent with an avoidant attachment style, where the child appears not to need the mother as a source of security and comfort.\n\nWait, but the question specifies \"insecure/anxious-avoidant.\" So, it's a combination of insecure and anxious-avoidant. I need to make sure I understand what that means. Anxious-avoidant might suggest that the child has conflicting feelings of wanting to be close for security but also avoiding closeness due to anxiety.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n- A seems more ambivalent.\n\n- B is confusing; maybe disorganized attachment?\n\n- C is a mix of distress and avoidance, possibly ambivalent.\n\n- D is more avoidant, showing little distress and turning away.\n\nBut the question includes \"anxious,\" so maybe it's not purely avoidant. Maybe it's a style where the child is anxious about closeness but also avoids seeking comfort.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to recall the specific characteristics of anxious-avoidant attachment. I think in some models, anxious-avoidant is a subtype where children show both anxiety and avoidance in their attachment behavior.\n\nLooking at option C again: very distressed when separated but pulls away when the mother returns. That seems like the child is anxious about the separation but then avoids the very person who could provide comfort, maybe because of some inconsistency or unreliability in the mother's responses in the past.\n\nOption D shows little distress and turns away, which seems more like a secure avoidant attachment, not necessarily anxious.\n\nMaybe option C is the best fit for anxious-avoidant, as it shows both anxiety (distress at separation) and avoidance (pulling away upon reunion).\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit unsure because I recall that in some attachment theories, avoidant attachment is characterized by minimal distress at separation and avoidance upon reunion, with little anxiety.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that anxious-avoidant is a bit of a mix, where there is some anxiety but also a tendency to avoid closeness.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n- A is high anxiety both during separation and reunion, which seems more anxious-resistant.\n\n- B is more anxious when the mother is present, which is unusual and might not fit standard attachment categories.\n\n- C is distressed at separation but avoids upon reunion, showing both anxiety and avoidance.\n\n- D is low distress and avoids upon reunion, which seems more avoidant without the anxiety.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the best answer for insecure/anxious-avoidant attachment, as it demonstrates both anxiety (distress at separation) and avoidance (pulling away upon reunion).\n\nBut I should confirm this understanding. Maybe I should look up the specific characteristics of anxious-avoidant attachment.\n\nOkay, upon recalling, in some attachment theory models, particularly in Bowlby's and Ainsworth's work, there are main categories: secure, anxious-ambivalent, and avoidant. Later, classifications became more nuanced, including anxious-avoidant as a subtype.\n\nAnxious-avoidant children might show ambivalent signals: they want proximity but also resist it, showing a conflict between seeking comfort and avoiding closeness.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to capture that conflict: distress at separation indicating a need for comfort, but pulling away upon reunion indicating avoidance.\n\nOption D, showing little distress and turning away, seems more consistent with a dismissive-avoidant attachment, where the child doesn't really care about the mother's comings and goings.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: is very distressed when separated from his/her mother but pulls away from her when she returns.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
