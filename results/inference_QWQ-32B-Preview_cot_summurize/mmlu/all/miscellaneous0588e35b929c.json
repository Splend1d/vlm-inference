                    "text": "The colored part of the eye is called the iris. So, the correct answer is A. iris.\n\nLet me explain a bit more about the different parts of the eye to help you understand why the other options are not correct.\n\n- **Iris**: This is the colored ring-shaped membrane behind the cornea of the eye. It controls the size and diameter of the pupil and thus the amount of light reaching the retina. The color of the iris is what gives eyes their distinctive color, such as blue, brown, green, etc.\n\n- **Pupil**: This is the black circular opening in the center of the iris. It appears black because most of the light that enters the pupil is absorbed by the tissues inside the eye. The pupil doesn't have color; it just appears dark.\n\n- **Retina**: This is the light-sensitive layer of tissue lining the inner surface of the eye. It captures light and converts it into neural signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. The retina is not visible from the outside, so it's not the colored part you see.\n\n- **Cochlea**: This is actually part of the inner ear, not the eye. It's a spiral-shaped cavity in the bony labyrinth of the inner ear that is responsible for hearing. So, it's not related to the eye at all.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, A. iris is the correct answer for the colored part of the eye.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
