                    "text": "So I've got this question here about \"horse-race journalism.\" Let's see what that means first. I think horse-race journalism is when the media focuses on the competition aspect of politics, like who's leading in the polls, who's up, who's down, instead of really delving into the issues and what the politicians stand for. It's kind of like treating politics like a sport, where the main thing is who's winning or losing, rather than what's best for the public.\n\nOkay, so with that in mind, let's look at the options:\n\nA. A news story focuses on a politician's scandals rather than achievements.\n\nHmm, this seems more like tabloid journalism or something. It's about scandals, which might get lots of views or readership, but it's not specifically about the race or competition between candidates. So, maybe not the best fit for horse-race journalism.\n\nB. A television news anchor reports an event before the station's rivals.\n\nThis sounds more like competitive journalism, where stations try to be first to break a story. It's about being faster than other media outlets, but it doesn't necessarily focus on the race between political candidates. So, probably not the answer.\n\nC. A reporter announces which candidate leads in a public opinion poll.\n\nNow, this seems right. Horse-race journalism is all about who's ahead in the polls, who's gaining momentum, that sort of thing. It's treating the election like a horse race, where the main interest is who's going to win, not necessarily what the candidates are proposing.\n\nD. A newspaper editor prints stories about long-term political developments.\n\nThis sounds more like in-depth journalism, looking at trends and developments over time. That's the opposite of horse-race journalism, which is more short-term and focused on the immediate competition.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the best answer is C. The reporter announcing who's leading in the polls is a classic example of horse-race journalism.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. Horse-race journalism is about treating politics like a contest, focusing on the competition between candidates, often relying on polls and predictions. Option C directly involves reporting on who's leading in polls, which is exactly that.\n\nOption A is more about sensationalism, option B is about media competition, option D is about long-term analysis, whereas option C is purely about the race aspect of politics.\n\nYeah, I'm confident with C as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
