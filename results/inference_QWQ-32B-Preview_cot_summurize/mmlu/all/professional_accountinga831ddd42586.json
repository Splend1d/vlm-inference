                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving Jackson and Sands, and I need to figure out if a contract was formed between them based on their communications about buying electric fans. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, on day 1, Jackson sends Sands a signed letter offering to sell him 500 electric fans at $10 each. Sands receives this letter on day 3. So, the offer is out there, and Sands knows about it by day 3.\n\nNow, the letter promises not to revoke the offer, but it doesn't specify an expiration date. That seems a bit tricky because usually, offers can be revoked before acceptance, but here, Jackson promised not to revoke it.\n\nThen, on day 4, Jackson changes his mind and sends a revocation letter to Sands, which Sands receives on day 6. So, Sands has now received both the original offer and the revocation.\n\nAfter that, on day 7, Sands decides to accept the original offer and mails an acceptance to Jackson. Jackson receives this acceptance on day 9.\n\nThe question is, under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 2, which deals with sales, was a contract formed?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No contract was formed because the offer failed to state an expiration date.\n\nB. No contract was formed because Sands received the revocation of the offer before Sands accepted the offer.\n\nC. A contract was formed on the day Jackson received Sands\u2019 acceptance.\n\nD. A contract was formed on the day Sands mailed the acceptance to Jackson.\n\nOkay, starting with option A, it says no contract was formed because the offer failed to state an expiration date. But in the UCC, particularly in Section 2-205, it talks about the revocation of offers. It seems like not having an expiration date doesn't necessarily prevent a contract from forming, especially since the offer promised not to be revoked.\n\nOption B says no contract was formed because Sands received the revocation before he accepted the offer. This seems important. Generally, if an offer is revoked before acceptance, the offer is no longer valid. But here, the offer promised not to be revoked. So, maybe that changes things.\n\nOption C says a contract was formed on the day Jackson received Sands\u2019 acceptance. This would be the mailbox rule, where the acceptance is effective when received by the offeror.\n\nOption D says a contract was formed on the day Sands mailed the acceptance to Jackson. This is also part of the mailbox rule, where acceptance is effective when dispatched, but under the UCC, it's usually when received.\n\nBut let's dig deeper into the UCC provisions.\n\nFirst, Section 2-205 deals with the revocation of offers. It states that an offer cannot be revoked if it indicates that it will remain open for a specified period of time, and the offeror receives reasonable compensation for promising to keep the offer open.\n\nIn this case, the offer promised not to be revoked but didn't specify an expiration date or mention any compensation. So, it's a bit unclear.\n\nHowever, Section 2-205(1) says: \"An option contract for the purchase or sale of goods may be created by an irrevocable offer if the requirements of Subsection (2) are met.\"\n\nSubsection (2) requires that the offeror must receive consideration for the promise to keep the offer open.\n\nIn this scenario, there's no mention of any consideration being provided by Sands to Jackson for keeping the offer open. So, perhaps the promise not to revoke the offer isn't enforceable because there's no consideration.\n\nIf that's the case, then Jackson could revoke the offer, and since Sands received the revocation before sending his acceptance, the acceptance would be ineffective.\n\nBut Sands sent the acceptance anyway, and Jackson received it after the revocation.\n\nSo, under these circumstances, did a contract form?\n\nLooking back at the UCC, Section 2-205(2)(b) provides that an offer that purports to be irrevocable but is not supported by consideration can be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance, but not otherwise.\n\nIn this case, the offer purported to be irrevocable but didn't provide any consideration. So, Jackson could revoke it at any time before acceptance.\n\nSands received the revocation on day 6, before he sent his acceptance on day 7. So, arguably, the offer was revoked before acceptance.\n\nHowever, Sands went ahead and accepted it anyway, and Jackson received the acceptance on day 9.\n\nNow, does the acceptance have any effect after the revocation has been received?\n\nUnder Section 2-206, \"Formation of contract; acceptance; consideration,\" it states that acceptance must be made in a manner invited by the offer or, if not so invited, in a manner otherwise reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nBut it doesn't specifically address the scenario where an offer is revoked before acceptance.\n\nSection 2-207 talks about additional terms in acceptance, but that's not directly relevant here.\n\nPerhaps I need to look at the common law principles behind contract formation.\n\nIn common law, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance, as long as the revocation is communicated to the offeree before acceptance.\n\nIn this case, the revocation was communicated to Sands before he sent his acceptance. So, under common law, the offer was revoked, and Sands' later acceptance would have no effect.\n\nBut since this is governed by the UCC, I need to see if there are any differences.\n\nSection 2-206(1) says: \"A contract for the sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.\"\n\nBut it doesn't override the revocation rules in Section 2-205.\n\nFurthermore, Section 2-205(2)(c) says: \"An irrevocable offer which does not meet the requirements of Subsection (2) loses its irrevocability on the expiration of a reasonable time not exceeding three months.\"\n\nBut in this case, the offer didn't meet the requirements because there was no consideration.\n\nSo, perhaps the offer was revocable, and Jackson did revoke it before Sands accepted it.\n\nTherefore, Sands' acceptance would have no effect, and no contract was formed.\n\nBut option B seems to suggest that no contract was formed because Sands received the revocation before accepting, which aligns with this reasoning.\n\nHowever, option C says a contract was formed on the day Jackson received Sands\u2019 acceptance.\n\nIf we consider that the acceptance was effective upon receipt, despite the revocation, then a contract would have been formed.\n\nBut based on my earlier analysis, it seems that the revocation invalidates the offer before acceptance, so the acceptance shouldn't be effective.\n\nWait, but under Section 2-206(2), \"An acceptance is effective upon dispatch if the method of acceptance invited by the offer prescribes a method of transmission of acceptance which starts its effect upon dispatch.\"\n\nIn this case, the offer didn't specify any particular method of acceptance, so perhaps the general rule applies, which is that acceptance is effective upon receipt.\n\nSo, Jackson received the acceptance on day 9.\n\nBut again, if the offer was revoked before acceptance, then the acceptance wouldn't be effective.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider the promise not to revoke the offer.\n\nThe offer promised not to be revoked, but without consideration, that promise might not be enforceable.\n\nUnder common law, for a option contract to be enforceable, there needs to be consideration for the promise to keep the offer open.\n\nIn this case, there's no mention of any consideration being provided by Sands to Jackson for keeping the offer open.\n\nTherefore, the promise not to revoke might be unenforceable, allowing Jackson to revoke the offer.\n\nThus, since Sands received the revocation before accepting, the offer was no longer valid, and acceptance would have no effect.\n\nTherefore, no contract was formed.\n\nSo, option B seems correct: No contract was formed because Sands received the revocation of the offer before Sands accepted the offer.\n\nBut let's consider option D: A contract was formed on the day Sands mailed the acceptance to Jackson.\n\nIf we were to apply the mailbox rule, where acceptance is effective when dispatched, then perhaps a contract was formed on day 7 when Sands mailed the acceptance.\n\nHowever, under the UCC, particularly in sales of goods, the mailbox rule doesn't apply in the same way as in common law.\n\nSection 2-206 doesn't explicitly adopt the mailbox rule.\n\nIn fact, Section 2-206(1) just says that acceptance must be made in a manner invited by the offer or in a manner otherwise reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the UCC tends to favor a more practical approach, it's possible that acceptance is effective when received.\n\nTherefore, even if Sands mailed the acceptance on day 7, it wouldn't be effective until Jackson received it on day 9.\n\nBut again, if the offer was revoked before acceptance, then the acceptance wouldn't be effective.\n\nWait, but when did Jackson revoke the offer? He sent the revocation on day 4, and Sands received it on day 6.\n\nSo, Sands received the revocation on day 6, and then sent acceptance on day 7.\n\nSo, from Sands' perspective, he might argue that he didn't know about the revocation when he sent the acceptance, but in reality, he had received the revocation before sending the acceptance.\n\nHowever, perhaps there are rules about when the revocation is effective.\n\nUnder Section 2-206(2), it talks about acceptance being effective upon dispatch only if the offer prescribes a method of acceptance that starts its effect upon dispatch.\n\nIn this case, the offer didn't prescribe any particular method, so perhaps acceptance is effective upon receipt.\n\nTherefore, Jackson received the acceptance on day 9, but by that time, the offer had already been revoked.\n\nSo, no contract was formed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the acceptance could be considered as being effective before the revocation, but that doesn't make sense because Sands received the revocation on day 6, before he sent the acceptance on day 7.\n\nWait, no, Sands received the revocation on day 6, then sent acceptance on day 7.\n\nSo, from Sands' standpoint, he's accepting an offer that he knew was revoked, which doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, no contract was formed.\n\nThus, option B is correct: No contract was formed because Sands received the revocation of the offer before Sands accepted the offer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the lack of an expiration date doesn't prevent the formation of a contract; it's the revocation that's the issue here.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, even though Jackson received the acceptance on day 9, the offer had already been revoked before Sands accepted it.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, under the UCC, acceptance is generally effective upon receipt, not dispatch, especially when the offer doesn't specify otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
