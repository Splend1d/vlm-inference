(\u2203x)(Wx \u2228 Sx)\n\nB. (\u2203x)(Sx \u2228 Wx)\n\nC. (\u2203x)(Sx \u2022 Wx)\n\nD. (\u2203x)(Sx \u2283 Wx)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"some students work hard\" means in logical terms. \"Some\" typically translates to the existential quantifier, which is (\u2203x), meaning \"there exists at least one x such that...\" So, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to define the predicates. Let's assume that Sx means \"x is a student\" and Wx means \"x works hard.\" So, the statement is saying that there exists at least one x that is a student and works hard.\n\nLooking at option A: (\u2203x)(Wx \u2228 Sx). This translates to \"There exists an x such that x works hard or x is a student.\" But that's not quite the same as saying some students work hard. This could be true for someone who is either a student or works hard, but not necessarily both.\n\nOption B: (\u2203x)(Sx \u2228 Wx). This is similar to A, just with the order switched. It still means \"there exists an x such that x is a student or x works hard.\" Again, not specifying that there are students who work hard.\n\nOption C: (\u2203x)(Sx \u2022 Wx). Here, \"\u2022\" typically means \"and.\" So, this translates to \"There exists an x such that x is a student and x works hard.\" That sounds exactly like \"some students work hard.\"\n\nOption D: (\u2203x)(Sx \u2283 Wx). \"\u2283\" usually means \"implies.\" So, this would be \"There exists an x such that if x is a student, then x works hard.\" This is different from the original statement. This would mean that there is at least one x for which, if it's a student, it works hard. But it could be that x is not a student, and the implication still holds trivially.\n\nSo, comparing all these, option C seems to be the best translation of \"some students work hard\" into predicate logic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
