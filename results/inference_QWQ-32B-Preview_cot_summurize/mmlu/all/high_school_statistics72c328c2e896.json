                    "text": "Let's see. The company has three investment options, and I need to figure out which one is best under different circumstances. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's Option I, which gives a sure $25,000 return. That means no risk; they get exactly $25,000.\n\nOption II has a 50% chance of returning $50,000 and a 50% chance of returning $10,000. So, it's risky. They could get a higher return or a lower one, depending on luck.\n\nOption III offers a 5% chance of getting $100,000 and a 95% chance of getting nothing. This seems like a high-risk, high-reward option.\n\nNow, the question presents four statements, and I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nOption A says: \"Option II if it wants to maximize expected return.\"\n\nTo check this, I need to calculate the expected return for each option.\n\nFor Option I, since it's a sure $25,000, the expected return is $25,000.\n\nFor Option II, it's 50% chance of $50,000 plus 50% chance of $10,000. So, expected return is (0.5 * $50,000) + (0.5 * $10,000) = $25,000 + $5,000 = $30,000.\n\nFor Option III, it's 5% chance of $100,000 plus 95% chance of $0. So, expected return is (0.05 * $100,000) + (0.95 * $0) = $5,000 + $0 = $5,000.\n\nComparing the expected returns: Option I ($25,000), Option II ($30,000), Option III ($5,000). So, if the company wants to maximize the expected return, it should choose Option II, which aligns with statement A.\n\nNext, statement B says: \"Option I if it needs at least $20,000 to pay off an overdue loan.\"\n\nSo, if the company needs at least $20,000 to pay off a loan, which option should they choose?\n\nOption I gives $25,000, which is above $20,000, so that meets the requirement.\n\nOption II has a 50% chance of giving $50,000 and 50% chance of giving $10,000. $10,000 is below $20,000, so there's a risk of not meeting the requirement.\n\nOption III has a 95% chance of giving $0, which is way below $20,000, so that's not reliable for meeting the loan payment.\n\nTherefore, if the company needs to ensure it gets at least $20,000, Option I is the safest choice, as it guarantees $25,000, which is above $20,000. So, statement B seems correct.\n\nNow, statement C says: \"Option III if it needs at least $80,000 to pay off an overdue loan.\"\n\nIf the company needs at least $80,000, let's see which option can provide that.\n\nOption I gives $25,000, which is less than $80,000.\n\nOption II gives either $50,000 or $10,000, both of which are less than $80,000.\n\nOption III gives a 5% chance of $100,000, which is above $80,000, and a 95% chance of $0.\n\nSo, if the company needs at least $80,000 and is willing to take a risk, Option III might be the only viable option, even though there's a high probability of getting nothing.\n\nHowever, it's a risky choice because there's only a 5% chance of getting the required amount.\n\nBut given that it's the only option that can provide more than $80,000, statement C seems correct as well.\n\nFinally, statement D says: \"All of the above answers are correct.\"\n\nGiven that statements A, B, and C seem correct based on my analysis, statement D should be correct.\n\nBut I should double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n- For maximizing expected return, Option II is the best.\n\n- For needing at least $20,000 with certainty, Option I is the way to go.\n\n- For needing at least $80,000, Option III is the only one that can provide that, albeit with high risk.\n\nAll these statements seem logically consistent with the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above answers are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
