The invention of fireworks is often attributed to the Chinese, who discovered that igniting certain substances could produce colorful explosions and loud noises. These early fireworks were used for various purposes, including religious ceremonies, celebrations, and even as a form of entertainment for emperors and nobles.\n\nOver time, the use of fireworks spread to other parts of the world, including Europe, where they became popular during festivals and special events. Today, fireworks are an integral part of many cultural and national celebrations around the globe.\n\n**Reference:**\n- Needham, J.
