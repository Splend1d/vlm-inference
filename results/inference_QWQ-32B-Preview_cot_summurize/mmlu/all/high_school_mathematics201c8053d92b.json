                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two positive even integers less than 15, and we can use the same number twice if needed. So, first things first, let's list out all the positive even integers less than 15.\n\nThe even integers less than 15 are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. So there are 7 possible numbers.\n\nNow, we need to consider all possible pairs of these numbers, including pairs where both numbers are the same, since the problem says \"not necessarily distinct.\" So, the total number of possible pairs is 7 choices for the first number and 7 for the second, which is 49 pairs in total. But we have to consider that the order might not matter here, because adding and multiplying is commutative, meaning x + y is the same as y + x, and x * y is the same as y * x. So, perhaps some of these 49 pairs will give the same result, and we need to find out how many unique results we can get.\n\nLet's denote the two numbers as x and y. We need to find the number of different possible values of x + y + x*y.\n\nOne way to approach this is to fix one of the numbers and see how the expression changes with the other number. Let's fix x and see how the expression varies as y changes.\n\nSo, for a fixed x, the expression is:\n\nx + y + x*y = x + y(1 + x)\n\nThis shows that for a fixed x, the expression is linear in y.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to think about this. Let's consider factoring the expression.\n\nx + y + x*y = x + y(1 + x) = x(1 + y) + y = x(1 + y) + y(1) = (x + 1)(y) + x\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can rearrange the expression differently.\n\nWait, what if I add 1 to the expression and factor?\n\nx + y + x*y + 1 = (x + 1)(y + 1)\n\nSo, x + y + x*y = (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1\n\nThat's interesting! So, the expression x + y + x*y is equal to (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1.\n\nThis might simplify things. Now, instead of dealing with x + y + x*y, I can deal with (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1.\n\nSo, for each pair of x and y, I can compute (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1 and see what unique values I get.\n\nLet's list out all possible values of (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1 for x and y in {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}.\n\nFirst, let's compute x + 1 for each x:\n\nx | x + 1\n\n---|------\n\n2 | 3\n\n4 | 5\n\n6 | 7\n\n8 | 9\n\n10 | 11\n\n12 | 13\n\n14 | 15\n\nSo, x + 1 ranges from 3 to 15 in steps of 2.\n\nSimilarly, y + 1 ranges from 3 to 15 in steps of 2.\n\nNow, we need to find all possible products of two numbers from {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}, and then subtract 1 from each product to get the expression's value.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct products of two numbers from the set {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}, and then subtracting 1 from each product.\n\nSince subtraction by 1 is a one-to-one operation, the number of distinct products will be the same as the number of distinct values of the expression.\n\nTherefore, we need to find how many distinct products there are when multiplying any two numbers from {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}, considering that order doesn't matter (since multiplication is commutative).\n\nLet's list out all possible products:\n\nFirst, list all possible pairs (a, b) where a and b are in {3,5,7,9,11,13,15}, and a \u2264 b to avoid duplicates.\n\nThen compute a * b for each pair.\n\nLet's list them systematically:\n\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n\n- 3 * 5 = 15\n\n- 3 * 7 = 21\n\n- 3 * 9 = 27\n\n- 3 * 11 = 33\n\n- 3 * 13 = 39\n\n- 3 * 15 = 45\n\n- 5 * 5 = 25\n\n- 5 * 7 = 35\n\n- 5 * 9 = 45\n\n- 5 * 11 = 55\n\n- 5 * 13 = 65\n\n- 5 * 15 = 75\n\n- 7 * 7 = 49\n\n- 7 * 9 = 63\n\n- 7 * 11 = 77\n\n- 7 * 13 = 91\n\n- 7 * 15 = 105\n\n- 9 * 9 = 81\n\n- 9 * 11 = 99\n\n- 9 * 13 = 117\n\n- 9 * 15 = 135\n\n- 11 * 11 = 121\n\n- 11 * 13 = 143\n\n- 11 * 15 = 165\n\n- 13 * 13 = 169\n\n- 13 * 15 = 195\n\n- 15 * 15 = 225\n\nNow, let's list all these products:\n\n9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, 35, 39, 45, 49, 55, 63, 65, 75, 77, 81, 91, 99, 105, 117, 121, 135, 143, 165, 169, 195, 225.\n\nNow, we need to check if there are any duplicate products in this list.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- 45 appears twice: from 3*15 and 5*9.\n\n- All other products seem unique.\n\nSo, out of the 28 possible products (since there are 7 choose 2 plus 7 choose 1 with repetition), we have one duplicate, which is 45.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct products is 28 - 1 = 27.\n\nSince each distinct product corresponds to a distinct value of the expression x + y + x*y, the number of different possible values is 27.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 27.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check to make sure there are no other duplicates that I might have missed.\n\nLooking again at the list:\n\n9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, 35, 39, 45, 49, 55, 63, 65, 75, 77, 81, 91, 99, 105, 117, 121, 135, 143, 165, 169, 195, 225.\n\nAre there any other duplicates here?\n\n- 45 appears twice.\n\n- 75 appears once (from 5*15).\n\n- 105 appears once (from 7*15).\n\n- 135 appears once (from 9*15).\n\n- Etc.\n\nSo, indeed, only one duplicate, which is 45.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct products is 28 - 1 = 27.\n\nHence, the number of different possible values of the expression is 27.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 27.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]"
