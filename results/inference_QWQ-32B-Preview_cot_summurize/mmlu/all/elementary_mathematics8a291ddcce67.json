Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I could try dividing 942 by 3 directly. I'm pretty comfortable with division, so let's give it a shot.\n\nStarting with 9 divided by 3. 9 divided by 3 is 3. So, the first digit of my quotient is 3.\n\nNext, I have 4 left. 3 goes into 4 once, because 3 times 1 is 3, which is less than 4. So, I write 1 after the 3, making it 31.\n\nNow, subtract 3 times 1, which is 3, from 4, and I get 1.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 12.\n\nNow, 3 goes into 12 four times, because 3 times 4 is 12.\n\nSo, I write 4 after the 1, making the quotient 314.\n\nAnd 12 minus 12 is 0, so there's no remainder.\n\nSo, 942 divided by 3 is 314.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 314 is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply 314 by 3 to see if I get back to 942.\n\n314 times 3:\n\n4 times 3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n1 times 3 is 3, plus the carried over 1 is 4.\n\n3 times 3 is 9.\n\nSo, 314 times 3 is indeed 942.\n\nAlright, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the options and see which one makes sense.\n\nOption A is 214. If I multiply 214 by 3, that's 642, which is less than 942. So, too small.\n\nOption B is 304. 3 times 304 is 912, which is less than 942.\n\nOption C is 314, which we've already checked and it works.\n\nOption D is 642. 3 times 642 is 1926, which is way more than 942.\n\nSo, again, option C is the correct choice.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
