It is an example of nonresponse bias, the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to refuse to answer a survey question.\nB. It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons.\nC.

A newspaper did a survey and found that 58% of respondents were against the annexation. But when it came to the actual vote, only 56% of those who voted were against it. Now, the question is asking about the difference between these two percentages and which option best describes that difference.\n\nOption A talks about nonresponse bias, which is when certain types of people are less likely to respond to a survey, and that affects the results systematically. So, if certain groups were not answering the newspaper survey, that could skew the results.\n\nOption B mentions systematic difference due to nonrandom selection of surveyed persons. This sounds a lot like selection bias, where the sample doesn't represent the population because of how the sample was chosen.\n\nOption C is about the difference between the same statistics from two different samples. That could happen due to sampling variability, but in this case, we have a survey and a vote, which might not be two random samples.\n\nOption D is about the difference between a statistic and a parameter due to using a random sample. This sounds like sampling error.\n\nSo, let's think about what's going on here. The newspaper survey is one way of gauging public opinion, and the actual vote is another. The percentages are different: 58% against in the survey versus 56% against in the vote.\n\nFirst, the survey is probably a voluntary response survey, where people choose to respond to the newspaper's poll. This type of survey is known to have biases because the people who choose to respond might have stronger opinions or be more interested in the topic than the general population.\n\nThe actual vote, on the other hand, is a vote by eligible voters who choose to participate in the election. Again, not all eligible voters vote, so there might be a voting bias where certain groups are more likely to vote than others.\n\nSo, the difference between 58% and 56% could be due to different biases in who responds to the survey versus who votes.\n\nOption A mentions nonresponse bias, which is relevant to the survey, but the vote also has its own form of nonresponse, since not everyone votes.\n\nOption B talks about systematic difference due to nonrandom selection, which could apply to both the survey and the vote.\n\nOption C is about differences between two samples, but in this case, it's not two random samples; it's a survey and a vote, which have different mechanisms for selecting participants.\n\nOption D is about the difference due to using a random sample, but neither the survey nor the vote is necessarily a random sample.\n\nConsidering all this, Option B seems the most appropriate because both the survey and the vote involve nonrandom selection of participants, leading to potential biases in who is included in each.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B: It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
