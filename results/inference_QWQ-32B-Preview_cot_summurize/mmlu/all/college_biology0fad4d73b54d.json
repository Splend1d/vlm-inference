                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about a sarcomere in striated muscle is correct. Sarcomeres are the basic unit of muscle contraction, and they have these repeating patterns that give muscle its striated appearance. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"During contraction, H zones become elongated.\" Hmm, I think I need to recall what happens during muscle contraction. In a sarcomere, there are different regions: the A band, I band, H zone, and Z lines. When the muscle contracts, the filaments slide over each other, right? The actin filaments slide towards the center of the sarcomere, overlapping more with the myosin filaments. I think the H zone, which is the central part of the A band that doesn't have actin filaments, should get narrower or even disappear in a fully contracted muscle. So, if it's getting narrower, that means it's shrinking, not elongating. Therefore, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: \"In the relaxed position, tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.\" Okay, tropomyosin is a protein that wraps around the actin filaments. Its position can block the myosin binding sites on actin, preventing the myosin heads from attaching. In the relaxed state, tropomyosin is in a position that blocks these sites, and calcium ions are needed to move tropomyosin out of the way, allowing myosin to bind to actin. So, this statement seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"Each myosin helical tail contains an actinbinding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site.\" Myosin is a motor protein with a head and a tail. The head has the actin-binding site and the ATPase activity, which is responsible for hydrolyzing ATP to provide energy for movement. The tail is often filamentous and can form part of the thick filament in muscle. So, it's the head of myosin that has these sites, not the helical tail. Therefore, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively.\" Let's recall: in muscle sarcomeres, the thick filaments are made of myosin, and the thin filaments are made of actin, with troponin and tropomyosin associated with them. Troponin and tropomyosin are regulatory proteins attached to the actin filaments, not constituting the filaments themselves. So, this statement is also incorrect.\n\nBased on this reasoning, option B seems to be the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
