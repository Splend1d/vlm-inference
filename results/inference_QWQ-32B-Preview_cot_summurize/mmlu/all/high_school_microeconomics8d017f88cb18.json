                    "text": "So, I've got this economics problem here. It's about apples and their market equilibrium. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, the market for apples is in equilibrium. That means supply and demand are balanced, right? So, the quantity of apples supplied by growers matches the quantity that consumers want to buy at the current price.\n\nNow, two things happen:\n\n1. Apple growers are using more pesticides to increase apple production.\n\n2. The price of pears, which are a substitute for apples, is rising.\n\nI need to predict what will happen to the price and quantity of apples based on these changes.\n\nLet's tackle the first change: growers using more pesticides to increase production. If they're using more pesticides to boost production, that probably means the supply of apples is increasing. More apples are being produced, so the supply curve should shift to the right.\n\nIn a standard supply and demand model, if supply increases while demand stays the same, the equilibrium price decreases, and the equilibrium quantity increases.\n\nSo, from this change alone, I'd expect the price of apples to fall and the quantity to rise.\n\nBut there's a second change: the price of pears is rising. Pears are a substitute for apples, meaning that if pears get more expensive, some consumers might switch to buying apples instead.\n\nIf the price of a substitute good rises, the demand for the original good increases. So, the demand curve for apples should shift to the right.\n\nAgain, in a standard model, if demand increases while supply stays the same, the equilibrium price rises, and the equilibrium quantity increases.\n\nSo, from this change alone, I'd expect the price of apples to rise and the quantity to rise.\n\nBut here's the thing: both changes are happening at the same time. Supply is increasing (which tends to lower price and raise quantity), and demand is also increasing (which tends to raise both price and quantity).\n\nSo, the effects on quantity are both positive, meaning quantity should increase overall.\n\nBut the effects on price are conflicting: one suggests a decrease, and the other suggests an increase.\n\nTherefore, the net effect on price is ambiguous. It could go either way depending on which effect is stronger.\n\nSimilarly, for quantity, both effects suggest an increase, so quantity should rise.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that.\n\nIn the first scenario, supply increases, which increases quantity.\n\nIn the second scenario, demand increases, which also increases quantity.\n\nSo, yes, quantity should increase.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for a reasonable prediction for the new price and quantity of apples, and the options are:\n\nA. Price rises, but quantity is ambiguous.\n\nB. Price falls, but quantity is ambiguous.\n\nC. Price is ambiguous, but quantity rises.\n\nD. Price is ambiguous, but quantity falls.\n\nGiven our analysis, quantity should rise, and price is ambiguous.\n\nBut option C says \"price is ambiguous, but quantity rises,\" which matches our conclusion.\n\nHowever, let's make sure that quantity is definitely rising.\n\nIs there any scenario where quantity wouldn't rise when both supply and demand increase?\n\nWell, usually, quantity increases when both supply and demand increase.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5 where that might not hold.\n\nIn standard models, with linear supply and demand curves, if both supply and demand increase, quantity increases, and price could either rise or fall, depending on the magnitudes of the shifts.\n\nBut perhaps with non-linear curves, there could be exceptions.\n\nBut at an introductory level, we generally assume linear relationships, so quantity should increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: price is ambiguous, but quantity rises.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"which of the following is a reasonable prediction for the new price and quantity of apples?\"\n\nAnd option C matches our analysis.\n\nBut let's see if another option could be plausible.\n\nOption A says price rises, but quantity is ambiguous.\n\nBut in our analysis, price is ambiguous, and quantity rises.\n\nOption B says price falls, but quantity is ambiguous.\n\nAgain, our analysis suggests price is ambiguous, quantity rises.\n\nOption D says price is ambiguous, but quantity falls.\n\nThat directly contradicts our analysis.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be extra sure, let's think about why price is ambiguous.\n\nPrice ambiguity arises because the effect of increased supply tends to lower price, while the effect of increased demand tends to raise price.\n\nUnless we know the relative magnitudes of these shifts, we can't definitively say whether price will rise or fall.\n\nIt's possible that if supply increases a lot more than demand, price might fall.\n\nAlternatively, if demand increases a lot more than supply, price might rise.\n\nOr, they could offset each other, leading to no change in price.\n\nTherefore, price is indeed ambiguous.\n\nQuantity, on the other hand, increases in both cases, so it's not ambiguous.\n\nHence, option C is the most reasonable prediction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
