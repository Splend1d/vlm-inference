I remember that in Jewish tradition, burial is supposed to happen as soon as possible after death, preferably on the same day, but not after sundown. I think other religions have different practices. For example, in Islam, burial is also important, but I'm not sure if it's the same as in Judaism. Hindu funerals usually involve cremation, and I think there are specific rituals and timings for that, but maybe not the same urgency as in Judaism. Taoism, I'm less familiar with, but I don't think it has the same rapid disposal practice. So, I'm going with Jewish.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
