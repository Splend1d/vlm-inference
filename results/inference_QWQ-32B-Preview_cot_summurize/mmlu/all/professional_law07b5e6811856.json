                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario: a shopper falls at the mall, gets hurt, and sues the mall owner for negligence. At the trial, the shopper's housekeeper takes the stand and says that the shopper was bedridden and couldn't work for a month due to a sprained back from the fall. Also, about a week after coming home from the hospital, the shopper told the housekeeper, \"My back is really killing me. The pain is excruciating. It'll be a miracle if I can ever stand up again.\" Then, the mall's lawyer moves to strike this testimony. We need to decide whether the motion should be granted or not, and why.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening here. The housekeeper is testifying about the shopper's condition after the fall and also repeating something the shopper said to her about the pain. The mall's counsel is trying to get this testimony removed from the record, probably because they think it's hearsay or somehow inadmissible.\n\nHearsay is a statement made outside of the courtroom that's being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Generally, hearsay is not allowed because it's considered unreliable. However, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule where certain statements are admissible.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Granted, because the housekeeper's testimony is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nB. Granted, because the housekeeper's testimony would be self-serving.\n\nC. Denied, because the housekeeper's testimony would be admissible as an adoptive admission.\n\nD. Denied, because the shopper's statement to her housekeeper would be admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nLet's break this down.\n\nOption A suggests that the testimony is hearsay without any exception. But we need to see if the shopper's statement to the housekeeper fits into any hearsay exception.\n\nOption B says it should be granted because the testimony is self-serving. Self-serving testimony is when someone testifies in a way that supports their own interest, but this isn't necessarily a reason to exclude evidence, especially if it's relevant and reliable.\n\nOption C says the motion should be denied because the testimony is an adoptive admission. Adoptive admissions are statements by someone else that the party against whom it's offered impliedly adopts or accepts as true. But in this case, the shopper is the one making the statement to the housekeeper, and she's the plaintiff. So, it's her own statement, not someone else's that she's adopting.\n\nOption D suggests denying the motion because the statement is a declaration of present bodily condition, which is a hearsay exception.\n\nLet's focus on option D. Declarations of present bodily condition are admissible under the hearsay exception because they are considered reliable, especially when made spontaneously and without time to fabricate.\n\nIn this case, the shopper told the housekeeper, \"My back is really killing me. The pain is excruciating. It'll be a miracle if I can ever stand up again.\" This sounds like a statement about her current physical condition and pain level. If this was said shortly after the incident, it could be considered a declaration of present sensation or bodily condition.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the statement includes an element of future prognosis (\"It'll be a miracle if I can ever stand up again.\"), which might not strictly fall under present bodily condition. But overall, the statement seems to be about her current state of pain and disability.\n\nAdditionally, the housekeeper also testified about the shopper being bedridden and unable to work for a month. This part might be hearsay unless it falls under another exception, like present sense impression or medical diagnosis/treatment, but that's not specified here.\n\nGiven that, option D seems plausible, but let's consider if there are other exceptions that might apply.\n\nOption C mentions adoptive admission, but as I thought earlier, that doesn't seem to fit because the statement is directly from the plaintiff to her housekeeper.\n\nOption B about self-serving testimony isn't typically a basis for excluding evidence; rather, the credibility of the testimony can be challenged during cross-examination.\n\nOption A is a possibility, but only if no exceptions apply.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option D is the most appropriate: the motion should be denied because the shopper's statement to her housekeeper would be admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's think about whether the statement is really a declaration of present condition. The statement includes \"My back is really killing me. The pain is excruciating.\" which clearly relates to her current sensation. The part about \"It'll be a miracle if I can ever stand up again\" might be considered a statement about future expectations or prognosis, which might not fall under the present bodily condition exception.\n\nBut in many jurisdictions, statements about present sensations, including pain and disability, are admissible under this exception. The future-oriented part might be considered too speculative and possibly excluded, but the core of the statement seems admissible.\n\nMoreover, the housekeeper's testimony about the shopper being bedridden and unable to work for a month might be considered hearsay unless it's offered for some other purpose, like the shopper's state of mind or to show the need for care, but that's a bit more nuanced.\n\nGiven that, I think the motion to strike should be denied regarding the shopper's statement about her current pain and condition, making option D the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
