The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the landowner and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the landowner and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the landowner's death, his estate is required to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The deed for the remaining 250-acre parcel contained the identical restrictions as the deeds to the other three parcels. The investor, ignoring these restrictions, was able to use his political influence to persuade the county zoning board to rezone the said parcel for commercial use.

It's a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, there's a landowner who can't farm his 1,000 acres anymore, so he decides to sell some of it in 250-acre parcels. The president of a development company buys three of these four parcels. The original deed has a restriction that any further subdivisions must be into minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwellings, and it binds all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns.\n\nFirst, the development company subdivides two of the parcels into three, four, and five-acre lots and builds homes there, which is phase 1. The deeds to the phase 1 homeowners include the original restrictions.\n\nThen, two years later, the president sells the third parcel to a contractor, who subdivides it into one-acre lots for single-family dwellings, which is phase 2. However, the deeds to phase 2 homeowners don't mention the two-acre minimum restriction.\n\nMeanwhile, after the landowner dies, his estate sells the last 250-acre parcel, and the buyer is an investor who wants to build a two-level shopping center. The deed to this parcel also has the same two-acre minimum restriction, but the investor gets the zoning changed to commercial use.\n\nNow, the residents of phase 1 want to stop the construction of the shopping center. The question is about their chances of success.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Little chance of preventing the projected commercial development.\n\nB. No standing to enjoin the construction of the shopping center.\n\nC. No chance of succeeding, because the zoning ordinance takes precedence over the covenant running with the land.\n\nD. Success in their cause of action in accordance with the common development scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"standing\" means. In law, standing refers to whether a party has the right to bring a lawsuit or seek a particular legal remedy. So, for phase 1 residents to enjoin the construction, they need to have standing.\n\nLooking at option B, it says they have no standing. But I think they might have standing because they are affected by the change in use from residential to commercial, which could impact their property values and the character of the neighborhood.\n\nOption A says they have little chance, which might be possible if there are legal reasons that make their case weak.\n\nOption C says they have no chance because zoning takes precedence over the covenant. That might be relevant, but I need to think about how covenants and zoning interact.\n\nOption D suggests they could succeed based on a common development scheme.\n\nLet me consider the covenant first. The original deed has a restriction that any further subdivisions must be into minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwellings, and it binds all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns. This sounds like a restrictive covenant that runs with the land.\n\nFor a covenant to run with the land, certain requirements must be met:\n\n1. It must be in writing.\n\n2. It must be intended to run with the land.\n\n3. It must touch and concern the land.\n\n4. The subsequent grantees must have notice of the covenant.\n\nIn this case, the covenant is in the deed, which is written, and it's expressly meant to bind all subsequent grantees. It touches and concerns the land because it affects how the land can be used and developed. And the phase 1 homeowners had notice since it was included in their deeds.\n\nNow, what about phase 2? The contractor subdivided the land into one-acre lots without mentioning the restriction in the deeds to phase 2 homeowners. This could be a problem because if the restriction is still enforceable, the phase 2 subdivision might be in violation.\n\nBut in this scenario, the focus is on the investor's plan to build a shopping center on the last parcel, which is in violation of the two-acre minimum for single-family dwellings.\n\nThe investor changed the zoning to commercial, which allows the shopping center. Now, there's a conflict between the private covenant and the public zoning ordinance.\n\nGenerally, zoning ordinances are supposed to prevail over private covenants because zoning is a police power exercised by the government for the public welfare. However, private covenants are contractual agreements between private parties.\n\nBut in some cases, covenants can be enforced even against zoning, especially if the zoning is permissive and the covenant is more restrictive.\n\nWait, in this case, the zoning is allowing something that the covenant prohibits, so it's zoning being less restrictive than the covenant.\n\nUsually, if zoning allows something that a private covenant prohibits, the zoning prevails, and the covenant may be unenforceable to the extent that it conflicts with the zoning.\n\nThis is known as the \"zoning trumps covenant\" principle.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since the zoning has been changed to commercial, the covenant requiring two-acre lots for single-family dwellings would likely be unenforceable.\n\nTherefore, the phase 1 residents might not be able to enforce the covenant against the investor.\n\nBut, perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLet me think about the common development scheme mentioned in option D.\n\nSometimes, when land is developed in a planned unit development (PUD) or with a common plan, the covenants can be enforced among the various phases or parcels.\n\nIn this case, the original deed had restrictions that were supposed to apply to all subsequent grantees, including the investor.\n\nHowever, since the investor's parcel has been rezoned commercially, and the covenant is about residential development, it might not be directly applicable.\n\nAdditionally, the phase 1 residents are trying to enforce a covenant that applies to the investor's parcel, which is separate from their own.\n\nI need to consider whether the phase 1 residents have standing to enforce the covenant against the investor.\n\nGenerally, parties who are benefited by a covenant have the right to enforce it against those who are burdened by it.\n\nIn this case, the phase 1 residents are benefited by the covenant because it maintains the residential character of the neighborhood.\n\nThe investor's parcel is burdened by the covenant, but the investor is trying to develop it commercially, which violates the covenant.\n\nSo, theoretically, the phase 1 residents could have standing to enforce the covenant.\n\nHowever, since the zoning has been changed to allow commercial use, which is more permissive than the covenant, there might be legal doctrines that prevent the enforcement of the covenant.\n\nOne such doctrine is the \"zoning supersedes covenant\" rule, where local land use regulations take precedence over private covenants.\n\nAnother factor is whether the covenant is for the benefit of the land or just for the benefit of the original parties.\n\nIf it's a real covenant that benefits the land, then the phase 1 residents, as owners of the benefited land, could enforce it.\n\nBut if the zoning has changed and allows commercial use, enforcing the covenant might be difficult.\n\nMoreover, the investor might argue that the covenant is unenforceable because it's an unreasonable restriction on the use of land, especially since zoning now permits commercial use.\n\nAdditionally, the investor might claim that the covenant has been abandoned or modified by the actions of previous parties, such as the development company subdividing into larger lots in phase 1 and the contractor subdividing into one-acre lots in phase 2.\n\nIf there has been substantial departure from the original restrictions by the development company and the contractor, a court might find that the covenant is no longer enforceable.\n\nAlternatively, the court might find that the phase 1 residents can still enforce the covenant against the investor, despite the zoning change, because the covenant is intended to maintain the character of the neighborhood.\n\nThis is a complex issue, and the outcome would likely depend on the specific jurisdiction's laws and precedents.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option A, \"little chance of preventing the projected commercial development,\" might be the most accurate.\n\nThe phase 1 residents face several hurdles: the zoning change, the possible unenforceability of the covenant due to actions by previous developers, and the general principle that zoning takes precedence over private covenants.\n\nHowever, option B says they have no standing, which might not be correct because they are benefited parties under the covenant.\n\nOption C says they have no chance because zoning takes precedence over the covenant, which aligns with what I've been thinking.\n\nOption D mentions success based on a common development scheme, but given the zoning change, this might not be sufficient.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is C, but I need to consider if standing is an issue.\n\nIf they don't have standing, then option B would be correct.\n\nBut I think they do have standing as benefited parties under the covenant.\n\nTherefore, option C seems more appropriate: they have no chance of succeeding because the zoning ordinance takes precedence over the covenant running with the land.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any exceptions or additional legal theories that might allow the phase 1 residents to succeed.\n\nFor example, maybe they could argue that the zoning change was invalid or that the investor didn't follow proper procedures in getting the zoning changed.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't mention any irregularities in the zoning process, so that might not be a viable argument.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they could argue that the covenant is a valid restriction that should be enforced despite the zoning change, but that seems unlikely given standard legal principles.\n\nAnother possibility is that the phase 1 residents could seek injunctive relief based on nuisance or some other equitable theory, but that seems stretches.\n\nGiven all this, I believe option C is the most accurate: the residents have no chance of succeeding because the zoning ordinance takes precedence over the covenant running with the land.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
