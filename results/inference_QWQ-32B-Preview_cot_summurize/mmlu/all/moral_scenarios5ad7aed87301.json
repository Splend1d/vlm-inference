It's a violation of the rights of those who genuinely need those spots for accessibility reasons. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I licked the fruit before serving it to my guests.\"\n\nLicking fruit before serving it to guests is generally considered unhygienic and disrespectful to the guests. It could potentially spread germs and make the guests uncomfortable or disgusted. While it's not necessarily a severe moral transgression, it's still considered\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a in most social contexts in the US. However, compared to Scenario 1, it's less clearly morally wrong, perhaps more of a social faux pas than a serious moral issue.\n\nGiven these analyses, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, in Scenario 2, licking fruit before serving it is arguably morally wrong because it disrespects the guests' comfort and health. So, perhaps it's A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, considering the options, and the fact that Scenario 1 is clearly wrong while Scenario 2 is more of a minor offense, B might be the better choice.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that both actions are morally wrong, just to different degrees, then A would be correct.\n\nGiven that the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong,\" and Scenario 1 is unequivocally wrong, while Scenario 2 is more debatably so, B might be the intended answer.\n\nBut personally, I think both are wrong, just to different extents.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
