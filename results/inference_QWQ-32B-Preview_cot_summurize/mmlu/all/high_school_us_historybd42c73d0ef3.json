The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about John C. Calhoun and something called the \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\" from 1828. The question is asking about the issue that led to this passage. There are four options: A, B, C, and D. Let's see what each one is about.\n\nOption A is about the removal of American Indians from the South. I know that there was something called the Indian Removal Act, but I think that was in the 1830s, a bit later than 1828. So maybe not directly related here.\n\nOption B is about the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States. I recall that there was a big debate about the national bank, and Andrew Jackson vetoed its recharter in the 1830s, but again, that's a bit after 1828.\n\nOption C is about the passage of an act creating higher tariff rates. Hmm, tariffs... I think tariffs were a big issue in the early 19th century, especially for the Southern states. South Carolina was particularly unhappy about certain tariffs.\n\nOption D is about the funding of \"internal improvements.\" I think this refers to things like building roads and canals, which was also a debated topic in terms of federal vs. state powers.\n\nNow, looking back at the passage, Calhoun is talking about the division of powers between the general and state governments. He's arguing that the states have the right to decide on infractions of their powers and apply the proper remedy. He mentions that to give one party the exclusive right of judging the division of powers is to create a consolidated government and diminish the states' sovereignty.\n\nGiven this context, it seems like he's discussing states' rights and the balance of power between the federal and state governments. The specific issue that triggered this exposition was likely something that highlighted this conflict.\n\nLet's consider the time frame: 1828. That was the year of the Tariff of 1828, which was also known as the \"Tariff of Abominations\" because it was highly unpopular in the South. This tariff raised rates on imported goods, which benefited Northern manufacturers but hurt Southern farmers who relied on cheaper imported goods.\n\nSouth Carolina, in particular, was vehemently opposed to this tariff, leading to the Nullification Crisis in the early 1830s. John C. Calhoun was a key figure in this debate, advocating for the idea of nullification, which is the concept that states have the right to nullify federal laws that they consider unconstitutional.\n\nSo, connecting the dots, the issue that precipitated Calhoun's \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\" was likely the passage of the Tariff of 1828, which is option C.\n\nTo double-check, let's look at the other options again. Option A, Indian removal, was indeed a contentious issue, but it wasn't the immediate trigger for this particular document in 1828. Option B, the rechartering of the Second Bank, was more of an issue in the early 1830s when Jackson was president. Option D, internal improvements, was a ongoing debate, but again, not the specific issue that led to the \"Exposition and Protest.\"\n\nTherefore, it seems that option C, the passage of an act creating higher tariff rates, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
