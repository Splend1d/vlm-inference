No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\nB.

                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this scenario about a father who gave a piece of real estate to his three daughters as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. That means that as long as they're all alive, they own the property together, and if one of them passes away, her share automatically goes to the surviving sisters, right? No need for a will or anything like that.\n\nNow, one of the sisters sold an undivided one-third interest to a third party during their lifetimes. Then, this third party died and left her one-third interest to her son in her will. The question is, is the son's ownership interest enforceable against the two surviving sisters who claim they now own 100% of the property due to the joint tenancy rules?\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what happens when a joint tenant sells their interest. I think that selling a joint tenant's interest might sever the joint tenancy, turning it into a tenancy in common. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.\n\nOption A says no, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole property, making the sister's attempt to convey a one-third interest invalid. Hmm, that sounds plausible because in a joint tenancy, each tenant owns the whole property, not just a specific portion. So, maybe she couldn't validly sell just a one-third interest.\n\nOption B says yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I thought a deed can certainly create a joint tenancy, especially if it specifically says \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship.\" So, I think this option is incorrect.\n\nOption C says yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son. This seems similar to what I was thinking earlier. If the sale severs the joint tenancy, then they become tenants in common, and each can dispose of their interest as they wish.\n\nOption D says no, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party. I don't think a court order is necessary to sever a joint tenancy. I believe that by selling her interest, she automatically severs the joint tenancy.\n\nLet me try to think this through step by step.\n\n1. The father conveyed the property to the three daughters as joint tenants with the right of survivorship.\n\n2. One sister sold an undivided one-third interest to a third party.\n\nNow, in a joint tenancy, there are four unities: time, title, interest, and possession. If any of these unities are broken, the joint tenancy is severed, and it becomes a tenancy in common.\n\nWhen the sister sold her interest, she was transferring her ownership to another party. This would break the unity of interest because the third party doesn't have the right of survivorship with the remaining sisters. Therefore, the joint tenancy should be severed into a tenancy in common at that point.\n\nSo, after the sale, the two remaining sisters and the third party are now tenants in common, each owning one-third interests in the property.\n\nThen, the third party died and left her one-third interest to her son in her will. Since they were tenants in common, she had the right to dispose of her interest through her will.\n\nTherefore, the son inherited one-third interest in the property, and the two surviving sisters own their respective one-third interests.\n\nSo, the son's ownership interest should be enforceable against the two surviving sisters.\n\nWait, but the sisters are claiming that they now own 100% of the property pursuant to the law of joint tenancies. But, since the sale severed the joint tenancy, the law of joint tenancies no longer applies fully. They are now tenants in common, and each can dispose of their interest independently.\n\nTherefore, the son's inheritance should be valid.\n\nSo, option C seems correct: yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\n\nOption A says no, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole property, making the sister's attempted conveyance invalid. But actually, in a joint tenancy, each tenant does own the whole property, but they can still sell their interest, which severs the joint tenancy.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a deed can certainly create a joint tenancy.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a court order isn't necessary to sever a joint tenancy; the sale itself should suffice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
