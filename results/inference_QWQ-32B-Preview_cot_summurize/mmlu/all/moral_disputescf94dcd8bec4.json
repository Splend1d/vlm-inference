It says that Mary is a person and because of that, she deserves moral consideration due to features inherent to her, like being self-aware. And it's asking what kind of moral standing that suggests she has.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what moral standing is. Moral standing, as I recall, is about whether an entity matters in a moral context. It's about who or what counts in ethical decisions.\n\nNow, there are different types of moral standing mentioned in the options: direct, indirect, and relative. I need to figure out which one applies to Mary based on the information given.\n\nLet's start with direct moral standing. I think this means that Mary matters morally in herself, not because of anything else. It's like she has intrinsic value, and her well-being is important for its own sake.\n\nIndirect moral standing, on the other hand, seems like it's when an entity matters morally only because of its relationship to something else that has direct moral standing. For example, maybe an animal has indirect moral standing because it belongs to someone who cares about it.\n\nRelative moral standing might be about how much moral consideration an entity deserves compared to others. Maybe it's a matter of degree.\n\nGiven that the question says Mary deserves moral consideration because of features inherent to her, like being self-aware, that sounds a lot like direct moral standing. It's about her own characteristics that make her morally important, not because of some external relationships or comparisons.\n\nSo, option A, direct moral standing, seems like the right answer.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is indirect moral standing. That doesn't seem to fit because the question emphasizes features inherent to Mary, which suggests it's about her own qualities, not about her relationships to others.\n\nOption C is relative moral standing. While it's possible that moral standing can be relative in some contexts, the question here is focusing on inherent features that make Mary deserve moral consideration, which again points to direct moral standing.\n\nOption D is none of the above, but since option A seems to fit perfectly, there's no need to choose this.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up the definitions to be absolutely sure. Let's see.\n\nLooking up direct moral standing: It refers to entities that are morally considerable in their own right, independent of their utility to others.\n\nIndirect moral standing: Entities that are morally considerable only insofar as they are related to or affect entities with direct moral standing.\n\nRelative moral standing: This might refer to the degree or weight of moral consideration an entity deserves compared to others.\n\nGiven these definitions, and considering that Mary is a person with inherent features like self-awareness that grant her moral consideration, it's clear that she has direct moral standing.\n\nMoreover, personhood often entails certain moral rights and considerations based on characteristics such as rationality, self-awareness, and the capacity to suffer or experience happiness.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the answer should be A. direct moral standing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
