                    "text": "C. Diwali\n\nDiwali, also known as Deepavali, is a major Hindu festival that is celebrated over five days in autumn every year. It is often called the \"Festival of Lights\" because homes are decorated with lights and lamps to symbolize the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance.\n\nDuring Diwali, people decorate their homes with rangoli (colorful patterns made on the floor using colored powders or rice), lights, and diyas (clay lamps). Firecrackers are set off to celebrate the occasion and to welcome the goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring prosperity and good fortune. It's also traditional for people to wear new clothes and exchange gifts with family and friends.\n\nWhile Deepavali and Diwali refer to the same festival, \"Diwali\" is the more commonly used term in English-speaking countries. So, the correct answer is C. Diwali.\n\nA. Deepavali - As mentioned, this is another name for Diwali.\n\nB. Holi - This is a different Hindu festival, known as the \"Festival of Colors,\" which celebrates the arrival of spring and is characterized by people throwing colored powders and water at each other.\n\nD. Navaratri - This is a nine-night festival celebrating the divine feminine, during which people perform dances like Garba and Dandiya Raas.\n\nI hope this helps!
