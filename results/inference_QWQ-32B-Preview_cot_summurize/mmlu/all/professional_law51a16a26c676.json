                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out how to interpret this agreement between the widget manufacturer and the retailer. Let's see what it says: \"The manufacturer promises to sell and the retailer promises to buy 10,000 widgets at $50 per 100. One thousand widgets are to be delivered by the manufacturer on the first day of each of the next 10 months. EACH MONTHLY DELIVERY IS A SEPARATE CONTRACT. Payment to be made within 10 days of receipt of each shipment.\"\n\nOkay, so they're agreeing to transact 10,000 widgets in total, but they're breaking it down into 10 monthly deliveries of 1,000 widgets each. And it specifically says that each monthly delivery is a separate contract. That seems pretty straightforward.\n\nNow, the question is asking how this agreement can best be interpreted. The options are:\n\nA. a divisible contract.\n\nB. an installment contract.\n\nC. 10 separate contracts.\n\nD. a requirements-output contract.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nFirst, a divisible contract. I think this refers to a contract where the performance can be divided into separate parts, and each part can be treated independently. In this case, the agreement is for 10,000 widgets, but divided into 10 monthly deliveries. So, it does seem divisible. But the agreement specifies that each monthly delivery is a separate contract. So, is it one divisible contract or multiple separate contracts?\n\nNext, an installment contract. I recall that an installment contract involves partial performances or payments at specified times. In this scenario, the deliveries are in installments\u20141,000 widgets each month for 10 months. So, that fits the description of an installment contract. But again, the agreement says each monthly delivery is a separate contract, which makes me wonder if they're considered independent contracts rather than parts of a single installment contract.\n\nOption C is 10 separate contracts. The agreement does state that each monthly delivery is a separate contract. That seems pretty clear. So, perhaps it's 10 distinct contracts, each for 1,000 widgets.\n\nLastly, a requirements-output contract. I think this is where the buyer agrees to purchase all the seller's output, or the seller agrees to supply all the buyer's requirements, based on actual needs. In this case, there's a fixed quantity: 10,000 widgets in total, with a specified schedule. It doesn't seem like it's based on the buyer's requirements or the seller's output; it's a set amount over a set period.\n\nGiven that, options A, B, and D don't seem to fit as well as option C. The agreement explicitly states that each monthly delivery is a separate contract. So, it's probably best interpreted as 10 separate contracts.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there are any implications or reasons why it might not be 10 separate contracts. For example, maybe there are overall terms that bind all the deliveries together, making it one contract with divisible performance. Or perhaps the payment terms suggest it's an installment contract.\n\nLet's think about the payment terms: \"Payment to be made within 10 days of receipt of each shipment.\" This sounds like each delivery has its own payment obligation, which is typical in installment contracts. However, if each delivery is a separate contract, then each would have its own payment obligation anyway.\n\nI think the key here is the statement \"each monthly delivery is a separate contract.\" That suggests that they intended each delivery to be independent, with its own set of promises and payments.\n\nSo, considering that, option C, 10 separate contracts, seems to be the best interpretation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any dependencies between the deliveries. For example, if one delivery is delayed or defective, does it affect the other deliveries? If they are separate contracts, then issues with one shouldn't affect the others. Whereas, in an installment contract, sometimes a default on one installment can affect the entire contract.\n\nHowever, since the agreement specifies that each delivery is a separate contract, it's likely that they are indeed independent.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. 10 separate contracts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{c}} \\]"
