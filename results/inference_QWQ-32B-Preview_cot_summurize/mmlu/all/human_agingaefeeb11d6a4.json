                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which cells in the eye are responsible for responding to low levels of illumination. The options are rods, cones, retinal cells, and nocturnal detectors. I think I remember something about rods being sensitive to low light, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I know that the eye has different types of photoreceptor cells that help us see in various conditions. Cones are typically associated with color vision and function best in bright light, while rods are more sensitive and allow us to see in dim light or at night. So, maybe rods are the answer here.\n\nWait, but what about retinal cells? Isn't that a more general term that includes both rods and cones? I think that's right. The retina contains several types of cells, including photoreceptors like rods and cones, as well as other neurons that process visual information. So, if the question is specifically about cells that respond to low light levels, \"retinal cells\" might be too broad.\n\nAnd \"nocturnal detectors\"? That sounds like a made-up term. I don't think that's a standard term in anatomy or physiology. Maybe it's just there to trick me.\n\nLet me consider the functions again. In low light conditions, our vision becomes less colorful and more monochromatic, which suggests that cones, which are responsible for color vision, are not as active. Rods, on the other hand, are more numerous and more sensitive to light, making them ideal for vision in dim light.\n\nAlso, there's a condition called night blindness, which is the inability to see well in low light, and it's often associated with a deficiency or damage to the rods. That further supports the idea that rods are crucial for low-light vision.\n\nMoreover, rods have a higher concentration in the peripheral regions of the retina, which is why sometimes we can see better in the dark if we don't look directly at an object but look slightly away from it. This allows the light to fall on the areas of the retina rich in rods.\n\nCones, on the other hand, are more concentrated in the fovea, the central part of the retina, and are responsible for high-acuity vision and color perception in bright light.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems clear that rods are the cells in the eye that respond to low levels of illumination.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options again. Retinal cells include both rods and cones, as well as other neurons like bipolar cells and ganglion cells. While it's true that some retinal cells are involved in processing low-light signals, the term is too general. The question is asking specifically about cells that respond to low light levels, and rods are the specific type of photoreceptor adapted for that purpose.\n\nNocturnal detectors doesn't seem like a recognized term in this context, so it's probably not the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A. Rods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
