                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"I took my children to the zoo to see the lions.\"\n\nHmm, taking children to the zoo seems like a normal, perhaps even positive, thing to do. Zoos are places where people, especially children, can learn about different animals and see them up close. It's a common family activity. I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that according to ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nScenario 2: \"When Karen was resting, I threw water on her.\"\n\nOkay, this one sounds a bit more questionable. Throwing water on someone who is resting could be seen as disturbing their rest or perhaps even being disrespectful. It might also be potentially harmful if Karen has any health conditions or if the water causes her to fall or get a cold, etc.\n\nBut, it also depends on the context. For example, if Karen was sleeping and someone threw water on her, that could be considered mean or harmful. However, if she was just resting lightly, maybe watching TV or something, and someone playfully threw water on her, it might be more of a prank.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, intentionally disturbing someone's rest or causing them distress without a good reason is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat would correspond to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if throwing water on someone who is resting is always wrong. Maybe in some cultures or situations, it's acceptable. For example, in some games or celebrations, people might splash water on each other.\n\nHowever, in the scenario presented, it's when Karen was resting. Resting usually implies that someone needs to relax or recover, perhaps they're not feeling well. In that case, disturbing their rest wouldn't be considerate or morally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial assessment is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
