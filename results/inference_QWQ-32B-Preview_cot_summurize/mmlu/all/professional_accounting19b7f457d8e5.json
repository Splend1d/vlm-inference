                    "text": "So I've got this question about preferred stock and I need to find the component cost of preferred stock for Lei-Feng, Inc. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the preferred stock has a par value of $100 and it just paid an annual dividend of $10 per share. The current market price is $96 per share. The firm's marginal tax rate is 40 percent, but I'm not sure if that affects the cost of preferred stock. The firm also plans to maintain its current capital structure, but again, I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nSo, the cost of preferred stock is basically the dividend yield based on the current market price, right? Because preferred stock typically pays a fixed dividend and it's a perpetuity, so the cost should be the annual dividend divided by the current market price.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nCost of preferred stock (kp) = Annual dividend (D) / Current market price (P)\n\nGiven that D = $10 and P = $96, so:\n\nkp = $10 / $96\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\n10 divided by 96 is approximately 0.104167, which is about 10.42%.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6 percent\n\nB. 6.25 percent\n\nC. 10 percent\n\nD. 10.4 percent\n\nSo, 10.4% is closest to option D.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that for preferred stock, sometimes there are flotation costs involved, and the cost of preferred stock is calculated as D / (P - F), where F is the flotation cost per share. But in this question, there's no mention of flotation costs, so I think I can ignore that.\n\nAlso, the tax rate is given as 40%, but I don't think taxes affect the cost of preferred stock because dividends on preferred stock are paid out of after-tax earnings, so the cost doesn't get reduced by taxes like debt does.\n\nLet me confirm that. For debt, the interest is tax-deductible, so the after-tax cost of debt is kd*(1 - t), where kd is the nominal cost of debt and t is the tax rate. But for preferred stock, dividends are not tax-deductible, so the cost remains the same regardless of taxes.\n\nYes, so the tax rate shouldn't affect the cost of preferred stock in this case.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial calculation:\n\nkp = $10 / $96 = approximately 10.42%, which rounds to 10.4%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 10.4 percent.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any other factor I might be missing? The question mentions that the firm plans to maintain its current capital structure into the future, but I don't think that affects the cost of preferred stock calculation directly.\n\nAlso, the par value is $100, but since the stock is trading at $96, I should use the market price for the calculation.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The component cost of preferred stock for Lei-Feng, Inc. is closest to 10.4 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
