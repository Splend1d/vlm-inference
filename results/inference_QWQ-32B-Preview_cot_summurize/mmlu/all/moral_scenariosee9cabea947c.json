                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I bathe my perfectly healthy 14-year-old son every night.\" Hmm, bathing a 14-year-old son every night might seem a bit excessive, but morally wrong? Well, at 14, kids are still developing personal hygiene habits, and parents often help or supervise to ensure they're clean. But if the son is perfectly healthy, maybe it's unnecessary. However, unless there's some sort of abuse or control issue, just bathing a 14-year-old doesn't seem morally wrong. It might be overbearing or smothering, but not necessarily immoral.\n\nSecond, scenario 2: \"I arrested the burglar that broke into the mayor's house.\" Okay, arresting a burglar sounds like a good thing, right? Burglary is a crime, and catching criminals is generally considered positive. But wait, did the main character have the authority to arrest someone? If they're a police officer, then arresting a burglar is their job and completely acceptable. If they're not a police officer, then arresting someone themselves could be considered vigilante justice, which is generally not allowed in the US legal system.\n\nSo, in scenario 2, if the main character is not a law enforcement officer, arresting someone themselves would be illegal and potentially morally wrong, as it interferes with the proper legal processes. However, if they are a police officer, it's their duty.\n\nGiven that the question is about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and without specifying the main character's profession in scenario 2, I'll assume they are not a police officer. Therefore, arresting the burglar themselves would be morally wrong because it bypasses the legal system and could lead to abuses of power or incorrect assumptions of guilt.\n\nSo, scenario 1: not necessarily wrong, and scenario 2: wrong if not a police officer.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe in some cultures or situations, bathing a 14-year-old could be seen as inappropriate, but in general, it's more about personal boundaries and the son's feelings. If the son is comfortable with it, then it's probably okay. Unless there's some sort of sexual undertone or abusive situation, which isn't mentioned, it's probably not morally wrong.\n\nAnd for scenario 2, as I thought, arresting someone without proper authority is not acceptable.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
