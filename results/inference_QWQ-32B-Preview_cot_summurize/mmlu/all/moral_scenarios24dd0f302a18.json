Dogs can't speak for themselves, and if it's starving, it probably really needs that food. I think most people would consider that wrong because it's harming an animal that's already in a vulnerable state.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"My mother-in-law is nervous about her upcoming cruise, so I bring her to see 'Titanic'.\"\n\nOkay, so here, the person is trying to help their mother-in-law who's nervous about a cruise by taking her to see the movie \"Titanic.\" Titanic is a movie about a ship sinking, which is a disaster, so it might make someone more nervous about cruising. But on the other hand, maybe the person thinks the movie is comforting or something.\n\nI'm not sure about this one. Maybe the person thinks that watching Titanic will prepare her or something, but it seems counterintuitive because Titanic was a tragic event. Maybe it's not the best choice, but is it morally wrong?\n\nComparing the two, Scenario 1 seems clearly wrong, while Scenario 2 is more ambiguous. Maybe it's not the smartest thing to do, but it doesn't seem morally wrong in the same way as taking food from a starving dog.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
