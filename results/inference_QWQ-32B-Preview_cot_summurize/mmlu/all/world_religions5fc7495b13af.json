                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Mani and his reference to God. The options are: A. Mother of Light, B. Father of Goodness, C. Ineffable Lover, D. Eternal Spirit. I don't remember exactly, but I think Mani was a religious figure who had some unique beliefs about God.\n\nFirst, I recall that Mani was the founder of Manichaeism, which was a religion that combined elements from Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism. It was quite influential in its time, spreading from its origin in Mesopotamia across the ancient world.\n\nIn Manichaeism, God is often associated with light, and there's a strong dualistic view between light and darkness, good and evil. So, perhaps the term \"Mother of Light\" could be related to that. But I'm not sure if Mani specifically referred to God as the \"Mother of Light.\"\n\nLet me think about the other options. \"Father of Goodness\" sounds familiar, maybe from Mani's teachings. In many religions, God is referred to as Father, especially in Christianity. Since Manichaeism incorporated Christian elements, it's possible that Mani used this term.\n\n\"Ineffable Lover\" seems more like a poetic or mystical description. Maybe in some mystical traditions, God is referred to in such terms, but I don't recall if this was specifically Mani's terminology.\n\n\"Eternal Spirit\" is a general term that could apply to many conceptions of God. It's possible that Mani used this term, but it doesn't seem particularly distinctive to his teachings.\n\nLet me try to recall more specifically. I remember that Mani talked about the \"Original Man\" or the \"Primal Man,\" but that might not directly answer this question.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at some of the key beliefs in Manichaeism. Mani believed in a cosmic struggle between light and darkness, with light representing goodness and spirituality, and darkness representing evil and materiality. God, in this context, is associated with the light.\n\nGiven that, \"Mother of Light\" could be a possible term. In some religious traditions, particularly those with a strong emphasis on light, feminine imagery is used to describe divine qualities. For example, in some Gnostic texts, the light is associated with feminine principles.\n\nAlternatively, \"Father of Goodness\" also makes sense, as God is often seen as the source of goodness and morality in many religions.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider the linguistic and cultural context of Mani's teachings. Mani lived in the Sasanian Empire, where Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion. In Zoroastrianism, Ahura Mazda is the supreme being, often translated as \"Wise Lord,\" which has a masculine connotation.\n\nHowever, in some ancient Middle Eastern religions, goddesses associated with light or fertility were worshipped. So, it's possible that Mani incorporated some of these concepts into his religion.\n\nAlternatively, Mani might have used both masculine and feminine imagery to describe God, seeing divinity as beyond gender duality.\n\nBut since the question is asking for a specific name that Mani referred to God by, I need to choose one of the options provided.\n\nLet me consider the term \"Ineffable Lover.\" The term \"ineffable\" means something that cannot be expressed in words, which is often used to describe the transcendent nature of God in mystical traditions. The concept of God as a lover is also present in certain mystical traditions, such as Sufism or Christian mysticism, where the believer seeks a intimate union with God.\n\nHowever, I don't recall if Mani specifically used this term.\n\nPerhaps I should think about primary sources or key texts in Manichaeism. Unfortunately, I don't have access to those right now, so I'll have to rely on my memory.\n\nAnother approach: Mani was known for his cosmological myths, which included the struggle between light and darkness. In these myths, there are various divine entities or principles at play.\n\nI seem to recall that in Manichaeism, the Supreme Being is sometimes referred to as the \"Father of Greatness\" or the \"Father of Light.\" If that's the case, then option B, \"Father of Goodness,\" might be close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Mani used the term \"Eternal Spirit\" to describe God, emphasizing the timeless and immaterial nature of the divine.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nLet me try to eliminate some options. \"Ineffable Lover\" seems like a more recent or less common way to refer to God, at least in the context of Manichaeism. So, maybe that's not the correct answer.\n\nSimilarly, \"Mother of Light\" might be more associated with certain feminist or neo-pagan interpretations of divinity, but I don't recall if Mani specifically used that term.\n\n\"Eternal Spirit\" is a broad term that could apply to many religious concepts of God, but again, I don't recall if it was specifically used by Mani.\n\nThat leaves \"Father of Goodness,\" which aligns with the idea of God as the source of goodness and morality, which is a common theme in many religions, including Manichaeism.\n\nGiven that, I think the most likely answer is B. Father of Goodness.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
