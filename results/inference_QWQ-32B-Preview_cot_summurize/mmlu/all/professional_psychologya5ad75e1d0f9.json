                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Thorndike's Law of Effect. So, Thorndike was a psychologist who studied how animals learn, and his Law of Effect is a key concept in understanding behavior and learning.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Law of Effect is all about. From what I remember, it's basically about how consequences affect behavior. Specifically, it suggests that behaviors followed by positive outcomes are more likely to be repeated, while behaviors followed by negative outcomes are less likely to be repeated.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. \"All behavior is caused: everything that is done has an effect on behavior.\" This seems a bit too broad. It suggests that every behavior has some effect on other behaviors, which isn't exactly capturing the essence of Thorndike's law. Thorndike was more focused on the relationship between a specific behavior and its immediate consequences.\n\nB. \"Elimination of the unconditioned stimulus or the reward results in a decreased frequency of behavior.\" This seems to be touching on extinction in conditioning, where removing a reward decreases the behavior. While related, it's not directly stating the Law of Effect, which is more about the relationship between behavior and its consequences.\n\nC. \"A positive correlation exists between responding and aversive stimulation.\" This seems to be mixing things up. Aversive stimulation is more related to negative consequences, and while Thorndike's law does address both positive and negative consequences, this option doesn't clearly capture the core idea of the law.\n\nD. \"A reward tends to increase the probability of recurrence of the response that it follows.\" This sounds very much like the Law of Effect. It directly states that positive consequences (rewards) increase the likelihood of the behavior being repeated.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. In Thorndike's original formulation, he talked about behaviors being strengthened or weakened depending on their consequences. Specifically, behaviors followed by satisfying consequences are more likely to be repeated, whereas those followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.\n\nOption D seems to align closely with this idea, as it mentions that a reward increases the probability of the behavior recurring.\n\nOption A is too general and doesn't specify the relationship between behavior and its consequences.\n\nOption B is about elimination of the stimulus leading to decreased behavior, which is more about extinction than the Law of Effect.\n\nOption C mentions a positive correlation between responding and aversive stimulation, which doesn't make much sense because aversive stimulation typically decreases behavior.\n\nTherefore, the best paraphrase of Thorndike's Law of Effect is likely option D: \"A reward tends to increase the probability of recurrence of the response that it follows.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any nuance I might be missing. Thorndike's Law of Effect is often considered a precursor to operant conditioning, where the consequences of behavior determine its future occurrence. Skinner later expanded on these ideas, but the core principle remains similar.\n\nSo, confirming my initial thought, option D accurately captures the essence of Thorndike's Law of Effect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
