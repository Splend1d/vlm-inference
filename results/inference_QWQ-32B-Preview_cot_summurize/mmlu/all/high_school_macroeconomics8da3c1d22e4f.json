                    "text": "So I've got this question here about inflation and income, and I need to figure out what happens to my real income when the CPI goes up by 2 percent and my nominal income increases by 8 percent. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what CPI is. CPI stands for Consumer Price Index, which measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. So, if CPI increases by 2 percent, that means prices overall are going up by 2 percent.\n\nNominal income is the income before adjusting for inflation, right? So, if my nominal income increases by 8 percent, that means on paper, my salary or whatever income I have has gone up by 8 percent.\n\nBut what I'm interested in is my real income, which is my purchasing power after accounting for inflation. So, even if my nominal income goes up, if prices go up more, my real income might actually decrease.\n\nOkay, so to find the approximate change in real income, I can use the formula:\n\nChange in real income \u2248 Change in nominal income - Change in CPI\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nChange in real income \u2248 8% - 2% = 6%\n\nWait, but I remember that this is an approximation, and the exact formula involves dividing the nominal income growth by the CPI growth or something like that. But for small changes, this approximation should be okay.\n\nLet me double-check. If nominal income increases by 8% and prices increase by 2%, then the purchasing power should increase by about 6%.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of how much more I can buy with my increased income after accounting for higher prices.\n\nLet's say my initial nominal income is $100, and the initial CPI is 100.\n\nAfter the increases:\n\nNominal income = $100 + 8% of $100 = $108\n\nCPI = 100 + 2% of 100 = 102\n\nNow, to find the real income, I need to adjust the nominal income for the change in prices. I can do this by dividing the nominal income by the CPI and multiplying by the initial CPI to keep the units consistent.\n\nSo, real income = (nominal income / CPI) * initial CPI\n\nReal income = ($108 / 102) * 100 \u2248 105.88\n\nSo, real income has increased from $100 to about $105.88, which is an increase of about 5.88%, which is roughly 6%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. increased by 4 percent.\n\nB. decreased by 4 percent.\n\nC. increased by 6 percent.\n\nD. decreased by 6 percent.\n\nSo, the closest answer is C. increased by 6 percent.\n\nWait a minute, but in the calculation, I got approximately 5.88%, which rounds to 6%. So, yes, C is the correct answer.\n\nI think the approximation formula works well here, and the exact calculation confirms it.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAnother approach is to use the Fisher equation, which relates nominal and real interest rates, but I'm not sure if that applies directly here.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes real income is calculated using the formula:\n\nReal income = nominal income / price level\n\nIn this case, price level is represented by CPI.\n\nSo, initial real income = $100 / 100 = 1\n\nNew real income = $108 / 102 \u2248 1.0588\n\nChange in real income = (1.0588 - 1) / 1 * 100% \u2248 5.88%, which is about 6%.\n\nAgain, this confirms that the real income has increased by approximately 6%.\n\nI don't see any reason to think that real income would decrease, so options B and D can be ruled out.\n\nOption A suggests a 4% increase, but our calculations show it's closer to 6%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. increased by 6 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
