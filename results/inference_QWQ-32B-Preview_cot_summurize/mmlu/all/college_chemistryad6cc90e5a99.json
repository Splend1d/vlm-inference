                    "text": "So I've got this question here about NMR frequencies and magnetogyric ratios. Let's see what it's asking. We have 23Na, which is sodium-23, and it has an NMR frequency of 198.52 MHz in a 750 MHz NMR spectrometer. I need to find its magnetogyric ratio, and there are four options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the magnetogyric ratio is. I recall that it's a property of nuclei that relates their magnetic moment to their angular momentum. In NMR spectroscopy, it's important because it determines how the nucleus interacts with an external magnetic field.\n\nThe relationship between the NMR frequency (\u03bd), the magnetogyric ratio (\u03b3), and the magnetic field strength (B) is given by the equation:\n\n\u03bd = \u03b3 * B / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nSo, if I can find \u03b3, that's what I'm looking for.\n\nNow, the problem mentions a 750 MHz NMR spectrometer. I think that 750 MHz is the operating frequency of the spectrometer, which is probably proton (1H) resonance frequency. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nWait, actually, in NMR spectroscopy, the frequency depends on the specific nucleus and its magnetogyric ratio. So, different nuclei will have different resonance frequencies in the same magnetic field.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the 750 MHz is the proton resonance frequency, and 198.52 MHz is the 23Na resonance frequency in the same magnetic field.\n\nBut, to find the magnetogyric ratio of 23Na, I need to know the magnetic field strength. Or do I?\n\nWait, maybe I can relate the frequencies of different nuclei in the same magnetic field.\n\nI recall that the resonance frequency is proportional to the magnetogyric ratio and the magnetic field strength.\n\nSo, for two different nuclei in the same magnetic field, the ratio of their frequencies is equal to the ratio of their magnetogyric ratios.\n\nIn equation form:\n\n\u03bd\u2081 / \u03bd\u2082 = \u03b3\u2081 / \u03b3\u2082\n\nAssuming that the magnetic field is the same for both.\n\nIf I know the frequency of one nucleus and its magnetogyric ratio, I can find the magnetogyric ratio of another nucleus given its frequency.\n\nBut in this problem, I only have the frequency of 23Na and the operating frequency of the spectrometer, which I assume is for protons.\n\nI need to know the magnetogyric ratio of protons to use this approach.\n\nI think the magnetogyric ratio of protons is a known value, around 26.75 x 10^7 T^-1 s^-1.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the options, option B is 26.75 x 10^7 T^-1 s^-1, which is the gyromagnetic ratio for protons.\n\nSo, if I assume that the 750 MHz is the proton resonance frequency, then I can use the ratio of frequencies to find the gyromagnetic ratio of 23Na.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n\u03bd_H = 750 MHz (proton resonance frequency)\n\n\u03bd_Na = 198.52 MHz (23Na resonance frequency)\n\n\u03b3_H = 26.75 x 10^7 T^-1 s^-1 (proton gyromagnetic ratio)\n\n\u03b3_Na = ? (23Na gyromagnetic ratio)\n\nUsing the relationship:\n\n\u03bd_H / \u03bd_Na = \u03b3_H / \u03b3_Na\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b3_Na = (\u03b3_H * \u03bd_Na) / \u03bd_H\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u03b3_Na = (26.75 x 10^7 T^-1 s^-1 * 198.52 x 10^6 s^-1) / (750 x 10^6 s^-1)\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n26.75 x 10^7 * 198.52 x 10^6 = 26.75 * 198.52 x 10^(7+6) = 26.75 * 198.52 x 10^13\n\nCalculate 26.75 * 198.52:\n\n26.75 * 200 = 5350\n\n26.75 * (-1.48) = -39.42\n\nSo, 5350 - 39.42 = 5310.58\n\nTherefore, numerator is 5310.58 x 10^13 T^-1 s^-2\n\nNow, denominator is 750 x 10^6 s^-1 = 750 x 10^6 s^-1\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b3_Na = 5310.58 x 10^13 T^-1 s^-2 / 750 x 10^6 s^-1 = (5310.58 / 750) x 10^(13-6) T^-1 s^-1\n\nCalculate 5310.58 / 750:\n\n5310.58 \u00f7 750 \u2248 7.080773333\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b3_Na \u2248 7.080773333 x 10^7 T^-1 s^-1\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 7.081 x 10^7 T^-1 s^-1, which matches this value when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 7.081 x 10^7 T^-1 s^-1\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a direct way to calculate the gyromagnetic ratio using the NMR frequency and the magnetic field strength.\n\nI recall that the NMR frequency is related to the magnetic field strength by the equation:\n\n\u03bd = \u03b3 * B / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nSo, \u03b3 = (\u03bd * 2 * \u03c0) / B\n\nBut I don't know the magnetic field strength B here.\n\nHowever, perhaps I can find B from the proton resonance frequency.\n\nSimilarly, for protons:\n\n\u03bd_H = \u03b3_H * B / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nSo, B = (\u03bd_H * 2 * \u03c0) / \u03b3_H\n\nThen, plugging this back into the equation for \u03b3_Na:\n\n\u03b3_Na = (\u03bd_Na * 2 * \u03c0) / B = (\u03bd_Na * 2 * \u03c0) / [(\u03bd_H * 2 * \u03c0) / \u03b3_H] = (\u03bd_Na * \u03b3_H) / \u03bd_H\n\nWhich is the same equation I used earlier.\n\nSo, it confirms that the approach I took is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 7.081 x 10^7 T^-1 s^-1\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 7.081 \\times 10^{7} \\ T^{-1} s^{-1}} \\]"
