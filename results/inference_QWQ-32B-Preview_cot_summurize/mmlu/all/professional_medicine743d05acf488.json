                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the best pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count. So, let's break down the information given.\n\nThe patient is a 55-year-old woman with small cell carcinoma of the lung who started chemotherapy six days ago. Now she has a temperature of 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), which is a mild fever, and her physical exam is otherwise normal. Her lab results show a leukocyte count of 100/mm\u00b3, with only 5% segmented neutrophils and 95% lymphocytes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Chemotherapy can suppress bone marrow function, leading to a decrease in white blood cell production, which includes neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell crucial for fighting infections. The normal total leukocyte count varies, but generally, a count of 100/mm\u00b3 is very low\u2014typically, the normal range is around 4,000 to 11,000/mm\u00b3. So, she's severely leukopenic, especially neutropenic.\n\nThe fever could be a sign of infection, which is a serious concern in a patient with such a low neutrophil count because she's at high risk for severe infections.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Darbepoetin: This is an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia by stimulating red blood cell production. It doesn't affect white blood cell counts, so it's not appropriate here.\n\nB. Dexamethasone: This is a corticosteroid that can have various effects, including immunosuppressive actions. While it might be used in certain cancer treatments or to manage chemotherapy side effects, it wouldn't directly increase leukocyte counts.\n\nC. Filgrastim: This is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that stimulates the bone marrow to produce more neutrophils. It's commonly used to prevent or treat neutropenia caused by chemotherapy.\n\nD. Interferon alfa: This is used in the treatment of certain cancers and viral infections. It has immunomodulatory effects but isn't primarily used to increase leukocyte counts in the context of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.\n\nGiven this information, filgrastim seems like the most appropriate choice to increase her leukocyte count, specifically her neutrophil count, which is critically low.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the timing. She just started chemotherapy six days ago, and now she's febrile and neutropenic. Maybe she needs more urgent management, like antibiotics for possible infection, in addition to filgrastim.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about pharmacotherapy to increase her leukocyte count, so filgrastim makes the most sense.\n\nDarbepoetin is for red blood cells, dexamethasone doesn't directly increase leukocytes, and interferon alfa isn't used for this purpose in this context.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Filgrastim.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
