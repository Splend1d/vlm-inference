                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which phrase among these options doesn't suggest legitimacy in the context of RMA, which I believe stands for Revolution in Military Affairs. The phrases given are:\n\nA. Surgical strike.\n\nB. Indiscriminate attack.\n\nC. Smart bomb.\n\nD. Precision target.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what legitimacy means in this scenario. Legitimacy in military terms often refers to actions that are justified, lawful, and precise, minimizing collateral damage and adhering to international laws and norms.\n\nSo, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Surgical strike: This term is often used to describe a precise military operation that targets specific objectives with minimal collateral damage. It's meant to be exact and legitimate in its approach.\n\nB. Indiscriminate attack: This phrase suggests an attack that doesn't distinguish between military targets and civilian areas or individuals. This goes against the principles of legitimate warfare, which emphasize distinction and proportionality.\n\nC. Smart bomb: A smart bomb is a guided munition designed to accurately hit its target, reducing the chance of hitting non-military targets. This aligns with the notion of legitimacy in modern warfare.\n\nD. Precision target: This refers to a target that is hit with precise weapons, again minimizing collateral damage and adhering to legitimate military practices.\n\nComparing these, option B stands out as it contradicts the principles of legitimate warfare. Indiscriminate attacks are generally considered illegal under international humanitarian law because they do not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.\n\nTherefore, the phrase that is not likely to indicate legitimacy in the new terminology of RMA is \"indiscriminate attack.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
