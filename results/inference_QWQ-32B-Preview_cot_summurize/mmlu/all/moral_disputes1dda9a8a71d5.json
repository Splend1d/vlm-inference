                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Sinnott-Armstrong's view on moral principles and intuitions, specifically regarding wasteful driving. The question is: if we can't find any moral principle to back up our intuition that wasteful driving is wrong, then what follows?\n\nLet's break this down. First, I need to recall what Sinnott-Armstrong is saying about moral principles and intuitions. From what I remember, he's discussing the relationship between our moral intuitions and the principles we use to justify them. So, if we have an intuition that something is wrong, but we can't find a principle to support it, what does that tell us?\n\nOption A says that if we can't find a moral principle to back up our intuition that wasteful driving is wrong, then we know that wasteful driving is morally permissible. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but I'm not sure if it aligns with Sinnott-Armstrong's view. He might be suggesting that the absence of a principle doesn't necessarily make the action permissible; maybe there's more to it.\n\nOption B says that we know that particularism is true. Particularism, in moral theory, is the idea that there are no general moral principles, and moral judgments are made based on the particular features of individual cases. So, if we can't find a principle to back up our intuition, maybe that supports particularism. That seems plausible.\n\nOption C says that we do not know whether wasteful driving is wrong. This suggests that without a principle to back it up, our intuition isn't enough to determine the morality of the action. That also seems reasonable.\n\nOption D says that we know that wasteful driving is not wrong. This is similar to option A but phrased differently. It directly states that without a principle, we know the action isn't wrong.\n\nI need to think about which of these options Sinnott-Armstrong would endorse. He's known for discussing particularism and the limits of moral principles. In his work, he often argues against the idea that moral principles are always necessary or sufficient for making moral judgments.\n\nLet me consider particularism first. If particularism is true, then moral judgments are based on the particular details of a situation rather than general principles. So, if we can't find a principle to back up our intuition, perhaps particularism is the better approach. That would align with option B.\n\nBut option C also seems appealing because it suggests that without a principle, we simply don't know whether the action is wrong. That seems cautious and reasonable. However, particularism might allow us to make moral judgments based on the specifics of the case, even without a general principle.\n\nOption A says that if we can't find a principle to support our intuition, then wasteful driving is morally permissible. But that seems to suggest that the absence of a principle implies permission, which might not necessarily follow. Maybe the action is wrong for reasons that don't fit into a general principle.\n\nOption D is similar to A but more direct. It says that we know wasteful driving is not wrong without a principle. Again, this seems too conclusive. Maybe the action is wrong, but for reasons that are too particular to capture in a general principle.\n\nConsidering Sinnott-Armstrong's views, he seems to be sympathetic to particularism and critical of the idea that moral principles are always required. In his writings, he often argues that particularism can be a viable alternative to principlism.\n\nGiven that, option B, which says that we know particularism is true if we can't find a principle to back up our intuition, seems most aligned with his view. It suggests that the failure to find a principle supports the particularist position that moral judgments can be made without general principles.\n\nOption C, saying that we don't know whether wasteful driving is wrong, is also a possible position, but it seems more agnostic. Sinnott-Armstrong might argue that particularism allows us to make moral judgments even without principles, so perhaps option C isn't the best fit.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B: we know that particularism is true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
