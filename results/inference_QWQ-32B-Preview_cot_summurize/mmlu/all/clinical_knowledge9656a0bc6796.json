                    "text": "Let's tackle this multiple-choice question about jaundice. I need to pick the statement that's true among the options given. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Pale stools and dark urine are characteristic of the jaundice of hemolytic anemia.\" Hmm, I know that jaundice can occur in hemolytic anemia, which is when red blood cells break down too quickly. In this condition, bilirubin levels rise because there's more bilirubin being produced than the liver can handle. Now, typically, in hemolytic anemia, the urine might be dark due to the presence of hemoglobin or bilirubin, but I'm not sure about the stools. I think in hemolytic anemia, stools might still be normal in color, unlike in obstructive jaundice where stools can be pale. So, I'm a bit unsure about this one.\n\nOption B states: \"Bilirubin is used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells.\" Wait a minute, bilirubin is actually a breakdown product of hemoglobin, not a component used to make red blood cells. The liver processes bilirubin, conjugates it, and excretes it in bile, but it's not used in red blood cell synthesis. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says: \"Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice.\" I recall that itching, or pruritus, can indeed be a symptom of obstructive jaundice. This type of jaundice occurs when there's a blockage in the bile ducts, preventing bile from flowing properly. The buildup of bile salts in the skin can cause itching. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D is: \"Putting a danger of infection sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice is optional.\" I think this is more about laboratory procedures and infection control. Intravenous drug users have a higher risk of bloodborne infections like hepatitis or HIV. Therefore, it's standard practice to handle their blood samples with extra caution, often indicated by a sticker denoting potential infection risk. I believe this is mandatory to ensure the safety of laboratory personnel, so saying it's optional might not be accurate.\n\nAlright, let's recap:\n\n- Option A: I'm not entirely sure about the stool and urine colors in hemolytic anemia.\n\n- Option B: This seems incorrect because bilirubin is a breakdown product, not used in red blood cell synthesis.\n\n- Option C: This seems correct; itching can be a sign of obstructive jaundice.\n\n- Option D: I think it's mandatory to mark such samples, so this might be incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is Option C: \"Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
