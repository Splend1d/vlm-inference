                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out who is likely to prevail in this situation. So, there's a woman who signed up for a website to get her credit reports. The site required her to create an account, and there was a notice in bold letters saying that by creating an account, she agrees to the terms and conditions. She didn't actually read the terms and conditions, even though there was a conspicuous link to them. She created the account and paid $50 for a credit report. Then, for the next 6 months, her credit card was automatically billed $50 each month, and she only received email notices that the report was available on the site. The terms and conditions stated that she authorized these charges unless she notified the company otherwise in advance.\n\nNow, the question is, which party will likely prevail in court regarding whether she was bound to pay for those 6 months until she canceled?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.\n\nB. The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.\n\nC. The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.\n\nD. The company will prevail because any mention of terms and conditions is enough to put the prospective member on notice of contract terms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a contract of adhesion is. It's a standardized contract that is drafted by one party and the other party has no negotiating power to change the terms. These types of contracts are common in consumer agreements, like website terms and conditions. Courts sometimes look unfavorably on contracts of adhesion and may invalidate certain terms that are unfair or not reasonably communicated to the party who didn't draft them.\n\nIn this case, the terms and conditions were presented in bold letters, and there was a conspicuous link to access them. The woman didn't click on the link to read them, but she proceeded to create an account and make a payment.\n\nOption A suggests that the woman will prevail because terms and conditions are often considered contracts of adhesion and are unenforceable. However, just because something is a contract of adhesion doesn't necessarily make it unenforceable. Many such contracts are enforced as long as the terms are reasonably communicated to the party agreeing to them.\n\nOption B says the company will prevail because the notice is in bold and the contract is easily accessible. This seems plausible because the notice was prominent, and the terms were accessible via a link. The woman chose not to read them, but she still agreed to them by creating the account.\n\nOption C claims the woman will prevail because the terms and conditions or important parts must be described on the 'create an account' page, which wasn't done here. This might be relevant if the key terms weren't visible or sufficiently highlighted. In this case, the notice was in bold, but the actual terms were linked elsewhere.\n\nOption D states that the company will prevail because any mention of terms and conditions is enough to put the prospective member on notice of contract terms. This is similar to option B but perhaps less specific about the prominence of the notice.\n\nI think the key here is whether the woman had adequate notice of the terms she was agreeing to, particularly the automatic billing aspect.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, courts have held that if the terms and conditions are presented in a way that is conspicuous and the user has to agree to them in order to proceed, then the user is bound by those terms, even if they didn't read them.\n\nIn this case, the notice was in bold letters, which suggests that it was designed to catch the user's attention. Additionally, there was a conspicuous link to the terms and conditions, meaning that the user had the opportunity to read them before proceeding.\n\nThe woman chose not to read the terms and conditions, but by clicking to create an account, she agreed to be bound by them. Therefore, it seems that the company would likely prevail because the terms were adequately communicated, and she had the opportunity to review them.\n\nOption A might be attractive because contracts of adhesion are sometimes scrutinized more closely, but in this case, the notice was prominent, and the terms were accessible.\n\nOption C suggests that the terms should have been described on the 'create an account' page, but generally, it's acceptable to provide a link to the terms as long as the user is notified that by agreeing, they accept those terms.\n\nOption D is similar to B but perhaps too broad, as simply mentioning terms and conditions might not always be sufficient. However, in this case, the mention was in bold letters, which adds weight to the notification.\n\nTherefore, I think the most likely outcome is that the company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
