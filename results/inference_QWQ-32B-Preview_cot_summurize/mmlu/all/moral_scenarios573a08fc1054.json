Now, feeding a starving animal seems like a kind and compassionate act. It's helping someone who is in need, especially an animal that can't help itself. In general, acts of kindness and compassion are considered morally good, not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character surprises their wife with a punch to the gut. Punching someone, especially your spouse, is a form of physical violence. Physical violence is generally considered morally wrong because it causes harm to another person without their consent. It can cause physical injury and emotional trauma.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
