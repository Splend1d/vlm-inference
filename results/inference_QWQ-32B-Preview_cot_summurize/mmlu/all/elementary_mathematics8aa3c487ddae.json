                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \u221225 \u2212 (\u221211). I need to find out what this equals, and there are four options: A) \u221236, B) \u221214, C) 14, and D) 36. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart. So, \u2212 (\u221211) should be the same as +11. Is that right? Yeah, that makes sense because subtracting a negative is like adding a positive.\n\nSo, if I have \u221225 \u2212 (\u221211), it should be the same as \u221225 + 11. Now, I just need to calculate \u221225 plus 11.\n\nLet me think about this on a number line. If I start at \u221225 and add 11, I move 11 units to the right. So, from \u221225, moving right to \u221224, \u221223, \u221222, \u221221, \u221220, \u221219, \u221218, \u221217, \u221216, \u221215, and \u221214. So, it lands on \u221214.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of absolute values. The difference between 25 and 11 is 14, and since \u221225 is more negative than 11 is positive, the result should be negative. So, \u221214.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. If I have \u221225 and I add 11, should it really be \u221214? Let me try another way.\n\nI can think of it as \u221225 + 11. Since 11 is less than 25, the result will still be negative. The difference between 25 and 11 is 14, so \u221214.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the rule for adding integers with different signs: subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and take the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. Here, 25 is larger than 11, and \u221225 is negative, so the result should be negative. So, \u2212(25 \u2212 11) = \u221214.\n\nOkay, that confirms it. So, the answer should be \u221214, which is option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe I should consider the original expression again: \u221225 \u2212 (\u221211). Is there any chance that it could be something else?\n\nWait, sometimes people get confused with multiple negatives. So, minus a negative is a positive. So, \u2212 (\u221211) is +11. So, it's \u221225 + 11. Yeah, that seems solid.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the concept of opposites. The opposite of \u221211 is +11, so subtracting \u221211 is the same as adding +11. So, again, \u221225 + 11.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it enough. The answer is \u221214, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
