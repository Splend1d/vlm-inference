                    "text": "I've been reading about bioelectrical impedance and how it's used to measure body composition. So, the basic idea is that you send a small electrical current through the body, and based on how quickly that current moves, you can estimate the proportion of muscle and fat. I know that muscle tissue has more water content than fat tissue, and water is a good conductor of electricity. So, I'm guessing that's why the current moves faster through muscle.\n\nLet me see. Option A says that muscle contains less water than fat. But that doesn't make sense because if muscle had less water, and water conducts electricity well, then the current should move slower through muscle, not faster. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption B says muscle contains more water than fat. That aligns with what I just thought. Since muscle has more water, and water is a good conductor, the current should move faster through muscle. This seems logical.\n\nOption C says muscle weighs more than fat. Well, that might be true, but I don't see how weight directly affects the conductivity of electrical current. So, maybe that's not the reason.\n\nOption D says muscle weighs less than fat. That contradicts what I know; muscle is denser than fat, so for the same volume, muscle would weigh more. So, this can't be correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about the composition in more detail. I know that muscle tissue has a lot of water, blood, and other conductive materials, whereas fat is more lipids, which are insulators. So, that would certainly slow down the electrical current.\n\nAlso, I've heard that bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) relies on the fact that lean tissue, which has higher water content, conducts electricity better than fat tissue. That's why it's used to estimate body fat percentage.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor. For example, the amount of electrolytes in the tissue might affect conductivity, but I think the primary factor is water content.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the electrical current travels faster through muscle because muscle contains more water than fat, and water is a better conductor of electricity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: Muscle contains more water than fat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
