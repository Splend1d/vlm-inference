                    "text": "I'm going to answer this question about which tradition, besides Jainism, started as a world-renouncing movement. The options are Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam. I need to think about what \"world-renouncing\" means in this context.\n\nWorld-renouncing movements are those that encourage their followers to detach from worldly desires and material attachments in pursuit of spiritual liberation or enlightenment. Jainism is known for its strict ascetic practices and renunciation of worldly life, so it fits this description.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Buddhism: I know that Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama, who himself renounced his worldly life as a prince to seek enlightenment. The Buddhist path emphasizes letting go of desires and attachments, similar to Jainism. So, Buddhism seems like a likely candidate.\n\nB. Hinduism: Hinduism is a complex religion with various paths or margas, including the path of knowledge (Jnana Marga), the path of devotion (Bhakti Marga), and the path of action (Karma Marga). While there are ascetic traditions within Hinduism, such as Sannyasa, Hinduism as a whole encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, including worldly engagement. So, it's not primarily a world-renouncing movement.\n\nC. Judaism: Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion that emphasizes ethical living, following God's commandments, and building a relationship with God through prayer and study. It doesn't focus on renouncing the world but rather on living a righteous life within the world. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nD. Islam: Islam is also a monotheistic religion that emphasizes submission to God's will and living a righteous life according to the teachings of the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad. Like Judaism, it doesn't promote renunciation of the world but rather engaging with the world in a moral and pious way.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only other tradition besides Jainism that began as a world-renouncing movement is Buddhism. So, the answer should be A. Buddhism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
