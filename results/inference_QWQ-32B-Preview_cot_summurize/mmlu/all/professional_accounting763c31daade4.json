                    "text": "In the financial statements of employee benefit pension plans and trusts, the plan investments are typically reported at fair value. This is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the requirements set forth by regulatory bodies such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States.\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. For pension plans and trusts, this means that investments are valued based on their current market prices or other relevant valuation techniques that reflect their current economic value.\n\nReporting investments at fair value provides stakeholders with a more accurate and up-to-date picture of the plan's financial position and its ability to meet future obligations. It also aligns with the objective of financial reporting, which is to provide useful information for decision-making.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Fair value.\n\nB. Historical cost: This refers to the original cost of the asset and does not account for changes in market value over time. While historical cost is used for many types of assets in financial statements, it is not the standard for reporting pension plan investments.\n\nC. Net realizable value: This is typically used for inventory valuation and represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and sale. It is not applicable to pension plan investments.\n\nD. Lower of historical cost or market: This method was historically used for certain types of assets, but under modern accounting standards, pension plan investments are required to be reported at fair value.\n\nIt's important for financial statement users to understand the valuation basis of plan investments to properly assess the funding status and risk profile of the pension plan or trust."
