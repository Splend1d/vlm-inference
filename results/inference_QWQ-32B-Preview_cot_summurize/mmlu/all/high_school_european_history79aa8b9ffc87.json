The options are:\n\nA. The conscription of huge armies\n\nB. Fixing prices and wages\n\nC. Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization\n\nD. Promoting soldiers based upon their merits in the field\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The radical phase of the French Revolution, often associated with the Reign of Terror, was a time of extreme measures taken to protect the revolution and its ideals. Maximilien Robespierre was a key figure during this period.\n\nOption A: The conscription of huge armies. This refers to the Lev\u00e9e en Masse, which was actually instituted by the Committee of Public Safety, of which Robespierre was a part. This policy drafted vast numbers of French citizens into the army to defend the revolution against foreign and internal threats. It was a significant measure that helped mobilize the nation for war and played a crucial role in defending France against invading armies. So, this seems quite beneficial for defense.\n\nOption B: Fixing prices and wages. During the Revolution, there were efforts to control inflation and ensure that basic goods were affordable. The Maximum was a set of laws that fixed prices and wages. While this was intended to help the poor and prevent profiteering, it had mixed results. It could lead to shortages and black markets if not managed properly. However, in terms of defense, it's not directly related unless it affected the morale or the economic stability needed to support the war effort.\n\nOption C: Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization. This involved removing religious symbols, changing the calendar, and even establishing a Cult of Reason. While this was part of the radical phase and aimed at secularizing society, it didn't directly contribute to the defense of France. In fact, it could have alienated some segments of the population and perhaps even undermined morale. So, this might be a candidate for the least beneficial option.\n\nOption D: Promoting soldiers based upon their merits in the field. This is about reforming the military hierarchy to reward ability and bravery rather than social status. This should have been beneficial for defense, as it could lead to more effective and motivated military leadership.\n\nComparing these options, A and D seem beneficial for defense, B has indirect implications that could be positive or negative, and C seems least related to defense and potentially harmful in terms of social cohesion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is probably C. Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization was the least beneficial to the defense of France among the options given.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
