The options are:\n\nScenario 1: \"My wife told me she was hot so I turned the temperature down.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"When I saw the neighbor undressing through the window, I pulled up a chair.\"\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: The wife says she's hot, so the husband turns down the temperature. That seems like a reasonable response. If someone is feeling hot, adjusting the temperature to make them more comfortable is considerate. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. It's a normal, helpful action between spouses.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: The person sees their neighbor undressing through the window and decides to pull up a chair to watch. This sounds problematic. Watching someone undress without their consent is invasive and disrespectful of their privacy. It's voyeuristic behavior, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 doesn't seem morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong: This would mean both scenarios are morally wrong, but I think only Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong: This would mean Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not, but that's the opposite of what I think.\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong: This matches my assessment\u2014Scenario 1 is not wrong, Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong: This would mean neither scenario is morally wrong, but I think Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe the husband turned down the temperature too much, making his wife uncomfortable. But the scenario doesn't specify that; it just says he turned it down because she was hot. So, it seems like a straightforward, considerate action.\n\nFor Scenario 2, even if the neighbor's window was left open or something, watching someone undress without their knowledge or consent is invasion of privacy. It's not acceptable.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that C is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
