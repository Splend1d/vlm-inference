                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about subsets of a group being a group themselves. The question is: A subset H of a group (G,*) is a group if... and then it gives four options. I need to figure out which of these options guarantee that H is a group under the same operation *.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what makes a group. A group (G,*) must satisfy four properties:\n\n1. Closure: For all a, b in G, a * b is also in G.\n\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in G, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).\n\n3. Identity: There exists an element e in G such that for every a in G, e * a = a * e = a.\n\n4. Inverses: For each a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a * b = b * a = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, since H is a subset of G, and G is already a group, some of these properties might be inherited by H, but not necessarily all of them. So, I need to see which of these options ensure that H is a subgroup of G.\n\nOption A says: a, b in H => a * b in H. That's the closure property. So, if H is closed under the operation *, that's a necessary condition for H to be a group.\n\nOption B says: a in H => a^-1 in H. That's the inverses property. So, if every element in H has its inverse also in H, that's another necessary condition.\n\nOption C says: a, b in H => a * b^-1 in H. This is a combination of closure and inverses, but it's a single condition that implies both closure and inverses in certain contexts.\n\nOption D says: H contains the identity element. So, the identity element of G is in H.\n\nNow, to determine which of these options guarantee that H is a group, I need to see which of these conditions, when satisfied, ensure that H satisfies all four group properties.\n\nFirst, associativity: Since H is a subset of G and G is a group, the operation * is associative in G, and therefore it's associative in H as well, because the operation doesn't change.\n\nSo, associativity is inherited from G to H without any additional conditions.\n\nNext, closure: Option A states this directly. If H is closed under *, then for any a, b in H, a * b is also in H.\n\nInverses: Option B states that for every a in H, its inverse a^-1 is also in H.\n\nIdentity: Option D says that H contains the identity element.\n\nNow, if H satisfies closure, inverses, and contains the identity, then H is a group under *.\n\nWait, but option C seems to combine closure and inverses in one condition. Let's see what option C implies.\n\nOption C: a, b in H => a * b^-1 in H.\n\nThis is a single condition that, if satisfied, implies both closure and inverses.\n\nLet me see why.\n\nFirst, to show that H is closed under the operation *, assuming option C holds.\n\nLet a, b be in H.\n\nWe need to show that a * b is in H.\n\nBut option C says that a * b^-1 is in H.\n\nHmm, that doesn't directly give me a * b.\n\nWait, maybe I can manipulate it.\n\nLet me consider b and a.\n\nIf I take a and b in H, then by option C, a * b^-1 is in H.\n\nBut I need a * b to be in H.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider the inverse of b.\n\nWait, if I take b and its inverse b^-1, both in H (since if b is in H, then b^-1 is in H, but that's assuming inverses are in H, which is part of what option C is supposed to imply).\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nI recall that in group theory, there's a theorem that says a subset H of G is a subgroup if and only if for all a, b in H, a * b^-1 is in H.\n\nIs that true? Let me think.\n\nSuppose H satisfies option C: for all a, b in H, a * b^-1 is in H.\n\nI need to show that H is a group under *.\n\nFirst, associativity is inherited from G.\n\nSecond, I need to show that H is closed under *, contains inverses, and contains the identity.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n1. Closure: for all a, b in H, a * b is in H.\n\n2. Inverses: for all a in H, a^-1 is in H.\n\n3. Identity: e is in H.\n\nNow, assuming option C, let's see if I can derive these three properties.\n\nFirst, let's try to show that H contains the identity.\n\nLet me take a = b in H.\n\nThen, a * b^-1 = a * a^-1 = e, which is in H.\n\nSo, the identity is in H.\n\nOkay, that's one property.\n\nNext, let's show that H contains inverses.\n\nTake a in H.\n\nLet b = e, which is in H as we just showed.\n\nThen, a * e^-1 = a * e = a is in H.\n\nWait, that doesn't help me directly.\n\nWait, I need to show that for any a in H, a^-1 is in H.\n\nLet me take b = a in H.\n\nThen, a * a^-1 = e is in H, which we already know.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let me take a = e and b in H.\n\nThen, e * b^-1 = b^-1 is in H.\n\nSo, for any b in H, b^-1 is in H.\n\nGreat, so inverses are in H.\n\nNow, closure: for a, b in H, a * b is in H.\n\nBut option C only gives a * b^-1 is in H.\n\nHow can I get a * b from that?\n\nWait, but now that I know that for any b in H, b^-1 is in H, I can use that.\n\nLet me take b in H, then b^-1 is in H.\n\nThen, a * (b^-1)^-1 = a * b is in H, because (b^-1)^-1 = b.\n\nWait, but option C is a * b^-1 in H.\n\nSo, a * b is in H only if b^-1 is in H, which it is, since inverses are in H.\n\nWait, but that seems circular.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nGiven a, b in H, and I know that b^-1 is in H (since inverses are in H), then a * (b^-1)^-1 = a * b is in H.\n\nWait, but (b^-1)^-1 is b, so a * b is in H.\n\nSo, closure follows from option C combined with the fact that inverses are in H.\n\nTherefore, option C implies both closure and inverses, and we already showed that the identity is in H.\n\nTherefore, option C alone is sufficient to guarantee that H is a subgroup of G.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Closure\n\nB. Inverses\n\nC. a * b^-1 in H\n\nD. Identity\n\nTo have H be a group, H needs to be closed, contain inverses, and contain the identity.\n\nOption C alone implies all three.\n\nOptions A and B together also imply closure and inverses, and with D (identity), they would cover all necessary properties.\n\nBut option C seems to cover all three with a single condition.\n\nSo, which of these options guarantee that H is a group?\n\nThe question is multiple choice, and it seems like it might be multiple answer.\n\nBut looking at the way it's phrased, \"A subset H of a group (G,*) is a group if\"\n\nand then options A, B, C, D.\n\nIt might be asking which single option is sufficient to guarantee that H is a group.\n\nIn that case, option C seems to be the most comprehensive, as it implies closure, inverses, and identity.\n\nOptions A and B together with D would also work, but that's not a single option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question allows selecting multiple options.\n\nIn that case, perhaps A, B, and D together are necessary and sufficient.\n\nBut option C alone seems sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is C, as it's the minimal condition that ensures H is a subgroup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me by including options that are necessary but not sufficient on their own.\n\nI need to read the question carefully.\n\nIt says, \"A subset H of a group (G,*) is a group if\"\n\nand then gives four options.\n\nIt's not clear if it's asking for which single option is sufficient, or which combination is sufficient.\n\nPerhaps it's a multiple-select question.\n\nIn that case, A, B, and D together are necessary and sufficient.\n\nBut C alone is also sufficient, as it implies A, B, and D.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking which of these conditions are necessary and sufficient on their own.\n\nIn that case, C is the only option that alone is sufficient.\n\nOptions A and B together might not be sufficient without D, but earlier I thought that C implies D.\n\nWait, let's clarify.\n\nOption C implies D, as we saw by taking a = b, a * b^-1 = e is in H.\n\nSo, C implies D.\n\nTherefore, C alone is sufficient.\n\nOptions A and B together also require D to be sufficient, but since C implies D, C is sufficient on its own.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nSuppose H satisfies option C: for all a, b in H, a * b^-1 is in H.\n\nWe've shown that this implies:\n\n1. Identity is in H.\n\n2. Inverses are in H.\n\n3. Closure is in H.\n\nTherefore, H satisfies closure, associativity (inherited from G), identity, and inverses, which are all required for H to be a group.\n\nTherefore, C is sufficient.\n\nNow, are any of the other options sufficient on their own?\n\nOption A: closure.\n\nBut closure alone doesn't guarantee the presence of inverses or the identity.\n\nFor example, take G = (Z, +), the integers under addition.\n\nLet H = {1, 2, 3}.\n\nH is closed under addition modulo some number, but it doesn't contain inverses or the identity.\n\nWait, under regular addition, H isn't closed, since 2 + 3 = 5 is not in H.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider H = {0, 2, 4} in G = Z6 under addition.\n\nH is closed under addition, since 0+0=0, 0+2=2, 0+4=4, 2+2=4, 2+4=0, 4+4=2, all in H.\n\nAlso, H contains the identity (0) and inverses (each element is its own inverse in this case, since 2 + 4 = 0, but 2 + 2 = 4, and 4 + 4 = 2).\n\nWait, but in Z6, the inverse of 2 is 4, and inverse of 4 is 2, inverse of 0 is 0.\n\nSo, H does contain inverses.\n\nBut is this always the case?\n\nWait, no.\n\nConsider G = Z4 under addition: {0,1,2,3}\n\nLet H = {0,2}.\n\nH is closed under addition: 0+0=0, 0+2=2, 2+0=2, 2+2=0, all in H.\n\nH contains the identity (0) and inverses (2 is its own inverse).\n\nSo, in this case, closure implies the rest.\n\nBut wait, this is a specific example.\n\nIn general, closure doesn't guarantee the presence of inverses or the identity.\n\nWait, in this example, H is closed, contains the identity, and contains inverses.\n\nBut is this always true when H is closed?\n\nNo, consider G = Z, and H = {1,2,3,...}, the positive integers.\n\nH is closed under addition, but it doesn't contain inverses or the identity (0).\n\nWait, but in that group, the identity is 0, which is not in H.\n\nSo, H is closed but doesn't contain the identity or inverses.\n\nTherefore, closure alone is not sufficient.\n\nSo, option A is not sufficient on its own.\n\nOption B: a in H => a^-1 in H.\n\nBut this only guarantees inverses.\n\nIt doesn't guarantee closure or the identity.\n\nFor example, in G = Z under addition, let H = {1, -1}.\n\nThen, for each a in H, a^-1 is in H.\n\nBut H is not closed under addition, since 1 + (-1) = 0, which may or may not be in H.\n\nWait, in this case, 0 is in H only if H contains 0.\n\nBut if H = {1, -1}, and G = Z under addition, then H doesn't contain 0, and it's not closed under addition.\n\nSo, option B alone is not sufficient.\n\nOption C: a, b in H => a * b^-1 in H.\n\nAs we've seen, this implies closure, inverses, and identity.\n\nSo, C is sufficient.\n\nOption D: H contains the identity element.\n\nBut this only guarantees the identity.\n\nIt doesn't guarantee closure or inverses.\n\nFor example, in G = Z under addition, let H = {0}.\n\nH contains the identity, but it doesn't necessarily contain other elements or their inverses.\n\nWait, in this case, H is a group, but that's because it's trivial.\n\nBut if H = {0,1}, in G = Z2 under addition, it's a group.\n\nBut if H = {0,1} in G = Z3 under addition, then H is not a group because it's not closed.\n\nSo, D alone is not sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the only option that is sufficient on its own is C.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut let's see what the question is asking.\n\nIt says, \"A subset H of a group (G,*) is a group if\"\n\nand then options A, B, C, D.\n\nIt might be asking which conditions are necessary and sufficient for H to be a group.\n\nIn that case, C is sufficient on its own.\n\nAlternatively, A, B, and D together are also sufficient.\n\nBut since C is a single condition that implies A, B, and D, C is the most efficient condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
