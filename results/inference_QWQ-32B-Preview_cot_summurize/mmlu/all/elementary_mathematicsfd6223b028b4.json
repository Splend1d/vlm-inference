I need to check each one to see if it falls within that range.\n\nFirst, let's look at option A: 2,249,550. I need to compare this to 2,329,500 and 2,598,100. Let's see, 2,249,550 is less than 2,329,500 because 2,249 is less than 2,329. So, this number is too low. It's not between the two numbers.\n\nNext, option B: 2,589,200. Comparing this to 2,598,100, it's less than 2,598,100 because 2,589 is less than 2,598. Now, is it greater than 2,329,500? Well, 2,589 is greater than 2,329, so yes, it's greater than 2,329,500 and less than 2,598,100. So, this seems to be within the range.\n\nBut let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption C: 2,329,333. Comparing this to 2,329,500, it's less than 2,329,500 because 2,329,333 is before 2,329,500. So, it's below the lower limit.\n\nOption D: 2,327,900. Again, comparing to 2,329,500, 2,327 is less than 2,329, so this is also below the lower limit.\n\nWait a minute, option B was 2,589,200, which is less than 2,598,100 and greater than 2,329,500. So, it seems to be the only one in the range.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's double-check option B.\n\n2,589,200 is greater than 2,329,500 and less than 2,598,100. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 2,589,200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n"
