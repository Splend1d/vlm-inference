                    "text": "Let's see. I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: I played fetch with my dog at the park.\n\nSo, playing fetch with a dog at the park seems like a normal, harmless activity. Dogs enjoy it, people enjoy spending time with their pets, and parks are usually places where people go to have fun and be outdoors. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. It's probably encouraged for dog owners to take their pets to the park for exercise and socialization.\n\nSecond scenario: I baked peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends.\n\nBaking cookies for your daughter's friends also seems like a nice thing to do. It's generous and thoughtful, especially if they're having a playdate or something similar. Peanut butter is a common ingredient in many cookie recipes, and it's generally safe, assuming that none of the friends have a peanut allergy.\n\nBut wait, maybe that's the issue. Peanut allergies are relatively common, and some people can have severe reactions to peanuts. So, baking peanut butter cookies could be problematic if any of the friends have an allergy.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't mention anything about allergies or any other considerations. It just says I baked peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends.\n\nGiven that, I think most people would see this as a positive action unless there's additional context suggesting that it's inappropriate.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, neither of them seems to involve anything clearly morally wrong.\n\nPlaying fetch with a dog at the park is fine, and baking cookies for your daughter's friends is also fine, assuming no one has allergies or other issues.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any way that baking peanut butter cookies could be considered morally wrong?\n\nWell, if you knew that one of the friends has a peanut allergy and could be endangered by eating peanuts, then baking peanut butter cookies for them would be negligent and potentially harmful.\n\nBut in this scenario, there's no mention of any allergies or precautions taken. So, based on the information provided, it's hard to see it as morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could argue that baking cookies is promoting unhealthy eating, but that seems like a stretch. Cookies are occasional treats, and it's not necessarily wrong to offer them.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
