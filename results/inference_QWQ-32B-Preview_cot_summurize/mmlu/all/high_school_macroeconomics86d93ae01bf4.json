                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about monetarism. The options are:\n\nA. the marginal propensity to consume is constant.\n\nB. the money supply is continuous.\n\nC. the exchange rate is fixed.\n\nD. the velocity of money is stable.\n\nI need to pick the one that's an important assumption underlying monetarism. Okay, first things first, I should probably remember what monetarism is.\n\nMonetarism is an economic theory that emphasizes the role of government in controlling the money supply as a means to regulate economic activity and control inflation. It was popularized by Milton Friedman in the 20th century. So, it's all about how the amount of money in an economy affects things like prices and output.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: the marginal propensity to consume is constant.\n\nMarginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a Keynesian concept that refers to the proportion of additional income that a household spends on consumption. If MPC is constant, it means that as people earn more, they spend a consistent percentage of that extra income.\n\nBut monetarism is more focused on the money supply and its effects, rather than on consumption patterns. So, I'm not sure if this is a key assumption of monetarism.\n\nOption B: the money supply is continuous.\n\nI think this might mean that the money supply is constantly being added to or adjusted in a smooth manner. However, monetarists actually advocate for a steady, predictable growth rate in the money supply, often referred to as the \"k-percent rule,\" where k is a constant growth rate.\n\nSo, while there is an emphasis on a consistent and predictable money supply growth, \"continuous\" might not be the exact term used. Maybe this is close, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption C: the exchange rate is fixed.\n\nMonetarists don't necessarily require the exchange rate to be fixed. In fact, some monetarists support flexible exchange rates as a way to adjust to economic shocks. So, I don't think this is a key assumption of monetarism.\n\nOption D: the velocity of money is stable.\n\nVelocity of money is the rate at which money circulates in the economy. It's calculated as the total value of transactions divided by the money supply. Monetarists often assume that the velocity of money is relatively stable in the long run, meaning that changes in the money supply have a direct impact on economic activity or prices.\n\nThis sounds familiar. Milton Friedman had the equation of exchange: MV = PY, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Y is real output. If V is stable, then changes in M lead directly to changes in P or Y.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the stability of the velocity of money is a key assumption in monetarist theory.\n\nComparing all the options, option D seems to be the most directly related to monetarist assumptions.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nOption A is more related to Keynesian economics.\n\nOption B is about the money supply, which is important in monetarism, but the specific term \"continuous\" isn't standard in monetarist literature.\n\nOption C is about exchange rates, which isn't a central assumption of monetarism.\n\nOption D aligns well with the monetarist view that V is stable, allowing M to have a predictable impact on P or Y.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. The velocity of money is stable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
