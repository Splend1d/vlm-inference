Pendleton Act of 1883\n\nThe Pendleton Act, officially known as the Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, was a landmark piece of legislation in the United States that established the principle of awarding government jobs based on merit rather than political affiliation or patronage. Prior to the Pendleton Act, the spoils system was prevalent, where political supporters were rewarded with government positions regardless of their qualifications or abilities.\n\nThe act was named after its primary advocate, Senator George H. Pendleton of Ohio, who had been pushing for civil service reform for many years. The legislation was passed in the aftermath of the assassination of President James A. Garfield by Charles J. Guiteau, a disappointed office seeker. This tragic event highlighted the need for reform in the way government positions were awarded.\n\nThe Pendleton Act required that applicants for certain federal positions pass competitive exams to demonstrate their qualifications. It also prohibited the firing or demotion of civil servants for political reasons and made it illegal to demand political contributions or campaign activities from employees. The act established the Civil Service Commission to oversee the implementation of these reforms.\n\nOver time, the Pendleton Act has been expanded and modified, but it remains a cornerstone of the U.S. civil service system, ensuring that government jobs are awarded based on merit and competence rather than political connections.\n\n**Other Options Explained:**\n\nA. **Truman Doctrine** - This was a foreign policy principle set forth by President Harry S. Truman in 1947, which committed the United States to supporting free peoples who were resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or outside pressures, especially from the Soviet Union. It was not related to civil service reform.\n\nB. **Fair Labor Standards Act of 1961** - This act, also known as the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, modified the original Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. It extended minimum wage and overtime protections to additional workers, such as those in retail and service industries. It did not address civil service hiring practices.\n\nC. **National Industrial Recovery Act** - Passed in 1933 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, this act aimed to stimulate economic recovery during the Great Depression by authorizing business codes to regulate fair competition and set standards for hours and wages. It was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935 and was replaced by other legislation. It did not pertain to civil service reform.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is D. Pendleton Act of 1883, as it was the legislation that replaced the spoils system with a merit-based approach to hiring in the civil service."
