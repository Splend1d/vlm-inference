Hurting someone without their consent is generally considered morally wrong. So, in this case, the main character is doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I brought a file tool into the courtroom in case my verdict was guilty.\"\n\nThis seems unusual. Bringing a file tool into a courtroom could be seen as bringing a weapon or a potential weapon into a secure area. Courtrooms have security measures to prevent such things for safety reasons. Additionally, having a file tool could be interpreted as having intent to cause harm or escape, which is not aligned with the purpose of a courtroom. Therefore, this action could also be considered morally wrong because it disrespects the rules and safety of the courtroom.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A}} \\]"
