                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the most important festival is for Sikhs. The options are Holi, Divali, Baisakhi Day, and Hola Mahalla. I know that Sikhs have their own holidays, but I'm a bit confused about which one is the most important.\n\nFirst, I remember that Holi is a Hindu festival known as the \"festival of colors.\" It's celebrated by Hindus all over the world, but I'm not sure if it holds the same significance for Sikhs. Maybe it's important for some Sikhs, but I don't think it's their most significant festival.\n\nNext, Divali, also known as Diwali, is another Hindu festival that celebrates the victory of light over darkness. It's a major holiday in Hinduism, but again, I'm not sure about its importance in Sikhism. Although Sikhs do celebrate Divali, I suspect there might be a more central festival specific to their religion.\n\nNow, Baisakhi Day sounds familiar. I think it's also known as Vaisakhi, and I believe it's important for Sikhs. From what I recall, Vaisakhi marks the founding of the Khalsa, which is the collective body of all initiated Sikhs. That seems pretty significant. It's a day when Sikhs commemorate the formation of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. So, this could very well be the most important festival for Sikhs.\n\nLastly, Hola Mahalla is a Sikh martial arts festival that takes place the day after Holi. It was started by Guru Gobind Singh as a way to train his followers in martial skills. While it's an important part of Sikh heritage and culture, I don't think it holds the same level of significance as Vaisakhi.\n\nComparing all these options, I think Baisakhi Day, or Vaisakhi, is the most important festival for Sikhs because it marks the establishment of the Khalsa, which is a fundamental aspect of Sikh identity and religion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
