After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage from Jane Addams' \"Twenty Years at Hull House.\" So, the context is a meeting of working girls at Hull House during a strike at a large shoe factory. It seems like these women were facing tough times, especially those who were paying board and were worried about being evicted if they fell behind on payments. One of them suggests having their own boarding club where they could support each other during strikes or hardships. This idea gains momentum, and soon they rent and furnish apartments near Hull House, with the Settlement providing some initial support but the members managing everything else themselves.\n\nSo, the passage is about these working women organizing themselves to create a mutual support system, specifically a boarding club, to help each other during times of struggle, like strikes. It's clear that this was a cooperative effort where they pooled resources and managed their own affairs.\n\nNow, the question is asking which political goal this perspective would most directly support. The options are:\n\nA. Women's suffrage\n\nB. Trust-busting\n\nC. Greater rights for unions\n\nD. Weakening political machines\n\nFirst, let's consider women's suffrage, which is the right for women to vote. While the passage involves women organizing and taking charge of their own welfare, it doesn't directly address the right to vote or political representation. So, while it might indirectly support women's suffrage by empowering women, it's not directly about voting rights.\n\nNext, trust-busting: this refers to the government's efforts to break up large monopolistic corporations, often referred to as trusts. The passage mentions a strike at a large shoe factory, which could imply that the women were working in a potentially exploitative environment. However, the focus is more on the workers' struggle and their self-help initiative rather than attacking large corporations or trusts specifically. So, while there might be some connection, it's not directly supporting trust-busting.\n\nOption C is greater rights for unions. The context is a strike, which is a labor action typically organized by unions to negotiate better working conditions or wages. The passage highlights the difficulties faced by the strikers, particularly those who were boarders and feared eviction. The idea of a boarding club seems aimed at providing a safety net for workers during strikes, allowing them to support each other and stand firm in their demands. This suggests a support for workers' solidarity and potentially for union activities. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nLastly, weakening political machines: political machines were urban political organizations that traded favors and jobs for votes, often engaging in corruption. While Hull House and settlement houses in general were involved in various social reforms and sometimes in political reform movements, this particular passage doesn't directly address political machines or corruption. It's more focused on the immediate needs and struggles of working women.\n\nConsidering all this, the perspective in the passage most directly supports greater rights for unions. The context of a strike, the difficulties faced by workers, and the creation of a mutual support system to strengthen workers' bargaining power all align with union goals. Additionally, by providing a safety net during strikes, the boarding club would enable workers to sustain longer strikes, potentially leading to better outcomes in labor negotiations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Greater rights for unions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
