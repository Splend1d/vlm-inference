                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about arenaviruses and their predominant locations worldwide. The options are SE Asia, Russia, Africa and S. America, and N. America. I need to figure out which of these areas arenaviruses are mostly found.\n\nFirst, I should recall what arenaviruses are. Arenaviruses are a family of viruses that cause diseases in humans, mostly hemorrhagic fevers and encephalitis. Some well-known diseases caused by arenaviruses include Lassa fever, Machupo virus, and Lujo virus.\n\nNow, I need to think about where these viruses are commonly found. I remember that Lassa fever is prevalent in West Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. So, that points towards Africa as one of the main regions.\n\nAdditionally, I think some arenaviruses are found in South America. For example, the Machupo virus, which causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, is found in Bolivia. There's also the Junin virus, which causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever, found in Argentina. So, South America seems to be another region where arenaviruses are predominant.\n\nLooking back at the options, SE Asia, Russia, and North America don't seem to be the primary areas associated with arenaviruses based on my current knowledge. I don't recall any major arenavirus outbreaks in these regions.\n\nWait a minute, is there any arenavirus found in North America? I think there is the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is an arenavirus found in the Americas, including the United States. It's primarily spread by rodents and can cause meningitis in humans. So, perhaps North America does have some presence of arenaviruses.\n\nHowever, compared to the severity and prevalence of arenavirus diseases in Africa and South America, the impact in North America seems relatively minor. Lassa fever and other African arenavirus diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality, and similar situations occur with some South American arenaviruses.\n\nRussia and SE Asia don't seem to be prominent areas for arenaviruses based on my knowledge. I don't recall any arenavirus outbreaks or endemic areas in these regions.\n\nTherefore, considering the information I have, it seems that Africa and South America are the regions where arenaviruses are predominately located.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Africa and S. America.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
