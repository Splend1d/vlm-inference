                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about therapy. It's asking about a type of therapy that combines both behavioral and cognitive interventions. The options are:\n\nA. counterconditioning\n\nB. symptom substitution\n\nC. primary preventions\n\nD. systematic desensitization\n\nFirst, I need to understand what behavioral and cognitive interventions are. Behavioral interventions focus on changing behaviors through techniques like reinforcement and conditioning. Cognitive interventions, on the other hand, aim to change thought patterns and perceptions.\n\nSo, the therapy that combines both would be one that works on changing both thoughts and behaviors simultaneously.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Counterconditioning: This is a behavioral technique where a person learns a new response to a stimulus that replaces an unwanted one. For example, if someone is afraid of dogs, counterconditioning might involve associating dogs with positive experiences to reduce fear. It seems more focused on behavior than cognition.\n\nB. Symptom substitution: This isn't a specific type of therapy; it's more of a concept where one undesirable behavior is replaced with another, perhaps less harmful behavior. For example, a smoker might chew gum instead of smoking. Again, this seems behavior-focused.\n\nC. Primary preventions: This refers to interventions aimed at preventing problems before they occur, often by promoting healthy behaviors and resilience. While it can include both behavioral and cognitive strategies, it's not a specific type of therapy.\n\nD. Systematic desensitization: This is a behavioral technique used to treat phobias and anxiety disorders. It involves exposing the person to the feared object or situation in a gradual and controlled way while teaching relaxation techniques to manage anxiety. This seems to combine behavioral exposure with cognitive strategies for managing anxiety.\n\nWait, but is systematic desensitization purely behavioral or does it incorporate cognitive elements?\n\nI recall that in systematic desensitization, the person is taught relaxation techniques, which could be seen as a cognitive intervention because it involves learning to control one's mental state. So, perhaps it does combine both.\n\nBut is there a therapy that more explicitly combines behavioral and cognitive approaches?\n\nActually, I think the term for therapy that combines both is cognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT. But that's not one of the options here.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them directly say \"cognitive-behavioral therapy,\" so maybe the question is trying to identify which of these involves elements of both.\n\nLet me consider again:\n\n- Counterconditioning: More behavioral.\n\n- Symptom substitution: Behavioral.\n\n- Primary preventions: Can include both but not a specific therapy.\n\n- Systematic desensitization: Behavioral with some cognitive elements.\n\nHmm, perhaps systematic desensitization is the closest, as it involves both exposure (behavioral) and relaxation techniques (which could be cognitive).\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me, and none of these perfectly fit the description of combining both behavioral and cognitive interventions.\n\nOr perhaps the correct answer is \"primary preventions\" because it can involve both behavioral and cognitive strategies in prevention.\n\nBut that seems a bit vague.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up each term to be sure.\n\nFirst, counterconditioning: It's a behavioral technique where a new response is taught to replace an existing one. For example, teaching someone to feel relaxed around spiders instead of fearful. So, it's mainly behavioral.\n\nSymptom substitution: This is when one\u4e0d\u826f\u4e60\u60efis replaced with another, perhaps less harmful one. For example, biting nails instead of smoking. Again, behavioral.\n\nPrimary preventions: These are interventions designed to prevent problems from occurring in the first place. They can include both behavioral and cognitive strategies, like teaching stress management techniques or promoting healthy lifestyles. But it's not a specific type of therapy.\n\nSystematic desensitization: This is a type of behavioral therapy for phobias where the person is gradually exposed to the feared object or situation while learning relaxation techniques. So, it combines exposure (behavioral) with relaxation training (which could be considered cognitive).\n\nGiven these definitions, systematic desensitization seems to be the option that most closely combines both behavioral and cognitive interventions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. systematic desensitization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
