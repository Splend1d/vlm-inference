One October, his beloved baseball team was playing in the playoffs and he wanted to place a large bet on his team. He told one of his employees that he wanted to bet $10,000 on his team to win the championship, but that he did not have the time to travel to the casino to place the bet. He then told his employee that he wanted the employee to travel to the casino and place the bet for him. The businessman and the employee agreed that the employee would travel to the casino, place a $10,000 bet for the businessman and then immediately return. In exchange, the employee would be paid $500. The parties reduced this agreement to writing. After the agreement was signed, the businessman handed the employee $10,000 and a round-trip airline ticket. The businessman then told the employee that he would be paid $500 after the employee returned. The employee arrived the next day and immediately went to the casino. There he noticed that the marquis in the parking lot was unlit and covered in a banner that read, \"Casino Temporarily Closed Due to Renovations. \" Unable to reach the businessman by telephone, the employee placed the bet at another gaming establishment located next door to the casino. The following morning, the employee flew back and gave the betting receipt to the businessman. When the businessman saw that the bet had been made at another gaming establishment, he angrily told the employee, \"I purposely directed you to wager that $10,000 at the casino. Since you failed to follow my instructions, the deal's off. \" As a result, the businessman refused to pay the employee the $500.

One time, he wants to bet $10,000 on his team to win the championship but doesn't have time to go to the casino himself. He asks his employee to do it for him and they agree that the employee will get $500 for this favor. They even wrote it down and signed the agreement.\n\nThe businessman gives the employee $10,000 and a round-trip ticket. The employee goes to the casino, but when he gets there, he sees that the casino is temporarily closed for renovations. The marquee in the parking lot is unlit, and there's a banner saying it's closed. The employee can't reach the businessman, so he decides to place the bet at another gaming place right next door.\n\nThe next morning, the employee comes back and gives the businessman the betting receipt, but it's from this other gaming establishment, not the original casino they agreed on. The businessman gets angry because the employee didn't follow his instructions exactly and refuses to pay the $500, saying the deal is off.\n\nNow, if the employee sues for breach of contract, what will the court likely decide about the employee placing the bet at another gaming place instead of the casino?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Breach of contract.\n\nB. Modification.\n\nC. Constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed.\n\nD. Discharge by impossibility.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these means.\n\nA. Breach of contract: This is when one party doesn't fulfill their obligations as per the contract terms. If the employee was supposed to place the bet at the casino but didn't, that could be a breach.\n\nB. Modification: This is when the original terms of the contract are changed with the agreement of both parties. Did the employee and businessman agree to change where the bet was placed?\n\nC. Constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed: This is a bit tricky. A condition precedent is something that must happen before a party has to perform their part of the contract. \"Substantially performed\" means that even if there are some minor deviations, the main purpose was achieved.\n\nD. Discharge by impossibility: This is when performance of the contract becomes impossible due to some event beyond the control of the parties.\n\nLet's think about the situation.\n\nThe original agreement was for the employee to place a $10,000 bet at the casino and then come back immediately. In exchange, the employee would get $500.\n\nBut when the employee got there, the casino was closed for renovations. So, it was impossible to place the bet there at that time.\n\nThe employee, unable to reach the businessman, decided to place the bet at another gaming establishment next door.\n\nNow, did this constitute a breach of contract?\n\nWell, technically, the employee didn't place the bet at the casino as instructed. So, from that perspective, it could be seen as a breach.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the casino was closed, so it was impossible to place the bet there. The employee acted to fulfill the purpose of the agreement by placing the bet elsewhere to ensure that the businessman's wager was made.\n\nOption B, modification, suggests that the terms of the contract were changed. However, there's no evidence that the businessman agreed to change where the bet was placed. The employee made this decision on his own.\n\nOption C, constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed, is a bit complex. A condition precedent is something that must happen before a party has to perform. In this case, perhaps the condition was that the casino was open, but it wasn't. The employee then placed the bet elsewhere, which might be considered substantial performance if the main goal was to place the bet, regardless of the location.\n\nOption D, discharge by impossibility, suggests that because the casino was closed, it was impossible to perform the original agreement. However, the employee did place the bet elsewhere, so the objective was still achieved.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most likely answer is C. Constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe main purpose of the agreement was for the employee to place a $10,000 bet on the businessman's team to win the championship. The specific location was the casino, but since it was closed, the employee placed the bet at another gaming establishment.\n\nThe businessman's goal was to have the bet placed, and that was achieved, even if not at the exact location specified.\n\nIn contract law, substantial performance is when one party has essentially fulfilled their obligations, despite some minor deviations from the contract terms.\n\nIn this case, placing the bet at a different gaming establishment might be considered a minor deviation, especially since the casino was closed and inaccessible.\n\nTherefore, the employee substantially performed his duties, and the businessman should still pay the $500.\n\nOption A, breach of contract, might seem plausible at first, but considering the circumstances, it's likely that the court would see the employee's actions as reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nOption B, modification, isn't applicable because there was no agreement to change the terms of the contract.\n\nOption D, discharge by impossibility, could be considered, but since the employee did place the bet elsewhere, the impossibility was circumvented.\n\nHence, C seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
