There is no direct return on investment in building security systems.\n\nB. Security systems are detrimental to usability and can make IT systems less functional, and therefore less attractive to the consumer.\n\nC. There is pressure to reduce the time it takes to get a new IT product or system onto the market, so security systems are sacrificed in order to reduce the time-to-market.\n\nD. All of these options.\n\nTo answer this, I need to think about the priorities in commerce and marketing and how they might conflict with IT security.\n\nOption A suggests that there's no direct return on investment (ROI) in security systems. From a business standpoint, ROI is crucial because companies need to see a tangible benefit from their investments. Security investments often prevent problems rather than generating direct revenue, which can make it hard to justify the cost. However, security breaches can lead to significant losses, so investing in security can be seen as risk mitigation rather than a direct ROI.\n\nOption B points out that security systems can compromise usability, making IT systems less user-friendly and potentially less attractive to consumers. In marketing, user experience is key, and anything that hinders usability could deter potential customers. For example, complex authentication processes might secure a system but frustrate users, leading them to seek alternatives with easier access.\n\nOption C highlights the pressure to expedite time-to-market for new IT products or systems. In competitive markets, being first to market can give a company a significant advantage. However, rushing a product to market might mean cutting corners on security to meet deadlines. This can leave the product vulnerable to exploits, which could damage the company's reputation and lead to financial losses.\n\nConsidering these points, all three options present significant obstacles to developing IT security from a commerce and marketing perspective. Option D suggests that all of these are issues, which seems plausible because each presents a different challenge:\n\n- Option A deals with the financial justifiability of security investments.\n\n- Option B addresses the trade-off between security and user experience.\n\n- Option C focuses on the conflict between rapid product release and thorough security implementation.\n\nGiven that all three are valid concerns in commerce and marketing, it's likely that the correct answer is D. All of these options present significant obstacles to developing IT security.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose the most significant obstacle, I might lean towards Option C: the pressure to reduce time-to-market. This is because time-to-market pressures can lead to both inadequate security investments (Option A) and compromises in usability for the sake of expedience (Option B). In other words, the rush to launch a product can cause companies to overlook security and usability, prioritizing speed over these critical aspects.\n\nBut since the question asks for the most significant obstacle and Option D encompasses all options, it's probably the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
