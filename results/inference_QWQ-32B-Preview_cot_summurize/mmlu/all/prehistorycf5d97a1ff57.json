The question is: \"A place where people lived and/or worked and where the physical evidence of their existence can be recovered is an archaeological:\n\nA. artifact.\n\nB. sample.\n\nC. site.\n\nD. culture.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of these terms\u2014artifact, sample, site, or culture\u2014best describes a place where people lived or worked and left behind physical evidence.\n\nFirst, let's think about what each of these terms means in the context of archaeology.\n\nAn \"artifact\" is usually an object made or modified by humans. It could be a tool, a piece of pottery, a weapon, anything like that. So, an artifact is a specific item, not a place.\n\nA \"sample\" in archaeology might refer to a small portion of material taken from a larger whole for analysis. For example, a soil sample or a sample of plant remains. Again, this seems more like a part of the evidence rather than the place where evidence is found.\n\nA \"site\" is a location where human activity occurred in the past, and where physical evidence of that activity is preserved. This could be a settlement, a burial ground, a workshop, or any other place where people carried out their daily activities.\n\nLastly, \"culture\" in archaeology refers to a way of life of a particular group of people, including their customs, beliefs, and material achievements. It's more abstract and refers to the overall characteristics of a society, not a specific place.\n\nGiven these definitions, it seems like \"site\" is the term that best fits the description provided in the question. A site is indeed a place where people lived and/or worked, and where the physical evidence of their existence can be recovered.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider the other options again. Artifact is too specific, referring to individual objects rather than a location. Sample is a part of the evidence, not the place itself. Culture is too broad and abstract, referring to the entire way of life rather than a particular location.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. site.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
