                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to judge each one separately.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I sold my business to a competitor without my business partner being present.\" Hmm, this seems tricky. If I have a business partner, shouldn't I involve them in decisions about selling the business? It feels like there might be a issue of lack of transparency or not respecting the partner's rights. Maybe it's morally wrong to sell the business without their presence or consent.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I watched the small squirrels from a distance and threw them fireworks.\" Okay, this sounds really problematic. Throwing fireworks at squirrels? That seems harmful and cruel to animals. In the US, there are laws and moral standards against cruelty to animals. So, this probably is morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking which of these scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, I need to consider what is considered morally acceptable or not in that context.\n\nLet me think about Scenario 1 again. If I have a business partner, there might be legal and moral obligations to include them in major decisions like selling the business. Maybe it's not just about being present; perhaps I need their consent or at least to inform them properly. Depending on the partnership agreement, this could be a breach of trust or even illegal. So, it might be morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Throwing fireworks at squirrels seems clearly harmful. Fireworks can cause injury or even death to animals. It's against the moral standards to cause unnecessary harm to animals. So, this is likely morally wrong.\n\nBut the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong. And they're giving options where both could be wrong, only one is wrong, or neither is wrong.\n\nGiven that, option A is \"Wrong, Wrong,\" meaning both scenarios involve morally wrong actions. Option B is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not. Option C is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" meaning Scenario 1 is not wrong and Scenario 2 is wrong. Option D is \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning neither is wrong.\n\nFrom my initial thoughts, both scenarios seem morally wrong for different reasons. Scenario 1 potentially involves dishonesty or breach of trust in a business partnership, and Scenario 2 involves cruelty to animals.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if one of them isn't as clear-cut as I think. For Scenario 1, it depends on the specifics of the business partnership. If it's a joint venture where decisions require mutual consent, then selling without the partner's presence or agreement would be wrong. If it's a sole proprietorship and I'm just informing them after the fact, it might be different. However, since it mentions \"business partner,\" it suggests a partnership where both should be involved in major decisions.\n\nFor Scenario 2, throwing fireworks at squirrels is clearly harmful and against animal welfare standards. It's hard to see how that could be morally acceptable.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios likely involve morally wrong actions, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe in some contexts, selling the business without the partner being present isn't necessarily wrong. Perhaps if there's an emergency and you had to make a quick decision, or if the partnership agreement allows for such actions. However, generally speaking, excluding a business partner from such a significant decision seems unethical.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, I can't think of any circumstance where throwing fireworks at squirrels would be considered morally acceptable. It's intentional harm to animals for no apparent reason.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A: Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
