Working capital is a measure of a company's liquidity and short-term financial health.\n\nFirst, let's identify the current assets from the balance sheet:\n\n1. Cash and cash equivalents: $200,000\n2. Short-term investments: $100,000\n3. Accounts receivable: $400,000\n4. Inventories: $600,000\n\nPatent (10 years): $300,000 - This is an intangible asset and typically not considered a current asset unless it is expected to be amortized or realized within one year.\n\nEquipment: $100,000 - This is a fixed asset and not a current asset.\n\nAccumulated depreciation: $200,000 - This is a contra-asset account related to fixed assets and not a current asset.\n\nCurrent liabilities: $640,000\n\nNow, sum up the current assets:\n\nCurrent assets = Cash and cash equivalents + Short-term investments + Accounts receivable + Inventories\nCurrent assets = $200,000 + $100,000 + $400,000 + $600,000\nCurrent assets = $1,300,000\n\nNext, calculate working capital:\n\nWorking capital = Current assets - Current liabilities\nWorking capital = $1,300,000 - $640,000\nWorking capital = $660,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $660,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
