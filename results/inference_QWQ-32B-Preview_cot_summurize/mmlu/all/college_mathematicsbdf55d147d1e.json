And I need to figure out what happens to the imaginary axis under this mapping. The options are:\n\nA. the entire real axis\n\nB. a point\n\nC. a ray\n\nD. an open finite interval\n\nOkay, first things first. Since f(z) is analytic and maps the whole complex plane to the real axis, that means for every z in the complex plane, f(z) is a real number. That's interesting.\n\nI know that analytic functions are pretty special. They're differentiable everywhere in the complex plane, which implies a lot of nice properties, like being infinitely differentiable and having a power series representation.\n\nNow, the imaginary axis is all the points where the real part is zero, so z = iy, where y is real.\n\nSo, f(iy) should be real for all real y, because the imaginary axis is being mapped to the real axis.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the entire finite complex plane is mapped into the real axis. So, actually, for every z in the complex plane, f(z) is real. That includes the imaginary axis, but it's stronger than that.\n\nHmm. So, f(z) is real for all z in the complex plane.\n\nI recall that if a function is analytic and its imaginary part is zero everywhere, then... well, that sounds like the function is constant. Because if f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y), and v(x, y) = 0 everywhere, and f is analytic, then by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, both u_x = v_y = 0 and u_y = -v_x = 0, which implies that u is constant. So f(z) is constant.\n\nWait, but if f(z) is constant, then the imaginary axis is mapped to a single point, which is that constant value.\n\nBut looking back at the options, B says \"a point.\" So maybe that's the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. If f(z) is constant, say f(z) = c, where c is real, then indeed, the entire complex plane is mapped to that single point c, including the imaginary axis.\n\nAlternatively, is there a non-constant analytic function that maps the entire complex plane to the real axis?\n\nI think not, because of the reasoning above with the Cauchy-Riemann equations. If f is analytic and its imaginary part is zero everywhere, then it must be constant.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that f is constant, and thus the imaginary axis is mapped to a single point.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. a point.\n\nBut wait, is there any other possibility? Maybe if f is not constant, but still maps everything to the real axis?\n\nI don't think so. The Cauchy-Riemann equations force the function to be constant if its imaginary part is zero everywhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f is constant except at some points, but that can't be, because analytic functions are extremely rigid. If they're constant on a set with an accumulation point, they're constant everywhere.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the only possibility is that f is constant, and thus the imaginary axis is mapped to a single point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. a point.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
