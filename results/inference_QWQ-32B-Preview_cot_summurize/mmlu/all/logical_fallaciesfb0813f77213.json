Let's see what each option is saying.\n\nOption A: \"A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.\" Hmm, that sounds possible. Formal validity is about the structure of the argument, whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. Material truth is about whether the content is actually true in reality. So, yeah, you can have an argument that's structured correctly, but the premises or the conclusion could still be false in reality. For example:\n\nAll birds can fly.\nPenguins are birds.\nTherefore, penguins can fly.\n\nThis syllogism is formally valid because the conclusion follows from the premises, but it's materially untrue because penguins can't fly.\n\nOption B: \"A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.\" Wait a minute, that seems to contradict what I just thought. If formal validity doesn't guarantee material truth, then this statement wouldn't be true. In the penguin example, the syllogism is formally valid but materially untrue. So, this option might be the one that's not true.\n\nOption C: \"A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.\" That makes sense. If the syllogism is formally valid and the premises are materially true, then the conclusion should be materially true as well. For example:\n\nAll humans are mortal.\nSocrates is a human.\nTherefore, Socrates is mortal.\n\nThis is both formally valid and materially true.\n\nOption D: \"The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.\" This is reiterating what I thought in option A. Formal validity is about structure, not about the actual truth of the content. So, this seems true.\n\nSo, looking back, option B seems to be asserting something that isn't true, based on my understanding. Formal validity doesn't ensure material truth, as shown in the penguin example.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any scenario where a formally valid syllogism must be materially true? I can't think of one off the top of my head. It seems like material truth depends on the actual content being true, not just the structure being valid.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B: \"A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.\" That's not necessarily the case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
