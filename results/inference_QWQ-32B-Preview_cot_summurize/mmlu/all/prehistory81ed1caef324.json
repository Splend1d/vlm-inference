The question is asking about a method used for building house walls and defensive structures that involves stamped or pounded earth. The options are Hang-t'u, Scapulimancy, Lung-shan, and Qin manufacture.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nHang-t'u sounds familiar. I think it's related to a type of rammed earth construction. Rammed earth is a technique where soil is compacted into molds to create walls. This seems like it could be the answer because it involves pounding or stamping earth.\n\nScapulimancy doesn't sound related to construction. I think scapulimancy is a form of divination where people would look at the patterns on burnt shoulder blades to predict the future. So, that probably isn't the right answer.\n\nLung-shan seems like it might be related to a specific period in Chinese history or a type of pottery. I recall that Lung-shan is associated with a Neolithic culture in China known for its black pottery. Maybe it has something to do with construction, but I'm not sure.\n\nQin manufacture probably refers to manufacturing techniques during the Qin dynasty, which is known for standardization and mass production, especially in the context of the Terracotta Army. But I don't think this directly relates to construction methods for walls.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I think Hang-t'u is the most likely answer. It sounds like it involves rammed earth, which is consistent with stamped or pounded earth for construction purposes.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should look up what Hang-t'u is. According to my knowledge, Hang-t'u is indeed a Chinese term for rammed earth construction. It was a common building technique in ancient China, used for both domestic and defensive structures like city walls.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is A. Hang-t'u.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
