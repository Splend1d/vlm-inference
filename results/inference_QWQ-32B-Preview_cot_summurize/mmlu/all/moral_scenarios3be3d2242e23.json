This seems like a responsible action, as hospitals often have areas where electronic devices can interfere with medical equipment. So, in this case, the character is doing something that is expected and safe, which is not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character has the flu and still goes to their office Christmas party. This could be considered morally wrong because attending a gathering while sick can potentially spread the flu to others, which could be harmful, especially to those who are more vulnerable, like the elderly or people with weak immune systems. It's generally considered considerate and responsible to stay home when you're sick to prevent spreading illness.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
