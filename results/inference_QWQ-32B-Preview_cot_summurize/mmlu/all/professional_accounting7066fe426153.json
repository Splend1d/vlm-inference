                    "text": "So I have this problem here about depreciation using the double-declining method. Let me see if I can figure this out. Smile Inc. bought a computer for $12,000 on May 1, and it has an estimated salvage value of $1,500 and a 3-year life. I need to find the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the double-declining method is. I think it's an accelerated depreciation method where the depreciation expense is higher in the early years of an asset's life and smaller in later years. The \"double\" means that it's twice the straight-line depreciation rate.\n\nOkay, so step one is to find the straight-line depreciation rate. Since the asset has a 3-year life, the straight-line rate would be 100% divided by 3, which is about 33.33% per year. But for the double-declining method, I need to double that rate, so it would be 66.67% per year.\n\nNow, I need to apply this rate to the book value of the asset at the beginning of the period. The book value starts at the cost of the asset, which is $12,000.\n\nBut wait, the asset was purchased on May 1, and we're looking at the year ending December 31. That means the asset was in use for 8 months in the first year.\n\nHmm, does the double-declining method prorate the depreciation based on the number of months the asset was in use? I'm not sure. Maybe I need to calculate the full year's depreciation and then take a fraction for the 8 months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the method is applied on an annual basis, and since it's a partial year, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nLet me try both approaches and see which one makes sense.\n\nFirst approach: Calculate the full year's depreciation and then prorate for 8 months.\n\nSo, full year's depreciation at 66.67% of $12,000 would be $12,000 * 0.6667 = approximately $8,000.\n\nThen, for 8 months, it would be $8,000 * (8/12) = $5,333.33.\n\nThat seems like a possible answer.\n\nSecond approach: Calculate the depreciation based on the asset being in use for 8 months from the beginning.\n\nIn this case, maybe the depreciation rate needs to be applied from the date of purchase.\n\nSo, from May 1 to December 31 is 8 months, which is 8/12 or 2/3 of the year.\n\nSo, perhaps I should apply 2/3 of the full year's depreciation.\n\nBut wait, in the double-declining method, depreciation is calculated on the book value at the beginning of the period.\n\nBut since the asset was purchased in May, the book value for the remaining 8 months is $12,000.\n\nSo, maybe I should calculate the full year's depreciation and then take 8/12 of that.\n\nThat seems similar to the first approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to adjust the depreciation rate for the partial year.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me look up the double-declining balance method to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nOkay, according to what I'm reading, the double-declining balance method calculates depreciation based on twice the straight-line rate applied to the book value at the beginning of the period.\n\nAnd book value is the cost minus accumulated depreciation.\n\nIn the first year, the book value is the full cost, since no depreciation has been taken yet.\n\nSo, for a 3-year life, the straight-line rate is 33.33%, and double that is 66.67%.\n\nSo, the first year's depreciation would be $12,000 * 66.67% = $8,000.\n\nBut since the asset was purchased in May, it was only in use for 8 months.\n\nSo, do I need to prorate that $8,000 over 8 months?\n\nIf so, then $8,000 * (8/12) = $5,333.33.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the depreciation for the full year and then adjust for the salvage value.\n\nBut salvage value is considered at the end of the asset's life, right?\n\nWait, no. In the double-declining method, you don't consider the salvage value until the last year.\n\nSo, in years 1 and 2, you depreciate based on the book value and the double-declining rate, and in the last year, you adjust to make sure the book value doesn't go below the salvage value.\n\nBut in this case, since it's only been one year, and the asset has a 3-year life, we're still in the first period.\n\nSo, perhaps the depreciation for the first year is $8,000, and since it was only in use for 8 months, it's $5,333.\n\nBut looking back at the options, $5,333 is one of the choices, but so is $8,000.\n\nI'm not sure which one is correct.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the double-declining method is applied on an annual basis, and since the asset was purchased mid-year, I need to prorate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the full year's depreciation is taken in the year of purchase.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, because the asset wasn't in use for the full year.\n\nWait, maybe it depends on the company's policy or the accounting standards being followed.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nMaybe I should calculate the depreciation for the full period the asset was in use.\n\nIt was purchased on May 1 and the year ends on December 31, so that's 8 months.\n\nSo, the asset was in use for 8 months in the first year.\n\nThe full year's depreciation would be $8,000, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, prorated for 8 months, it would be $5,333.33.\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the remaining book value after the first year.\n\nBut since it's only been 8 months, maybe I need to adjust the depreciation rate accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of monthly depreciation.\n\nIf the full year's depreciation is $8,000, then monthly depreciation would be $8,000 / 12 = $666.67 per month.\n\nFor 8 months, that would be $666.67 * 8 = $5,333.33.\n\nAgain, that matches.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSome companies might choose to take a full year's depreciation in the year of purchase if the asset is purchased in the first few months.\n\nBut in this case, it was purchased in May, which is the fifth month, so it's been in use for 8 months, which is less than a full year.\n\nSo, prorating seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the depreciation is calculated based on the number of days the asset was in use.\n\nBut that might be more complicated.\n\nI think prorating based on months is sufficient for this problem.\n\nSo, according to this, the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31 would be $5,333.33.\n\nLooking back at the options, C is $5,333, which matches this.\n\nBut wait, option A is $8,000, which is the full year's depreciation.\n\nMaybe some people would choose that, thinking that the double-declining method applies the full year's depreciation regardless of the purchase date.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right to me, because the asset wasn't in use for the full year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the double-declining method, you apply the full year's depreciation in the year of purchase, even if it's purchased mid-year.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should look for a reference or an example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the depreciation is calculated based on the remaining life of the asset at the beginning of the year.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nGiven the confusion, and since $5,333 is one of the options, and it makes sense based on prorating the full year's depreciation, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. $5,333.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C.\\ 5,333} \\]"
