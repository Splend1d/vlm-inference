                    "text": "So I've got this question here about lactase non-persisters worldwide. It's asking for the approximate percentage of people who are lactase non-persisters. The options are A. 45%-50%, B. 70%-75%, C. 10%-15%, and D. 30%-35%. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst off, I know that lactase is an enzyme that helps us digest lactose, which is a sugar found in milk and dairy products. So, if someone has lactase deficiency, their body doesn't produce enough lactase, which can lead to lactose maldigestion. That means they might have trouble breaking down lactose, which could cause symptoms like bloating, gas, and diarrhea\u2014basically, lactose intolerance.\n\nThe question mentions that infants and children usually have enough lactase, but in adults, there are two groups: lactase-persisters and lactase non-persisters. Lactase persistence means that the person continues to produce lactase into adulthood, so they can digest lactose without issues. On the other hand, lactase non-persisters don't maintain high lactase levels in adulthood, so they might experience lactose intolerance.\n\nNow, I need to find out what percentage of adults worldwide are lactase non-persisters. To do that, I should probably look into the global distribution of lactase persistence and lactase non-persistence.\n\nI recall that lactase persistence is more common in some populations than others. For example, in northern Europe, a lot of people can drink milk without problems, even as adults. That suggests a high rate of lactase persistence in those populations. On the other hand, in many African, Asian, and South American populations, lactase non-persistence is more common.\n\nIn fact, I think the majority of the world's population is lactase non-persistent. I seem to remember that only certain populations have a genetic trait that allows them to continue producing lactase into adulthood.\n\nLet me think about this. If I consider that lactase persistence is a genetic trait that spread in populations with a long history of dairy farming, like in Europe and some African pastoralist groups, then it might be that a minority of the world's population has this trait.\n\nSo, if lactase persistence is less common globally, then lactase non-persistence must be more common. But what's the approximate percentage?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 45%-50%\n\nB. 70%-75%\n\nC. 10%-15%\n\nD. 30%-35%\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that lactase non-persistence is higher than persistence worldwide. So options B or C might be possible, but C is 10%-15%, which seems too low for non-persistence. Wait, no, if persistence is higher, then non-persistence would be lower. But I think persistence is actually the minority trait globally.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIn many parts of the world, especially in Asia and some African regions, lactase non-persistence is the norm. In fact, I've read that up to 90% of adults in some Asian populations are lactase non-persistent.\n\nSimilarly, in some African and South American populations, the rate of lactase non-persistence is also very high.\n\nIn contrast, in northern Europe and some African pastoralist groups, lactase persistence is more common.\n\nSo, if I consider the global population, with a large proportion coming from areas where lactase non-persistence is the norm, then the worldwide percentage of lactase non-persisters should be quite high.\n\nMaybe around 60-70% or higher?\n\nBut looking at the options, B is 70%-75%, which seems plausible.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nI recall that in some studies, the global prevalence of lactase non-persistence is estimated to be around 65-70%.\n\nFor example, in a review I read, the prevalence of lactase non-persistence varies from less than 10% in northern Europe and some African populations, up to nearly 100% in some Asian and South American populations.\n\nGiven that a large portion of the world's population comes from areas with high rates of lactase non-persistence, it makes sense that globally, the majority of adults are lactase non-persisters.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I'd go with option B, 70%-75%.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm not entirely sure, and I might be misremembering the statistics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's option A, 45%-50%, but that seems too low given what I know.\n\nOption C, 10%-15%, seems way off, as that would imply that only a small fraction of the world's population has lactase non-persistence, which contradicts what I've read.\n\nOption D, 30%-35%, also seems low.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that lactase persistence is more common than I think.\n\nBut no, I believe that lactase non-persistence is the ancestral trait, and lactase persistence is a relatively recent evolutionary adaptation in populations with a history of dairying.\n\nTherefore, globally, lactase non-persistence should be more common.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial thought, I'll go with B, 70%-75%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
