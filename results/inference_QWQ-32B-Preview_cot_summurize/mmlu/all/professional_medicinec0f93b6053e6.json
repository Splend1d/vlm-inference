                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 27-year-old guy who's come in because he's noticed some lesions on his penis. He's been healthy up until now, and these lesions have been there for about four weeks without changing in size. He's sexually active with multiple partners, both male and female, but he doesn't use condoms consistently. He doesn't take any medications regularly, drinks a bit on social occasions, and occasionally smokes marijuana.\n\nHis temperature is normal, and there's no lymphadenopathy, which means no swollen lymph nodes. During the exam, the doctor found three small, flesh-colored lesions on the shaft of his penis, each about 10 millimeters in diameter. When the doctor applied a dilute solution of acetic acid to these lesions, they turned white.\n\nSo, I need to figure out what's going on here and what the next step should be in managing this situation. Let's start by trying to identify what these lesions might be.\n\nFirst off, the patient is sexually active with multiple partners and doesn't use condoms consistently. That raises red flags for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The lesions are on his penis, which is a common site for STIs.\n\nHe's 27 years old, which is within the age range where sexually transmitted infections are more common, especially with his sexual habits.\n\nThe lesions are described as sessile, meaning they're flat and don't have a stem or base. They're flesh-colored, which suggests they might be the same color as the surrounding skin, and they're nontender, meaning they don't hurt when touched.\n\nThey've been there for four weeks without changing in size, which is interesting. That suggests they're not something acute or inflamed.\n\nWhen the doctor applied acetic acid, they turned white. Acetic acid is often used in medical exams to highlight certain types of lesions, particularly those caused by human papillomavirus, or HPV.\n\nSo, HPV comes to mind here. HPV can cause genital warts, which are small growths or lesions in the genital area. These warts can be flesh-colored, sessile, and may turn white when acetic acid is applied.\n\nBut, there are other possibilities too. For example, molluscum contagiosum can cause similar lesions, but they usually have a central umbilication, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause genital lesions, but they're typically ulcerative and can be painful, which isn't the case here since these lesions are nontender.\n\nSyphilis can cause painless ulcers called chancres, but they're usually single and can be firm and raised.\n\nGiven the presentation\u2014multiple, nontender, flesh-colored lesions that turn white with acetic acid\u2014HPV seems like the most likely culprit.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided for the next step in management.\n\nOption A is oral acyclovir therapy. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes\u75c5\u6bd2\u611f\u67d3\uff0c\u5982HSV-1\u548cHSV-2\uff0c\u5f15\u8d77\u751f\u6b96\u5668\u75b1\u75b9\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u75c5\u53d8\u662f\u7531\u4e8eHPV\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u6297\u75c5\u6bd2\u836f\u7269\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76ee\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u7279\u6548\u836f\u7269\u53ef\u4ee5\u6cbb\u6108HPV\u611f\u67d3\u3002\n\n\u9009\u9879B\u662f\u53e3\u670d\u591a\u897f\u73af\u7d20\u6cbb\u7597\u3002\u591a\u897f\u73af\u7d20\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6297\u751f\u7d20\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec6\u83cc\u611f\u67d3\uff0c\u5982\u8863\u539f\u4f53\u6216\u6dcb\u75c5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u75c5\u53d8\u662f\u7531\u75c5\u6bd2\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\uff0c\u5982HPV\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u6297\u751f\u7d20\u662f\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u3002\n\n\u9009\u9879C\u662f\u808c\u8089\u6ce8\u5c04\u9752\u9709\u7d20\u6cbb\u7597\u3002\u9752\u9709\u7d20\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6297\u751f\u7d20\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec6\u83cc\u611f\u67d3\uff0c\u5982\u6885\u6bd2\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6000\u7591\u662f\u6885\u6bd2\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u6839\u636e\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u66f4\u7b26\u5408HPV\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6885\u6bd2\u7684\u786c\u4e0b\u75b3\u3002\n\n\u9009\u9879D\u662f\u51b7\u51bb\u7597\u6cd5\u3002\u51b7\u51bb\u7597\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u6e29\u7834\u574f\u5f02\u5e38\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u6cbb\u7597\u75a3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7531HPV\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u751f\u6b96\u5668\u75a3\u3002\n\n\u8003\u8651\u5230\u75c5\u53d8\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531HPV\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u60a3\u8005\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u51b7\u51bb\u7597\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u9002\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u53bb\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4f20\u67d3\u7ed9\u4ed6\u4eba\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eHPV\u611f\u67d3\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6297\u75c5\u6bd2\u836f\u7269\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u9664\u75c5\u6bd2\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6cbb\u7597\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u5bf9\u75c7\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u75c5\u53d8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u662f\u8fdb\u884c\u51b7\u51bb\u7597\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u9009\u9879D\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u4e9b\u68c0\u67e5\u6765\u786e\u8ba4\u8bca\u65ad\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884cHPV DNA\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5bf9\u75c5\u53d8\u8fdb\u884c\u6d3b\u68c0\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u533b\u751f\u5df2\u7ecf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u918b\u9178\u767d\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u521d\u6b65\u8bca\u65adHPV\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u75c5\u53d8\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u6027\u4f34\u4fa3\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684 condom \u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u75be\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec HIV\u3001\u6885\u6bd2\u3001\u6dcb\u75c5\u3001\u8863\u539f\u4f53\u7b49\u3002\n\n\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u51b7\u51bb\u7597\u6cd5\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u7ba1\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u6700\u9002\u5f53\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
