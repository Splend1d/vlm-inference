                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about externalities imposed on the world's poor by wealthy nations' economic activities. The options are unequal social order, authoritarian regimes, crime, and pollution. I think the answer might be pollution, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an externality is. In economics, an externality is a cost or benefit that affects someone who is not directly involved in an activity or transaction. So, if wealthy nations engage in certain economic activities that impose costs on poor nations, that would be an externality.\n\nOption A is \"unequal social order.\" While it's true that there is inequality between wealthy and poor nations, I'm not sure if this is directly an externality imposed by economic activities. It might be more of a structural issue in the global economy.\n\nOption B is \"authoritarian regimes.\" I don't see a direct link between wealthy nations' economic activities and the type of political regimes in poor countries. Maybe in some cases, but it doesn't seem like a universal externality.\n\nOption C is \"crime.\" Again, while crime exists in poor nations, I don't see a direct connection to the economic activities of wealthy nations. Perhaps in some specific instances, like drug trafficking, but overall, it doesn't seem directly related.\n\nOption D is \"pollution.\" This seems like a strong candidate. Wealthy nations have historically emitted a large amount of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change, affecting poor nations disproportionately. Also, sometimes, wealthy nations export their pollution by sending waste to poorer countries or having factories there that emit pollutants.\n\nLet me consider this further. Climate change is a classic example of an externality where the costs are imposed on others, often the poor, who may not have the resources to adapt. So, pollution seems like a clear choice.\n\nMoreover, there's the issue of resource extraction. Wealthy nations often import resources from poor countries, and the extraction processes can lead to environmental degradation and pollution in those countries.\n\nAnother point is that wealthy nations may have stricter environmental regulations, so companies might move their polluting operations to countries with laxer regulations, imposing the pollution externality on the poor.\n\nI think pollution is the most appropriate answer here. The other options don't seem directly linked to economic activities in the same way.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
