                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out why filibusters are less common in the House of Representatives compared to the Senate. Let's look at each option to see which one makes the most sense.\n\nOption A says that Senate decorum forbids one senator from attempting to stop another's speech. Hmm, I think in the Senate, filibusters are actually a tradition where senators can talk indefinitely to delay voting on a bill. So, it seems like the Senate does allow for filibusters, which are a way to prevent or delay action on a bill. Therefore, this option might not be the reason why filibusters are less likely in the House.\n\nOption B mentions that the House meets for fewer hours per day than the Senate. I'm not sure about the exact meeting hours, but I don't think that's the primary reason for the difference in filibuster occurrences. Filibusters can happen whenever the chamber is in session, so meeting hours might affect the duration but not the likelihood of filibusters.\n\nOption C states that Senate sessions are open to the public, unlike House sessions. Wait, actually, both House and Senate sessions are open to the public. So, this option doesn't make sense because both chambers have public sessions.\n\nOption D says that debate in the House is, in most instances, strictly regulated by the rules. This sounds promising. In the House, there are stricter rules governing debate, including time limits on speeches and restrictions on the topics that can be discussed. This regulation likely makes it harder to conduct a filibuster, which relies on unlimited debate to delay or block action.\n\nComparing this with the Senate, where there are fewer restrictions on debate, senators can speak for as long as they want, provided they remain on topic. This is what allows for filibusters to occur in the Senate.\n\nSo, it seems that the correct answer is D: debate in the House is in most instances strictly regulated by the rules, which makes filibusters less likely to occur there compared to the Senate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
