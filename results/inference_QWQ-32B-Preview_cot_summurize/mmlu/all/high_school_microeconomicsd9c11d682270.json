                    "text": "Let's see. Melanie is buying apples and oranges with her lunch money, and she wants to maximize her utility. Apples cost $1 each, and oranges cost $2 each. Right now, her marginal utility from apples is 12 and from oranges is 18. She's spent all her money already, and I need to figure out if she should change her consumption to get more utility.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the principle of utility maximization. I think it has something to do with the marginal utility per dollar spent on each good being equal. Yeah, that sounds right. So, for Melanie to maximize her utility, the marginal utility per dollar spent on apples should equal the marginal utility per dollar spent on oranges.\n\nLet me calculate that. For apples, the price is $1, and the marginal utility is 12, so the marginal utility per dollar for apples is 12 / 1 = 12. For oranges, the price is $2, and the marginal utility is 18, so the marginal utility per dollar for oranges is 18 / 2 = 9.\n\nSo, MU per dollar for apples is 12, and for oranges, it's 9. Since 12 is greater than 9, Melanie gets more utility per dollar from apples than from oranges. That means she should reallocate her spending to buy more apples and fewer oranges until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\nWait, but let me think about this again. If she buys more apples, their marginal utility might decrease because each additional apple gives her less extra satisfaction. Similarly, if she buys fewer oranges, their marginal utility might increase. So, she needs to adjust her consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is the same for both.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility-maximizing combination of apples and oranges.\n\nBut that can't be right because her MU per dollar is not equal for both goods.\n\nB. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\n\nThis seems to match what I was thinking. Since she gets more MU per dollar from apples, she should buy more apples and fewer oranges.\n\nC. She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\n\nThis would be the opposite of what I think she should do.\n\nD. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both.\n\nWait, this is similar to option B, but it's talking about equal marginal utilities, not equal marginal utility per dollar.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\n\nBut let me double-check. If she increases apples, their MU might decrease, and if she decreases oranges, their MU might increase. So, she needs to keep adjusting until MU_apple / P_apple = MU_orange / P_orange.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, option B is the way to go.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
