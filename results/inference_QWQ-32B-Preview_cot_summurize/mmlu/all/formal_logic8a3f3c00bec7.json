                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I have to translate the logical formula (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C into natural English sentences, using the given key:\n\n- A: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book.\n\n- B: Izzy plays Minecraft.\n\n- C: Emily stops working.\n\nThe formula is (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this formula means logically. The symbol \"\u2228\" stands for \"or,\" \"~\" for \"not,\" and \"\u2283\" for \"implies.\" So, the formula can be read as \"not A or not B implies C.\"\n\nBut to make it more natural in English, I should consider the meaning behind the logical connectives.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. ~A \u2228 ~B: This part means \"not A or not B,\" which can also be expressed using De Morgan's law as \"not (A and B).\" In other words, it's saying that at least one of A or B is not happening.\n\n2. (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C: This means that if at least one of A or B is not happening, then C happens.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. If neither Marina reads a Percy Jackson book nor Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working.\n\nB. If it's not the case that both Marina reads a Percy Jackson book and Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working.\n\nC. Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working.\n\nD. Emily stopping working is a sufficient condition for either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft.\n\nI need to see which of these best captures the meaning of the formula.\n\nOption A says \"neither Marina reads nor Izzy plays,\" which is equivalent to \"~A and ~B.\" But the formula has \"~A or ~B,\" which is different. So option A isn't accurate.\n\nOption B says \"it's not the case that both Marina reads and Izzy plays,\" which is the negation of \"A and B,\" i.e., \"~(A \u2227 B),\" which by De Morgan's law is equivalent to \"~A \u2228 ~B.\" This matches the antecedent of the formula. So, this seems promising.\n\nOption C says \"either Marina not reading or Izzy not playing entails that Emily stops working.\" This directly reflects the structure of the formula: if ~A or ~B, then C. This is a direct translation.\n\nOption D says \"Emily stopping working is a sufficient condition for either Marina not reading or Izzy not playing.\" This seems to reverse the implication. The original formula has (~A \u2228 ~B) implying C, but this option suggests C implying (~A \u2228 ~B), which is the converse and not the same.\n\nSo, between options B and C, both seem to capture the meaning correctly.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check.\n\nOption B: \"If it's not the case that both Marina reads a Percy Jackson book and Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working.\"\n\nThis is indeed equivalent to (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C, since \"not both A and B\" is ~ (A \u2227 B), which is ~A \u2228 ~B.\n\nOption C: \"Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working.\"\n\nThis is another way of saying the same thing: ~A \u2228 ~B entails C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"neither A nor B\" is ~A and ~B, which is stronger than ~A or ~B.\n\nOption D reverses the implication, which is not correct.\n\nTherefore, both options B and C seem to be correct translations of the formula.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Maybe I need to see which one is more natural or precise.\n\nOption B is perhaps more natural in English, as it uses the phrase \"it's not the case that both ... and ...,\" which is a common way to express the negation of a conjunction.\n\nOption C is also correct but might sound a bit more formal or less natural to some readers.\n\nGiven that, option B might be the preferred translation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers only one of them as correct. Since it's a multiple-choice question, there should be only one correct answer.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Incorrect, as explained.\n\nB. Correct.\n\nC. Correct.\n\nD. Incorrect, as it reverses the implication.\n\nSo, if both B and C are correct, but the question expects only one answer, perhaps B is preferred for its natural flow in English.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a subtle difference I'm missing.\n\nLet me check the meaning again.\n\nThe formula is (~A \u2228 ~B) \u2283 C.\n\nOption B: \"If it's not the case that both Marina reads a Percy Jackson book and Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working.\"\n\nThis is logically equivalent to the formula.\n\nOption C: \"Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working.\"\n\nThis is also equivalent, but perhaps slightly less natural.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the question might expect the most natural-sounding translation, option B might be the intended correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
