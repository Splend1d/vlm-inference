                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which criticisms of standard GARCH models can be addressed by EGARCH models. Let's look at each point one by one.\n\nFirst, option (i): \"Estimated coefficient values from GARCH models may be negative.\" In standard GARCH models, the coefficients are typically constrained to be positive to ensure that the variance remains positive. If estimated coefficients are negative, it might violate this positivity constraint. Now, EGARCH models are designed to allow asymmetric effects in volatility, and they model the log of the variance, which can take negative values. So, does EGARCH address the issue of negative coefficients in standard GARCH? I think it does because in EGARCH, the parameters can be positive or negative, and it doesn't constrain them to be positive as in standard GARCH. So, EGARCH can handle situations where the coefficients might be negative.\n\nNext, option (ii): \"GARCH models cannot account for leverage effects.\" Leverage effects refer to the phenomenon where negative shocks (bad news) have a larger impact on volatility than positive shocks of the same magnitude. Standard GARCH models assume that all shocks, whether positive or negative, affect volatility symmetrically. EGARCH models, on the other hand, can capture asymmetric effects, including leverage effects, because they allow the impact of shocks to depend on their sign. So, yes, EGARCH can overcome this limitation of standard GARCH.\n\nOption (iii): \"The responsiveness of future volatility to positive and negative shocks is symmetric under a GARCH formulation.\" This is similar to the previous point. Standard GARCH models assume symmetry in the impact of positive and negative shocks. EGARCH models relax this assumption and allow for asymmetric responses. So, again, EGARCH can handle situations where the responsiveness to positive and negative shocks is different.\n\nFinally, option (iv): \"GARCH models cannot allow for a feedback from the volatility to the returns.\" Standard GARCH models focus on modeling the conditional variance (volatility) of returns but do not directly model the relationship between volatility and returns. In other words, they assume that volatility does not directly affect the level of returns. However, there are extensions like GARCH-in-mean models that allow for such feedback. EGARCH models themselves do not inherently include a feedback from volatility to returns unless specified otherwise. So, I don't think EGARCH specifically addresses this issue compared to standard GARCH.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- (i): EGARCH can handle negative coefficients by not constraining parameters to be positive.\n\n- (ii): EGARCH can account for leverage effects due to its asymmetric specification.\n\n- (iii): EGARCH allows for asymmetric responsiveness to shocks, overcoming the symmetry assumption of standard GARCH.\n\n- (iv): EGARCH does not specifically address feedback from volatility to returns; this would require additional modeling.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
