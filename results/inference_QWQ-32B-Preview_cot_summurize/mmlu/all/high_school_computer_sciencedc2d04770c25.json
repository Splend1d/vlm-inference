                    "text": "Let's analyze this code step by step. We have two input lists, inputList1 and inputList2, and we're creating a resultList that starts off empty. The code goes through each item in inputList1 and checks if that item is found in inputList2 using the IsFound procedure. If it is found in inputList2, it appends that item to resultList.\n\nSo, for every item in inputList1, if it also exists in inputList2, it gets added to resultList. That means resultList will contain only those items that are present in both inputList1 and inputList2.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n\nA. All elements in inputList1 followed by all elements in inputList2. No, that's not what's happening. The code isn't just concatenating the two lists.\n\nB. Only elements that appear in both inputList1 and inputList2. That seems to match what the code is doing. It's finding the common elements between the two lists.\n\nC. Only elements that appear in either inputList1 or inputList2 but not in both lists. That would be the symmetric difference, but our code is appending only items that are in both lists.\n\nD. Only elements that appear in inputList1 but not in inputList2. Wait, no. The code appends items to resultList only if they are found in both lists. So, it's including items that are in both, not excluding those in inputList2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Only elements that appear in both inputList1 and inputList2.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider an example:\n\nSuppose inputList1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nAnd inputList2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nGoing through each item in inputList1:\n\n1 is not in inputList2, so it's not appended.\n\n2 is not in inputList2, so it's not appended.\n\n3 is in inputList2, so it's appended to resultList.\n\n4 is in inputList2, so it's appended to resultList.\n\nSo, resultList = [3, 4], which are the elements present in both lists.\n\nHence, option B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
