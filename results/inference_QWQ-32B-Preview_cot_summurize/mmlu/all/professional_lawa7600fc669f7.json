While new members were pledging the fraternity, the student had a reputation for initiating pranks and hazing the pledges. Late one night, after a fraternity party, the student decided to kidnap one of the pledges. Enlisting the help of his friend, they grabbed the pledge, tied him up, and locked him in the trunk of the student's car. They then drove into the downtown section of a city where they dropped the pledge at a street corner. While the pledge was wandering around and trying to find a telephone booth, a gang of youths saw his predicament and attacked him. The pledge, who was severely beaten, suffered a broken nose, multiple lacerations, and contusions. When the pledge finally returned to the school, he filed a criminal complaint against the student who was charged with violating a state law, which provides:\"Every person who hazes a student and thereby is responsible for causing bodily harm to said student is guilty of a felony punishable by three years in prison. \"At thai, the prosecuting attorney called the student's alleged accomplice as a witness. The friend refused to answer any questions and was cited for contempt. After the friend left the witness stand, the prosecutor offered into evidence a transcript of the friend's testimony given at the student's preliminary hearing. At the preliminary hearing, the friend testified under oath that he and the student were responsible for hazing the pledge and driving the victim against his will to the city.

One night, after a party, he decides to kidnap one of the pledges with the help of his friend. They tie up the pledge, lock him in the trunk of the car, and drop him off in the downtown area. The pledge gets beaten up by a gang and later files a criminal complaint against the student.\n\nThe student is charged with violating a state hazing law that makes it a felony to haze a student and cause bodily harm, punishable by three years in prison. At the trial, the prosecuting attorney calls the student's friend, who was involved in the incident, to testify. The friend refuses to answer questions and is cited for contempt. After the friend leaves the witness stand, the prosecutor wants to submit a transcript of the friend's testimony from the preliminary hearing.\n\nAt the preliminary hearing, the friend testified under oath that he and the student hazed the pledge and drove him against his will to the city. The friend was also cross-examined by the student's defense counsel during the preliminary hearing. The trial court admits the transcript over the defense's objections, and the student is convicted. Now, the student is appealing the conviction, arguing that admitting the transcript violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.\n\nSo, the key issue here is whether using the friend's testimony from the preliminary hearing, where he was cross-examined, but is now unavailable or refusing to testify at trial, violates the student's confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment.\n\nFirst, let's recall what the Sixth Amendment's confrontation clause guarantees. It ensures that a defendant has the right to confront the witnesses against them. This generally means that witnesses should testify in person at trial and be subject to cross-examination.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions where out-of-court statements or prior testimony can be admitted even if the witness is not present at trial. One such exception is when the witness is unavailable, and there has been prior opportunity for cross-examination.\n\nIn this case, the friend is unavailable or refusing to testify at trial, having been cited for contempt. The prosecution wants to use his prior testimony from the preliminary hearing, where he was under oath and was cross-examined by the defense.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Granted, because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial.\n\nWell, actually, there was an opportunity for cross-examination at the preliminary hearing. So, this isn't accurate because the defense did have a chance to cross-examine the witness before.\n\nB. Granted, because in order to admit prior testimony, the witness must be shown to be unavailable.\n\nThis seems relevant. Generally, to admit prior testimony, the witness needs to be unavailable. Unavailability can be due to death, illness, or other reasons that prevent them from testifying. Refusal to testify, like in this case, might also qualify as unavailability.\n\nHowever, even if the witness is unavailable, there needs to be a prior opportunity for cross-examination. In this case, there was cross-examination at the preliminary hearing.\n\nC. Denied, because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for cross-examination at the preliminary hearing.\n\nThis seems plausible. Since the witness is unavailable and was cross-examined previously, admitting the transcript might be acceptable under the confrontation clause.\n\nD. Denied, because the testimony was a statement by a co-conspirator and, therefore, admissible as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nThis is interesting. Co-conspirator statements are indeed an exception to the hearsay rule, meaning they can be admitted even if the declarant doesn't testify, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nHowever, the confrontation clause is separate from the hearsay rule. Just because something is admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule doesn't necessarily mean it complies with the confrontation clause.\n\nIn Crawford v. Washington, the Supreme Court held that testimonial statements by witnesses who don't testify at trial can only be admitted if the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\n\nSo, in this case, the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing was testimonial, and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.\n\nTherefore, admitting the transcript should be permissible under the confrontation clause, provided that the witness is unavailable.\n\nGiven that, option C seems correct: the appeal will most likely be denied because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for cross-examination at the preliminary hearing.\n\nOption D might be tempting, but it's important to note that while the statement might be admissible under the hearsay exception for co-conspirator statements, the confrontation clause requires additional safeguards, such as unavailability and prior cross-examination.\n\nSo, I think C is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
