                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about environmental ethics. It's asking for what a true environmental ethic must hold regarding direct moral standing. The options are:\n\nA. at least some nonhuman beings\n\nB. at least some nonconscious beings\n\nC. both A and B\n\nD. neither A nor B; an environmental ethic may deny that there are any nonhuman and nonconscious beings with direct moral standing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"direct moral standing\" means. As I recall, something has direct moral standing if it is inherently valuable and should be considered for its own sake in moral decision-making. It's not just valuable because of its utility to others.\n\nOption A mentions \"nonhuman beings.\" So, this is referring to animals, plants, maybe even microorganisms. An environmental ethic that gives direct moral standing to nonhuman beings would consider their well-being important in itself, not just for what they provide to humans.\n\nOption B talks about \"nonconscious beings.\" This could include things like trees, rivers, maybe even ecosystems as a whole, since they might not have consciousness but are still part of the environment.\n\nOption C combines both A and B, suggesting that a true environmental ethic should recognize the direct moral standing of both nonhuman and nonconscious beings.\n\nOption D says that an environmental ethic might not grant direct moral standing to any nonhuman or nonconscious beings, implying that only humans or perhaps only conscious beings have moral standing.\n\nNow, I need to think about what a \"true\" environmental ethic would entail. Environmental ethics is about extending moral consideration to the natural world beyond just humans. So, it seems like options A and B are in line with that goal.\n\nSome environmental philosophies, like deep ecology, argue that all living things have intrinsic value, which would support option A. Biocentrism goes even further to include all forms of life, conscious or not, which might align with both A and B.\n\nOn the other hand, anthropocentric views hold that only humans have intrinsic value, but that doesn't seem to fit with the idea of an environmental ethic, which is supposed to be concerned with the environment beyond human interests.\n\nThen there's the concept of ecocentrism, which considers ecological wholes, like ecosystems or bioregions, as having moral standing. Some of these wholes might not be conscious, so that would support option B.\n\nAlso, there's the idea of moral considerability based on sentience or consciousness. Some ethics argue that only beings capable of suffering or experiencing have direct moral standing. That might suggest that nonconscious beings don't have direct moral standing, which could lean towards option D.\n\nBut the question is asking for what a truly environmental ethic must hold. Given that environmental ethics is, by definition, concerned with the environment and often seeks to expand moral consideration beyond humans, it seems unlikely that it would deny moral standing to all nonhuman and nonconscious beings.\n\nSo, option D seems less likely. Option C seems comprehensive, as it includes both nonhuman and nonconscious beings, covering a broad range of entities in the natural world.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are environmental ethics that might only include nonhuman beings but not nonconscious beings, or vice versa.\n\nFor example, some animal rights theories focus on sentient animals, which would be nonhuman beings but might not include nonconscious entities like plants or rivers.\n\nSimilarly, land ethic or ecocentric views might include nonconscious beings like ecosystems or trees, which some argue have intrinsic value regardless of their consciousness.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option C is the most inclusive and therefore the best answer for what a true environmental ethic must hold.\n\nBut I should also consider if there's a consensus in environmental ethics literature. From what I've studied, there isn't a single, unified view on this. Different theories grant moral standing to different entities.\n\nDeep ecology, for instance, proposes that all living beings have intrinsic value. Biocentrism extends this to all forms of life. Ecocentrism includes ecological wholes. And some theories even grant moral standing to abiotic elements like mountains or rivers, perhaps because they are part of the natural system.\n\nGiven this diversity, it's challenging to say that a true environmental ethic must hold one position over others. However, the question seems to be asking for the most inclusive position, which would be C, both A and B.\n\nAlternatively, if an environmental ethic could be considered valid even if it only includes nonhuman beings or only nonconscious beings, then perhaps D could be considered, but that seems contrary to the spirit of environmental ethics, which is to extend moral consideration beyond humans.\n\nMoreover, if an environmental ethic denied moral standing to all nonhuman and nonconscious beings, it would essentially reduce to a human-centered ethic, which might not qualify as an environmental ethic at all.\n\nTherefore, option D seems unlikely.\n\nBetween options A and B, it seems that a comprehensive environmental ethic should include both nonhuman and nonconscious beings, suggesting that C is the best answer.\n\nTo sum up, a truly environmental ethic must hold that both at least some nonhuman beings and at least some nonconscious beings have direct moral standing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
