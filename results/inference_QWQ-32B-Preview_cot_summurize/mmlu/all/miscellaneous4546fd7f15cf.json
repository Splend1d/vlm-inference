I don't wear any of these regularly, so I might need to think this through.\n\nFirst, what's a parka? I think it's like a big, warm coat, usually for cold weather. I've seen people wearing them in winter, and sometimes they have hoods. Actually, a lot of parkas do have hoods to protect against snow and wind. So, that seems likely.\n\nNext, a kilt. I know that's a traditional Scottish garment, like a skirt with lots of pleats, worn by men, right? I don't think kilts have hoods. They're just lower-body clothing, no upper body coverage except maybe a jacket or something separate.\n\nThen, lederhosen. That's another traditional outfit, I think from Germany, like breeches made of leather, often worn by men with a suspenders and a shirt. Again, it's lower-body clothing, doesn't include a hood.\n\nLastly, a sarong. That's a wrap-around cloth, often worn in tropical regions, like in Southeast Asia or Africa. It can be used as a skirt or a dress, but I don't think it comes with a hood.\n\nSo, comparing all these, the parka seems to be the only one that typically has a hood. Kilts, lederhosen, and sarongs are more about covering the lower body or using as a wrap, without any head coverage.\n\nWait a minute, maybe some modern versions of these clothes have hoods added for style or functionality, but I think in their traditional forms, only the parka has a hood.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Parka.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
