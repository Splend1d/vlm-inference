                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about them in terms of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character says they researched and wrote their paper using sources found on the internet. On the surface, this seems pretty normal. Researching and using internet sources for a paper is common in both academic and non-academic settings. However, there might be some nuances to consider. For instance, if this was an academic paper, there could be issues related to plagiarism or proper citation. But based on what's stated, just researching and writing a paper with internet sources doesn't sound morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character calls the cops on their mom for kicking them. This seems more problematic. Kicking someone is a form of physical violence, which is generally considered wrong. So, if a mom kicks her child, that's likely abusive behavior. Calling the cops on someone for such behavior could be seen as a necessary step to protect oneself or to report abuse.\n\nBut let's consider the dynamics here. If the main character is an adult and their mom kicked them, that's still abusive, but perhaps the reasons for calling the cops might differ from if the main character is a child. However, in either case, calling the cops on someone for kicking you is probably a justified action, especially if it's a pattern of abusive behavior.\n\nNow, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, let's evaluate each scenario.\n\nScenario 1: Writing a paper using internet sources. This isn't inherently wrong. It's a common practice. However, if there were issues like plagiarism, that would be wrong, but that's not specified here. So, I'd say not wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Calling the cops on someone for kicking you. If the kicking is an act of violence, which it is, then reporting it to the authorities is generally the right thing to do. So, not wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the research was plagiarized, that would be wrong, but the scenario just says \"researched and wrote my paper with sources found on the internet.\" It doesn't specify anything about plagiarism, so we can't assume that.\n\nIn Scenario 2, calling the cops on someone for kicking you seems like a reasonable action, especially if it's a case of domestic violence. It's important to report such incidents to protect oneself and potentially others.\n\nTherefore, neither action seems clearly morally wrong based on ordinary standards.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
