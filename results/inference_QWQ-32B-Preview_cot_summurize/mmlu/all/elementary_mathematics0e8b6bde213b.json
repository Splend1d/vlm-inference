                    "text": "Let's tackle this division problem step by step. I need to find the quotient of 1,248 divided by 7 and determine the correct option among the given choices.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the division: 1,248 \u00f7 7.\n\nI remember that division involves seeing how many times one number (the divisor) fits into another number (the dividend). Here, the divisor is 7, and the dividend is 1,248.\n\nI'll start by looking at the first digit of the dividend, which is 1. Since 1 is less than 7, I can't divide 7 into 1. So, I'll look at the first two digits: 12.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how many times 7 can go into 12. Let's see:\n\n7 \u00d7 1 = 7\n\n7 \u00d7 2 = 14\n\n14 is greater than 12, so 7 can go into 12 only once. I'll write 1 as the first digit of the quotient.\n\nNow, I'll multiply 1 by 7, which gives me 7, and subtract that from 12:\n\n12 - 7 = 5\n\nSo, I have a remainder of 5. I'll bring down the next digit of the dividend, which is 4, making it 54.\n\nNow, I need to divide 7 into 54.\n\n7 \u00d7 7 = 49\n\n7 \u00d7 8 = 56\n\n56 is greater than 54, so 7 can go into 54 seven times.\n\nI'll write 7 as the next digit of the quotient.\n\nMultiply 7 by 7, which is 49, and subtract that from 54:\n\n54 - 49 = 5\n\nAgain, I have a remainder of 5. Now, I'll bring down the last digit of the dividend, which is 8, making it 58.\n\nNow, divide 7 into 58.\n\n7 \u00d7 8 = 56\n\n7 \u00d7 9 = 63\n\n63 is greater than 58, so 7 can go into 58 eight times.\n\nI'll write 8 as the next digit of the quotient.\n\nMultiply 8 by 7, which is 56, and subtract that from 58:\n\n58 - 56 = 2\n\nSo, the remainder is 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the quotient is 178, and the remainder is 2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 177 remainder 9\n\nB. 168 remainder 2\n\nC. 178 remainder 2\n\nD. 178 remainder 3\n\nOption C matches our calculation.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1,248 \u00f7 7\n\nFirst step: 12 \u00f7 7 = 1, remainder 5\n\nBring down 4: 54 \u00f7 7 = 7, remainder 5\n\nBring down 8: 58 \u00f7 7 = 8, remainder 2\n\nSo, quotient is 178, remainder 2.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can verify by multiplying the quotient by the divisor and adding the remainder to see if I get back to the dividend.\n\n178 \u00d7 7 + 2 = ?\n\n178 \u00d7 7:\n\n100 \u00d7 7 = 700\n\n70 \u00d7 7 = 490\n\n8 \u00d7 7 = 56\n\n700 + 490 = 1,190\n\n1,190 + 56 = 1,246\n\nNow, add the remainder: 1,246 + 2 = 1,248\n\nYes, that matches the dividend, so my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 178 remainder 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
