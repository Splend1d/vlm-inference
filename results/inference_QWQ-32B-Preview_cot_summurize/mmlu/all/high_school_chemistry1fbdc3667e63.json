                    "text": "So I've got this question about electrolysis of molten magnesium bromide. I need to figure out what products are formed at the anode and the cathode. The options are:\n\nA. magnesium at the anode and bromine at the cathode\n\nB. magnesium at the cathode and bromine at the anode\n\nC. magnesium at the cathode and oxygen at the anode\n\nD. bromine at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode\n\nFirst, I need to recall what electrolysis is. Electrolysis is a process that uses an electric current to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction. In this case, it's applied to molten magnesium bromide (MgBr2).\n\nWhen a molten ionic compound is electrolyzed, the positive ions (cations) are attracted to the negative electrode (cathode), where they gain electrons and get reduced. The negative ions (anions) are attracted to the positive electrode (anode), where they lose electrons and get oxidized.\n\nSo, in MgBr2, the ions are Mg2+ and Br-.\n\nAt the cathode (negative electrode):\n\n- Mg2+ ions will gain electrons to form magnesium metal.\n\nThe half-reaction is: Mg2+ + 2e- \u2192 Mg\n\nAt the anode (positive electrode):\n\n- Br- ions will lose electrons to form bromine molecules.\n\nThe half-reaction is: 2Br- \u2192 Br2 + 2e-\n\nSo, based on this, magnesium should be produced at the cathode and bromine at the anode.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. magnesium at the anode and bromine at the cathode - This seems reversed.\n\nB. magnesium at the cathode and bromine at the anode - This matches what I just thought.\n\nC. magnesium at the cathode and oxygen at the anode - Where does oxygen come from? Oxygen isn't in MgBr2.\n\nD. bromine at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode - Hydrogen isn't in MgBr2 either.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider if there are any other species present. In molten salts, sometimes water is present, but MgBr2 is a salt, and when it's molten, it's just ions in a liquid state, right? So, no water involved.\n\nTherefore, the only ions are Mg2+ and Br-.\n\nSo, the reactions should solely produce magnesium and bromine.\n\nOption B seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn electrolysis, cations go to the cathode and anions go to the anode.\n\nMg2+ is the cation, so it goes to the cathode and gets reduced to Mg.\n\nBr- is the anion, so it goes to the anode and gets oxidized to Br2.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nOption C mentions oxygen at the anode, but there's no oxygen in MgBr2.\n\nOption D mentions hydrogen at the cathode, but there's no hydrogen in MgBr2.\n\nSo, unless there's something I'm missing, option B should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there are any other possible reactions or if there's a chance that electrons could be discharged elsewhere.\n\nBut in a pure molten MgBr2, the only ions present are Mg2+ and Br-, so their reactions should be the only ones occurring.\n\nTherefore, magnesium at the cathode and bromine at the anode.\n\nOption B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
