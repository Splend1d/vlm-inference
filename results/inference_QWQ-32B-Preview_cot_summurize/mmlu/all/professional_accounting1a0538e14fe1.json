                    "text": "To determine which of the options cannot be amortized for tax purposes, we need to understand the tax treatment of each type of cost mentioned. Amortization for tax purposes generally refers to the deduction of certain startup and organizational costs over a period of time, rather than immediately.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. **Incorporation costs**: These are costs incurred in forming a corporation, such as legal fees, state filing fees, and other expenses directly related to the incorporation process. Under U.S. tax law, certain startup and organizational costs can be either expensed in the year they are incurred or amortized over a period of 180 months beginning with the month the active trade or business begins.\n\nB. **Temporary directors\u2019 fees**: These are fees paid to directors who serve temporarily, perhaps during the formation phase of a company. Directors' fees are generally considered ordinary and necessary business expenses and can be deducted in the year they are paid. They are not typically subject to amortization.\n\nC. **Stock issuance costs**: These are costs associated with issuing stock, such as underwriting fees, legal fees, and printing costs. Under U.S. tax law, certain costs of issuing stock can be capitalized and amortized over a period of years, or they may be deductible in the year incurred, depending on the specific circumstances and the type of stock issued.\n\nD. **Organizational meeting costs**: These are costs related to meetings held for organizational purposes, such as legal and accounting fees, meeting expenses, and other costs directly related to organizing the business. Like incorporation costs, these can also be subject to amortization over a period of 180 months or expensed in the year incurred, subject to certain limitations.\n\nGiven this information, the key distinction is between costs that can be amortized and those that are typically deductible in the year incurred.\n\n**Temporary directors\u2019 fees** (Option B) are generally deductible in the year they are paid as ordinary business expenses, rather than being amortized over time. Incorporation costs, stock issuance costs, and organizational meeting costs, on the other hand, may qualify for amortization over a specified period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Temporary directors\u2019 fees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
