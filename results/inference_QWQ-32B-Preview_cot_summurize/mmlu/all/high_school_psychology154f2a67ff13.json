                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about kittens and their vision. So, the experiment involved covering one eye at a time every day, switching between the two eyes. As adults, we need to determine what visual limitations they might have.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Unable to make use of interposition depth perception.\n\nInterposition is a monocular cue for depth perception where one object covers another, indicating that it's closer. Since this is a monocular cue, it should still be available to both eyes individually. But because the kittens had experience with each eye separately, they should still be able to use this cue. So, maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nB. Unable to maintain perceptual constancy.\n\nPerceptual constancy is the ability to recognize that an object remains the same even if its appearance changes due to distance, angle, or lighting. This seems more related to object recognition and less directly to the use of eyes. Since the problem is about eye usage and depth perception, this might not be the primary issue here.\n\nC. Unable to distinguish left from right monocular cues.\n\nMonocular cues are those that can be detected with one eye. If the kittens had experience with each eye separately, they should be able to distinguish these cues with each eye individually. So, this doesn't seem like the main problem.\n\nD. Unable to use binocular cues for depth perception.\n\nBinocular cues require both eyes working together to perceive depth, like stereopsis, which is the ability to judge distance and depth based on the slight differences in perspective between the two eyes. Since the kittens had one eye covered alternately, they might not have developed proper binocular vision. This could impair their ability to use binocular cues for depth perception.\n\nThinking about it, binocular vision develops early in life, and if the eyes aren't used together during a critical period, it can lead to problems like amblyopia or lack of stereopsis. So, in this case, since the kittens had one eye covered alternately, their brains might not have learned to combine the inputs from both eyes effectively.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be D. They were unable to use binocular cues for depth perception.\n\nBut let me double-check. If they couldn't use binocular cues, that would affect their depth perception, which aligns with the experimental manipulation.\n\nOption A seems less likely because interposition is a monocular cue, and the kittens had experience with each eye individually.\n\nOption B, perceptual constancy, doesn't seem directly related to the use of eyes or depth perception.\n\nOption C, distinguishing left from right monocular cues, also seems less relevant because monocular cues should be processable by each eye independently.\n\nSo, yeah, D makes the most sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
