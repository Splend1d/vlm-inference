                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Which of the following disorders will most likely result from X chromosome aneuploidy in women?\" and the options are A. Cystic fibrosis, B. Hemophilia, C. Turner syndrome, D. Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"X chromosome aneuploidy\" means. Aneuploidy refers to an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell. Normally, humans have 46 chromosomes, including two sex chromosomes (XX for females and XY for males). So, X chromosome aneuploidy in women would mean they have an abnormal number of X chromosomes, either more or fewer than two.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Cystic fibrosis: I know that cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which is located on chromosome 7. It's an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning it affects both sexes equally and isn't related to the sex chromosomes. So, it's unlikely to be caused by X chromosome aneuploidy.\n\nB. Hemophilia: Hemophilia is caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, specifically the genes for clotting factors. It's an X-linked recessive disorder, which means it's more common in males because they have only one X chromosome. Females can be carriers if they have one mutated X and one normal X, but they usually don't show symptoms unless both X chromosomes are affected. However, X chromosome aneuploidy could potentially affect the expression of these genes, but I'm not sure if it directly causes hemophilia.\n\nC. Turner syndrome: This is a condition where a female has only one X chromosome instead of two (45,X instead of 46,XX). So, this is clearly an X chromosome aneuploidy, specifically monosomy X. Turner syndrome is characterized by various features including short stature, infertility, and certain physical abnormalities. This seems like a direct result of X chromosome aneuploidy in women.\n\nD. Tay-Sachs disease: This is another autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15. Like cystic fibrosis, it's not related to the X chromosome, so it's unlikely to be caused by X chromosome aneuploidy.\n\nComparing all these options, Turner syndrome is the only one that is directly caused by an abnormal number of X chromosomes in females. Cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs are both autosomal recessive disorders, not related to the X chromosome, and hemophilia, while linked to the X chromosome, is not necessarily caused by aneuploidy but by specific gene mutations.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Turner syndrome.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
