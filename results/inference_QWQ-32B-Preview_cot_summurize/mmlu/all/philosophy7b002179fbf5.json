I think he had some thoughts on what that says about their soul or their character.\n\nLet me think about the options given:\n\nA. philosophical ambition - That doesn't seem right. Philosophical ambition would probably be about seeking knowledge and wisdom, not just material things and status.\n\nB. worldly wisdom - Hmm, worldly wisdom might be about being savvy in worldly affairs, but I don't think Socrates viewed pursuing status and wealth as wise. He often talked about the true meaning of wisdom and happiness, and I think he would see that as superficial.\n\nC. exceptional desires - Maybe, but I'm not sure. Exceptional desires could mean extraordinary or unusual desires, but I don't recall Socrates specifically using that term in this context.\n\nD. an unhealthy soul - Now, this rings a bell. Socrates, and Plato in his works, often discussed the health of the soul. They believed that true happiness comes from the well-being of the soul, not from external goods like wealth and status. So, if someone only pursues those external things, maybe their soul is not in a good state.\n\nLet me think back to some of the dialogues we read in class. In the \"Apology,\" Socrates talks about how he doesn't care much for wealth or status, and he's more concerned with pursuing truth and wisdom. In the \"Republic,\" Plato, through Socrates, discusses the idea of the philosopher-king, who has a healthy soul because he pursues knowledge and the good.\n\nSo, if someone is only interested in social status, wealth, power, and pleasure, maybe Socrates would see that as a sign of an unhealthy soul, because they're not pursuing higher goods or nurturing their soul with wisdom and virtue.\n\nAlso, in the \"Phaedo,\" Socrates discusses the immortality of the soul and the importance of caring for it. He suggests that the true philosopher is preparing for death by detaching from worldly things and focusing on the eternal forms.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like Socrates would consider someone who exclusively pursues social status, wealth, power, and pleasure as having an unhealthy soul.\n\nLet me check the other options again to make sure. Philosophical ambition seems opposite to that. Worldly wisdom might be about being shrewd in worldly matters, but I don't think Socrates valued that above spiritual or intellectual pursuits.\n\nExceptional desires might just mean they have unusual desires, but that doesn't capture what Socrates might think about their soul.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D. an unhealthy soul.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
