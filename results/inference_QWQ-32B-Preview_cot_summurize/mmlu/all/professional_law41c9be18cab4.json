                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out the best answer to this real estate question. It's a bit tricky, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, there's this owner who had two adjoining lots, each with a building on them, and these buildings are connected by a party wall, making it a \"twin\" home with two separate residential units. The front entrance is entirely on one of the lots, and the other unit accesses their home through a door in the party wall.\n\nThe owner sold one of the lots, the one with the front entrance, to a buyer, but kept living in the other unit. The deed of sale didn't mention anything about the owner retaining the right to use the doorway that's on the sold lot.\n\nNow, there's a dispute about whether the owner can still use that doorway after selling the lot it's on. We need to figure out what a court would most likely decide.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The owner retained an implied right to an exclusive license by necessity to use the doorway.\n\nB. The buyer can prevent access to the owner because the deed was defective in not reserving a right to use the doorway.\n\nC. The court will automatically order a new deed be drafted containing court-ordered language that includes a reservation of rights.\n\nD. The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of the owner to use the doorway.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these means.\n\nOption A mentions an \"implied right to an exclusive license by necessity.\" An exclusive license would allow the owner to use the doorway without anyone else being able to use it, except perhaps the buyer. \"By necessity\" suggests that this right is essential for the owner to access their property.\n\nOption B says the buyer can prevent access because the deed didn't reserve the right. This implies that without explicitly stating in the deed that the owner retains the right to use the doorway, the buyer can deny access.\n\nOption C suggests that the court will order a new deed to be drafted with the necessary reservations. This seems like a possible solution, but it's not clear if it's the most appropriate immediate decision.\n\nOption D talks about an implied easement by law for the owner to use the doorway. An easement is a non-possessory interest in land that allows the easement holder to use another's property for a specific purpose.\n\nGiven these definitions, I need to think about property law principles, specifically regarding easements and licenses.\n\nFirst, in property law, an easement is generally a right to use another's land for a specific purpose, and it runs with the land, meaning it benefits the land and binds future owners.\n\nA license, on the other hand, is a personal permission to use another's land and does not run with the land. It's generally revocable at will, unless it's irrevocable or creates some interest that can't be revoked.\n\nIn this scenario, the owner sold one lot but kept the other, and the doorway is on the sold lot. The owner needs to access their remaining property through this doorway.\n\nUnder the principles of easements, there's a concept called \"easement by necessity.\" This arises when there's an absolute necessity to use a particular path or right of way that crosses another's land.\n\nIn this case, it seems like there might be a necessity for the owner to use the doorway to access their property, especially if there's no other reasonable way to enter their unit.\n\nHowever, for an easement by necessity to exist, certain conditions must be met:\n\n1. Unity of ownership at some time in the past.\n\n2. Severance of that unity.\n\n3. Necessity for the use in question.\n\nHere, the owner previously owned both lots, so there was unity of ownership. Then, by selling one lot, there's severance. And if the doorway is necessary for access, that would satisfy the necessity requirement.\n\nBut, in this scenario, it's a bit nuanced because there are two residential units, and one has a front entrance while the other uses a party wall door.\n\nWait a minute, the question says that the building was divided into two separate residential units, with a party wall, and one has a front entrance while the other uses a door through the party wall.\n\nSo, if the owner is keeping one unit and selling the other, and the front entrance is on the sold lot, does that mean the owner's unit can only be accessed through the party wall door?\n\nIf that's the case, then there might be an argument for an easement by necessity for the owner to continue using the doorway on the sold lot to access their unit.\n\nBut, the question mentions that there was a building on both lots, separated by a party wall, and it's a \"twin\" home divided into two residential units, with one front entrance and another door through the party wall.\n\nI think the setup is that there are two separate houses, each on their own lot, connected by a party wall, and one of them has the front entrance, while the other has a door through the party wall as its entrance.\n\nWhen the owner sells one lot with the front entrance, and keeps the other, the question is whether the owner retains the right to use that front entrance.\n\nWait, but the owner is keeping one unit and selling the other, and the front entrance is on the sold lot. So, if the owner is keeping the unit that doesn't have the front entrance, but has a door through the party wall, do they need to use the front entrance on the sold lot to access their own unit?\n\nIf that's the case, then there might be a necessity for the owner to continue using that front entrance.\n\nBut, in the description, it says that there's a door through the party wall that the occupants of the adjoining residence use to access their home. So, it sounds like each unit has its own entrance, but one is through the party wall.\n\nIf the owner is keeping the unit that uses the party wall door and selling the one with the front entrance, then perhaps the owner doesn't need to use the front entrance anymore, as they have their own entrance through the party wall.\n\nBut the question says that the owner continued to reside in the remaining part of the building, meaning the part that was not sold.\n\nSo, if the owner is keeping one unit and selling the other, and the front entrance is on the sold lot, but there's a door through the party wall that the owner uses to access their unit, then perhaps the owner doesn't need to use the front entrance.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me re-read the question.\n\n\"Owner owned two adjoining lots. There was a building located on both lots that was separated by a party wall. The building was called a \"twin\" home, i.e., it was divided into two separate residential units. However, the front entrance was located entirely on one of the lots; there was a door through the party wall that the occupants of the adjoining residence used to access their home. Owner sold the lot on which the stairway was located to the buyer, and owner continued to reside in the remaining part of the building. The deed did not contain a reservation of a right to use the doorway. The parties later disputed whether owner could continue to use the entrance that was located on the lot that he sold. What will a court most appropriately decide regarding the rights of the disputing parties?\"\n\nOkay, so the front entrance is on the lot that was sold, and the owner is keeping the other unit, which has a door through the party wall for access.\n\nSo, the owner sold the lot with the front entrance and kept the other unit.\n\nNow, does the owner need to use the front entrance to access their unit? If there's a door through the party wall that provides reasonable access, maybe not.\n\nBut perhaps the front entrance is also necessary for some reason.\n\nIn property law, if a seller sells part of their property and retains another part, and the retained part is landlocked or has no reasonable access without crossing the sold property, there might be an implied easement by necessity.\n\nBut in this case, it seems like the owner's unit has a door through the party wall, which might provide adequate access.\n\nHowever, if that door is the only way to access the owner's unit, and it goes through the buyer's unit, then there might still be an issue.\n\nWait, no, the door is through the party wall, meaning it's directly between the two units, so it's internal, not going through the buyer's unit.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to visualize this.\n\nImagine two houses side by side, each on their own lot, connected by a shared wall, which is the party wall.\n\nEach house has its own entrance, but one house has a front entrance, and the other has a door that connects through the party wall.\n\nSo, the owner sells the house with the front entrance and keeps the other house, which has the party wall door.\n\nIn this case, the owner's house has its own entrance through the party wall, so perhaps there's no necessity for the owner to use the front entrance on the sold lot.\n\nTherefore, maybe there's no easement by necessity.\n\nBut the question mentions that there was a stairway on the sold lot, which might be relevant.\n\nWait, the question says: \"Owner sold the lot on which the stairway was located to the buyer, and owner continued to reside in the remaining part of the building.\"\n\nSo, there's a stairway on the sold lot, which might be part of the front entrance.\n\nPerhaps the front entrance has a stairway leading to the upper floor, and the owner's unit is accessed via that stairway.\n\nIf that's the case, then the owner might need to use the stairway on the sold lot to access their unit.\n\nIn that scenario, there could be an argument for an easement by necessity.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nIf the owner's unit can only be accessed by going through the stairway on the sold lot, then there's a necessity for the owner to continue using that stairway.\n\nIn such a case, courts might imply an easement by necessity, allowing the owner to continue using the stairway to access their unit.\n\nThis would be in line with the principle that equity does not allow a person to be landlocked without access.\n\nSo, option D seems plausible: \"The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of the owner to use the doorway.\"\n\nBut let's look at option A: \"The owner retained an implied right to an exclusive license by necessity to use the doorway.\"\n\nThis suggests an implied license rather than an easement.\n\nA license is more temporary and doesn't run with the land, whereas an easement does.\n\nGiven that the right to use the doorway is essential for accessing the owner's unit, and it's tied to the land, an easement seems more appropriate than a license.\n\nMoreover, licenses are generally revocable, unless they're irrevocable or create some interest that can't be revoked.\n\nIn this case, making the license exclusive and by necessity might suggest that it's not revocable, but still, easements are more suitable for such continuous, indefinite rights.\n\nTherefore, option D seems better than option A.\n\nOption B states: \"The buyer can prevent access to the owner because the deed was defective in not reserving a right to use the doorway.\"\n\nThis implies that since the deed didn't reserve the right, the buyer can deny access.\n\nHowever, if there's an implied easement by necessity, then the owner would still have the right to use the doorway, despite the deed not specifying it.\n\nSo, this option might not hold water if there's an implied easement.\n\nOption C suggests that the court will order a new deed to be drafted with court-ordered language including reservation of rights.\n\nWhile this could be a possible solution, it's not necessarily the most appropriate immediate decision.\n\nCourts might recognize an implied easement without requiring a new deed to be drafted.\n\nMoreover, ordering a new deed might be an equitable remedy, but it's not the primary legal principle at play here.\n\nTherefore, option D seems more directly applicable.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors.\n\nIs there a pre-existing easement or any other restrictions on the property?\n\nThe question doesn't mention any, so we'll assume there aren't any.\n\nAdditionally, did the owner and buyer have any discussions or agreements regarding the use of the doorway?\n\nThe question doesn't specify, so we'll assume there were no such agreements.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the principle of easement by necessity seems to apply.\n\nTherefore, the court is most likely to conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of the owner to use the doorway.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
