In other words, the extension of the spring is directly proportional to the applied force, provided the elastic limit is not exceeded.\n\nIn the context of the question, the tree branch is being treated like a spring. When you hang from it, it bends a certain amount, and according to Hooke's law, if you double the weight hanging from it, the bend should also double, assuming the branch behaves elastically and doesn't break.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. twice the bend.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in reality, tree branches may not strictly follow Hooke's law over large deformations, and other factors like the branch's material properties and geometry could affect its behavior. But based on the idealized model of Hooke's law, the answer is C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because doubling the weight should double the bend, not halve it.\n\nOption B suggests that the bend remains the same if the branch doesn't break, which contradicts Hooke's law.\n\nOption D suggests that the bend quadruples, which would be the case if the relationship were quadratic, but according to Hooke's law, it's linear.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
