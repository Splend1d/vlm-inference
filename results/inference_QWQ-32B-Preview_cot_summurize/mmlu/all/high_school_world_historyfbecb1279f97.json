                    "text": "So I've got these two passages here, and I need to figure out which factor is most likely preventing the progress that Halima Ghomri, the woman in the second passage, was hoping for after Algeria's war of independence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what progress she was expecting. From her words, it seems like she thought that after independence, her children would have access to education, and generally, their lives would improve. But she's saying that nothing has changed; they're still poor peasants, and apart from the end of the war and feeling safer, there's been no real improvement.\n\nSo, the question is, why hasn't there been the expected progress? The options given are:\n\nA. Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism\n\nB. Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure\n\nC. Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites\n\nD. Prioritization of national liberation over social reform\n\nI need to think about which of these factors is most likely the cause of the lack of progress in education and overall quality of life for Halima and her children.\n\nLet me look back at what she said. She expected her children to have an education, but they didn't get it. They're still poor peasants, and nothing has changed except that the war is over and they can work without fear.\n\nSo, it seems like the main issue is the lack of improvement in their economic situation and access to education.\n\nOption A talks about failing to eradicate Islamic traditionalism. While traditional practices can certainly impact social progress, especially for women, it's not directly clear from Halima's statement that this is the main issue preventing progress in education and economic status.\n\nOption B mentions the lack of industrial assets or infrastructure. This could be a plausible reason. If a country doesn't have the industrial base or infrastructure, it might struggle to provide education and improve the economy, especially in rural areas where peasants live.\n\nOption C talks about hostility to women's rights among new elites. Again, this could affect women's rights and opportunities, but Halima is speaking more generally about the lack of progress for her family, including her children's education, not specifically about women's rights.\n\nOption D suggests that the priority was national liberation over social reform. This might mean that after gaining independence, the new government focused on political and national goals rather than on social issues like education and economic development.\n\nConsidering these options, I need to think about what might be the primary barrier to the progress Halima was hoping for.\n\nIf I think about post-independence Algeria, it's possible that the new government was more focused on asserting their sovereignty and dealing with the aftermath of the war than on implementing social reforms like education and economic development.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the country lacked the necessary industrial base and infrastructure to support such developments, making it difficult to improve the lives of peasants.\n\nBetween options B and D, I'm leaning towards D because it suggests that the priority was national liberation, which might have come at the expense of addressing social issues like education and poverty.\n\nOption C, about hostility to women's rights, might be a factor affecting Halima personally, but her statement seems to be more about the general lack of progress for her family and possibly her community, not specifically about gender issues.\n\nOption A, about Islamic traditionalism, might also play a role, but again, it's not directly addressed in Halima's statement.\n\nSo, based on Halima's expression that nothing has changed except the end of the war and feeling safer, it seems like the new government may have prioritized national liberation and stability over social reforms that could have improved education and economic conditions.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D: Prioritization of national liberation over social reform.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe lack of industrial assets or infrastructure is the primary issue. If the country doesn't have the means to provide education and improve the economy, then no progress would be made, regardless of the government's priorities.\n\nHowever, if the government had prioritized social reform, they might have worked on developing infrastructure and acquiring industrial assets. So, perhaps the prioritization is the key issue here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of both: the government prioritized national liberation, and as a result, didn't invest in the necessary infrastructure and industrial development needed for social progress.\n\nBut since I have to choose one option, and based on Halima's statement that nothing has changed except the end of the war, it seems like the government focused on ending the war and achieving independence but didn't follow through with social reforms.\n\nTherefore, I believe D is the most likely answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
