                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about informed consent in psychological research, especially when some information needs to be withheld for the study's objectives. So, I need to think about what ethical guidelines require in such situations.\n\nOption A says that consent maybe waived if written consent is obtained from a member of the participant's immediate family. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. In most ethical guidelines, consent should be obtained from the participant themselves, not from their family members. So, I doubt this is the correct answer.\n\nOption B says that consent is not necessary, but some explanation of the research situation to the participant is essential. Wait, isn't consent always necessary in research? Ethical standards typically require that participants give informed consent before participating. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nOption C states that consent is necessary, and an explanation of significant aspects that might affect willingness to participate must be provided. This sounds more accurate. Even if some information is withheld for the research objectives, participants should still be informed about significant aspects that could influence their decision to participate.\n\nOption D says that consent is considered essential only if there is possible risk of physical or psychological harm. But, actually, consent is generally required regardless of the risk level. The level of detail in the consent might vary based on the risk, but consent itself is still necessary.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to be the most appropriate. It acknowledges the necessity of consent while allowing for certain information to be withheld for research purposes, as long as participants are informed about significant aspects that could affect their willingness to participate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
