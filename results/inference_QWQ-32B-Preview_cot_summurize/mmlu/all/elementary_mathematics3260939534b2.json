                    "text": "So I have this problem: evaluate -2(x - 3) for x = 2. And there are options A through D to choose from: -4, -2, 10, and 2. Okay, let's see how to do this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to plug in x = 2 into the expression. So, the expression is -2(x - 3). When x is 2, it becomes -2(2 - 3).\n\nNow, I need to calculate inside the parentheses first. 2 minus 3 is -1. So, it's -2 times -1.\n\nMultiplying -2 by -1 should give me a positive 2, right? Because negative times negative equals positive.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2. That's option D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to first distribute the -2 across the parentheses.\n\nSo, -2(x - 3) equals -2*x + (-2)*(-3), which is -2x + 6.\n\nNow, plug in x = 2: -2*(2) + 6 = -4 + 6 = 2.\n\nAgain, I get 2. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret the expression, but I think -2(x - 3) is straightforward.\n\nLet me see if there's any possibility that the answer could be something else.\n\nWait, perhaps someone might mistake the expression as -2*x - 3, but that's not what it says. It's -2 multiplied by (x - 3), so parentheses are important here.\n\nAlternatively, if someone forgets that subtracting a negative is like adding, but in this case, it's multiplying negatives.\n\nBut as per the calculations, it should be 2.\n\nLet me check if there's any context or if I'm missing something in the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says \"evaluate \u22122(x \u2212 3) for x = 2.\" and gives options A through D.\n\nSeems straightforward. My calculation shows it's 2, which is option D.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. Start with the given expression: \\(-2(x - 3)\\).\n2. Substitute \\( x = 2 \\) into the expression:\n   \\[\n   -2(2 - 3)\n   \\]\n3. Calculate the expression inside the parentheses:\n   \\[\n   2 - 3 = -1\n   \\]\n4. Multiply \\(-2\\) by \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   -2 \\times -1 = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Alternative Method**\n\n1. Distribute \\(-2\\) across the terms inside the parentheses:\n   \\[\n   -2(x - 3) = -2x + 6\n   \\]\n2. Substitute \\( x = 2 \\) into the distributed expression:\n   \\[\n   -2(2) + 6 = -4 + 6 = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods confirm that the value of the expression when \\( x = 2 \\) is \\( 2 \\).\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u662f \\( \\boxed{2} \\)\u3002"
