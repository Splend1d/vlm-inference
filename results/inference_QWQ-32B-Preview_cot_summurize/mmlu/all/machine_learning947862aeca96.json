                    "text": "Let's see which statement is false among these options. I need to think carefully about each one.\n\nOption A says: \"Semantic segmentation models predict the class of each pixel, while multiclass image classifiers predict the class of the entire image.\" I know that semantic segmentation is about assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, so that sounds correct. And multiclass image classifiers do predict which class the whole image belongs to, so that seems accurate too. So, A seems true.\n\nOption B: \"A bounding box with an IoU equal to 96% would likely be considered a true positive.\" IoU, or intersection over union, is a measure used to evaluate the accuracy of a bounding box prediction. A high IoU value means the predicted bounding box closely matches the ground truth box. Typically, a threshold like 50% or higher is used to decide if a prediction is a true positive. So, 96% is way above that threshold, so it should be considered a true positive. That seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"When a predicted bounding box does not correspond to any object in the scene, it is considered a false positive.\" Yes, that makes sense. A false positive is when the model incorrectly identifies an object where there is none. So, if a bounding box is predicted but there's no actual object there, it's a false positive.\n\nOption D: \"A bounding box with an IoU equal to 3% would likely be considered a false negative.\" Now, this one sounds a bit off. IoU of 3% is very low, meaning the predicted bounding box barely overlaps with the ground truth box. In object detection, if the IoU is below a certain threshold, it's not considered a true positive. But would it be a false negative?\n\nWait, let's recall: a false negative occurs when an actual object is present in the image, but the model fails to detect it. In this case, there is a predicted bounding box with low IoU, but it's still a prediction. So, it might be considered a false positive if there's no actual object, or maybe just not a true positive if there is an object but the bounding box doesn't match well.\n\nI think the correct term for a low IoU prediction when an object is present would be a false positive, not a false negative. Because the model is predicting an object where it shouldn't (since the bounding box doesn't accurately locate the object).\n\nSo, option D seems to be incorrect. It's probably a false positive, not a false negative.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- True positive: predicted bounding box has high IoU with ground truth.\n\n- False positive: predicted bounding box doesn't correspond to any actual object, or has low IoU with any ground truth box.\n\n- False negative: actual object present, but no prediction or prediction with very low IoU.\n\nSo, in option D, if there's a predicted bounding box with 3% IoU, it's likely a false positive, not a false negative.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
