                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character took a ream of paper from work to use at home instead of buying their own. So, they're using their employer's resources for personal use without permission. Generally, taking company property for personal benefit is considered unethical and often against company policies. It's like borrowing without asking, and it could be seen as stealing, which is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character cleaned a stain on their child's face with bleach. Bleach is a strong chemical that can be harmful if not used properly, especially on skin. Using bleach on a child's face could cause serious injury or burns. This action puts the child at risk of harm, which is clearly against the moral obligation to protect and care for one's child. It's a dangerous and potentially harmful act, so it's morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
