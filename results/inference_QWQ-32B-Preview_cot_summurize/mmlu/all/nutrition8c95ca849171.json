                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the typical body composition for a normal weight young adult man. The options are a bit confusing with all the percentages for fat, fat-free mass, intracellular fluid, and extracellular fluid. I need to pick the correct combination from these choices:\n\nA. Fat = 17%, Fat Free Mass=83%, Intracellular Fluid= 40%, Extracellular Fluid= 20%\n\nB. Fat = 83%, Fat Free Mass=40%, Intracellular Fluid= 17%, Extracellular Fluid= 20%\n\nC. Fat = 20%, Fat Free Mass=17%, Intracellular Fluid= 40%, Extracellular Fluid= 83%\n\nD. Fat = 40%, Fat Free Mass=20%, Intracellular Fluid= 17%, Extracellular Fluid= 83%\n\nFirst, I know that fat and fat-free mass should add up to 100% because they are the two main components of body composition. So, let's check that.\n\nIn option A, fat is 17% and fat-free mass is 83%, which adds up to 100%. That seems correct.\n\nIn option B, fat is 83% and fat-free mass is 40%, which adds up to 123%. That can't be right.\n\nIn option C, fat is 20% and fat-free mass is 17%, which adds up to 37%. That's way off.\n\nIn option D, fat is 40% and fat-free mass is 20%, which adds up to 60%. Also incorrect.\n\nSo, only option A makes sense so far because the fat and fat-free mass percentages add up to 100%.\n\nNow, let's look at the intracellular and extracellular fluids. I recall that body fluids are divided into intracellular and extracellular compartments. Intracellular fluid is the fluid inside cells, and extracellular fluid is outside cells, including blood plasma and interstitial fluid.\n\nI think the total fluid in the body is around 60% of body weight for males, but I'm not sure about the exact split between intracellular and extracellular.\n\nIn option A, intracellular fluid is 40% and extracellular fluid is 20%, which adds up to 60%. That seems plausible.\n\nIn option B, intracellular is 17% and extracellular is 20%, totaling 37%.\n\nIn option C, intracellular is 40% and extracellular is 83%, totaling 123%.\n\nIn option D, intracellular is 17% and extracellular is 83%, totaling 100%.\n\nSo, only option A and D have fluid percentages that add up to a reasonable total, but option D has fat and fat-free mass adding up to only 60%, which doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nTo confirm, I should recall or look up the typical body composition for a healthy young adult man.\n\nI remember that body fat percentage for men is generally lower than for women, and a normal range is around 10-20%. So, 17% fat fits within that range.\n\nFat-free mass would then be 83%, which makes sense.\n\nRegarding fluid composition, about two-thirds of total body water is intracellular and one-third is extracellular. So, intracellular fluid at 40% and extracellular at 20% would mean total body water is 60%, with intracellular being 40% and extracellular 20%. That seems consistent because 40% is two-thirds of 60%, and 20% is one-third.\n\nSo, option A appears to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption B has fat at 83%, which is way too high for a normal weight individual. That can't be right.\n\nOption C has fat at 20% and fat-free mass at 17%, which doesn't add up correctly and suggests negative body mass, which is impossible.\n\nOption D has fat at 40% and fat-free mass at 20%, which again doesn't add up to 100%. Also, 40% body fat is considered obese for men, not normal weight.\n\nTherefore, the only logical and correct choice is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
