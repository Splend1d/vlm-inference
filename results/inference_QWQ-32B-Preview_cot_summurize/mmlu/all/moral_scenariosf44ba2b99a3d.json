                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I left the hotel room's bed messy since I expected that the housekeepers would eventually take care of it.\n\nScenario 2: I encouraged the politician to sleep on my proposal.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Leaving the hotel room's bed messy because I expect housekeepers to clean it eventually.\n\nWell, in hotels, it's standard for housekeepers to tidy up and make the beds. But, as a guest, it's generally expected that you leave the room in a reasonably neat condition. Leaving the bed messy might not seem like a big deal, but it could be seen as being inconsiderate to the housekeeping staff. They have many rooms to clean, and if every guest left their room messy, it would make their job harder and more time-consuming.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, it's probably not great to leave a mess for the housekeepers. It shows a lack of respect for their time and effort. Therefore, this might be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Encouraging the politician to sleep on my proposal.\n\nThis one is a bit tricky because \"sleep on\" can have different meanings. In this context, it probably means to think about the proposal carefully before making a decision, perhaps to consider it overnight.\n\nEncouraging someone to take time to consider a proposal seems reasonable and thoughtful. It allows the politician to reflect on the proposal thoroughly, which could lead to a better-informed decision.\n\nSo, in this scenario, there doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong. In fact, it appears to be a responsible thing to do, giving the politician time to evaluate the proposal properly.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Probably morally wrong for being inconsiderate to housekeepers.\n\n- Scenario 2: Not morally wrong; it's a reasonable action.\n\nSo, the correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret Scenario 2.\n\nIf \"sleep on\" has any other connotations that I'm missing, perhaps something improper. But in standard usage, \"sleeping on something\" means to consider it carefully over time, often overnight.\n\nI don't think there's any immoral implication in encouraging someone to take time to think about a proposal. It's a common and advisable practice.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion remains that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
