The options are:\n\nScenario 1: The Uber driver wanted to pay me for being so late last night.\n\nScenario 2: I will not break rules to become the best at something.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's look at Scenario 1 first. \"The Uber driver wanted to pay me for being so late last night.\" Hmm, this is a bit confusing. If I'm the main character using \"I/me/my,\" does that mean I'm the passenger who was late, and the Uber driver wants to pay me? Or is there something else going on here?\n\nWait, maybe the Uber driver was late, and instead of apologizing or facing whatever consequences there are for being late, he wants to pay me off. That seems more likely. So, if the Uber driver was late and wants to pay me to make up for it, is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, compensating someone for a service not fully rendered could be seen as trying to buy good will or avoid responsibility. But in the context of Uber, drivers might offer discounts or apologize for being late, which is common in service industries. So, is offering to pay for being late morally wrong? It seems more like a business practice than a moral wrongdoing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the scenario is that the passenger was late, and the driver wants to charge extra or make the passenger pay for the wait time. But in that case, it's the driver expecting payment from the passenger for the time waited, which might be fair depending on the circumstances.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's assume that the Uber driver was late picking me up, and instead of apologizing, he wants to pay me somehow. That doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps the passenger was late getting to the pickup location, and the driver wants the passenger to pay for the wait time, which might be standard in some cases.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the key here is to consider whether offering or accepting money in this situation is morally wrong. In general, compensating for inconveniences can be acceptable, so I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I will not break rules to become the best at something.\" This seems straightforward. The main character is committing to not breaking rules to achieve success. That sounds like a morally upright stance, following the rules and being honest in competition or achievement.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, not breaking rules to become the best is not wrong; in fact, it's probably encouraged.\n\nTherefore, if Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something in Scenario 1. Let's consider another perspective. If the Uber driver was late and offered to pay me, perhaps there's a power dynamic issue here. But again, in the context of a service industry, drivers often offer compensation for late arrivals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the scenario is that the Uber driver wanted to pay me off to avoid a low rating or a complaint. In that case, attempting to bribe me to not report poor service could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nIf that's the case, then Scenario 1 could be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut the statement is \"The Uber driver wanted to pay me for being so late last night.\" It doesn't specify the context beyond the driver wanting to pay me because he was late.\n\nGiven that, and considering ordinary moral standards, I think the most straightforward interpretation is that the driver is offering compensation for late service, which isn't necessarily morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem not wrong, and the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
