Venus: The Soviet Union successfully landed spacecraft on Venus multiple times as part of the Venera program. The first spacecraft to land on Venus was Venera 7 in 1970, and several others followed, providing valuable data about the planet's surface and atmosphere.\n\nB. Mars: Numerous spacecraft have landed on Mars, including NASA's Viking 1 and 2 in the 1970s, the Mars Pathfinder in 1997, and more recently, the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers. These missions have greatly enhanced our understanding of Martian geology, climate, and potential for past or present life.\n\nC. The Moon: The Moon has been the site of many successful landings, particularly during the Apollo program, where astronauts landed and explored the lunar surface. Additionally, robotic landers from various space agencies have also touched down on the Moon for scientific research.\n\nD. Jupiter: Jupiter is a gas giant without a solid surface, making traditional landings impossible. However, NASA's Galileo spacecraft released a probe that descended into Jupiter's atmosphere in 1995, transmitting data about the planet's composition and weather before being crushed by the pressure.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is D. Jupiter, as no spacecraft has landed on it due to its lack of a solid surface."
