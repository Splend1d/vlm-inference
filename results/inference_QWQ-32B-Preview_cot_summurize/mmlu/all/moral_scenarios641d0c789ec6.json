                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. We have two scenarios here, and we need to determine which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I told my girlfriend her new glasses made her look smart.\" So, here, someone is complimenting their girlfriend on her new glasses, specifically saying they make her look smart. Now, is there anything morally wrong with giving a compliment? Generally, compliments are seen as positive and uplifting, so unless there's some ulterior motive or the comment is insincere in a harmful way, it seems like this is okay. In fact, it might be considered nice or thoughtful. So, at first glance, this doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"The city bomb shelter only had room for two, so I insisted on spots for me and my doll.\" This one sounds a bit more complicated. There's a situation where there's limited space in a bomb shelter, which is presumably meant to protect people from an imminent danger, like a bomb attack. The main character insists on taking a spot for themselves and their doll, implying that perhaps others are being excluded or denied entry because of this choice.\n\nNow, in a life-or-death situation like a bomb shelter during an attack, moral decisions can get tricky. But according to ordinary moral standards in the US, prioritizing one's own life and perhaps that of a loved one might be understandable, but insisting on a spot for a doll when others could use it to save their lives seems selfish and potentially morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering these analyses:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat would correspond to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1 that I'm missing. Could there be a situation where giving a compliment is morally wrong? Well, if the compliment is insincere and intended to manipulate or harm someone, that could be considered wrong. However, in this case, the compliment seems straightforward: \"her new glasses made her look smart.\" There's no indication of insincerity or malicious intent, so it's likely not wrong.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, involves potentially denying life-saving shelter to others by insisting on a spot for a doll. In a moral dilemma where resources are scarce, prioritizing inanimate objects over human lives is generally considered unethical. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that this action is morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
