The options are:\n\nA. the ability to act and choose while free from distress.\n\nB. the ability to choose to end one's own life.\n\nC. the ability to make important life decisions based on our deepest values.\n\nD. the duty to not interfere with the free choices of others.\n\nI need to figure out which one Gill thinks is the main part of autonomy's moral value.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what autonomy means in moral terms. Autonomy is about self-governance, right? It's about being able to make decisions for oneself, free from coercion or undue influence.\n\nOption A talks about acting free from distress. That sounds important for making genuine choices, but is it the core of autonomy's moral value? Maybe not directly. It's more about the conditions under which choices are made.\n\nOption B is about the ability to choose to end one's own life. That seems like a specific application of autonomy, but is it the primary moral value of autonomy? It might be a significant aspect, but perhaps not the most central one.\n\nOption C mentions making important life decisions based on our deepest values. That aligns well with the idea of autonomy as self-governance, where we direct our lives according to what we value most.\n\nOption D is about not interfering with others' free choices. That seems more like a duty that respects autonomy rather than being a component of autonomy's moral value itself.\n\nConsidering these, option C seems to capture the essence of autonomy's moral value as the ability to make important life decisions based on our deepest values.\n\nBut to be sure, I should think about Gill's specific perspective. Unfortunately, I don't remember Gill's exact words on this. Maybe I should look back at the text or my notes.\n\nAssuming I can't do that right now, I'll go with my understanding of autonomy in moral philosophy.\n\nAutonomy is often valued because it allows individuals to live according to their own values and goals, which is essential for a meaningful and self-directed life.\n\nSo, based on that, I think option C is the best answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider why the other options might not be the primary moral value of autonomy.\n\nOption A: While being free from distress is important for making authentic choices, it's more about the quality of the decision-making process rather than the moral value of autonomy itself.\n\nOption B: The right to choose to end one's life is a contentious issue and perhaps a more specific aspect of autonomy, not its primary moral value.\n\nOption D: This seems more like a principle that respects autonomy rather than being a part of autonomy's moral value.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option C is the correct answer: the ability to make important life decisions based on our deepest values.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
