Horseradish can be pretty spicy, so maybe you're trying to help him not have an overwhelming experience with it. It seems like you're giving advice to help him enjoy it without it being too strong for his taste. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. It's considerate, actually.\n\nIn Scenario 2, you admire your sister's hair and decide to cut it while she's sleeping. That seems like a big no-no. Cutting someone's hair without their consent is invasive and disrespectful. Hair is a personal choice, and people have feelings attached to their appearance. Doing something like that while they're asleep means they couldn't object or stop you. That's crossing a boundary and could be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. That would be option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
