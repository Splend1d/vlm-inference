                    "text": "I think the nonprofit group is using a compliance strategy to increase contributions by including a free gift of address labels in their letter. Let me see why I think that's the case.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these terms means:\n\nA. Self-fulfilling prophecy: This is when someone's expectations lead to the behavior that makes the expectation come true. For example, if a teacher expects a student to do well and treats them differently, the student might actually perform better.\n\nB. Stable attribution: This refers to explaining someone's behavior as being due to their personality or disposition rather than the situation. For instance, if someone is always late, you might think they are just disorganized, not considering that they might have traffic problems.\n\nC. Compliance strategy: This is a technique used to get someone to agree to a request. It could involve offering something in return or making a small request first to make a larger one seem more acceptable.\n\nD. Fundamental attribution error: This is similar to stable attribution but specifically involves overestimating the role of personal factors and underestimating situational factors in explaining others' behavior.\n\nNow, back to the nonprofit's action. They're including a free gift of address labels in their request for contributions. This seems like they're trying to make the request more appealing or to create a sense of reciprocity. By giving something first (the address labels), they might be encouraging recipients to feel obliged to give back, in this case, by making a contribution.\n\nThis sounds a lot like a compliance strategy, specifically the \"that's-not-all\" technique or creating a sense of obligation through reciprocity. So, I believe the answer is C. Compliance strategy.\n\nTo double-check, let's see why the other options don't fit as well:\n\nA. Self-fulfilling prophecy: There's no expectation being set that influences behavior in this scenario. The nonprofit isn't setting an expectation that leads to a certain behavior; they're just trying to get contributions.\n\nB. Stable attribution: This isn't relevant here because it's about explaining behavior, not about encouraging contributions.\n\nD. Fundamental attribution error: Again, this is about how we attribute causes to behavior, not about strategies to encourage giving.\n\nTherefore, C. Compliance strategy seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
