                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the legal nature of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is. The question gives four options: it's a multilateral treaty, a UN General Assembly resolution, a UN Security Council resolution, or a declaration adopted by several states at an international conference. I need to decide which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I know that the UDHR was adopted by the United Nations. I think it was the General Assembly that adopted it, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall some facts about the UDHR. I believe it was adopted in 1948, right after World War II, as a response to the atrocities that happened during the war. It was meant to establish a common standard of achievements for all peoples and all nations.\n\nNow, option A says it's a multilateral treaty. A treaty is an international agreement entered into by multiple countries, and it's usually binding on the parties that ratify it. But I think the UDHR is more of a declaration of principles rather than a treaty that countries have to ratify. So, maybe A is not the correct answer.\n\nOption B says it's a UN General Assembly resolution. The UN General Assembly passes resolutions on various topics, and these resolutions can be declaratory or they can create programs and committees. Since the UDHR was adopted by the General Assembly, this might be the correct answer.\n\nOption C mentions a UN Security Council resolution. The Security Council deals with issues of international peace and security, and while human rights are important, the UDHR seems more aligned with the General Assembly's work.\n\nOption D says it's a declaration adopted by several states at an international conference. While it's true that the UDHR was adopted by the UN General Assembly, which consists of representatives from several states, it's specifically a General Assembly resolution, not just a declaration from an international conference.\n\nLet me check some information to confirm. The UDHR was indeed adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. It's considered a landmark document that sets out fundamental human rights to be universally protected. Although it's not a treaty and doesn't itself have legal binding force, it has influenced many international treaties and conventions that do have legal force.\n\nGiven that, I think the most accurate answer is B: The UDHR is a UN General Assembly resolution. It was adopted by the General Assembly as a resolution, specifically Resolution 217 A (III), on December 10, 1948.\n\nI should also note that while the UDHR is not legally binding, it has moral and political authority and has been instrumental in the development of international human rights law. Many of its provisions have attained the status of customary international law, which is binding on all states.\n\nSo, to sum up, the UDHR is a UN General Assembly resolution that outlines fundamental human rights and has had a profound influence on international law and standards.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
