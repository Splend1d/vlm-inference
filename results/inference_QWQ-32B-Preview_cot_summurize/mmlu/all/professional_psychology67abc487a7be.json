This method simulates the tasks and responsibilities that a manager would typically handle, such as prioritizing tasks, decision-making, problem-solving, and communication. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Managerial.\n\nOption A, Clerical, might involve more routine and administrative tasks, which could be assessed through other methods like typing tests or data entry assessments.\n\nOption B, Sales, would likely require evaluations of interpersonal skills, persuasion, and closing deals, possibly through role-plays or simulated sales scenarios.\n\nOption D, Secretarial, might focus on organizational skills, note-taking, and managing schedules, which could be assessed through specific administrative tests.\n\nHowever, the \"in-basket\" technique is designed to assess higher-level managerial competencies, making option C the most appropriate choice."
