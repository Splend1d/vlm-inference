I have this question here: \"Soft determinism entails that _____.\" And there are four options:\n\nA. we are free to choose our desires\n\nB. there are no restraints on human behavior\n\nC. the thesis of determinism is false\n\nD. the thesis of determinism is true\n\nFirst, I need to recall what determinism means. Determinism is the view that every event, including human cognition and behavior, decision and action, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences. In other words, everything that happens is determined by causes external to one's will.\n\nNow, soft determinism, I think, is another term for compatibilism. Compatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are compatible. So, it's the idea that even if determinism is true, we can still have free will in some sense.\n\nOption A says \"we are free to choose our desires.\" Hmm, that sounds like it's related to free will, but I'm not sure if it captures the essence of soft determinism. Soft determinism is about reconciling free will with determinism, not just about choosing desires.\n\nOption B says \"there are no restraints on human behavior.\" That sounds more like libertarianism, where people have complete freedom without deterministic constraints. But soft determinism acknowledges determinism, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says \"the thesis of determinism is false.\" Wait, but soft determinism accepts determinism, so saying that determinism is false would contradict that.\n\nOption D says \"the thesis of determinism is true.\" That aligns with what I recall about soft determinism, which accepts determinism but tries to reconcile it with free will.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the correct answer is D. Soft determinism entails that the thesis of determinism is true.\n\nBut let me double-check. If soft determinism is compatible with determinism, then it must accept that determinism is true. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a version of determinism.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
