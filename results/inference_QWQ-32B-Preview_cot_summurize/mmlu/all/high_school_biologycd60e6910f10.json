                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about starch and cellulose. Both are made up of glucose monomers, but only starch is digestible by humans. Why is that? Let's look at each option to understand better.\n\nOption A says: \"The bonds linking the monomers of starch differ in shape from the bonds linking the monomers of cellulose.\" Hmm, actually, the bonds between glucose monomers in both starch and cellulose are beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds. So, the bonds are similar in nature. Maybe shape refers to the overall structure, but that might not be the best way to describe it. Let's see the next option.\n\nOption B: \"Molecules of starch are much smaller than molecules of cellulose.\" Size could be a factor, but in reality, both starch and cellulose can form very large polymers. Cellulose tends to be more rigid and forms long, straight chains, while starch has a more coiled structure due to the presence of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 bonds in branching points. But is size the reason we can't digest cellulose? Probably not directly.\n\nOption C: \"Starch is an intracellular molecule, while cellulose is an extracellular molecule.\" This is interesting. Starch is indeed stored inside plant cells, while cellulose forms the cell walls. But is the location the reason for digestibility? Maybe not directly. Perhaps it's related to how our bodies handle these molecules based on their structure and function.\n\nOption D: \"Starch is hydrated by water, but cellulose is not.\" Cellulose is quite hydrophilic due to its many hydroxyl groups, so it can bind water well. Starch also interacts with water, but perhaps in a different way. This option seems a bit off.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about the actual chemical structure and how our bodies break down these molecules. Both starch and cellulose are polysaccharides made from glucose, but the way the glucose molecules are linked differs slightly.\n\nIn starch, the glucose units are linked by alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds, and there are also alpha-1,6 bonds at branching points in amylopectin, one of the components of starch. In cellulose, the glucose units are linked by beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds.\n\nThe difference lies in the type of glycosidic bond: alpha vs. beta. This seemingly small difference affects the overall structure of the molecule and how enzymes can interact with it.\n\nHumans have enzymes called amylases that can break down alpha-1,4 bonds found in starch. These enzymes cannot break beta-1,4 bonds found in cellulose. That's why we can digest starch but not cellulose.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them directly mention the type of glycosidic bond. Option A talks about the shape of the bonds, which might be indirectly related to the bond type, but it's not very precise.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the difference in bond type leads to different spatial configurations of the molecules, affecting enzyme interaction.\n\nStarch, with its alpha bonds, forms a coiled structure, making the glycosidic bonds more accessible to amylase enzymes. Cellulose, with beta bonds, forms straight chains that can hydrogen bond with each other to form strong, crystalline structures that are less accessible to enzymes.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is A, \"The bonds linking the monomers of starch differ in shape from the bonds linking the monomers of cellulose,\" because it hints at the structural differences caused by the bond type, which affects digestibility.\n\nOption C, \"Starch is an intracellular molecule, while cellulose is an extracellular molecule,\" might be somewhat relevant, but it doesn't directly explain why one is digestible and the other isn't. It's more about function than structure.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the best choice among the given options, even though it could be worded more precisely to mention the type of glycosidic bonds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
