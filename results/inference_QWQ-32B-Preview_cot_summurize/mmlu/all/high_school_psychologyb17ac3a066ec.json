The scenario is that you're walking around a statue, checking it out from different angles, and even though the image on your retina is changing, you don't perceive these changes. The question is asking why that is, and it gives four options: convergence, motion parallax, perceptual constancy, and interpositioning.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of perception.\n\nConvergence refers to the way our eyes turn inward when focusing on a close object. It's part of depth perception, but I'm not sure if that's directly related to why the changing retinal images don't make me see the statue differently.\n\nMotion parallax is a depth cue where closer objects appear to move faster across your field of vision than distant objects when you're in motion. Again, while interesting, I'm not sure if this explains why the statue looks consistent despite different viewpoints.\n\nPerceptual constancy is a concept that suggests we perceive objects as relatively stable and unchanging, even as sensory information changes. For example, color constancy helps us see an object as the same color under different lighting conditions. Similarly, shape constancy allows us to recognize an object's shape regardless of the angle from which we view it.\n\nInterpositioning, I think, refers to when one object blocks the view of another, creating a sense of depth. But in this case, it doesn't seem directly related to the statue's perception remaining constant despite changing views.\n\nGiven these definitions, perceptual constancy seems like the most likely answer. When I walk around the statue, my brain is able to maintain a consistent perception of the statue's shape and identity, even though the retinal images are changing as my perspective changes.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about what would happen if perceptual constancy weren't in play. If my perception changed with every shift in viewpoint, the statue would look different each time I looked at it from a new angle, which would be very confusing and make it hard to recognize and understand the object.\n\nSo, perceptual constancy seems to be the mechanism that allows me to see the statue as a consistent object despite the changing retinal images.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nConvergence is more about focusing on near objects and isn't directly related to maintaining a stable perception of an object's identity or shape.\n\nMotion parallax is a cue for depth perception, but it doesn't explain why the perception of the statue remains constant as I move around it.\n\nInterpositioning is about objects blocking each other, which isn't relevant to the consistency of the statue's perception as I move around it.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is perceptual constancy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
