It involves mapping the gene to a specific chromosomal region and then isolating and sequencing the DNA from that region to find the gene of interest.\n\nLet me look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says \"using a selection procedure to clone a cDNA.\" That sounds like functional cloning or some other method where you select clones based on their function or expression, not specifically based on position.\n\nOption B, \"cloning a portion of a gene using PCR,\" is more about amplifying a specific part of a gene using primers, but it doesn't necessarily involve mapping the gene to a chromosomal location.\n\nOption C, \"isolating a gene by PCR using primers from another species,\" sounds like cross-species cloning or PCR, where you use conserved sequences between species to amplify a gene, but again, this isn't about positional cloning.\n\nSo, I believe D is the correct answer because positional cloning is all about mapping a gene to a specific chromosomal location and then isolating the genomic DNA from that region to clone the gene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
