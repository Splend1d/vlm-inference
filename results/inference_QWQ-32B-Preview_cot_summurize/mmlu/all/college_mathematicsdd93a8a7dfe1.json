                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the maximum number of acute angles a convex 10-gon can have in the Euclidean plane. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of convex polygons. In a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and the sum of the interior angles depends on the number of sides. For an n-gon, the sum of interior angles is (n-2)*180 degrees. So for a 10-gon, it would be (10-2)*180 = 1440 degrees.\n\nNow, an acute angle is one that's less than 90 degrees. So, the question is asking for the maximum number of interior angles in this convex 10-gon that can be less than 90 degrees.\n\nLet me think about this. If I have multiple acute angles, that means the sum of those angles is less than 90 degrees each, so the remaining angles need to make up the rest of the 1440 degrees. But in a convex polygon, no interior angle can be 180 degrees or more, so they all have to be less than 180 degrees.\n\nLet's assume that there are k acute angles in the 10-gon. Then, the sum of these k angles is less than 90k degrees. The remaining (10 - k) angles each must be less than 180 degrees, so their sum is less than 180*(10 - k) degrees.\n\nBut the total sum of all interior angles is exactly 1440 degrees. So, we have:\n\nSum of k acute angles + sum of (10 - k) non-acute angles = 1440\n\nWith:\n\nSum of k acute angles < 90k\n\nSum of (10 - k) non-acute angles < 180*(10 - k)\n\nTherefore:\n\n90k + 180*(10 - k) > 1440\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n90k + 1800 - 180k > 1440\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n-90k + 1800 > 1440\n\nSubtract 1800 from both sides:\n\n-90k > -360\n\nDivide both sides by -90 (and remember to reverse the inequality sign):\n\nk < 4\n\nSo, k must be less than 4. Since k has to be an integer, the maximum possible value for k is 3.\n\nWait a minute, but the options include 4. And according to this inequality, k < 4, meaning k can be 1, 2, or 3. But maybe there's a way to have 4 acute angles.\n\nLet me check if k = 4 is possible. If k = 4, then:\n\nSum of 4 acute angles < 90*4 = 360 degrees\n\nSum of remaining 6 angles < 180*6 = 1080 degrees\n\nTotal sum < 360 + 1080 = 1440 degrees\n\nBut the total sum must be exactly 1440 degrees. So, if the sum of the 4 acute angles is less than 360, and the sum of the other 6 angles is less than 1080, their total is less than 1440, which contradicts the required sum of exactly 1440 degrees.\n\nTherefore, k cannot be 4. So, the maximum number of acute angles is 3.\n\nBut let me think about it differently. Maybe there's a geometric constraint that prevents having 4 acute angles in a convex 10-gon.\n\nI recall that in a convex polygon, the exterior angles sum up to 360 degrees. Each exterior angle is supplementary to its corresponding interior angle, so if the interior angle is acute (less than 90 degrees), the exterior angle is greater than 90 degrees.\n\nSo, if there are k acute interior angles, there are k exterior angles greater than 90 degrees. The sum of all exterior angles is 360 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the sum of exterior angles is always 360 degrees, regardless of the number of sides.\n\nSo, if I have k exterior angles each greater than 90 degrees, and (10 - k) exterior angles each less than 90 degrees (since all interior angles are less than 180 degrees, exterior angles are positive and less than 180 degrees), their total sum must be 360 degrees.\n\nLet me try to see if k = 4 is possible.\n\nSuppose I have 4 exterior angles, each greater than 90 degrees, say each is 91 degrees.\n\nThen, the sum of these 4 exterior angles is 4*91 = 364 degrees, which is already greater than 360 degrees, which is impossible because the total sum must be 360 degrees.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to have 4 exterior angles each greater than 90 degrees, because their sum would exceed 360 degrees.\n\nHence, the maximum number of exterior angles greater than 90 degrees is 3, which corresponds to a maximum of 3 acute interior angles.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.\n\nBut let me check if having 3 acute angles is actually possible.\n\nSuppose I have a convex 10-gon with 3 acute interior angles. Then, the sum of these 3 acute angles is less than 270 degrees.\n\nThe sum of the remaining 7 angles must be greater than 1440 - 270 = 1170 degrees, but less than 180*7 = 1260 degrees.\n\nSo, 1170 < sum of 7 angles < 1260\n\nThis seems possible. For example, if the 7 angles are each around 165 degrees, their sum would be 1155 degrees, which is less than 1170, so maybe not.\n\nWait, 1170 divided by 7 is approximately 167.14 degrees per angle. So, if each of the 7 angles is at least approximately 167.14 degrees, their sum would be at least 1170 degrees.\n\nSince in a convex polygon, angles can be up to just under 180 degrees, this seems feasible.\n\nTherefore, having 3 acute angles is possible, but not 4.\n\nSo, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
