                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this property law question. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the homeowner conveyed his property to his cousin \"for life, with remainder to (the homeowner's) heirs.\" That sounds like a life estate to the cousin, followed by a remainder to the homeowner's heirs.\n\nThen, the cousin later conveyed the property to a farmer \"for as long as he would continue to farm the property.\" Hmm, this seems like another type of interest being created.\n\nAfter the cousin dies, the homeowner's heirs sue the farmer to quiet title. So, they're trying to establish who owns the property now.\n\nThe question is asking which common law doctrine would be most applicable in the court's determination of the ownership of the property. The options are:\n\nA. Rule in Wild's Case.\n\nB. Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders.\n\nC. Doctrine of Worthier Title.\n\nD. Rule against Remainders in the Grantees' Heirs.\n\nLet me look at each one.\n\nOption A: Rule in Wild's Case. I think this has something to do with executory interests. In Wild's Case, the rule is that an executory interest can't cut short a prior estate unless it's created in the same instrument as the prior estate. But in this scenario, the cousin conveyed the property to the farmer after the original conveyance by the homeowner. So, it's a separate conveyance. Maybe this could be relevant, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption B: Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders. This doctrine says that if a contingent remainder is destroyed, the fee simple absolute goes to the grantor or the grantor's heirs, depending on the circumstances. In this case, there's a remainder to the homeowner's heirs, which is a contingent remainder because the duration of the life estate is uncertain. If something happens to destroy that remainder, maybe this doctrine applies.\n\nOption C: Doctrine of Worthier Title. This is also known as the doctrine of merger in some jurisdictions. It provides that when land is granted to a person for life, with remainder to the grantor's heirs, the legal title merges into the grantor, and the grantor holds both the life estate and the remainder in one person. This seems somewhat relevant here because the homeowner conveyed to his cousin for life, with remainder to his own heirs.\n\nOption D: Rule against Remainders in the Grantees' Heirs. This is a rule that says you can't create a remainder in the heirs of the grantee; it would be void and the grantee would take the property in fee simple absolute. But in this case, the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, not the cousin's heirs. So, maybe this doesn't apply.\n\nLet me think again. The homeowner conveyed to his cousin for life, with remainder to his heirs. Then, the cousin conveyed to the farmer \"for as long as he would continue to farming the property.\"\n\nSo, first, there's a life estate to the cousin, with a remainder to the homeowner's heirs. Then, the cousin, who holds the life estate, conveys his interest to the farmer, but with a condition attached: \"for as long as he would continue to farm the property.\"\n\nNow, after the cousin dies, the homeowner's heirs sue the farmer to quiet title. So, they're disputing who owns the property now.\n\nI need to figure out what interest the farmer has and whether the remainder to the homeowner's heirs still exists.\n\nLet me consider the Doctrine of Worthier Title first. In many jurisdictions, when land is granted to a person for life, with remainder to the grantor's heirs, the legal estate merges into the grantor, and the grantor holds both the life estate and the remainder in one person. This is to prevent the remainder from lapsing if the grantor outlives the life tenant.\n\nIf this doctrine applies, then the homeowner would hold both the life estate and the remainder in himself, and the cousin would only have a possessory interest for life.\n\nBut in this case, the homeowner conveyed to his cousin for life, with remainder to his heirs. So, perhaps the Doctrine of Worthier Title doesn't apply because the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, not to the homeowner himself.\n\nWait, in the Doctrine of Worthier Title, it's specifically when the remainder is to the grantor's heirs. So, yes, that seems to be the situation here.\n\nUnder this doctrine, the legal estate merges into the grantor, and the grantor holds both the legal and equitable interests. So, the homeowner would hold both the life estate and the remainder in himself, and the cousin would only have a possessory interest for life.\n\nBut in this scenario, the cousin still conveys the property to the farmer. So, if the cousin only has a possessory interest for life, what exactly is he conveying to the farmer?\n\nIs he conveying his life estate subject to the condition that the farmer continues to farm the property?\n\nOr is he creating some kind of executory interest in favor of the farmer?\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me consider Option A: Rule in Wild's Case. This rule is about executory interests and whether they can cut short a prior estate. In Wild's Case, the rule established that an executory interest cannot cut short a prior estate unless it's created in the same instrument as the prior estate.\n\nIn this case, the homeowner's conveyance to his cousin included a remainder to his heirs, and then the cousin made a separate conveyance to the farmer with a condition.\n\nSo, the condition attached by the cousin to the farmer's interest might be seen as an attempt to create an executory interest that affects the prior interests.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nLet me look back at Option B: Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders.\n\nA contingent remainder is one that is subject to some condition precedent. In this case, the remainder to the homeowner's heirs is contingent on the cousin's life estate ending.\n\nIf the cousin conveys his interest to the farmer, does that affect the remainder?\n\nUnder the Doctrine of Destructibility, if a contingent remainder is destroyed, the fee simple absolute goes to the grantor or the grantor's heirs.\n\nBut in this scenario, the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, who are also the grantor's heirs.\n\nWait, the homeowner is the grantor, and the remainder is to his heirs.\n\nSo, if the contingent remainder is destroyed, it would go back to the grantor, who is the homeowner, but he's already deceased because his heirs are claiming the property.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me consider Option D: Rule against Remainders in the Grantees' Heirs.\n\nThis rule states that you can't create a remainder in the heirs of the grantee; it would be void, and the grantee would take the property in fee simple absolute.\n\nBut in this case, the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, not the cousin's heirs. So, this rule might not apply here.\n\nPerhaps Option C: Doctrine of Worthier Title is the most applicable.\n\nThis doctrine provides that when land is granted to a person for life, with remainder to the grantor's heirs, the legal estate merges into the grantor, and the grantor holds both the life estate and the remainder.\n\nIn this case, the homeowner conveyed to his cousin for life, with remainder to his heirs. So, under the Doctrine of Worthier Title, the legal estate would merge into the homeowner, and the cousin would only have a possessory interest for life.\n\nThen, when the cousin conveys to the farmer, he can only convey his possessory interest, which is the life estate subject to the condition that the farmer continues to farm the property.\n\nAfter the cousin dies, the life estate would end, and the remainder would go to the homeowner's heirs, unless the condition attached by the cousin affects it.\n\nBut since the homeowner holds both the life estate and the remainder, and the cousin only has a possessory interest, perhaps the condition attached by the cousin doesn't affect the remainder.\n\nTherefore, when the cousin dies, the remainder should go to the homeowner's heirs, and the farmer's interest should end, unless the condition is still being met.\n\nBut the question is about determining the ownership of the property after the cousin's death.\n\nGiven that, the homeowner's heirs are bringing suit against the farmer to quiet title, meaning they're claiming that the property should belong to them now.\n\nSo, if the Doctrine of Worthier Title applies, and the homeowner held both the life estate and the remainder, then upon the homeowner's death, the property would pass to his heirs, regardless of what the cousin did with his possessory interest.\n\nBut wait, the homeowner is still alive because his heirs are bringing the suit after the cousin's death.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify who is alive and who is dead.\n\nThe homeowner conveyed the property to his cousin for life, with remainder to his heirs.\n\nThen, the cousin conveyed the property to the farmer with a condition.\n\nLater, the cousin dies, and the homeowner's heirs sue the farmer.\n\nSo, at this point, the homeowner is still alive, because his heirs are bringing the suit after the cousin's death.\n\nWait, actually, if the homeowner had conveyed the property to his cousin for life, with remainder to his heirs, and then the cousin dies, perhaps the homeowner has already died before the cousin, because the remainder to his heirs suggests that the homeowner is deceased.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nLet me try to outline the timeline:\n\n1. Homeowner conveys property to cousin for life, with remainder to his heirs.\n\n2. Later, cousin conveys property to farmer with a condition.\n\n3. Then, cousin dies.\n\n4. Homeowner's heirs sue farmer to quiet title.\n\nSo, the homeowner must have died before the cousin, because the remainder is to his heirs.\n\nIn other words, the homeowner died after conveying the property to his cousin for life, and his heirs are now claiming the remainder interest.\n\nBut the cousin has died, so the life estate has ended, and now the remainder should vest in the homeowner's heirs.\n\nHowever, the cousin conveyed the property to the farmer with a condition.\n\nSo, what is the status of the farmer's interest now that the cousin has died?\n\nUnder the Doctrine of Worthier Title, the legal estate merged into the homeowner, and the homeowner held both the life estate and the remainder.\n\nBut the homeowner has died, and his heirs are claiming the property.\n\nThe cousin's conveyance to the farmer might be seen as only conveying his possessory interest during his life, subject to the condition.\n\nBut now that the cousin has died, and the life estate has ended, the remainder should vest in the homeowner's heirs, unless the condition attached by the cousin affects it.\n\nBut since the homeowner held both the life estate and the remainder, perhaps the condition attached by the cousin doesn't affect the remainder.\n\nTherefore, the homeowner's heirs should own the property now, and the farmer's interest has ended with the cousin's death.\n\nSo, in this case, the Doctrine of Worthier Title seems most applicable, as it deals with the merger of the life estate and the remainder into the grantor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option C: Doctrine of Worthier Title.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
