To determine the child's basis for the securities sold, we need to consider if there are any adjustments or other factors, but based on the information provided, the basis remains $9,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $9,000\n\n**Additional Note:**\n\nWhen the child sells the securities for $7,000, which is less than the basis of $9,000, the child would have a capital loss of $2,000 ($7,000 - $9,000 = -$2,000). However, the question specifically asks for the child's basis for the securities sold, which is $9,000.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- IRS Publication 551, Basis of Assets\n\n- IRC Section 1015(a)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
