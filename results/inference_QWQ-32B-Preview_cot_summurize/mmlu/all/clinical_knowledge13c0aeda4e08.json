They are arranged in two rows: the proximal row consists of the scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, and pisiform bones, while the distal row includes the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate bones.\n\nOption B includes some incorrect terms like \"lunar\" (which is an old term for the lunate bone but not commonly used now), \"triquetrium\" (which is an older term for the triquetral bone), and \"capitates,\" which seems to be a misnomer for \"capitate.\" Additionally, it includes the radius and ulna, which are not carpal bones; they are the two bones of the forearm.\n\nOption C includes the scaphoid and hamate, but also includes the proximal phalanx, which is a bone in the finger, and the humerus, which is in the upper arm, making it incorrect.\n\nOption D includes the scaphoid and hamate, but also includes the radius and ulna (forearm bones), the cunniform (which is not a standard anatomical term for wrist bones), and the trapezius (which is a large back muscle, not a bone).\n\nTherefore, option A is the accurate and complete list of carpal bones.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
