                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which statement best summarizes normative legal theory. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"Its principal concern is with moral or political values.\" Hmm, normative legal theory does involve morality and politics, but is that its main focus? I think normative legal theory is more about what the law should be, not just about moral or political values. So, maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B mentions \"the positivist view of law as developed by HLA Hart.\" Now, HLA Hart is indeed a legal positivist, and his theory is about what law is, based on social facts. But normative legal theory is about what law ought to be, not just what it is. So, this seems to be descriptive, not normative. Therefore, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption C says, \"It expresses the idea that law consists only of norms.\" Again, this sounds like a descriptive theory, perhaps related to legal positivism or formalism, which describes law in terms of norms or rules. But normative legal theory is prescriptive; it's about how law should be structured or applied. So, this doesn't seem to capture the essence of normative legal theory.\n\nOption D is \"It is preoccupied with the analysis of the application of legislation to moral issues.\" This seems closer because it involves both law and morality, and it suggests that normative legal theory is concerned with how laws are applied to moral questions. But I'm not sure if \"preoccupied\" is the right word, as it might imply an excessive focus on moral issues, which may not be entirely accurate.\n\nLet me think differently. Normative legal theory is, by definition, concerned with norms or standards that prescribe how law should be. It's about evaluating legal systems, rules, and practices based on certain values or principles. So, it's not just about describing what law is, but about what it ought to be.\n\nComparing this with the options, option A comes closest because it mentions moral or political values, which are often central to normative theories. However, I feel like it's too narrow, as normative legal theory can encompass other values beyond just moral and political ones.\n\nOption B is about HLA Hart's positivism, which is a descriptive theory about the nature of law. Positivism generally separates law and morality, so it's more about what law is, based on social facts, not about what it should be.\n\nOption C says law consists only of norms, which again is a descriptive claim about the nature of law, aligning more with formalist or positivist theories.\n\nOption D seems to mix normative and descriptive elements, focusing on the application of legislation to moral issues. While this might be a part of normative legal theory, I'm not sure if it fully captures the essence.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that normative legal theory is broader than any of these options suggest. It could include various perspectives on what law should aim to achieve, such as justice, efficiency, fairness, etc., and it might involve both moral and political considerations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether we can distinguish between normative and descriptive theories of law. In that case, options B and C are descriptive, as they deal with what law is, while options A and D are more normative, involving what law should be or how it should be applied.\n\nIf that's the case, then between A and D, A seems more general and overarching, capturing the idea that normative legal theory is concerned with moral and political values, which guide what law should be.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, seems to focus narrowly on the application of legislation to moral issues, which might be one aspect of normative legal theory, but not the whole picture.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the best answer. It correctly identifies that normative legal theory is principally concerned with moral or political values, which are used to evaluate and prescribe legal norms.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's a better way to frame normative legal theory. Some scholars might argue that normative legal theory includes economic analysis or other non-moral, non-political considerations. However, moral and political values are central to most normative theories in law.\n\nMoreover, HLA Hart's theory is descriptive, aiming to explain what law is, based on rules and social practices, without prescribing what it should be. So, option B is incorrect in this context.\n\nSimilarly, saying that law consists only of norms is a descriptive claim, which doesn't capture the normative aspect of evaluating and prescribing legal standards.\n\nTherefore, after considering all options, I conclude that option A is the most accurate summary of normative legal theory, as it highlights the theory's principal concern with moral or political values in evaluating and shaping law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
