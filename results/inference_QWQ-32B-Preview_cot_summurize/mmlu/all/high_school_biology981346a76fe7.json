                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which idea Darwin learned from Thomas Malthus. First, I should probably remember who Thomas Malthus was and what he wrote about.\n\nThomas Malthus was an English cleric and scholar who lived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He's best known for his work on population growth, specifically his book \"An Essay on the Principle of Population.\" In this essay, he argued that populations have the tendency to grow exponentially, while food production increases arithmetically. This mismatch leads to various checks on population growth, such as war, disease, and famine.\n\nNow, Darwin read Malthus's essay, and it had a significant impact on his thinking about nature and evolution. So, I need to connect Malthus's ideas with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.\n\nOption A says, \"All species are fixed in the form in which they are created.\" This sounds like the idea of special creation or fixity of species, which was a common view before Darwin. However, this is opposite to what Darwin proposed; he believed in the evolution and change of species over time. So, this doesn't seem like something Darwin learned from Malthus.\n\nOption B says, \"Populations tend to increase at a faster rate than their food supply normally allows.\" This directly aligns with Malthus's principle of population, which posits that populations grow geometrically (or exponentially) while food supply increases arithmetically. This means that populations have the potential to outstrip their resources, leading to competition for survival.\n\nDarwin realized that this competition for limited resources could drive natural selection. In other words, individuals with traits that give them an advantage in acquiring resources or avoiding predators are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those advantageous traits to their offspring. Over time, this could lead to the evolution of species.\n\nSo, option B seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption C says, \"Earth changed over the years through a series of catastrophic upheavals.\" This sounds more like the catastrophist view of earth's history, which was contrasted with Lyell's uniformitarianism, which influenced Darwin. Malthus's work was more about population dynamics and economics, not geological changes. So, this doesn't seem related to Malthus's ideas.\n\nOption D says, \"The environment is responsible for natural selection.\" While this is true in Darwin's theory, it's a bit vague. The environment does play a role in natural selection by determining which traits are advantageous, but this isn't specifically an idea from Malthus.\n\nComparing all the options, option B seems to be the one that directly connects Darwin's thoughts to Malthus's writings. Darwin was struck by the idea that populations have the potential to grow beyond their means, leading to a struggle for existence, which in turn drives natural selection.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Populations tend to increase at a faster rate than their food supply normally allows.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
