                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about hiring the least-cost combination of labor and capital for a firm. The options are a bit confusing, and I'm not entirely sure which one is correct. Let me see if I can reason through this.\n\nOption A says to find the combination where the marginal product of labor equals the marginal product of capital. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Marginal products are about the additional output from an extra unit of input, but costs are about the price of those inputs. So, equal marginal products don't necessarily mean least cost.\n\nOption B says to find the combination where the ratio of the marginal product of labor to the marginal product of capital is equal to one. That sounds similar to option A, actually. If the ratio is one, that means the marginal products are equal, which is the same as option A. So, same issue here.\n\nOption C says to find the combination where the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor equals the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital. Okay, this seems more promising. This looks like it's relating the productivity of inputs to their costs. In economics, I think there's a principle that says you should allocate resources so that the last dollar spent on each input gives the same marginal product. So, this might be the condition for cost minimization.\n\nOption D says to find the combination where the price of labor equals the price of capital. But prices alone don't tell us about productivity. You could have two inputs costing the same, but if one is more productive, you'd want to use more of that one. So, equal prices don't ensure least-cost combination without considering marginal products.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The goal is to minimize cost for a given level of output. So, the firm wants to produce a certain amount of output as cheaply as possible. To do that, it needs to balance the productivity of labor and capital with their respective prices.\n\nI recall that the condition for cost minimization is that the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) should equal the ratio of input prices. The MRTS is the rate at which the firm can substitute labor for capital while keeping output constant. It's equal to the ratio of marginal products: MPL/MPK.\n\nSo, setting MRTS equal to the price ratio gives: MPL/MPK = PL/PK, where PL is the price of labor and PK is the price of capital.\n\nRearranging that, we get MPL/PL = MPK/PK, which is exactly what option C says.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct condition for hiring the least-cost combination of labor and capital.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: MPL = MPK. This would only be a special case where the prices of labor and capital are equal, which isn't generally true. So, this can't be the general condition for cost minimization.\n\nOption B: MPL/MPK = 1, which again is just MPL = MPK, same as option A.\n\nOption D: PL = PK. This is just saying that the prices are equal, but as I thought earlier, equal prices don't ensure that the firm is minimizing costs without considering marginal products.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
