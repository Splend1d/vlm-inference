                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this scenario where a man conveys a property to his wife's cousin with the condition \"to cousin and the heirs of his body.\" Then, he conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple. I need to figure out what interest, if any, his niece has under modern real estate laws.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"to cousin and the heirs of his body\" means. This sounds like a type of life estate where the cousin gets the property during his lifetime, and after his death, the property goes to his heirs. But specifically, \"heirs of his body\" usually refers to his lineal descendants, like his children and their descendants.\n\nNow, the man conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple. A fee simple is the most complete ownership interest in property, meaning the niece would own the property absolutely, with the right to use it, dispose of it, or pass it on to heirs.\n\nBut since he already conveyed the property to his cousin with the condition about heirs of his body, I need to see how these two conveyances interact.\n\nUnder the traditional common law system of future interests, when you have a grant \"to A and the heirs of his body,\" it typically creates a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent or a fee simple determinable, depending on the exact wording. However, in modern property law, things might be different.\n\nIn modern real estate laws, many states have adopted the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities and other reforms that affect how future interests are handled.\n\nLet me consider the two conveyances:\n\n1. To cousin and the heirs of his body.\n\n2. Then to niece in fee simple.\n\nIf the first conveyance is interpreted as a life estate in the cousin, with the remainder to his heirs, then the second conveyance to the niece might be problematic because the property might already be conveyed to the cousin.\n\nAlternatively, if the first conveyance is a fee simple subject to a condition about having heirs, then the second conveyance might be seen as a conveyance of whatever interest remains.\n\nBut under the race-notice statute or grantor recording statute, depending on the state, the priority of the conveyances might depend on who records their deed first.\n\nAssuming that the conveyance to the cousin was recorded first, and then the conveyance to the niece was recorded later, the niece's interest might be subordinate to the cousin's interest.\n\nAlternatively, if the niece records her deed first, she might have priority.\n\nBut the question is about the interest the niece has under modern real estate laws and practice in most states today.\n\nI think I need to look at the principles of conveyancing and the rules regarding concurrent conveyances of the same property.\n\nIn most states, the general rule is that the first party to convey and record their deed has priority, provided they are a bona fide purchaser without notice of any prior claims.\n\nSo, if the conveyance to the cousin was recorded first, and the conveyance to the niece was recorded later, the niece would have no interest because the property was already conveyed to the cousin.\n\nAlternatively, if the niece's deed was recorded first, she would have priority.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify the recording order, so I'll assume that the conveyance to the cousin was recorded first.\n\nTherefore, the conveyance to the niece would be\u65e0\u6548 because the property was already conveyed to the cousin.\n\nSo, option A seems plausible: \"The conveyance gives the niece nothing because the property was already conveyed in fee simple to his wife's cousin.\"\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLet's consider that the first conveyance is \"to cousin and the heirs of his body.\" If this is interpreted as a fee simple determinable, it might automatically revert to the grantor if the cousin fails to have heirs.\n\nThen, if the grantor conveys the property to the niece in fee simple, that conveyance might be of the future interest, i.e., the possibility of reverter.\n\nBut in modern property law, such future interests are strictly construed, and the Rule Against Perpetuities might void them if they are too uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conveyance to the niece extinguishes any future interest the grantor has.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me look at the answer choices:\n\nA. The conveyance gives the niece nothing because the property was already conveyed in fee simple to his wife's cousin.\n\nB. She gets a reversion in case the cousin has no heir of his body at his death.\n\nC. A contingent remainder based upon whether or not cousin has heirs.\n\nD. She has a fee simple.\n\nOption A suggests that the niece gets nothing because the property was already conveyed to the cousin.\n\nOption B suggests that the niece gets a reversion if the cousin has no heirs.\n\nOption C suggests a contingent remainder depending on whether the cousin has heirs.\n\nOption D says the niece has a fee simple.\n\nGiven that the first conveyance is \"to cousin and the heirs of his body,\" and then the second conveyance is to the niece in fee simple, I need to see how these two conveyances interact.\n\nIf the first conveyance is a fee simple determinable, it automatically reverts to the grantor if the condition fails\u2014that is, if the cousin has no heirs.\n\nThen, if the grantor conveys the property to the niece in fee simple, he's conveying whatever interest he has, which would be the possibility of reverter.\n\nIn that case, the niece would have an interest only if the property reverts back to the grantor, which happens if the cousin has no heirs.\n\nSo, the niece's interest would be contingent on the cousin having no heirs.\n\nThis sounds similar to a contingent remainder.\n\nBut in the traditional sense, a contingent remainder is an interest that is subject to a condition precedent.\n\nHowever, in modern property law, the rules might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conveyance to the niece is a executory interest, which springs when a certain condition is met.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second conveyance is invalid because the grantor no longer has any interest to convey after the first conveyance.\n\nIf the first conveyance is a fee simple determinable, the grantor retains a possibility of reverter, which is a future interest.\n\nThen, conveying that future interest to the niece in fee simple might be possible.\n\nIn that case, the niece would have an interest that would vest only if the condition fails\u2014that is, if the cousin has no heirs.\n\nSo, her interest is contingent on the cousin having no heirs.\n\nThis seems closest to option C: a contingent remainder based upon whether or not cousin has heirs.\n\nOption B says she gets a reversion if the cousin has no heir of his body at his death.\n\nA reversion is the interest that automatically returns to the grantor when a condition fails.\n\nBut in this case, the grantor has already conveyed that possibility of reverter to the niece.\n\nSo, perhaps the niece holds something similar to a reversionary interest.\n\nBut I think \"contingent remainder\" is more accurate.\n\nOption D says she has a fee simple, which seems unlikely because her interest is contingent on the cousin's failure to have heirs.\n\nSo, it's not an absolute fee simple.\n\nTherefore, between options B and C, I think C is more appropriate because a contingent remainder better describes an interest that is subject to a condition precedent.\n\nOption B suggests she gets a reversion, but reversion is typically an interest retained by the grantor, not conveyed to someone else.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely confident, as property law can be tricky, especially with these future interests.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps under modern laws, the second conveyance is invalid because the grantor no longer has any interest to convey after the first conveyance.\n\nIn that case, the niece gets nothing, which is option A.\n\nBut I think that if the grantor conveys the possibility of reverter to the niece, that should be valid.\n\nTherefore, the niece has a contingent interest that vests only if the cousin has no heirs.\n\nSo, option C seems most correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
