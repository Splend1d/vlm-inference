                    "text": "So I've got this question about the Johansen \"trace\" test, and I need to figure out which eigenvalues are used when testing for a null hypothesis of 2 cointegrating vectors in a system with 4 variables. The options are: all of them, the largest 2, the smallest 2, or the second largest.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Johansen test is all about. It's a method used in time series analysis to test for cointegration among multiple non-stationary variables. Cointegration means that even though the variables themselves might be non-stationary, some linear combination of them is stationary.\n\nThe Johansen test comes in two flavors: the trace test and the maximum eigenvalue test. The trace test is the one mentioned here, and it's used to test the null hypothesis that the number of cointegrating vectors is less than or equal to a certain number against the alternative that it's greater.\n\nIn this case, the null hypothesis is that there are 2 cointegrating vectors in a system of 4 variables. So, I need to know which eigenvalues are involved in computing the test statistic for this specific null.\n\nI remember that in the Johansen procedure, eigenvalues are associated with the strength of the cointegrating relationships. Larger eigenvalues correspond to stronger cointegrating relationships.\n\nThe trace test statistic is calculated by summing the natural logarithms of (1 - \u03bb_i) for the eigenvalues that are being considered under the null hypothesis.\n\nWait, actually, I think it's the sum of the natural logarithms of (1 - \u03bb_i) for the eigenvalues that are not being restricted by the null hypothesis.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIn the Johansen trace test, the null hypothesis is that the number of cointegrating vectors is less than or equal to r, and the test statistic is:\n\ntrace = -T * sum_{i=r+1}^{k} ln(1 - \u03bb_i)\n\nwhere T is the number of observations, \u03bb_i are the eigenvalues sorted in descending order, and k is the number of variables in the system.\n\nSo, for a system with 4 variables (k=4), and testing the null that there are 2 cointegrating vectors (r=2), the trace test would sum over the eigenvalues from i=3 to i=4, which are the smallest two eigenvalues.\n\nWait, if r=2, then sum_{i=3}^{4} ln(1 - \u03bb_i), so that's the smallest two eigenvalues.\n\nBut let's confirm this.\n\nYes, in the Johansen procedure, the eigenvalues are ordered from largest to smallest, \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 ... \u2265 \u03bbk.\n\nThe trace test for H0: rank \u2264 r involves summing the logarithms of (1 - \u03bb_i) from i=r+1 to k.\n\nSo, for r=2 and k=4, it's i=3 and i=4, which are the smallest two eigenvalues.\n\nTherefore, the smallest two eigenvalues are used in the test.\n\nBut looking back at the options, it's C. The smallest 2.\n\nWait, but the question is a bit tricky because it says \"which eigenvalues would be used in the test?\"\n\nIn the trace test, it's the eigenvalues that are not being restricted by the null hypothesis that are used in the test statistic.\n\nSo, if H0: rank \u2264 2, then the eigenvalues \u03bb3 and \u03bb4 are the ones that are being tested, assuming that \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 correspond to the two cointegrating vectors under the null.\n\nWait, no. Actually, under the null hypothesis that there are at most r cointegrating vectors, the smallest k - r eigenvalues are associated with the absence of cointegration, and the test checks whether these smallest eigenvalues are significantly different from zero.\n\nSo, for r=2 in a k=4 system, the smallest two eigenvalues (\u03bb3 and \u03bb4) are the ones that should be close to zero if the null is true.\n\nThe test statistic is constructed using these smallest eigenvalues.\n\nTherefore, the smallest two eigenvalues are used in the test.\n\nBut let me think again.\n\nActually, in the Johansen trace test, the test statistic is:\n\ntrace = -T * sum_{i=r+1}^{k} ln(1 - \u03bb_i)\n\nSo, for r=2 and k=4, it's sum over i=3 and i=4.\n\nThese are the smallest two eigenvalues.\n\nSo, yes, the smallest two eigenvalues are used in the test.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. The smallest 2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider what the other options might imply.\n\nIf it were A. All of them, that would mean using all four eigenvalues in the test statistic, which isn't the case.\n\nB. The largest 2 would correspond to summing over \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, but that's not what's done under the null hypothesis of rank \u2264 2.\n\nD. The second largest would be \u03bb2, but again, that's not relevant for the trace test statistic under this null.\n\nSo, indeed, the correct answer is C. The smallest 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
