                    "text": "So I've got this question here about property interests and rights of way. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, there's an orange grove and a grapefruit grove that are next to each other. The citrus grower owns the orange grove completely (fee simple) and lives and runs his business there. He also has a right of way across the grapefruit grove, which is owned by a farmer. This right of way allows him to cross the grapefruit grove on foot, by bike, or by car, and it's all spelled out in a written agreement.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the citrus grower's property interest in the use of his right of way across the grapefruit grove. The options are:\n\nA. license\n\nB. easement in gross\n\nC. easement appurtenant\n\nD. prescriptive easement\n\nOkay, let's break these down one by one.\n\nFirst, what's a license? I think a license is like permission to use someone else's property, but it's not a property interest itself. It's more like a personal privilege that can be revoked at any time. So, if the citrus grower had just the farmer's verbal okay to cross the grapefruit grove, that might be a license. But here, it's a written agreement, which seems more formal.\n\nNext, an easement in gross. I recall that an easement in gross is a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose, and it's not tied to ownership of another piece of land. It's like a personal right attached to the owner, not to the land. So, if the citrus grower has an easement in gross, it means he has a right to cross the grapefruit grove for his personal use, regardless of whether he owns the orange grove or not.\n\nThen there's an easement appurtenant. This is different because it's a right that benefits one piece of land at the expense of another. So, if the right of way is for the benefit of the orange grove, and it's tied to the land itself, then it would be an easement appurtenant. That means if the orange grove is sold to someone else, the right of way would pass to the new owner.\n\nLastly, a prescriptive easement. That's when someone uses another's land continuously for a certain period without permission, and eventually, they gain a legal right to continue using it. But in this case, the right of way was granted by a written agreement, so it's not something that was acquired through continuous use without permission.\n\nOkay, so going back to the options, since there's a written agreement granting the right of way for specific purposes (on foot, bike, or car), it sounds like an easement rather than a license, because it's more formal and probably has some legal standing.\n\nNow, between easement in gross and easement appurtenant, the key difference is whether the right is tied to the land or to the individual. Here, the citrus grower has the right of way for his personal use, and it's granted in a written agreement. But, since he owns the orange grove and uses the right of way for access to his property, it might be argued that it's for the benefit of the orange grove, making it an easement appurtenant.\n\nWait, but the question says it's for crossing on foot, by bicycle, or automobile, which sounds like it's for the citrus grower's personal use, not necessarily for the benefit of the orange grove specifically. Although, in reality, it's likely for accessing his orange grove.\n\nLet me check the definitions again.\n\nAn easement in gross is a right that benefits a particular individual or entity, not tied to any land they own. Whereas an easement appurtenant benefits one piece of land and burdens another.\n\nIn this case, the right of way is granted to the citrus grower across the grapefruit grove, and it's for his personal use, not necessarily for the benefit of his orange grove specifically. Although, in practice, it might be for accessing his orange grove.\n\nBut the question is, what is the nature of his property interest in the use of the right of way?\n\nGiven that it's a written agreement granting him the right to cross the grapefruit grove for personal use, it sounds more like an easement in gross, because it's a personal right attached to him, not necessarily to his orange grove.\n\nHowever, since he owns the orange grove and likely uses the right of way to access it, it could also be argued that it's an easement appurtenant, benefiting the orange grove.\n\nThis is a bit confusing.\n\nLet me consider the legal definitions more carefully.\n\nAn easement in gross is a right that benefits a particular individual or entity, regardless of whether they own any land. For example, a right to cross someone's land to access a public beach, where the right is personal to the individual.\n\nAn easement appurtenant, on the other hand, is a right that benefits one piece of land (the dominant estate) and burdens another piece of land (the servient estate). So, in this case, if the orange grove is the dominant estate and the grapefruit grove is the servient estate, then it would be an easement appurtenant.\n\nGiven that the citrus grower owns both the orange grove and has a right of way across the grapefruit grove to access his orange grove, it seems more likely that it's an easement appurtenant, because it's for the benefit of his orange grove property.\n\nMoreover, easements in gross are typically for commercial use, like utility companies having a right of way across multiple properties, but in this case, it's for personal use by the citrus grower.\n\nBut the question mentions that the right of way is for crossing on foot, by bicycle, or automobile, which seems more personal than commercial.\n\nHowever, since it's granted by a written agreement, it's probably an easement rather than a license.\n\nGiven that, between easement in gross and easement appurtenant, I think it's more appropriate to consider it an easement appurtenant because it benefits the orange grove property.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. easement appurtenant.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why it's not the other options.\n\nA. License: As mentioned earlier, a license is a personal privilege that can be revoked at any time, and it's not a property interest. Since there's a written agreement, it's more formal than a license.\n\nD. Prescriptive easement: This is acquired through continuous use without permission over a certain period, which is not the case here because the right of way was granted by agreement.\n\nB. Easement in gross: While it's a right granted to the citrus grower personally, the context suggests that it's for the benefit of his orange grove property, making it more of an easement appurtenant.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. easement appurtenant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
