                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is for this question about Mill CPA's report on agreed-upon procedures for Modern Co.'s royalty payments. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what agreed-upon procedures (AUP) engagement is. From what I recall, in an AUP engagement, a CPA firm performs specific procedures on a subject matter or an assertion in accordance with an agreement between the engaging party and the intended users. The CPA then reports on the factual findings of those procedures without providing any assurance or opinion.\n\nIn this case, Mill CPA was engaged by a group of royalty recipients to apply agreed-upon procedures to financial data supplied by Modern Co. regarding its compliance with contractual requirements to pay royalties. So, the focus is on compliance with contractual requirements for royalty payments.\n\nNow, I need to look at each option and see which one makes sense for the report in an AUP engagement.\n\nOption A: \"Disclaimer of opinion about the fair presentation of Modern's financial statements.\"\n\nThis seems unrelated to the AUP engagement. In an AUP engagement, the CPA doesn't provide any opinion on the financial statements as a whole or their fair presentation. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B: \"List of the procedures performed (or reference thereto) and Mill's findings.\"\n\nThis sounds more appropriate. In an AUP report, the CPA is supposed to list the procedures performed and report the findings of those procedures. There's no assurance or opinion provided; it's just a report of what was found based on the specific procedures agreed upon.\n\nOption C: \"Opinion about the effectiveness of Modern's internal control activities concerning royalty payments.\"\n\nAgain, in an AUP engagement, the CPA doesn't provide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. That would be more aligned with an attestation engagement, like an internal control audit, not an AUP engagement.\n\nOption D: \"Acknowledgment that the sufficiency of the procedures is solely Mill's responsibility.\"\n\nWhile the CPA does perform the procedures as agreed, the responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures typically lies with the engaging party and the intended users, not solely with the CPA. The CPA may provide guidance, but it's up to the engaging party to determine what procedures are necessary for their needs.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option B seems to be the most appropriate for an AUP report. It aligns with the nature of such engagements, which is to perform specific procedures and report the findings without providing any assurance or opinion.\n\nTo double-check, I recall that in AUP engagements, the report should include:\n\n1. A description of the procedures performed.\n\n2. The related findings.\n\n3. A statement that the report is intended for specific users and for specified purposes.\n\n4. A clarification that the CPA expresses no opinion or assurance on the subject matter or the assertion.\n\nOption B captures the essence of listing the procedures and reporting the findings, which is exactly what should be in an AUP report.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
