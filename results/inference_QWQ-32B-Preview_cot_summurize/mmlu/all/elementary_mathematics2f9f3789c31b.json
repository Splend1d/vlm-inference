                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We've got two whole numbers here, both of which are less than or equal to 12. Their least common multiple (LCM) is 60, and their greatest common factor (GCF) is 2. We need to figure out which pair of numbers fits these criteria. The options are:\n\nA. 6 and 10\n\nB. 5 and 12\n\nC. 10 and 12\n\nD. 12 and 15\n\nFirst, I need to recall what LCM and GCF mean. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both, while the GCF is the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder.\n\nGiven that, there's a relationship between LCM and GCF of two numbers. The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their LCM and GCF. In other words:\n\n\\[ \\text{number1} \\times \\text{number2} = \\text{LCM} \\times \\text{GCF} \\]\n\nSo, if LCM is 60 and GCF is 2, then:\n\n\\[ \\text{number1} \\times \\text{number2} = 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\]\n\nThis could be helpful in checking the pairs.\n\nNow, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: 6 and 10\n\nFirst, check if both are less than or equal to 12. Yes, both are.\n\nCalculate their LCM. The multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 60, etc. The multiples of 10 are 10, 20, 30, 60, etc. The smallest common multiple is 30, not 60. So, this doesn't match the given LCM of 60. Therefore, option A is not correct.\n\nOption B: 5 and 12\n\nBoth are less than or equal to 12.\n\nCalculate their LCM. The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60, etc. The multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36, 60, etc. The smallest common multiple is 60. That matches.\n\nNow, check the GCF. The factors of 5 are 1 and 5. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The greatest common factor is 1, not 2. So, this doesn't match the given GCF of 2. Therefore, option B is not correct.\n\nOption C: 10 and 12\n\nBoth are less than or equal to 12.\n\nCalculate their LCM. The multiples of 10 are 10, 20, 30, 60, etc. The multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, etc. The smallest common multiple is 60. That matches.\n\nNow, check the GCF. The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The greatest common factor is 2. That matches. So, this pair satisfies both conditions.\n\nOption D: 12 and 15\n\nFirst, check if both are less than or equal to 12. 12 is equal to 12, but 15 is greater than 12. So, this pair doesn't satisfy the condition that each number is less than or equal to 12. Therefore, option D is not correct.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct choice is option C: 10 and 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
