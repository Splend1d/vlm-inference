                    "text": "Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used in statistics to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by repeatedly sampling from the original dataset with replacement. It is particularly useful when traditional assumptions about the data's distribution cannot be made or are violated. Let's analyze each option to determine under which situations bootstrapping would be preferred over pure simulation.\n\n**Option (i): If it is desired that the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are the same as those of some actual data.**\n\nBootstrapping involves resampling from the actual data, thereby preserving the empirical distribution of the original dataset. In contrast, pure simulation often relies on assuming a specific theoretical distribution (e.g., normal, Poisson) to generate data. Therefore, if the goal is to maintain the same distributional properties as the actual data, bootstrapping is preferred because it directly uses the data's empirical distribution without making strong assumptions about its form.\n\n**Option (ii): If it is desired that the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are known exactly.**\n\nPure simulation is typically used when the distributional properties are known and can be specified parametrically. For example, if data are known to be normally distributed with specific mean and variance, one can simulate data from this distribution. Bootstrapping, on the other hand, makes no assumptions about the underlying distribution and instead relies on the empirical distribution of the data. Therefore, if the distributional properties are known exactly, pure simulation might be preferred because it can generate data that exactly match the specified distribution. Bootstrapping would be less necessary in this scenario since the distribution is already known.\n\n**Option (iii): If the distributional properties of the actual data are unknown.**\n\nWhen the distributional properties of the data are unknown or unclear, bootstrapping is a valuable tool because it does not require any assumptions about the underlying distribution. It uses the data themselves to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic. Pure simulation, conversely, often requires specifying a distribution, which may not be possible or accurate if the distribution is unknown. Therefore, in situations where the distribution is unknown, bootstrapping is preferred.\n\n**Option (iv): If the sample of actual data available is very small.**\n\nBootstrapping can be particularly useful with small sample sizes because it makes efficient use of the available data by resampling with replacement. However, the effectiveness of bootstrapping diminishes with very small sample sizes, as the resampled datasets may not adequately represent the population. In such cases, pure simulation might be preferred if there is prior knowledge about the distribution, allowing for more reliable simulation of data. Nevertheless, bootstrapping can still be applied, and in some cases, it may be the only feasible option when no distributional assumptions can be made.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Option (i): Bootstrapping is preferred when wanting to match the distributional properties of actual data.\n\n- Option (ii): Pure simulation is preferred when distributional properties are known exactly.\n\n- Option (iii): Bootstrapping is preferred when distributional properties are unknown.\n\n- Option (iv): Bootstrapping can be used with small samples, but pure simulation might be preferred if distribution is known.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. (i) and (iii) only**. These are the scenarios where bootstrapping is specifically preferred over pure simulation due to its ability to preserve the empirical distribution without making strong assumptions about the data's underlying distribution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
