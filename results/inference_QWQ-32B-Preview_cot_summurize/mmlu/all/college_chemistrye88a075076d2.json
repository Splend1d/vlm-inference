                    "text": "To determine which nuclide has an NMR frequency of 115.5 MHz in a 20.0 T magnetic field, we can use the relationship between the NMR frequency (\u03bd), the gyromagnetic ratio (\u03b3), and the magnetic field strength (B):\n\n\u03bd = \u03b3 * B / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for \u03b3:\n\n\u03b3 = (2 * \u03c0 * \u03bd) / B\n\nGiven that \u03bd = 115.5 MHz = 115.5 \u00d7 10^6 Hz and B = 20.0 T, we can plug in these values:\n\n\u03b3 = (2 * \u03c0 * 115.5 \u00d7 10^6 Hz) / 20.0 T\n\nFirst, calculate 2 * \u03c0:\n\n2 * \u03c0 \u2248 6.2832\n\nNow, multiply by \u03bd:\n\n6.2832 * 115.5 \u00d7 10^6 Hz \u2248 726.14 \u00d7 10^6 Hz\n\nThen, divide by B:\n\n726.14 \u00d7 10^6 Hz / 20.0 T \u2248 36.307 \u00d7 10^6 Hz/T\n\nSo, \u03b3 \u2248 36.307 MHz/T\n\nNow, we need to find which nuclide has a gyromagnetic ratio close to this value. Let's look up the gyromagnetic ratios for the given options:\n\nA. 17O (Oxygen-17)\n\nB. 19F (Fluorine-19)\n\nC. 29Si (Silicon-29)\n\nD. 31P (Phosphorus-31)\n\nLooking up the gyromagnetic ratios:\n\n- 17O: \u03b3 \u2248 35.23 MHz/T\n\n- 19F: \u03b3 \u2248 40.75 MHz/T\n\n- 29Si: \u03b3 \u2248 10.07 MHz/T\n\n- 31P: \u03b3 \u2248 17.23 MHz/T\n\nComparing these to our calculated \u03b3 of 36.307 MHz/T, the closest value is for 17O with \u03b3 \u2248 35.23 MHz/T.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a slight discrepancy. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n\u03bd = 115.5 MHz = 115.5 \u00d7 10^6 Hz\n\nB = 20.0 T\n\n\u03b3 = (2 * \u03c0 * \u03bd) / B\n\n2 * \u03c0 \u2248 6.2832\n\n6.2832 * 115.5 \u00d7 10^6 Hz \u2248 726.14 \u00d7 10^6 Hz\n\n726.14 \u00d7 10^6 Hz / 20.0 T = 36.307 \u00d7 10^6 Hz/T = 36.307 MHz/T\n\nIndeed, 17O has \u03b3 \u2248 35.23 MHz/T, which is close but not exact. 19F has a higher \u03b3 of 40.75 MHz/T, which is further off. 29Si and 31P have lower \u03b3 values.\n\nGiven that 17O is the closest, it might be the answer, but the discrepancy suggests that perhaps there's an error in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be \u03bd = \u03b3 * B, without the 2 * \u03c0 factor. Let's check this.\n\nIn NMR, the Larmor frequency \u03bd is given by:\n\n\u03bd = \u03b3 * B / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nThis is because \u03b3 is usually given in units of radians per second per tesla, and frequency is in Hertz.\n\nSo, the original formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes \u03b3 is given in MHz per tesla, and in that case, \u03bd (in MHz) = \u03b3 (in MHz/T) * B (in T).\n\nIn this case, \u03bd = \u03b3 * B\n\nSo, \u03b3 = \u03bd / B = 115.5 MHz / 20.0 T = 5.775 MHz/T\n\nBut this seems much lower than the typical \u03b3 values for these nuclides.\n\nTherefore, the first approach is correct, and the discrepancy might be due to the fact that the gyromagnetic ratios of nuclides are not exact integers and can vary slightly depending on the source.\n\nGiven that, 17O with \u03b3 \u2248 35.23 MHz/T is the closest to our calculated \u03b3 of 36.307 MHz/T.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the proton gyromagnetic ratio and scaling factors, but that seems unnecessary given the direct approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 17O.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
