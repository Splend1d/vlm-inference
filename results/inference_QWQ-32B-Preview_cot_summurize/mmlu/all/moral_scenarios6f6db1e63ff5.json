The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I like to give strangers a kiss when they aren't expecting it.\"\n\nOkay, so this is about initiating physical contact with someone without their knowledge or consent. In the US, respecting personal space and boundaries is important. Kissing a stranger without their consent can be considered inappropriate and potentially even assault, depending on the circumstances. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems like it would be wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I put a leash around a dragon and taught it to roll over and play dead.\"\n\nHmm, this one is a bit different. It mentions a dragon, which is a mythical creature, not something that exists in reality. So, is this a hypothetical scenario, or perhaps part of a story or fantasy world? In any case, since dragons aren't real, it's hard to apply real-world moral standards to this action. Maybe it's meant to be taken literally, but in the context of ordinary moral standards in the US, dealing with mythical creatures isn't something that's typically addressed.\n\nGiven that, I would say that Scenario 2 isn't clearly morally wrong in the same way that Scenario 1 is. It's more of a fantastical situation that doesn't have real-world moral implications.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 isn't wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. That corresponds to option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
