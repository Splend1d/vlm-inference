                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: there are two points on a Cartesian plane, (1,2) and (7,4), and they're opposite vertices of a square. I need to find the area of that square. The options are 20, 34, 40, and square root of 40.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of squares on a coordinate plane. In a square, all sides are equal, and the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. Since I have two opposite vertices, I can find the length of the diagonal and then use that to find the side length and subsequently the area.\n\nSo, let's find the length of the diagonal. The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the distance formula:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\\]\n\nPlugging in the points (1,2) and (7,4):\n\n\\[\\sqrt{(7 - 1)^2 + (4 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 4} = \\sqrt{40}\\]\n\nSo, the diagonal of the square is \\(\\sqrt{40}\\) units long.\n\nNow, in a square, the relationship between the side length (s) and the diagonal (d) is given by:\n\n\\[d = s\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSo, I can solve for s:\n\n\\[s = \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{40}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{20}\\]\n\nThen, the area (a) of the square is s squared:\n\n\\[a = s^2 = (\\sqrt{20})^2 = 20\\]\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the coordinates of the other two vertices of the square. Since it's a square, the sides should be perpendicular to each other, and the distances between adjacent vertices should be equal.\n\nLet me try to find the coordinates of the other two vertices.\n\nGiven points (1,2) and (7,4), the vector between them is (7-1, 4-2) = (6,2).\n\nTo find the other two vertices, I can rotate this vector by 90 degrees clockwise and counterclockwise.\n\nA 90-degree rotation of a vector (a,b) is (-b,a), and a 270-degree rotation is (b,-a).\n\nSo, rotating (6,2) by 90 degrees gives (-2,6), and by 270 degrees gives (2,-6).\n\nThen, the other two vertices can be found by adding these vectors to one of the given points.\n\nStarting from (1,2):\n\nAdding (-2,6): (1-2, 2+6) = (-1,8)\n\nAdding (2,-6): (1+2, 2-6) = (3,-4)\n\nSo, the other two vertices are (-1,8) and (3,-4).\n\nNow, I can verify if these points form a square by checking the distances between all pairs of adjacent vertices.\n\nFirst, distance between (1,2) and (-1,8):\n\n\\[\\sqrt{(-1-1)^2 + (8-2)^2} = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 36} = \\sqrt{40}\\]\n\nWait, that seems too large. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, no, let's check again.\n\nDistance between (1,2) and (-1,8):\n\n\\[\\sqrt{(-1 - 1)^2 + (8 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 36} = \\sqrt{40}\\]\n\nDistance between (1,2) and (3,-4):\n\n\\[\\sqrt{(3 - 1)^2 + (-4 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 36} = \\sqrt{40}\\]\n\nHmm, that's the same as the diagonal. That can't be right because the sides should be shorter than the diagonal.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the rotations. Let me try again.\n\nGiven the vector from (1,2) to (7,4) is (6,2). Rotating this vector by 90 degrees should give a vector perpendicular to it, which would be (-2,6) or (2,-6).\n\nThen, to find the other vertices, I should add these perpendicular vectors to the given vertices.\n\nSo, starting from (1,2), add (-2,6) to get the next vertex:\n\n(1-2, 2+6) = (-1,8)\n\nThen, from (-1,8), add (6,2) to get to (5,10), but that's not one of the original points.\n\nWait, maybe I need to add the perpendicular vector to (7,4) as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Maybe sticking to the first method is better.\n\nGiven that the diagonal is \\(\\sqrt{40}\\), and knowing that in a square, diagonal = side * sqrt(2), so side = diagonal / sqrt(2) = sqrt(40) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(20), and area = side^2 = 20.\n\nThat matches option A.\n\nBut let me double-check with another approach.\n\nLet me consider the midpoint of the diagonal, which should be the center of the square.\n\nThe midpoint between (1,2) and (7,4) is:\n\n\\[\\left( \\frac{1+7}{2}, \\frac{2+4}{2} \\right) = (4,3)\\]\n\nNow, the sides of the square should be perpendicular to the diagonal.\n\nThe slope of the diagonal is:\n\n\\[\\frac{4-2}{7-1} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\nSo, the slope of the sides should be the negative reciprocal, which is -3.\n\nSo, the equations of the sides can be found using point-slope form, knowing a point and the slope.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too involved. Perhaps I should just stick with the first method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use vectors to find the area.\n\nThe area of the square is equal to the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides divided by 2.\n\nBut since it's a square, and I have the diagonal, perhaps it's more straightforward to use the diagonal to find the area.\n\nI recall that the area of a square is also equal to half the product of its diagonals if the diagonals are perpendicular, which they are in a square.\n\nWait, in a square, the area is (diagonal^2)/2.\n\nBecause area = side^2, and side = diagonal / sqrt(2), so area = (diagonal^2)/2.\n\nWait, but earlier I used side = diagonal / sqrt(2), then area = side^2 = (diagonal^2)/2.\n\nBut in this case, diagonal is sqrt(40), so area = (sqrt(40))^2 / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20.\n\nAgain, that matches option A.\n\nBut maybe I should check with the distance formula for all sides to confirm.\n\nGiven vertices (1,2), (7,4), (-1,8), and (3,-4).\n\nFirst, distance between (1,2) and (7,4): sqrt(40)\n\nBetween (1,2) and (-1,8): sqrt(40)\n\nBetween (1,2) and (3,-4): sqrt(40)\n\nWait, that can't be right for a square. In a square, adjacent sides should have the same length, and diagonals should be equal and longer than the sides.\n\nI think I messed up the coordinates of the other vertices.\n\nLet me try to find the other two vertices again.\n\nGiven points (1,2) and (7,4), and the vector between them is (6,2).\n\nRotating (6,2) by 90 degrees gives (-2,6).\n\nSo, from (1,2), adding (-2,6) gives (1-2,2+6)= (-1,8)\n\nFrom (7,4), adding (-2,6) gives (7-2,4+6)=(5,10)\n\nWait, but (5,10) wasn't one of the points I had before. Maybe I need to add the other rotation.\n\nRotating (6,2) by 270 degrees gives (2,-6).\n\nFrom (1,2), adding (2,-6) gives (1+2,2-6)=(3,-4)\n\nFrom (7,4), adding (2,-6) gives (7+2,4-6)=(9,-2)\n\nSo, the four vertices should be (1,2), (7,4), (-1,8), and (3,-4), or alternatively (1,2), (7,4), (5,10), and (9,-2). Wait, that seems inconsistent.\n\nMaybe I need to verify which ones actually form a square.\n\nLet me calculate the distances between all pairs:\n\nFirst, between (1,2) and (7,4): sqrt(40)\n\nBetween (1,2) and (-1,8): sqrt(40)\n\nBetween (1,2) and (3,-4): sqrt(40)\n\nBetween (7,4) and (-1,8): sqrt((7 - (-1))^2 + (4 - 8)^2) = sqrt(8^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(64 + 16) = sqrt(80)\n\nBetween (7,4) and (3,-4): sqrt((7 - 3)^2 + (4 - (-4))^2) = sqrt(4^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(16 + 64) = sqrt(80)\n\nBetween (-1,8) and (3,-4): sqrt((-1 - 3)^2 + (8 - (-4))^2) = sqrt((-4)^2 + 12^2) = sqrt(16 + 144) = sqrt(160)\n\nThis doesn't make sense for a square, where all sides should be equal and diagonals equal.\n\nI must have made a mistake in finding the other vertices.\n\nPerhaps instead of adding the rotated vectors to one point, I should add half the rotated vector or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should try a different approach altogether.\n\nLet me consider that in a square, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other at right angles.\n\nI can find the length of the diagonal, which I already did as sqrt(40), and then use the property that the area is (diagonal^2)/2 for a square.\n\nSo, area = (sqrt(40))^2 / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20.\n\nThat matches option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use vectors to find the area.\n\nLet me define vectors from one vertex to the other two adjacent vertices, and then take their cross product to find the area.\n\nBut I don't know the coordinates of the adjacent vertices yet.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the first method, as it seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the area using the determinant formula for the coordinates.\n\nGiven four points, the area can be found by ordering the points and using the shoelace formula.\n\nBut since I don't have all four points correctly, that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the side length of the square is equal to the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals, but in a square, the diagonals bisect each other, so that might not help.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that in a square, the area is side squared, and side is diagonal over sqrt(2).\n\nSo, side = sqrt(40) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(20), and area = 20.\n\nAgain, that matches option A.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that the area could be 34 or 40.\n\nIf I mistakenly calculated the diagonal as something else, maybe I'd get a different answer.\n\nBut according to the distance formula, the diagonal is sqrt(40), and area is 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the points aren't opposite vertices, but adjacent vertices. But the problem says opposite vertices.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again.\n\n\"points (1,2) and (7,4) are opposite vertices of a square.\"\n\nYes, they are opposite vertices.\n\nIf they were adjacent, maybe the area would be different, but according to the problem, they are opposite.\n\nSo, I think the answer is indeed 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
