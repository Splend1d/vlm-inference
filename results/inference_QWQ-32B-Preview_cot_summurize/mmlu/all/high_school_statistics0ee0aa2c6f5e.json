                    "text": "To determine who is more unusually tall within their respective sex, we need to compare how far each person's height is from their own gender's mean height in terms of standard deviations. This is because standard deviations give us a sense of how spread out the heights are within each group.\n\nFirst, let's recall the given data:\n\n- Mean height of adult men: 70 inches\n\n- Standard deviation for men: 4 inches\n\n- Mean height of adult women: 66 inches\n\n- Standard deviation for women: 3 inches\n\nWe have a man who is 74 inches tall and a woman who is 70 inches tall. We need to find out who is more unusually tall within their own group.\n\nTo do this, we can calculate the z-score for each person. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. The formula for the z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{\\text{individual's height} - \\text{mean height}}{\\text{standard deviation}} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the z-score for the man:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{man}} = \\frac{74 - 70}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1.00 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the z-score for the woman:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{woman}} = \\frac{70 - 66}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.33 \\]\n\nSo, the man's height is 1.00 standard deviation above the mean for men, while the woman's height is approximately 1.33 standard deviations above the mean for women.\n\nIn terms of how unusually tall they are within their own groups, the woman is more unusually tall because her height is further from the mean in terms of standard deviations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The woman, because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women, whereas the man\u2019s height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of all men.\n\nNow, let's consider why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. It cannot be determined, because the mean heights for the two groups are different.\n\n- This is incorrect because even though the mean heights are different, we are comparing each individual to their own group's mean and standard deviation. The difference in means doesn't prevent us from making this comparison.\n\nB. It cannot be determined, because the standard deviations of the heights for the two groups are different.\n\n- This is also incorrect because we are normalizing the heights by each group's standard deviation. The fact that the standard deviations are different allows us to make a fair comparison by using z-scores.\n\nC. The man, because he is 74 inches tall and the woman is only 70 inches tall.\n\n- This is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the different means and standard deviations for each group. Simply comparing raw heights doesn't tell us who is more unusually tall within their own group.\n\nSo, the key point is to use z-scores to standardize the comparison, allowing us to see who is relatively taller in their respective groups.\n\n"
