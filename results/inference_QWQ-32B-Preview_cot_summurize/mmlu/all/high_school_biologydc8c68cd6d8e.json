                    "text": "So I've got this question about horses evolving over time, and it says they've gradually gotten bigger. And I need to pick the best term from these options: artificial selection, directional selection, stabilizing selection, or disruptive selection. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what each of these terms means.\n\nArtificial selection is when humans breed animals or plants for specific traits. Like, breeders might choose horses with certain characteristics because people want them for racing or riding or something. But in this case, the question is about fossil evidence over geologic time, which is millions of years. Humans haven't been around that long to breed horses specifically for size. So, probably not artificial selection.\n\nNext, directional selection. I think this is when there's a consistent pressure for one extreme of a trait. So, if larger horses had an advantage over smaller ones in their environment over time, nature would select for larger sizes. That sounds pretty similar to what the question is describing. Horses gradually increasing in size over geologic time could be because larger size conferred some advantage, like being able to reach higher vegetation or scare off predators better.\n\nThen there's stabilizing selection, which is when the average trait is favored, and extremes are selected against. So, if medium-sized horses had the best survival and reproduction rates, that would be stabilizing selection. But the question says horses have increased in size, which suggests that larger sizes were favored over time, not the average size.\n\nDisruptive selection is when both extremes of a trait are favored over the average. So, both very large and very small horses had advantages, but medium-sized ones did not. But again, the question indicates a gradual increase in size, which doesn't really fit with disruptive selection.\n\nSo, considering all this, directional selection seems to be the best fit. It makes sense that if being larger provided a consistent advantage over time, horses would evolve to be larger.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it. Could artificial selection have played a role over geologic time? Well, humans only started domesticating horses relatively recently, maybe 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. Geologic time spans millions of years, so human influence is a blip in that timeline. Therefore, the size increase over geologic time is more likely due to natural selection rather than artificial selection.\n\nAlso, maybe environmental changes led to directional selection. For example, if the climate changed and only larger horses could survive, that could explain the increase in size. Or perhaps competition with other species favored larger size.\n\nStabilizing selection usually maintains the status quo, so it doesn't explain a trend toward larger size.\n\nDisruptive selection would lead to two different extremes, which doesn't match the observation of a gradual increase in size.\n\nTherefore, I think directional selection is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
