                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** If H is a subgroup of a group G and a belongs to G, then aH = Ha.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what aH and Ha represent. Here, aH is the left coset of H in G with respect to a, which is the set {ah | h \u2208 H}, and Ha is the right coset of H in G with respect to a, which is {ha | h \u2208 H}.\n\nIn general, for an arbitrary subgroup H of G and an element a in G, there is no reason to expect that aH and Ha are the same set. The equality aH = Ha holds for all a in G if and only if H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSo, in general, Statement 1 is false because not all subgroups are normal. There are examples of groups and subgroups where aH \u2260 Ha for some a in G.\n\n**Statement 2:** If H is normal in G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H.\n\nThis statement is about the commutativity of elements from H and a specific element a in G when H is a normal subgroup.\n\nA subgroup H of G is normal if and only if for all a in G and h in H, there exists some h' in H such that ah = h'a. This is often written as aH = Ha, which is similar to Statement 1, but with the condition that H is normal.\n\nHowever, normality does not imply that every element of H commutes with every element of G. It only implies that the left and right cosets are equal.\n\nSo, even if H is normal in G, it is not necessarily true that ah = ha for all h in H and for all a in G. This would only be the case if G is abelian, which is a stronger condition.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also false.\n\nGiven that both statements are false, the correct choice is:\n\nB. False, False\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
