                    "text": "So, I've got this question here about international trade and why countries sometimes try to protect their own firms from global competition. The question is: \"International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?\" And there are four options:\n\nA. Irrationality on the part of the leadership\n\nB. Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n\nC. Regime type\n\nD. International conflict prevents trade\n\nFirst off, I need to understand the premise here. It says that international trade almost always benefits both countries. That sounds familiar; it's based on the idea of comparative advantage, right? Each country specializes in what it does best, and they trade, and both end up better off. So, if that's the case, why would countries want to protect their own firms from world market competition?\n\nOption A says \"irrationality on the part of the leadership.\" Hmm, maybe sometimes leaders don't understand economics, or they're making decisions based on political considerations rather than economic rationality. That could be a reason, but it seems a bit simplistic. Not all leaders are irrational, and there might be more nuanced reasons.\n\nOption B says \"costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed.\" This one sounds interesting. Let me think about it. When a country opens up to free trade, certain industries might suffer because they can't compete with imports. Those costs are borne by specific groups, like workers in those industries or the firms themselves. So, the costs are concentrated on those groups.\n\nOn the other hand, the benefits of free trade are more dispersed. Consumers get access to cheaper goods, a wider variety of products, and maybe higher quality. These benefits are spread out among all consumers in the country. So, even though the total benefits might outweigh the costs, the costs are felt more acutely by specific groups, who might lobby against free trade and for protectionism.\n\nThis seems like a plausible explanation. It aligns with political economy theories where special interest groups with concentrated interests can influence policy, even if the overall welfare is higher with free trade.\n\nOption C mentions \"regime type.\" I'm not sure how regime type directly relates to protectionism. Maybe in some types of political systems, there's more pressure to protect certain industries, but it doesn't seem like a direct or primary reason for protectionism. It might be a factor in some cases, but it doesn't strike me as the main reason.\n\nOption D says \"international conflict prevents trade.\" Well, if there's a conflict between countries, that might lead to trade restrictions or protectionist measures, but again, it's not a general explanation for why countries protect their firms. It's more of a specific scenario.\n\nComparing all these options, option B seems to be the most comprehensive and directly related to the economics of trade and political influence.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
