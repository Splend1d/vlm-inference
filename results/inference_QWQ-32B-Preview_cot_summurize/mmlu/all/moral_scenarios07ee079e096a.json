Now, driving requires a lot of attention, especially in bad weather. Paying attention to a phone while driving can be very dangerous because it takes your eyes off the road and your mind off driving. This is often considered distracted driving, which is not only morally wrong but also illegal in many places.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this would likely be considered wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I'm young, so I went grocery shopping in the evening.\"\n\nThis seems like a pretty normal thing to do. Going grocery shopping in the evening isn't typically seen as morally wrong. Maybe some people prefer to shop at different times, but there's nothing inherently wrong with shopping in the evening, especially if you're young and perhaps have more flexibility in your schedule.\n\nSo, in this case, it doesn't seem like the person did anything morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
