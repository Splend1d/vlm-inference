                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a retiree who owned a vacant lot next to his house and decided to give it to his friend for $28,000. He did this by executing a deed, which was then recorded. The description of the property in the deed is a bit tricky, and after the retiree died, his heirs are contesting the friend's title to the lot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the property description in the deed. It says: \"all the tract of land beginning at the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way; thence west along Davis Street 100 feet; thence north 175 feet; thence west 100 feet; thence south 175 feet along University Way to the place of beginning.\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let's try to visualize this. The lot is adjacent to both Davis Street and University Way. Davis Street and University Way presumably form a corner, and the lot is at that corner.\n\nThe description starts at the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way. So, let's assume Davis Street runs east-west, and University Way runs north-south. The northwest corner would be where the northwest ends of these streets meet.\n\nFrom there, it goes \"thence west along Davis Street 100 feet.\" Wait, if Davis Street runs east-west, and we're starting at the northwest corner, moving west along Davis Street would take us along the street away from University Way.\n\nThen, \"thence north 175 feet.\" So, from the end of that first line, moving north.\n\nThen, \"thence west 100 feet.\" From the end of the northward line, moving west again.\n\nFinally, \"thence south 175 feet along University Way to the place of beginning.\" So, from there, moving south along University Way back to the starting point.\n\nThis sounds a bit messy. Let's see if this description actually closes properly, meaning if the lines described form a continuous loop back to the starting point.\n\nStarting at the northwest corner of Davis and University:\n\n1. West along Davis Street 100 feet.\n\n2. North 175 feet.\n\n3. West 100 feet.\n\n4. South 175 feet along University Way back to the starting point.\n\nWait a minute, if we start at the northwest corner, go west along Davis Street 100 feet, then north 175 feet, then west 100 feet, and finally south 175 feet along University Way, do we end up where we started?\n\nLet's plot this out:\n\n- Starting point: northwest corner of Davis and University.\n\n- Go west along Davis Street 100 feet: so we're moving along Davis Street away from University Way, so our coordinates might be (starting point) -> (100 feet west, 0 feet north).\n\n- Then north 175 feet: from that point, moving north, so now we're at (100 feet west, 175 feet north).\n\n- Then west 100 feet: from there, moving another 100 feet west, so now we're at (200 feet west, 175 feet north).\n\n- Then south 175 feet along University Way: moving south, but along University Way, which is presumably a street running north-south. So, if University Way is running north-south, and we're moving south along it, we should be moving south from our current position.\n\nBut our current position is 200 feet west and 175 feet north from the starting point. If University Way is running north-south, and we're supposed to move south along it, does that mean we need to align ourselves with University Way?\n\nThis seems confusing. Maybe the description is flawed.\n\nIn surveying and property description, particularly using the metes and bounds system, it's crucial that the description forms a closed loop, meaning the starting and ending points coincide.\n\nIn this case, the description seems to have an error because moving west twice and then north and south might not bring us back to the starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intention was to describe a rectangle bounded by Davis Street and University Way.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct description should be:\n\n- Starting at the northwest corner of Davis and University.\n\n- Thence west along Davis Street 100 feet.\n\n- Thence south along the west line 175 feet.\n\n- Thence east 100 feet along University Way.\n\n- Thence north 175 feet back to the starting point.\n\nBut the actual description doesn't match this.\n\nInstead, it says:\n\n- Thence west along Davis Street 100 feet.\n\n- Thence north 175 feet.\n\n- Thence west 100 feet.\n\n- Thence south 175 feet along University Way to the place of beginning.\n\nThis seems to describe a parcel that is 200 feet west and 175 feet north from the starting point, but then trying to close along University Way, which doesn't make much sense.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the description.\n\nNow, the heirs are contesting the friend's title. So, the question is whether the friend has valid title to the lot based on this deed description.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The retiree's heirs will prevail because metes and bounds, rather than streets, are appropriate boundary descriptions.\n\nI'm not sure about this. Metes and bounds are a valid way to describe property, and using streets as references is also common. So, this seems a bit vague.\n\nB. The friend will prevail because equity will not permit forfeiture for a mere technicality.\n\nThis suggests that even if there's a mistake in the description, equity (fairness) will side with the friend.\n\nC. The outcome will depend on whether the tract of land was plotted as a lot in a subdivision.\n\nThis implies that if the land was part of a subdivision with recorded plats, that might affect the interpretation of the description.\n\nD. The outcome will depend on whether the last call (175 feet along University Way) prevails over the third call (west 00 feet).\n\nThis seems to suggest that in property descriptions, the last call (direction) takes precedence in closing the loop.\n\nI need to think about which of these is most accurate.\n\nFirst, let's consider the accuracy of the property description. In legal terms, a property description in a deed must adequately identify the property being conveyed. If the description is ambiguous or incorrect, it could lead to title issues.\n\nIn this case, the description seems ambiguous and potentially incorrect, as the directions don't form a clear closed loop.\n\nOption A suggests that the heirs will win because metes and bounds aren't appropriate here. But metes and bounds are a standard way to describe property, so I don't think that's the issue.\n\nOption B suggests that equity will side with the friend despite a technical mistake. This could be possible, but it depends on the severity of the mistake and whether the intent is clear.\n\nOption C suggests that whether the land was part of a subdivision affects the outcome. If the land was part of a subdivision with recorded lot lines, that could override the deed description or provide clarity.\n\nOption D suggests that the last call in the description takes precedence. In surveying, there's a principle that the last call is given more weight in correcting errors, but I'm not sure if that directly applies here.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is the most accurate. If the tract was plotted as a lot in a subdivision, then the recorded plat would likely control the boundaries, regardless of the deed description's inaccuracies. So, if there's a recorded subdivision map showing the lot lines, that would determine the boundaries, and the friend's title would be secured based on the plat, not solely on the deed description.\n\nOn the other hand, if the land wasn't part of a subdivision, then the deed description would be crucial, and its inaccuracies could lead to title issues.\n\nTherefore, the outcome depends on whether the tract was plotted as a lot in a subdivision.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
