Allegheny.\n\nFirst, I know that the Seine is a famous river in France. It flows through Paris, which is the capital city. So, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is the Volga. I think the Volga is in Russia. It's the longest river in Europe, and it flows through Russia. So, that's not France.\n\nOption C is the Mekong. I believe the Mekong is in Southeast Asia. It flows through countries like Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Definitely not France.\n\nOption D is the Allegheny. I think that's a river in the United States, specifically in Pennsylvania. It's part of the Ohio River basin. So, not in France either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Seine, as it's the only river among the options that flows through France.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
