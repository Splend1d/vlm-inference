According to the ex-con's plan, he would pick up the two men in the van on Friday morning and drive over to the bank where the robbery would occur.

The two men, nevertheless, decided to carry out the robbery using the van that the ex-con had stolen. On Friday moming, the two men drove to the bank.

                    "text": "Let's break this down step by step. We have an ex-con who approached two men to participate in a bank robbery. All three agreed, and the ex-con planned the robbery, including stealing a van to use as the getaway vehicle. The plan was to meet on Friday morning, but the ex-con was arrested the day before for a parole violation.\n\nDespite this, the two men decided to proceed with the robbery using the stolen van. They went to the bank on Friday morning but were arrested by an undercover police detective who had received an anonymous tip.\n\nWe need to determine which crimes the ex-con should be found guilty of from the given options:\n\nA. Automobile theft and solicitation.\n\nB. Automobile theft and conspiracy.\n\nC. Automobile theft and attempted robbery.\n\nD. Automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n\nFirst, let's consider the automobile theft. The ex-con stole a van to use as the getaway vehicle for the robbery. Theft is a completed crime, so he is guilty of automobile theft.\n\nNext, let's look at solicitation. Solicitation is encouraging or requesting someone to commit a crime, with the intent that the person will engage in the criminal act. Here, the ex-con asked two men if they wanted to take part in a bank robbery, and they agreed. So, he solicited them to commit robbery.\n\nHowever, in this case, the ex-con went beyond just soliciting; he also planned the robbery and provided the getaway vehicle. This suggests a higher level of involvement than just solicitation.\n\nConspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, coupled with an intent to achieve the objective of the agreement. Here, the ex-con and the two men agreed to commit a bank robbery, which satisfies the agreement element. Additionally, they took steps towards committing the robbery, such as stealing the van and setting a date to meet.\n\nAttempted robbery is coming close to committing the robbery but failing for some reason. In this case, the ex-con was arrested before the robbery took place, but his cohorts proceeded with the robbery using the stolen van and were arrested.\n\nNow, considering the ex-con's actions:\n\n1. He stole a van, which is automobile theft.\n\n2. He solicited two men to commit robbery.\n\n3. He conspired with the two men to commit robbery.\n\n4. His cohorts attempted to commit robbery using the stolen van.\n\nThe question is, for which crimes should the ex-con be found guilty?\n\nFirst, he is clearly guilty of automobile theft, as he stole the van.\n\nSecond, he solicited the two men to commit robbery, so he could be guilty of solicitation.\n\nHowever, since he went beyond solicitation and conspired with them, conspiracy might be a more appropriate charge than solicitation alone.\n\nThird, regarding the attempted robbery, the ex-con was arrested before the robbery took place, but his cohorts proceeded with the robbery using the stolen van.\n\nIn criminal law, an accomplice or co-conspirator can be held liable for crimes committed by other members of the conspiracy in furtherance of the conspiracy's objectives, provided those crimes were foreseeable.\n\nHere, the attempted robbery was in furtherance of the conspiracy to rob the bank, and it was foreseeable that such an attempt would be made.\n\nTherefore, even though the ex-con was not present during the attempted robbery, he could be held liable for the attempted robbery as a co-conspirator.\n\nSo, considering all this, the ex-con should be found guilty of automobile theft, conspiracy to commit robbery, and attempted robbery.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Automobile theft and solicitation.\n\nB. Automobile theft and conspiracy.\n\nC. Automobile theft and attempted robbery.\n\nD. Automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n\nOption D seems to encompass all the crimes he should be found guilty of.\n\nHowever, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any reason why he shouldn't be charged with conspiracy?\n\nWell, he agreed with the two men to commit robbery and took steps to prepare for it, so conspiracy is appropriate.\n\nIs there any reason why he shouldn't be charged with attempted robbery?\n\nEven though he wasn't present during the attempt, as a co-conspirator, he can be liable for the acts of his co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most comprehensive and accurate.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if solicitation is a separate charge from conspiracy.\n\nSolicitation is encouraging someone to commit a crime, while conspiracy is an agreement to commit a crime.\n\nIn this case, since there was an agreement between the ex-con and the two men, conspiracy is the more appropriate charge.\n\nSolicitation is typically charged when there is no conspiracy, but here, there was a conspiracy.\n\nTherefore, option A, which includes solicitation, might not be as accurate as option B or D.\n\nBut option D includes conspiracy and attempted robbery, which seem appropriate.\n\nWait, but option D includes all three: automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n\nIs there any reason to exclude one of these charges?\n\nWell, the ex-con stole the van, which is automobile theft.\n\nHe conspired with the two men to rob the bank.\n\nAnd he can be held liable for the attempted robbery by his co-conspirators.\n\nTherefore, all three charges seem applicable.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D. Automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
