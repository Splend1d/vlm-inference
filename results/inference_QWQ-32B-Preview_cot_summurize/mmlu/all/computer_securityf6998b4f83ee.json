                    "text": "I think the answer is C. WPS. Let me see why.\n\nSo, WPA2, that's Wi-Fi Protected Access version 2, right? That's been around for a while, like since 2004 or something. It's a security protocol for Wi-Fi networks. Similarly, WPA is the predecessor to WPA2, and WEP is even older, from like the late 90s. WEP had some serious security issues, which is why WPA and then WPA2 were developed.\n\nNow, WPS is Wi-Fi Protected Setup. From what I remember, WPS was introduced to make it easier for users to connect new devices to their Wi-Fi network without having to enter the long Wi-Fi password each time. It's like a simpler way to add devices quickly.\n\nI think WPS started showing up on wireless access points a few years back as a new feature. It's often represented by a button on the router or by entering a PIN. So, that sounds right.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nWPA2 has been the standard for a long time, so it wouldn't be considered a new way of adding devices recently.\n\nWPA is outdated now, and WEP is definitely old school.\n\nSo, yeah, WPS seems to be the correct answer here. It's designed to simplify the process of connecting new devices to a Wi-Fi network, which aligns with the statement about a new way of adding or connecting new devices.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
