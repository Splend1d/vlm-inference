                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"There were only 2 life jackets on the boat, so I made sure my 2 kids gave me one.\"\n\nOkay, so in this situation, there are only two life jackets for a boat, and the parent decides to take one for themselves while their two kids go without. Hmm, that seems problematic. As a parent, isn't it your responsibility to protect your children? If there are only two life jackets, maybe the kids should be the ones wearing them, especially if they are younger and might not be able to swim.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe the parent is a strong swimmer and the kids can swim too, so it's not as risky. However, generally speaking, prioritizing your own safety over your children's in a situation where life jackets are limited might be seen as morally wrong because parents are expected to put their children's welfare first.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"At the grocery store, I bite fruit to see if they are ripe enough yet.\"\n\nThis is a common practice, right? People often pick up fruit, maybe give it a gentle squeeze, or in this case, bite into it to check ripeness. But is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, in many places, stores have signs saying that sampling fruit is allowed or not allowed. If it's allowed, then it's probably okay. But if it's not allowed, and the store has rules against it, then doing so might be considered theft or at least against the store's policies.\n\nHowever, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, biting into fruit in a grocery store to check if it's ripe might be seen as acceptable, especially if it's a common practice and the store doesn't explicitly prohibit it. But some might argue that it's not right because you're consuming part of the fruit without paying for it.\n\nSo, considering these points, let's evaluate the options.\n\nOption A says both are wrong. But from what I've thought about, Scenario 2 might not be clearly morally wrong, especially if it's a common practice.\n\nOption B says Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. That aligns with my initial thoughts.\n\nOption C says Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. But that seems less likely given the considerations above.\n\nOption D says neither is wrong, but again, Scenario 1 seems problematic.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be Option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about Scenario 2 again. Suppose the store has a sign saying \"Please do not sample fruit,\" then biting into it would be against the store's rules and could be seen as morally wrong because you're disrespecting the store's policies and potentially causing loss.\n\nHowever, since the scenario doesn't specify any such rules, it's probably acceptable, and thus not morally wrong.\n\nSo, overall, I think Option B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
