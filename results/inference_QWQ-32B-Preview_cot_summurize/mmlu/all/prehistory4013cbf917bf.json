                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the palace at Knossos. The question is: \"At its peak, the palace at Knossos is thought to have had over _________ rooms.\" And the options are A. 100, B. 500, C. 1,000, D. 5,000.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about the palace at Knossos. I remember that it was the center of the Minoan civilization, which flourished on the island of Crete in the Bronze Age. The palace was a large complex that served as an administrative, religious, and commercial center.\n\nI think the palace was quite extensive, but I'm not sure exactly how many rooms it had. I recall that it was a multi-story building with a lot of rooms, but I don't remember the exact number or estimate.\n\nLet me think about the options provided:\n\nA. 100 rooms - That seems too small for a palace that was the center of a civilization. I doubt it had only 100 rooms.\n\nB. 500 rooms - That sounds more plausible. Many ancient palaces had hundreds of rooms.\n\nC. 1,000 rooms - This is also a possibility. Maybe the palace was even larger than 500 rooms.\n\nD. 5,000 rooms - That seems excessively large for an ancient palace, especially one from the Bronze Age.\n\nI need to consider what I know about the size of ancient palaces. For example, I know that the palace of Versailles has over 700 rooms, but that's from a much later period. In the Bronze Age, I don't know if any palace was that large.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the functionality of the palace. It was not only a residence for the royal family but also served administrative and religious purposes. So, it likely had rooms for storage, workshops, temples, audience halls, and living quarters.\n\nI recall that the palace at Knossos had a lot of storage rooms, called magazines, where grain and other goods were stored. There were also areas for religious ceremonies, like the throne room and the sanctuaries.\n\nMoreover, the palace was destroyed and rebuilt several times, so its size might have changed over time. But the question is about its peak, so probably the largest it ever was.\n\nI think that 1,000 rooms is a reasonable estimate for such a major palace in the Bronze Age. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was smaller, with around 500 rooms. But I have a feeling that modern archaeology suggests a larger number.\n\nWait a minute, I seem to remember a documentary where they estimated that the palace had around 1,400 rooms or something like that.\n\nBut I need to be careful because my memory might be fuzzy.\n\nPerhaps I should try to eliminate some options.\n\nOption A, 100 rooms, seems too small for a palace of this importance.\n\nOption D, 5,000 rooms, seems too large for a Bronze Age palace.\n\nBetween options B and C, I need to decide between 500 and 1,000 rooms.\n\nI think 1,000 rooms is more in line with what I've read or heard about the palace's size.\n\nSo, my best guess would be option C, 1,000 rooms.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look it up sometime when I have access to more information.\n\nFor now, I'll go with C. 1,000 rooms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
