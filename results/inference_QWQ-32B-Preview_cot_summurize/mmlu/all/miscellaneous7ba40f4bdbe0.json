I need to figure out which group among the Franks, Visigoths, Russians, and Anglo-Saxons was converted to Christianity in the tenth century AD by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire. Okay, first things first, I should recall when and how these groups adopted Christianity.\n\nStarting with the Franks: I know that the Franks were a Germanic people who played a crucial role in the history of the early medieval period in Europe. Clovis I, the King of the Franks, converted to Christianity in the late fifth century, around 496 AD, but that's way before the tenth century. So, that rules out option A.\n\nNext, the Visigoths: They were another Germanic group who also converted to Christianity, but they adopted Arian Christianity in the fourth century, and later switched to Nicene Christianity in the seventh century at the Third Council of Toledo. Again, this is earlier than the tenth century, so option B isn't the right answer.\n\nNow, the Russians: I think the Russians were converted to Christianity in the late ninth or early tenth century. I recall something about Prince Vladimir of Kiev adopting Christianity around 988 AD, and that was influenced by the Byzantine Empire. Let me check that date again. Yes, according to history, in 988 AD, Prince Vladimir embraced Orthodox Christianity and had the residents of Kiev baptized by priests from the Byzantine Empire. This event is considered the baptism of Kievan Rus', which is the beginning of the Christianization of the Russian people. So, this seems to fit the time frame and the influence of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nLastly, the Anglo-Saxons: They were the Germanic people who settled in England starting in the fifth century. Christianity came to Britain before the Anglo-Saxon invasion with the Romans, but the Anglo-Saxons themselves were converted gradually starting in the seventh century, most notably with the mission of St. Augustine of Canterbury in 597 AD, who was sent by the Pope. So, this conversion happened much earlier than the tenth century and was influenced by the Roman Church, not the Byzantine Empire.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it seems that the Russians were the group that was converted to Christianity in the tenth century AD by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire. So, the answer should be C. Russians.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The conversion of Kievan Rus' is indeed attributed to Prince Vladimir in 988 AD, which is well within the tenth century. The Byzantine Empire played a significant role in this conversion, as Vladimir married a Byzantine princess and adopted their form of Christianity, Orthodox Christianity.\n\nI don't think there's any confusion here. The other options don't match the criteria of being converted in the tenth century by Byzantine missionaries. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Russians.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
