                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"When white light passes through a prism, the light that bends more than green is... A. red, B. yellow, C. blue, D. None of these.\" Hmm, I remember that when white light goes through a prism, it splits into different colors, right? That's called dispersion. But I'm a bit fuzzy on which colors bend more than others.\n\nI think different colors bend by different amounts because of refraction. Light changes speed when it enters a different medium, like from air into glass, and that causes it to bend. The amount of bending depends on the wavelength of the light. I think shorter wavelengths bend more than longer ones.\n\nLet me think about the colors of the spectrum. Starting from one end, we have red, then orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Red has the longest wavelength, and violet has the shortest. So if shorter wavelengths bend more, that means violet bends the most, followed by blue, then green, and so on, with red bending the least.\n\nSo, in a prism, the light that bends the most is violet, and it spreads out into its constituent colors. Now, the question is asking for the light that bends more than green. So, considering that violet bends more than green, and blue bends more than green as well.\n\nLooking at the options: A. red, B. yellow, C. blue, D. None of these. Red bends less than green, yellow bends less than green but more than red, and blue bends more than green. So, blue should bend more than green.\n\nWait, but I just thought that violet bends more than blue, which bends more than green. But the options don't include violet. So, is the answer blue?\n\nBut the question says \"the light that bends more than green.\" If blue bends more than green, and violet bends more than blue, but violet is not an option, maybe the answer is blue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"none of these\" because both blue and violet bend more than green, but violet is not an option. But that doesn't make sense because blue is an option and it does bend more than green.\n\nLet me check my understanding of the spectrum again. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Red has the longest wavelength, violet the shortest. In terms of bending in a prism, violet bends the most, then blue, then green, then yellow, orange, and red bends the least.\n\nSo, among the options given, blue bends more than green, red bends less than green, yellow bends less than green. So, the light that bends more than green is blue.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. blue.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the light that bends more than green.\" If blue bends more than green, and violet bends more than blue, but violet is not an option, then blue is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if \"none of these\" means that no colors bend more than green, which we know isn't true because blue and violet do, but violet isn't an option, so maybe \"none of these\" is incorrect.\n\nI think the best answer is C. blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
