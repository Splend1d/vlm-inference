                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Argon can be liquefied at low temperature because of...\" and there are four options: A. dipole-dipole attractive forces, B. hydrogen bonding, C. instantaneous and induced dipoles, and D. the very low temperature. I need to figure out which one is the correct reason why argon can be turned into a liquid at low temperatures.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic chemistry. Argon is a noble gas, right? It's in group 18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are known for being inert, meaning they don't readily form chemical bonds with other elements. That's because they have a full valence shell of electrons, making them stable.\n\nNow, when it comes to intermolecular forces, which are the forces that hold molecules together in a liquid or solid state, there are several types. The strongest are ionic and covalent bonds, but those are intramolecular forces, not intermolecular.\n\nFor intermolecular forces, the strongest type is hydrogen bonding, which occurs when a hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative atom like nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. Then there are dipole-dipole forces, which occur between molecules that have permanent dipoles due to differences in electronegativity between the atoms in the molecule. The weakest type of intermolecular force is the London dispersion force, also called instantaneous dipole-induced dipole forces. These occur in all molecules, whether they are polar or nonpolar, because of temporary fluctuations in electron distribution.\n\nSince argon is a noble gas and is monatomic, meaning it exists as single atoms, not molecules, it doesn't have dipole-dipole forces or hydrogen bonding. So options A and B can be eliminated.\n\nThat leaves options C and D. Option C mentions \"instantaneous and induced dipoles,\" which sounds a lot like London dispersion forces. Option D is \"the very low temperature.\"\n\nSo, is it because of the London dispersion forces or because of the low temperature?\n\nWell, both are related, but I think the question is asking for the type of intermolecular force responsible for argon's ability to liquefy at low temperatures.\n\nLondon dispersion forces are the only intermolecular forces present in argon, and these forces become stronger as the mass of the atom or molecule increases. However, even in large atoms like argon, these forces are relatively weak compared to other types of intermolecular forces.\n\nTo liquefy a gas, you need to overcome the kinetic energy of its particles by cooling it down or increasing the pressure. For gases with weak intermolecular forces, you need to reach very low temperatures to liquefy them because the kinetic energy needs to be significantly reduced for the weak attractive forces to dominate.\n\nArgon has a boiling point of about -185.8 degrees Celsius, which is indeed a very low temperature. So, in a way, it's the low temperature that allows argon to liquefy, but the underlying reason is the presence of London dispersion forces between the argon atoms.\n\nBut looking back at the options, C seems to be the most directly correct because it specifies the type of intermolecular force involved. Option D is somewhat vague because it just says \"the very low temperature,\" which is a consequence of the weak forces, not the cause.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. Instantaneous and induced dipoles, which refer to London dispersion forces.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about other gases. For example, nitrogen gas (N2) also liquefies at low temperatures, but it has stronger London dispersion forces than argon because nitrogen molecules are smaller and have fewer electrons, but they have a larger molecular mass compared to argon. Wait, no, argon has a larger atomic mass than nitrogen. Anyway, the point is, different gases have different boiling points based on the strength of their London dispersion forces.\n\nIn summary, argon can be liquefied at low temperatures because of the London dispersion forces between its atoms, which are the only intermolecular forces present in argon.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
