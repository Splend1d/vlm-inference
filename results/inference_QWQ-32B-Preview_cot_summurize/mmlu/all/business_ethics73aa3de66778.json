                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about post-modern ethics. It says that post-modern ethics assert that ethics are context and individual specific and as such have an internal guide to ethics. Then it lists options A through D with numbers 1,2,3 in different combinations. I'm not sure what 1,2,3 refer to here. Maybe they are statements or principles related to post-modern ethics.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what post-modern ethics are. From what I remember, post-modernism is a philosophical stance that criticizes modernist ideas of objective truth and universal norms. In ethics, this might mean that there are no absolute moral truths, and that ethical decisions are dependent on the context and the individual involved.\n\nSo, if post-modern ethics assert that ethics are context and individual specific, that means morality is not universal but varies based on situational factors and personal perspectives. And having an internal guide to ethics suggests that individuals rely on their own feelings, beliefs, or conscience to determine what is right or wrong, rather than external authorities or universal principles.\n\nNow, regarding the options A through D, which seem to involve selecting combinations of numbers 1,2,3. Perhaps these numbers correspond to certain features or characteristics of post-modern ethics. Maybe 1 represents context-specific ethics, 2 represents individual-specific ethics, and 3 represents internal guide to ethics. If that's the case, then the statement is asserting all three of these points.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 2,3 - which would be individual-specific ethics and internal guide to ethics.\n\nB. 1,3 - context-specific ethics and internal guide to ethics.\n\nC. 1,2,3 - context-specific, individual-specific, and internal guide to ethics.\n\nD. 1,2 - context-specific and individual-specific ethics.\n\nGiven that the statement mentions both context and individual specific ethics, and also an internal guide, it seems like all three are being asserted. Therefore, option C might be the correct choice.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether the internal guide is separate from the individual-specific part. If individual-specific already includes the idea that each person has their own moral guide, then maybe 2 and 3 are overlapping. But the statement separately mentions \"as such have an internal guide to ethics,\" which suggests that it's an additional point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 1 is context-specific, 2 is individual-specific, and 3 is internal guide, and the statement is asserting all three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers correspond to different schools of thought within post-modern ethics, but that seems less likely.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the key features of post-modern ethics:\n\n1. Relativism - morals are relative to context and individuals.\n\n2. Subjectivism - morals are based on personal feelings or beliefs.\n\n3. Anti-authoritarianism - rejection of external moral authorities.\n\nIf 1 is relativism (context and individual specific), 2 is subjectivism (internal guide), and 3 is anti-authoritarianism, then the statement is asserting 1 and 2, perhaps.\n\nBut the statement specifically mentions context and individual specific ethics and an internal guide, which aligns more closely with relativism and subjectivism.\n\nGiven that, options A (2,3) would be subjectivism and anti-authoritarianism, B (1,3) relativism and anti-authoritarianism, C (1,2,3) all three, D (1,2) relativism and subjectivism.\n\nIf anti-authoritarianism is not directly mentioned in the statement, perhaps it's not being asserted here. The statement focuses on context and individual specificity and internal guide, which would be relativism and subjectivism.\n\nTherefore, option D (1,2) might be the correct choice.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"as such have an internal guide to ethics,\" which suggests that because ethics are context and individual specific, they have an internal guide. So, perhaps 1 and 2 lead to 3, making all three related.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent different assertions within post-modern ethics, and the question is asking which of these are being asserted in this particular statement.\n\nWithout more context about what 1,2,3 represent, it's a bit challenging to be certain.\n\nGiven that, and assuming 1 is context-specific, 2 is individual-specific, and 3 is internal guide, and the statement affirms all three, then C (1,2,3) would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if 3 is a consequence of 1 and 2, then perhaps selecting 1 and 2 is sufficient.\n\nBut since the statement explicitly mentions \"as such have an internal guide to ethics,\" it seems like all three are being asserted.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. 1,2,3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
