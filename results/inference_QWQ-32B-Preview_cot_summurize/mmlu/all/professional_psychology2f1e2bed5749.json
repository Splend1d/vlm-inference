                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out what the key accomplishment of Piaget's preoperational stage is. I remember that Piaget had stages of cognitive development, and the preoperational stage is the second one, right after the sensorimotor stage.\n\nSo, during the sensorimotor stage, babies learn about the world through their senses and actions, and they develop the object permanence concept, which is knowing that objects still exist even when they can't see them. But that's the sensorimotor stage, and this question is about the preoperational stage.\n\nThe preoperational stage is from about 2 to 7 years old, I think. Kids start using symbols and language a lot more during this time. They can think about things symbolically, like using words and images to represent objects.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Conservation. I think conservation is about understanding that quantity doesn't change just because the arrangement changes. Like, if you have two identical glasses of water and you pour one into a taller, thinner glass, a child who understands conservation knows that the amount of water is the same. But I think conservation is more related to the concrete operational stage, which is the next stage after preoperational.\n\nB. The object concept. Hmm, object concept sounds similar to object permanence, which is more about knowing that objects exist even when out of sight. That seems like something from the sensorimotor stage.\n\nC. Formal operations. I know that formal operations are the last stage in Piaget's theory, around age 11 and up, where adolescents can think abstractly and hypothetically.\n\nD. The symbolic function. This sounds like it might be related to using symbols, which I think is a big part of the preoperational stage.\n\nWait, let me think again. In the preoperational stage, kids are starting to use symbols a lot more, like pretending a stick is a sword or something. They also develop language skills greatly during this time. So, symbolic function seems pretty central to this stage.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if that's considered the key accomplishment. Maybe there's something more specific.\n\nLet me recall, Piaget did some famous experiments, like the conservation experiments, but as I recall, children in the preoperational stage typically fail conservation tasks, which means they don't yet understand conservation. So, maybe conservation is more of an achievement in the next stage.\n\nWait, maybe the key accomplishment of the preoperational stage is the development of the symbolic function. That makes sense because they start to use symbols, engage in pretend play, and their language explodes during this time.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I'd go with D. the symbolic function.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check the other options.\n\nA. Conservation: That's more concrete operational.\n\nB. Object concept: That seems like sensorimotor.\n\nC. Formal operations: That's the last stage.\n\nYes, D seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
