It is typically associated with significant weight loss and an intense preoccupation with controlling one's weight and shape.\n\nLet's look at the options provided:\n\nA. Depressive symptoms\n\nB. Significant weight loss\n\nC. Body image distortion\n\nD. Fear of becoming fat\n\nFirst, we need to understand what are the core diagnostic features of Anorexia Nervosa according to established criteria, such as the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition).\n\nAccording to the DSM-5, the diagnostic criteria for Anorexia Nervosa include:\n\n1. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.\n\n2. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight.\n\n3. Disturbance in the way one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body shape and weight on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.\n\nNow, let's map these criteria to the options provided:\n\nB. Significant weight loss aligns with the first criterion of restricting energy intake leading to significantly low body weight.\n\nD. Fear of becoming fat aligns with the second criterion of an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight.\n\nC. Body image distortion aligns with the third criterion of disturbance in the way one's body weight or shape is experienced.\n\nOption A, depressive symptoms, is not explicitly listed as a core diagnostic feature of Anorexia Nervosa in the DSM-5 criteria. While it is common for individuals with Anorexia Nervosa to experience depression or other mood disorders concurrently, depression is not a required diagnostic feature for Anorexia Nervosa.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Depressive symptoms.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that depressive symptoms can co-occur with Anorexia Nervosa and may complicate the diagnosis and treatment. But for the purposes of this question, depressive symptoms are not considered a diagnostic feature of Anorexia Nervosa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
