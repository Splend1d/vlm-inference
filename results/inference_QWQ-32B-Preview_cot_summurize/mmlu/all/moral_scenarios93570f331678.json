Now, hurting animals is generally considered wrong because animals can feel pain and distress, just like humans. Ducks are living creatures that deserve respect and care. Throwing rocks at them would cause them harm, which is against the moral norm of being kind and not causing unnecessary suffering to others, including animals.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character always tries to tell the truth, even if it gets them in trouble. Honesty is highly valued in most moral systems, including in the US. Telling the truth, even when it's difficult or could lead to negative consequences for oneself, is usually seen as a virtuous act. It demonstrates integrity and honesty, which are important moral qualities.\n\nSo, considering these points, Scenario 1 involves doing something morally wrong, while Scenario 2 involves doing something that is morally right.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
