                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about fibre supplements and their properties or uses. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that's correct.\n\nOption A says, \"May be helpful in diverticular disease.\" I know that diverticular disease is when you have diverticula in the intestine, which are like small pouches that can get inflamed or infected. I think fibre is good for preventing constipation, which might reduce the pressure in the colon and perhaps prevent complications from diverticula. So, maybe A is correct.\n\nOption B says, \"Are always easily fermented by colonic bacteria.\" Fermentation is a process where bacteria break down fibre into shorter chains, like short-chain fatty acids, which can be beneficial for gut health. But not all fibres are easily fermented. Some are more resistant and pass through mostly intact. So, I don't think B is always true.\n\nOption C says, \"Are usually derived from soluble fibre sources.\" Fibre supplements can be from soluble or insoluble fibre sources. Soluble fibre dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance, which can help with digestion and cholesterol levels. Insoluble fibre adds bulk to the stool and helps food pass through the gut. So, I don't know if they're usually derived from soluble sources. Maybe half and half?\n\nOption D says, \"Should be avoided in constipation.\" Wait, isn't fibre supposed to help with constipation? Soluble fibre absorbs water and softens the stool, making it easier to pass, while insoluble fibre adds bulk. So, it seems like fibre supplements should be helpful for constipation, not avoided.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe in some cases, if someone has a sensitive gut, increasing fibre too quickly could cause gas or bloating, but generally, fibre is recommended for constipation.\n\nGiven that, option D seems incorrect.\n\nGoing back to option A, about diverticular disease. I recall that some studies suggest that a high-fibre diet can help reduce the risk of developing diverticula and complications like diverticulitis. Fibre helps keep the colon healthy and movements regular, which might decrease the pressure in the colon.\n\nSo, it makes sense that fibre supplements could be helpful in managing or preventing diverticular disease.\n\nOption B isn't always true because not all fibres are easily fermented.\n\nOption C might not be accurate because fibre supplements can be from both soluble and insoluble sources. In fact, some supplements combine both types.\n\nOption D is contrary to what I know about fibre and constipation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be A: May be helpful in diverticular disease.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
