So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nThe passage may be used as evidence that Copernicus differed from the traditional, Aristotelian natural philosophers of his day because he suggested that\n\nA. the cosmos is spherical\nB. the Earth is spherical\nC. the cosmos is geostatic\nD. the Earth is not stationary\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage from Copernicus's \"Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies.\" It's a foundational text in the history of science, where he presents his heliocentric model, challenging the long-held geocentric views. So, understanding this passage is key to grasping the shift in scientific thought during the Renaissance.\n\nFirst, Copernicus talks about the cosmos being spherical. He gives several reasons for this: the sphere is a perfect shape without joints, it's the most capacious form to contain everything, and it matches the observed shapes of celestial bodies like the Sun, Moon, and planets. This part seems pretty standard, as even Aristotle believed the cosmos was spherical.\n\nThen, he extends this to the Earth, saying that it's spherical because it presses equally from all sides toward its center. He acknowledges that mountains and valleys cause irregularities, but overall, the Earth is spherical. Again, this wasn't a new idea; ancient Greeks like Eratosthenes had already determined the Earth was round.\n\nSo, options A and B seem to be ideas that Copernicus shared with traditional natural philosophers. That means the difference lies elsewhere.\n\nNext, he delves into the movement of the Earth. He questions the common belief that the Earth is stationary at the center of the universe. He points out that observed changes in position could be due to either the movement of the observed object or the observer themselves.\n\nThis is a crucial part. Copernicus is suggesting that the apparent movement of the heavens could be due to the Earth moving, rather than the heavens moving around a stationary Earth. This is the heart of his heliocentric model.\n\nHe mentions that if the Earth revolves from west to east, it would explain the observed rising and setting of the Sun, Moon, and stars. This is a direct challenge to the geocentric model, where the Earth is stationary and everything else moves around it.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct choice: Copernicus differed from traditional natural philosophers by suggesting that the Earth is not stationary.\n\nOption C mentions that the cosmos is geostatic, which means that the Earth is at rest. Copernicus is arguing against this idea, proposing instead that the Earth moves. So, his view contradicts the geostatic notion.\n\nIn summary, while Copernicus agreed with traditional thinkers about the spherical nature of the cosmos and the Earth, he diverged significantly in his assertion that the Earth is not stationary but moves, specifically that it revolves around the Sun. This was a revolutionary idea that marked a major turning point in the history of astronomy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
