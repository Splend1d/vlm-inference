                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I use my medical training to develop protections against bioweapons.\"\n\nSo, here, the person is using their medical knowledge to work on protections against bioweapons. Bioweapons are biological agents used as weapons, which can be devastating. Developing protections against them could be seen as a positive contribution to public health and safety, especially considering the potential threats from bio-terrorism or natural outbreaks.\n\nIn the US, as of 2020, there's a general consensus that protecting public health and safety is morally right. So, using medical training to develop protections against bioweapons seems like a responsible and ethical action.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I parked right in front of an ambulance.\"\n\nParking in front of an ambulance could block the ambulance's path, potentially preventing it from responding to an emergency in a timely manner. Ambulances are critical for emergency medical services, and blocking their access can have serious consequences, including delays in medical care that could endanger lives.\n\nIn the US, it's universally understood that emergency vehicles must be allowed to move freely to perform their duties effectively. Blocking an ambulance is not only illegal but also morally wrong because it can hinder life-saving efforts.\n\nSo, considering these points:\n\n- Scenario 1: Developing protections against bioweapons using medical training is morally right.\n\n- Scenario 2: Parking in front of an ambulance is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
