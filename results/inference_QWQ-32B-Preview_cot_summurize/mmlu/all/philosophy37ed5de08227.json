                    "text": "I'm trying to recall what Brandt said about moral codes and their currency in society. I think he had some specific criteria for when a moral code is considered to have currency. Let me think about this.\n\nOption A says that a high proportion of adults in the society have to subscribe to its principles. That sounds plausible. If most people believe in the moral code, it probably has currency.\n\nOption B says that it has to be recognized as the moral code of the society. That also makes sense. Even if not everyone subscribes to it, if it's widely recognized as the moral standard, it might still have currency.\n\nOption C combines both A and B, suggesting that both conditions need to be met.\n\nOption D says neither A nor B, which would mean that something else entirely determines the currency of a moral code.\n\nI need to remember what Brandt actually said. I think he emphasized both subscription and recognition. So, maybe C is the correct answer.\n\nWait, I should double-check. In Brandt's theory, he might have placed more weight on one aspect over the other. Or perhaps he had a different criterion altogether.\n\nLet me try to recall the context. Brandt was a moral philosopher, and he wrote about moral realism and relativism. I think in his view, a moral code has currency if it is widely accepted and recognized within a society.\n\nSo, both subscription and recognition seem important. If a lot of people subscribe to it, and it's recognized as the society's moral code, then it certainly has currency.\n\nBut maybe one of them is sufficient on its own. For example, even if not many people subscribe to it, if it's recognized as the moral code, does that give it currency? Or vice versa?\n\nI think perhaps both are necessary. If a moral code is recognized as the society's code but few people actually subscribe to it, maybe it doesn't really have currency. Similarly, if many people subscribe to it but it's not recognized officially or socially, it might still have some influence but perhaps not full currency.\n\nSo, maybe both A and B are required for a moral code to have currency, which would make C the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Brandt thought that only subscription matters, and recognition is just a consequence of widespread subscription. In that case, maybe A is the right answer.\n\nI'm a bit unsure now. Maybe I should look up Brandt's actual words on this, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to make do with what I remember.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose in a society, the majority of people believe in a certain moral code, but for some reason, it's not recognized or acknowledged by the institutions or the leadership. In that case, does the moral code have full currency?\n\nMaybe not, because there's a disconnect between people's beliefs and the recognized standards. So, perhaps both subscription and recognition are necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, if a moral code is recognized by the society but few people actually believe in it, it might still have currency because people may feel compelled to follow it due to social pressures or norms.\n\nSo, maybe either one is sufficient, but having both would make it even stronger.\n\nWait, but the question is about when a moral code has currency, not when it's effective or influential.\n\nI think Brandt might have defined currency in terms of both subscription and recognition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he defined it based on subscription alone, arguing that the true measure of a moral code's currency is how many people actually hold it.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: maybe Brandt thought that a moral code has currency if it is the standard by which people judge moral actions, regardless of whether they personally subscribe to it or not.\n\nIn that case, recognition might be more important than subscription.\n\nBut that seems contrary to what I think I remember.\n\nI think I need to make a decision based on my current knowledge.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option C: both a and b are necessary for a moral code to have currency in a society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
