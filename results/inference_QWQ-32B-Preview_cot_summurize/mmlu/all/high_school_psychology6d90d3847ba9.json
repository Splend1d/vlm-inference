The options are biological, behavioral, cognitive, and humanistic. I think the answer is humanistic, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see.\n\nFirst, the biological approach focuses on how physical structures and processes in the body, like the brain and genetics, influence behavior and mental processes. It's more about the physical aspects rather than feelings or personal growth.\n\nNext, the behavioral approach is based on the idea that behaviors are learned through interactions with the environment, like conditioning and reinforcement. It doesn't really focus on internal feelings or human nature being positive; it's more about observable behaviors.\n\nThe cognitive approach emphasizes mental processes like thinking, memory, and problem-solving. While it does consider how people perceive and interpret the world, it's not specifically about feelings or the inherent positivity of human nature.\n\nFinally, the humanistic approach was developed as a reaction to the deterministic views of behaviorism and psychoanalysis. It focuses on the individual's subjective experience, personal growth, and the innate drive toward self-actualization. This sounds a lot like emphasizing people's feelings and viewing human nature as positive and growth-seeking.\n\nSo, to confirm, humanistic psychology is known for its emphasis on personal growth, self-actualization, and the inherent goodness of humans. Key figures like Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers are associated with this approach.\n\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs suggests that once basic needs are met, people strive for higher-level needs like self-actualization. Rogers developed client-centered therapy, which emphasizes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and congruence to facilitate personal growth.\n\nBoth of these perspectives align with the idea that humans have a natural tendency toward positivity and growth, and that their feelings and experiences are central to understanding their behavior.\n\nIn contrast, the other approaches don't place as much emphasis on these aspects. Biological psychology is more about physical processes, behavioral psychology is about observable actions and their consequences, and cognitive psychology is about mental processes like thinking and memory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. humanistic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
