Moral theories are like big ideas that help us understand what makes actions good or bad. They give us reasons and principles to decide whether something we do is the right thing to do.\n\nOption A says \"why an action is right or wrong.\" That sounds exactly like what moral theories are for. They provide standards or rules that tell us whether an action aligns with moral goodness or not.\n\nOption B says \"why one moral event caused another.\" This sounds a bit like cause and effect, but moral theories aren't primarily about how one moral situation leads to another. They're more about evaluating the morality of actions themselves.\n\nOption C says \"where a moral agent got her values.\" This seems to be about the origin of someone's morals, maybe from their culture, family, or personal experiences. While that's an interesting question, it's not the main purpose of moral theories. Moral theories are more about justifying why certain actions are right or wrong, not about tracing where someone's values came from.\n\nOption D says \"why people do what they do.\" This is more about human behavior and psychology. It's about understanding the motivations behind people's actions, which could be driven by morality, but also by other factors like desires, fears, or habits. Moral theories focus specifically on the moral aspect of actions, not on all the reasons why people act the way they do.\n\nSo, overall, the best answer is A: moral theories explain why an action is right or wrong. They give us the framework to make moral judgments and decisions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
