I don't remember the exact figure, but I know that Saudi Arabia is a country that spends a significant portion of its budget on defense due to regional security concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how GDP is related to military spending. GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of a country's economic activity. Military spending as a percentage of GDP indicates how much of the country's total economic output is allocated to defense purposes.\n\nSaudi Arabia is known for its high military expenditures because of its involvement in conflicts like the one in Yemen and its desire to counterbalance the influence of other regional powers, such as Iran. So, it's likely that the percentage is on the higher side among the options provided.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. 1% - That seems too low. If a country is prioritizing military spending, 1% might be typical for a neutral or less confrontational nation, but not for Saudi Arabia.\n\nB. 3% - This is still relatively low. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) recommends that its members spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense, so 3% would be above that, but I suspect Saudi Arabia spends more.\n\nC. 6% - This seems more plausible. Given the country's active role in regional conflicts and its desire to modernize its military, a higher percentage like 6% could be possible.\n\nD. 10% - That's a substantial portion of GDP. While Saudi Arabia does spend heavily on defense, allocating 10% of its GDP to the military might be excessively high, even for them.\n\nI think the most reasonable answer is C. 6%. It's higher than the NATO recommendation and reflects the country's security priorities without being unrealistically high.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to remember specific figures. I recall that in some years, Saudi military spending has been around 6-7% of GDP, but I'm not sure about exactly 2017.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the global context. Countries like the United States spend around 3-4% of their GDP on defense, while smaller nations might spend less. Given that Saudi Arabia is a key player in the Middle East, it's logical that their spending is higher.\n\nI'll go with C. 6% as the most likely answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
