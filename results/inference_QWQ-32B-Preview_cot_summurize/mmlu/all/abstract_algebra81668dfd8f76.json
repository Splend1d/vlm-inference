                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about group theory. The question is: In the group G = {2, 4, 6, 8} under multiplication modulo 10, what is the identity element? The options are A. 6, B. 8, C. 4, and D. 2.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an identity element is in the context of a group. In group theory, the identity element is the element that, when combined with any other element of the group under the group operation, leaves that other element unchanged. So, for multiplication, it would be an element e such that for any element a in G, a * e \u2261 a (mod 10).\n\nGiven that the group operation is multiplication modulo 10, I need to find which element in G, when multiplied by any other element in G and then taken modulo 10, gives back the original element.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 6\n\nLet's check if 6 is the identity element.\n\nTake a = 2.\n\n2 * 6 = 12 \u2261 2 (mod 10)? Well, 12 mod 10 is 2, which matches.\n\nTake a = 4.\n\n4 * 6 = 24 \u2261 4 (mod 10)? 24 mod 10 is 4, which matches.\n\nTake a = 6.\n\n6 * 6 = 36 \u2261 6 (mod 10)? 36 mod 10 is 6, which matches.\n\nTake a = 8.\n\n8 * 6 = 48 \u2261 8 (mod 10)? 48 mod 10 is 8, which matches.\n\nSo, for all elements in G, multiplying by 6 and taking modulo 10 gives back the original element. That suggests that 6 might be the identity element.\n\nBut let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption B: 8\n\nLet's test if 8 is the identity element.\n\nTake a = 2.\n\n2 * 8 = 16 \u2261 6 (mod 10), which is not equal to 2.\n\nAlready, this doesn't satisfy the condition for a = 2. So, 8 cannot be the identity element.\n\nOption C: 4\n\nLet's check if 4 is the identity element.\n\nTake a = 2.\n\n2 * 4 = 8 \u2261 8 (mod 10), which is not equal to 2.\n\nSo, 4 is not the identity element.\n\nOption D: 2\n\nLet's see if 2 is the identity element.\n\nTake a = 2.\n\n2 * 2 = 4 \u2261 4 (mod 10), which is not equal to 2.\n\nSo, 2 is not the identity element.\n\nFrom this, only option A (6) satisfies the condition for all elements in G.\n\nBut wait a minute, I recall that in some groups, the identity element for multiplication is 1. However, in this case, 1 is not in the group G. So, perhaps the group is defined differently, and within the set G, 6 acts as the identity element under multiplication modulo 10.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if 6 indeed behaves as the identity for all elements in G under the given operation.\n\nWe already checked:\n\n2 * 6 \u2261 2 (mod 10)\n\n4 * 6 \u2261 4 (mod 10)\n\n6 * 6 \u2261 6 (mod 10)\n\n8 * 6 \u2261 8 (mod 10)\n\nAll of these are true, so 6 is indeed the identity element for this group under multiplication modulo 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
