The informant gave a detailed description of the two men and the license number of the vehicle. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to the movie theater. A few minutes later, the police saw a car matching the description given parked about two blocks from the movie theater. When the police approached, they saw one man fitting the description provided. The police proceeded to the car and opened the doors of the vehicle. The police then pried open a locked tool case that was situated in the rear of the vehicle. Inside, the police found an envelope that contained about one gram of cocaine. They then placed the driver of the vehicle under arrest. Immediately thereafter, the police opened the glove compartment and found a small amount of marijuana.

                    "text": "This is a complex scenario involving search and seizure, which is governed by the Fourth Amendment in the United States. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and generally, a warrant is required for a search to be reasonable unless certain exceptions apply.\n\nLet's break down the events step by step:\n\n1. **Informant's Tip:** A reliable informant provides detailed information about two men selling narcotics outside a movie theater, including a description of the men and the license number of their blue car.\n\n2. **Dispatch of Police:** Based on this tip, a patrol car is sent to the movie theater.\n\n3. **Observation by Police:** Instead of finding the car at the movie theater, the police spot a matching description two blocks away.\n\n4. **Approach and Search:** The police approach the car, open its doors, and see a man who matches the description. They then proceed to pry open a locked tool case in the rear of the vehicle and find an envelope containing about one gram of cocaine.\n\n5. **Arrest and Further Search:** The driver is arrested, and immediately afterward, the police open the glove compartment and find a small amount of marijuana.\n\n6. **Charges and Motion to Exclude:** The driver is charged with two counts of possession of controlled dangerous substances and files a motion to exclude both the cocaine and the marijuana from evidence.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the motion to exclude the evidence will be granted as to the cocaine, the marijuana, or both.\n\n### Analysis\n\n#### Initial Stop and Search\n\n- **Reasonable Suspicion for Stop:** The police had a tip from a reliable informant, which included specific details such as the description of the men and the license plate number. This information likely provided reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle.\n\n- **Opening the Doors:** Approaching and opening the doors of the vehicle might be justified if the police have reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. However, generally, opening\u8f66\u95e8\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u62c5\u5fc3\u5acc\u7591\u4eba\u9003\u8dd1\u6216\u9500\u6bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\n\n- **Prying Open the Tool Case:** This action involves a more intrusive search. The tool case was locked, which suggests that it was private property that the police did not have permission to open. Without a warrant or exigent circumstances, prying open a locked container is likely a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n#### Arrest and Search Incident to Arrest\n\n- **Arrest Based on Cocaine:** The police found cocaine in the tool case, which provided probable cause to arrest the driver for possession of narcotics.\n\n- **Search Incident to Arrest:** Once the arrest is made, the police are allowed to search the area within the arrestee's immediate control for officer safety and to prevent destruction of evidence. This typically includes the passenger compartment of the vehicle.\n\n- **Glove Compartment Search:** Opening the glove compartment as part of a search incident to arrest may be permissible, but it depends on the specific circumstances, such as whether the compartment is within the arrestee's reach or if there is reason to believe evidence relevant to the arrest might be found there.\n\n### Legal Precedents\n\n- **Arizona v. Gant (2009):** This Supreme Court case holds that once an arrestee is secured and cannot access the interior of the vehicle, the police cannot search the vehicle unless they have a reasonable belief that evidence relevant to the arrest might be found in the vehicle.\n\n- **California v. Acevedo (1991):** This case allows for the warrantless search of a container within a vehicle if there is probable cause to believe that the container holds evidence of a crime.\n\n### Application to the Case\n\n1. **Cocaine in the Tool Case:**\n\n- The tool case was locked, and the police prying it open without a warrant or exigent circumstances likely violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\n- However, if there was probable cause to believe that the tool case contained narcotics (based on the informant's tip and the observation of the men), then under Acevedo, the search might be justified.\n\n- Given that the tool case was locked, and without explicit exigent circumstances, it's arguable that the search was unreasonable.\n\n2. **Marijuana in the Glove Compartment:**\n\n- The search of the glove compartment occurred after the arrest based on the cocaine.\n\n- Under Gant, if the arrestee was secured and could not reach the glove compartment, the police would need a reasonable belief that evidence relevant to the arrest might be found there to justify the search.\n\n- Finding cocaine already, the police might argue that additional narcotics could be present.\n\n- However, the scope of the search incident to arrest is limited, and the glove compartment might be considered outside the arrestee's immediate control if they were secured.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n\n- The search of the locked tool case may be deemed unreasonable, leading to the exclusion of the cocaine.\n\n- The search of the glove compartment might also be deemed unreasonable, leading to the exclusion of the marijuana.\n\nTherefore, the motion to exclude both the cocaine and the marijuana from evidence will most likely be granted.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
