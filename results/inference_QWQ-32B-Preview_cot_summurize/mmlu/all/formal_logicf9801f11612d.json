                    "text": "So I have these premises in propositional logic, and I need to figure out which of the options is a direct consequence of them. Let's list out the premises again to keep them clear:\n\n1. ~E \u2283 ~F\n\n2. G \u2283 F\n\n3. H \u2228 ~E\n\n4. H \u2283 I\n\n5. ~I\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. E \u2283 F\n\nB. F \u2283 G\n\nC. H \u2283 ~E\n\nD. ~H\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what each premise is saying and how they relate to each other.\n\nStarting with premise 1: ~E \u2283 ~F. This is a conditional statement that says if not E, then not F. Using contraposition, I know that this is logically equivalent to F \u2283 E. So, if F is true, then E must be true.\n\nPremise 2: G \u2283 F. This says that if G is true, then F is true.\n\nPremise 3: H \u2228 ~E. This is a disjunction, meaning either H is true, or not E is true, or both.\n\nPremise 4: H \u2283 I. If H is true, then I is true.\n\nPremise 5: ~I. This simply states that I is false.\n\nAlright, with these in mind, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: E \u2283 F\n\nDoes the set of premises imply that if E is true, then F is true?\n\nFrom premise 1, we have ~E \u2283 ~F, which as I noted earlier, is equivalent to F \u2283 E. But that's not the same as E \u2283 F. So, it seems like E \u2283 F isn't directly following from premise 1.\n\nIs there another premise that could help establish E \u2283 F?\n\nLooking at premise 2: G \u2283 F. This tells us something about F following from G, but not directly from E.\n\nPremise 3: H \u2228 ~E. This says that either H is true or E is false.\n\nPremise 4: H \u2283 I. If H is true, then I is true.\n\nPremise 5: ~I. I is false.\n\nGiven that I is false, and H \u2283 I, what can we say about H?\n\nWell, if H were true, then I would have to be true (from H \u2283 I), but I is false, so H must be false. Therefore, ~H is true.\n\nSo, from premises 4 and 5, we can conclude ~H.\n\nNow, going back to premise 3: H \u2228 ~E. Since we've established that ~H is true, meaning H is false, then for the disjunction H \u2228 ~E to be true (since it's a premise and must be true), ~E must be true. Therefore, E is false.\n\nSo, E is false.\n\nNow, knowing that E is false, what can we say about E \u2283 F?\n\nWell, in classical logic, a false antecedent makes the conditional true, regardless of the consequent. So, if E is false, then E \u2283 F is true.\n\nTherefore, option A, E \u2283 F, is true based on the premises.\n\nBut let's check the other options to make sure there isn't a better or more direct consequence.\n\nOption B: F \u2283 G\n\nDoes the premises imply that if F is true, then G is true?\n\nLooking at premise 2: G \u2283 F. This is the opposite of F \u2283 G. It doesn't necessarily mean that F \u2283 G.\n\nIn fact, G \u2283 F allows for the possibility that F is true without G being true. So, F could be true even if G is false. Therefore, F \u2283 G is not necessarily true based on the premises.\n\nOption C: H \u2283 ~E\n\nDoes the premises imply that if H is true, then E is false?\n\nWell, we've already determined that H is false, because H \u2283 I and ~I, which implies ~H.\n\nSo, H is false.\n\nNow, H \u2283 ~E means that if H were true, then E is false.\n\nBut since H is false, the conditional H \u2283 ~E is true regardless of the truth value of ~E, because a false antecedent makes the conditional true.\n\nHowever, we already know that E is false, as established earlier.\n\nSo, H \u2283 ~E is true, but it's not necessarily a direct consequence in the same way that ~H is directly derived.\n\nOption D: ~H\n\nWe've already established that ~H is true based on premises 4 and 5.\n\nSo, ~H is indeed a direct consequence of the premises.\n\nNow, comparing options A and D, both seem to be direct consequences, but the question asks for \"an immediate (one-step) consequence.\"\n\nGiven that, option D, ~H, is more directly derived from premises 4 and 5 in a single step, whereas option A, E \u2283 F, requires a bit more inference.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D. ~H.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFrom premises 4 and 5:\n\n4. H \u2283 I\n\n5. ~I\n\nTherefore, ~H. This is a direct application of modus tollens.\n\nThen, from premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n\nSince ~H is true, then ~E must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nSo, E is false.\n\nThen, E \u2283 F is true because E is false.\n\nBut the question is asking for an immediate consequence, which likely means a single inference step.\n\nIn that case, ~H is derived in one step from premises 4 and 5, whereas E \u2283 F requires deriving ~H first, then ~E, and then concluding E \u2283 F based on E being false.\n\nTherefore, ~H is more immediately derived.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. ~H.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
