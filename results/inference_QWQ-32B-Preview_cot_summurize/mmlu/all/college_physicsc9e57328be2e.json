                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of ionization energy and how it applies to the helium atom.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom or ion. For helium, which has two electrons, there are two ionization energies: the first ionization energy (removing the first electron) and the second ionization energy (removing the second electron from the singly ionized helium ion).\n\nThe problem states that the energy required to remove both electrons from the helium atom in its ground state is 79.0 eV. This total energy is the sum of the first and second ionization energies.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nTotal energy to remove both electrons = First ionization energy + Second ionization energy\n\nGiven that the total energy is 79.0 eV, we have:\n\nFirst ionization energy + Second ionization energy = 79.0 eV\n\nOur goal is to find the first ionization energy, which is the energy required to remove one electron from the neutral helium atom.\n\nTo proceed, we need to know the second ionization energy of helium. The second ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the helium ion (He+), which has only one electron.\n\nThe helium ion (He+) is isoelectronic with hydrogen, meaning it has a single electron orbiting a nucleus with twice the charge of hydrogen. Therefore, its energy levels are similar to hydrogen's, but scaled by the square of the nuclear charge.\n\nThe energy levels for hydrogen-like atoms are given by:\n\nE_n = - (Z^2 * R) / n^2\n\nwhere:\n\n- Z is the nuclear charge (for He+, Z = 2)\n\n- R is the Rydberg constant (approximately 13.6 eV for hydrogen)\n\n- n is the principal quantum number\n\nFor the ground state of He+ (n=1), the energy is:\n\nE_1 = - (2^2 * 13.6 eV) / 1^2 = -16 * 13.6 eV = -217.6 eV\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the given total ionization energy of 79.0 eV for both electrons. There must be a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the binding energy of the electrons in helium. The ground state energy of the helium atom is known to be approximately -79.0 eV per atom, which matches the total energy required to remove both electrons.\n\nBut to find the first ionization energy, we need to consider the energy difference between the neutral helium atom and the singly ionized helium ion (He+).\n\nLet's denote:\n\nE_total = energy required to remove both electrons = 79.0 eV\n\nE_first = first ionization energy (remove one electron from He to form He+)\n\nE_second = second ionization energy (remove one electron from He+ to form He^2+)\n\nSo, E_total = E_first + E_second = 79.0 eV\n\nWe need to find E_first.\n\nTo find E_first, we can use the known value of E_second and subtract it from E_total.\n\nBut we don't directly know E_second. However, we can find E_second using the energy levels of He+.\n\nSince He+ is hydrogen-like with Z=2, its ionization energy (which is E_second) can be calculated as:\n\nE_second = Rydberg constant * Z^2 = 13.6 eV * 4 = 54.4 eV\n\nWait, but if E_second is 54.4 eV, and E_total is 79.0 eV, then:\n\nE_first = E_total - E_second = 79.0 eV - 54.4 eV = 24.6 eV\n\nLooking back at the options, 24.6 eV is option A.\n\nHowever, this seems too low compared to the first ionization energy of helium, which I recall is around 24.6 eV, but the second ionization energy is much higher.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I have a confusion here.\n\nLet me check the standard values:\n\nThe first ionization energy of helium is approximately 24.6 eV, and the second ionization energy is approximately 54.4 eV. Adding these gives 79.0 eV, which matches the given total energy to remove both electrons.\n\nTherefore, the first ionization energy is indeed 24.6 eV.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the energy required to ionize helium, which is to remove one electron, so it should be the first ionization energy.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option A is 24.6 eV, which matches this calculation.\n\nBut the problem might be trying to test something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach considering the binding energy.\n\nThe binding energy of the two electrons in helium is 79.0 eV.\n\nThe first ionization energy is the energy required to remove one electron, which would leave helium in the singly ionized state.\n\nThe binding energy of the remaining electron in He+ would be higher due to the increased nuclear charge.\n\nBut using the straightforward approach, E_first = 24.6 eV seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the helium atom's ground state energy.\n\nThe ground state energy of the helium atom is known to be approximately -79.0 eV.\n\nWhen you remove one electron, the atom becomes He+, which has a ground state energy of -54.4 eV.\n\nTherefore, the energy required to remove one electron would be the difference between the ground state energy of neutral helium and the ground state energy of He+.\n\nSo, E_first = E(He+) - E(He) = (-54.4 eV) - (-79.0 eV) = 24.6 eV\n\nThis again confirms that the first ionization energy is 24.6 eV.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A, 24.6 eV.\n\nBut let's check if there's any mistake in considering the binding energies or the ionization energies.\n\nIn some contexts, the binding energy is the energy required to disassemble a system into its constituent parts. For helium, the binding energy of the two electrons is 79.0 eV.\n\nThe first ionization energy is the energy required to remove the least tightly bound electron, which is 24.6 eV.\n\nThe second ionization energy is the energy required to remove the second electron from He+, which is 54.4 eV.\n\nSo, total energy to remove both electrons is E_first + E_second = 24.6 eV + 54.4 eV = 79.0 eV, which matches the given value.\n\nTherefore, the energy required to ionize helium (remove one electron) is indeed 24.6 eV.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option A is 24.6 eV, which seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps there's confusion because the problem mentions \"the energy required to remove both electrons is 79.0 eV\" and asks for the energy to remove one electron.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to test the concept of average ionization energy or something similar.\n\nBut based on standard ionization energy definitions, the first ionization energy is 24.6 eV.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A, 24.6 eV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
