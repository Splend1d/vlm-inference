                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about NMR spectra and I need to find the ratio of concentrations of DMSO to acetonitrile based on the relative intensities of their lines in the 1H NMR spectrum. The intensities are given as \u03b1 for DMSO and 3\u03b1 for acetonitrile. The options are 1:1, 1:3, 1:6, and 2:3. I'm a bit rusty on NMR, so I'll need to think this through.\n\nFirst, I remember that in NMR, the intensity of a signal is related to the number of nuclei producing that signal and their environment. For protons, it's the number of hydrogen atoms in a particular chemical environment.\n\nDMSO is dimethylsulfoxide, which has the formula (CH3)2SO. Looking at its structure, there are two methyl groups, each with three hydrogen atoms, so that's 6 protons in total.\n\nAcetonitrile is CH3CN, which has one methyl group with three protons.\n\nSo, DMSO has 6 protons, and acetonitrile has 3 protons.\n\nNow, in the NMR spectrum, the intensity of a signal is proportional to the number of protons giving rise to that signal, assuming equal relaxation times and other factors.\n\nBut here, the intensities are given as \u03b1 for DMSO and 3\u03b1 for acetonitrile.\n\nWait a minute, DMSO has 6 protons, and acetonitrile has 3 protons. So, if the concentrations were equal, the intensity ratio should be 6:3, which simplifies to 2:1.\n\nBut in the problem, the intensities are \u03b1 and 3\u03b1, which is a ratio of 1:3.\n\nSo, if equal concentrations would give a 2:1 intensity ratio, but we have 1:3 instead, that means the concentration of DMSO must be higher to compensate for its larger number of protons.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of DMSO as [DMSO] and acetonitrile as [AN].\n\nThe total proton intensity for DMSO is [DMSO] times 6 (since there are 6 protons per molecule).\n\nSimilarly, for acetonitrile, it's [AN] times 3.\n\nAccording to the problem, the intensity for DMSO is \u03b1 and for acetonitrile is 3\u03b1.\n\nSo, we can set up the equations:\n\n6 [DMSO] = \u03b1\n\n3 [AN] = 3\u03b1\n\nFrom the second equation, 3 [AN] = 3\u03b1 \u21d2 [AN] = \u03b1\n\nFrom the first equation, 6 [DMSO] = \u03b1 \u21d2 [DMSO] = \u03b1 / 6\n\nTherefore, the ratio [DMSO] : [AN] = (\u03b1 / 6) : \u03b1 = 1:6\n\nSo, the answer should be 1:6, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nIf [DMSO] is 1 part and [AN] is 6 parts, then the proton contribution would be:\n\nDMSO: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n\nAN: 6 \u00d7 3 = 18\n\nSo, the intensity ratio would be 6:18, which is 1:3, matching the given \u03b1 and 3\u03b1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if concentrations were equal, say [DMSO] = [AN] = 1, then intensities would be 6 and 3, ratio 2:1.\n\nBut here, it's 1:3, so DMSO concentration needs to be lower relative to AN.\n\nSpecifically, [DMSO] needs to be 1/6 of [AN] to make the intensities \u03b1 and 3\u03b1.\n\nSo, the ratio is indeed 1:6.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1:6} \\]"
