The spacing of the grating determines the angles at which constructive interference occurs, leading to the formation of distinct spectral lines. So, interference is the key principle here.\n\nOption B, amplitudes, is related because the interference depends on the amplitudes of the light waves, but it's not the primary mechanism of how the grating works. It's more about how the waves interact through interference.\n\nOption C, variations in brightness, is an effect of interference but not the underlying principle of how the grating functions.\n\nOption D, light being composed of photons, is a quantum mechanical property of light but isn't directly relevant to the operation of a diffraction grating, which can be explained using classical wave theory.\n\nTherefore, A. interference is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
