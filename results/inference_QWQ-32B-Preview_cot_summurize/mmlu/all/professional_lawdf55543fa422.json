The contract signed by the woman was to last for one year and called upon the woman to pay $2,000 in quarterly payments of $500. The contract also specified that all fees were non-refundable. Upon signing the contract, the woman made her first payment of $500 and started classes the next day. The woman attended classes on a regular basis for the next three months. At the end of the three-month period, the woman was involved in an automobile accident. Although she was not seriously injured, her doctor advised the woman that she needed complete rest. Her doctor told her to avoid strenuous activity and advised her to discontinue her pre-natal exercise classes. One week later, the woman received a billing notice from the gymnasium, indicating that her second installment payment of $500 was past due. She immediately telephoned the manager of the gymnasium and informed him that she would not be attending any further classes because of her accident. Also, the woman said she did not feel obligated to make any additional payments. Which of the following most accurately describes the woman's duty to pay the gymnasium the second installment fee of $500?\n\nA. It would be excused, because of impossibility of performance.\nB. It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.\nC. It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.\nD.

                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this woman who signed up for a prenatal and postnatal exercise program at a gym. She's three months pregnant when she enrolls, and the contract is for one year, with quarterly payments of $500, totaling $2,000. The contract says all fees are non-refundable. She makes her first payment and starts attending classes regularly for three months.\n\nThen, she gets into a car accident, but she's not seriously hurt. Her doctor tells her to rest and avoid strenuous activity, so she can't continue with the exercise classes. A week later, she gets a bill for her second payment, which is past due. She calls the gym manager and tells him she won't be attending any more classes because of her accident and that she doesn't feel obligated to make further payments.\n\nNow, the question is about her duty to pay the second installment of $500. Which option most accurately describes her duty?\n\nOption A says it would be excused because of impossibility of performance. Hmm, impossibility of performance is a doctrine that says if performing the contract becomes impossible, the duty to perform may be excused. But in this case, the woman isn't unable to attend the classes because of something beyond her control related to the contract itself. She can probably still go to the gym, but her doctor advised her not to due to medical reasons. So, it's more of a prevention of performance for health reasons rather than true impossibility. Maybe not the best fit.\n\nOption B says it would be excused because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated. Frustration of purpose is when the fundamental reason for entering into the contract is eliminated due to an unexpected event. Here, the woman enrolled in a prenatal exercise program to stay fit and healthy during her pregnancy. But because of the accident and her doctor's advice, she can't continue the exercises. So, the purpose of the contract is somewhat frustrated. This might be a stronger argument.\n\nOption C says it would not be excused because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable. Well, the contract does say that all fees are non-refundable. But does that mean she still has to pay even if she can't use the service anymore? Non-refundable fees usually mean you can't get your money back, but does that preclude any kind of adjustment or exemption from future payments? It's possible that despite the non-refundable clause, there might still be grounds to excuse future payments under certain circumstances.\n\nOption D says it would not be excused because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent. A condition precedent is an event or action that must happen before a party is obligated to perform their part of the contract. I'm not sure how that applies here. The woman has already signed the contract and made her first payment, so the conditions for her to start making payments seem to have been met. Maybe I'm misunderstanding this option.\n\nLet me think again. The woman can't continue the classes due to medical advice. She's already made one payment and attended classes for three months. Now, she's being asked to pay the second installment, but she doesn't want to because she can't use the service.\n\nIn contract law, there are doctrines like impossibility, frustration of purpose, and mitigation of damages that might apply here.\n\nImpossibility seems a bit stretchy because she can probably still go to the gym, but her doctor says she shouldn't due to health reasons.\n\nFrustration of purpose might be more applicable because the main reason she enrolled in the program is no longer feasible due to her health situation.\n\nHowever, the contract specifies that fees are non-refundable. Does this mean she has to pay all installments regardless of whether she uses the service or not?\n\nWell, non-refundable usually means you can't get your money back once you've paid, but it doesn't necessarily mean you have to pay for services you didn't receive or can't receive due to circumstances beyond your control.\n\nMaybe there's a distinction between refunding paid amounts and being excused from future payments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gym could argue that she's still obligated to pay because the services are being offered, even if she chooses not to use them.\n\nBut in this case, she's not choosing not to use them; she's being advised by her doctor not to due to health reasons.\n\nIt's a bit tricky.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Excused due to impossibility of performance \u2013 maybe not the best fit.\n\nB. Excused due to frustration of purpose \u2013 this seems plausible.\n\nC. Not excused because fees are non-refundable \u2013 but maybe there's room to negotiate future payments.\n\nD. Not excused because her covenant to pay is a condition precedent \u2013 I'm not sure about this one.\n\nPerhaps the answer is B, that her duty to pay is excused because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated by her inability to continue the exercise program due to medical advice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-refundable clause overrides any arguments about frustration of purpose, in which case option C would be correct.\n\nBut I feel like frustration of purpose is a valid legal doctrine that might override a non-refundable fee clause in certain circumstances.\n\nI need to think more about this.\n\nLet me consider what the law says about frustration of purpose.\n\nFrustration of purpose occurs when an event occurs after the formation of the contract that destroys the fundamental reason for entering into the contract, through no fault of either party.\n\nIn this case, the woman enrolled in a prenatal exercise program to stay fit and healthy during her pregnancy. Due to the accident and her doctor's advice, she can no longer safely participate in these exercises. So, the purpose of the contract is frustrated.\n\nHowever, the contract says fees are non-refundable. Does this mean she still has to pay all installments, despite the frustration of purpose?\n\nWell, non-refundable fees typically prevent her from getting a refund for payments already made, but it may not necessarily require her to pay future installments if the contract's purpose is frustrated.\n\nIt's possible that the non-refundable clause only applies to payments already made, not to future payments.\n\nAlternatively, the gym might argue that the non-refundable clause means she can't get a refund for payments already made and still has to pay all future installments, even if she doesn't use the service.\n\nBut that seems unfair, and the law might consider whether it's equitable to require her to pay for services she can't use due to circumstances beyond her control.\n\nPerhaps there's room for negotiation here.\n\nBut the question is asking about her duty to pay the second installment, not about what's fair or equitable.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Excused due to impossibility of performance \u2013 not the best fit, as she can probably still go to the gym, but her doctor says she shouldn't.\n\nB. Excused due to frustration of purpose \u2013 plausible, as the fundamental reason for the contract is frustrated.\n\nC. Not excused because fees are non-refundable \u2013 but maybe the non-refundable clause doesn't prevent her from being excused from future payments.\n\nD. Not excused because her covenant to pay is a condition precedent \u2013 I'm not sure how this applies here.\n\nI think the best answer is B, that her duty to pay is excused due to frustration of purpose.\n\nThe essential purpose of the contract was for her to participate in prenatal exercise classes, but due to medical advice, she can no longer do so. Therefore, the purpose of the contract is frustrated, and her duty to pay further installments may be excused.\n\nOption C might be tempting, but legal principles can sometimes override contract clauses, especially when there's frustration of purpose involved.\n\nSo, I'll go with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
