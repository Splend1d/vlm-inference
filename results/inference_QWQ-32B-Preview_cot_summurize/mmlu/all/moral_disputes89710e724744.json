                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question about Nagel's view on the absolutist position. So, first things first, I need to recall what Nagel's stance is on this topic. Thomas Nagel is a philosopher known for his work in ethics, among other areas, and he has discussed the concept of absolutism in moral theory.\n\nAbsolutism in ethics generally holds that certain moral rules are universally applicable and must always be followed, regardless of the consequences. So, an absolutist would argue that there are some actions that are inherently right or wrong, and this intrinsic nature shouldn't be overridden by considering the outcomes.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Human persons have a right to life.\n\nThis seems related to absolutist positions, particularly in ethics, where the right to life is often considered a fundamental, non-negotiable principle. Absolutists might argue that killing is always wrong because every human has an inherent right to life.\n\nB. It is permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence of action.\n\nThis sounds more like a consequentialist or utilitarian position, where the ends might justify the means, and harming someone is acceptable if it leads to a greater good. However, absolutists typically reject this idea, maintaining that certain actions are wrong regardless of their consequences.\n\nC. The ends justify the means.\n\nAgain, this is a consequentialist principle, which absolutists would likely\u53cd\u5bf9. Absolutists focus on the inherent morality of actions rather than their outcomes.\n\nD. The hostility should be directed at its true object.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what this means in the context of absolutism. It seems a bit vague. Maybe it's about targeting the source of a problem directly rather than indirectly, but I'm not sure how that fits with absolutist moral positions.\n\nGiven that, option A seems the most aligned with an absolutist position, as it asserts an inherent right that should always be respected. Absolutists often emphasize such inviolable rights.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider Nagel's specific views. I recall that Nagel is known for his critique of consequentialism and his defense of agent-centered restrictions, which align with absolutist positions. He argues that there are limits to what we can permissibly do, even if our intentions are good or the consequences are beneficial.\n\nIn his essay \"War and Massacre,\" Nagel discusses the morality of warfare and the principle of double effect, which allows for harm to be inflicted as a side effect of a morally good action, provided that the harm is not intended and proportionate.\n\nHowever, Nagel is critical of this principle and argues that sometimes, the harm involved in certain actions is so severe that it cannot be justified by good intentions or positive outcomes. This seems to align with an absolutist position that some actions are inherently wrong, regardless of context.\n\nGiven that, option A makes the most sense, as it affirms an inherent right to life, which absolutists would consider non-negotiable.\n\nOption B, however, is more in line with the principle of double effect, which Nagel critiques. So, if Nagel is arguing against that, then B would not be the core of the absolutist position as he sees it.\n\nOption C is clearly contrary to absolutist positions, as absolutists reject the idea that ends can justify morally impermissible means.\n\nOption D is unclear, but it doesn't seem directly related to the core of absolutist ethics.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A: human persons have a right to life. This seems to capture the absolutist's commitment to certain fundamental rights that must always be respected.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
