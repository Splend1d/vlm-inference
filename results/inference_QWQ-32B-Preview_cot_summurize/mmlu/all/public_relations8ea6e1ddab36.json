                    "text": "Let's see what Louis is doing here. So, he owns a chemical company that's been dumping waste improperly and hurting the community's water. He knew about the cost-cutting in waste disposal, but he's saying publicly that he had no idea about the bad practices. Then, he blames it on the general manager and fires him. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these image restoration strategies means.\n\nA. Denial: That's when someone just says, \"No, I didn't do it,\" or \"It didn't happen.\" Like flat-out rejecting the accusation.\n\nB. Evasion of responsibility: This is when someone tries to shift the blame onto someone or something else, so they don't look bad.\n\nC. Reducing the offensiveness: This is when someone tries to make what they did seem not as bad as it is, maybe by downplaying the effects or finding some positive spin on it.\n\nD. Corrective action: This is when someone acknowledges the problem and takes steps to fix it, to show that they're responsible and are making things right.\n\nNow, looking at Louis's actions:\n\n- He's saying publicly that he had no knowledge of the irresponsible practices. That sounds like he's denying any personal involvement or awareness, which might align with denial.\n\n- But then he blames it on the general manager and fires him. That seems like he's shifting the blame onto someone else, making it their fault instead of accepting any responsibility himself.\n\nSo, is he denying his knowledge, which would be option A, or is he evading responsibility by blaming someone else, which is option B?\n\nHmm, it's a bit of both, but maybe more of evasion of responsibility because he's trying to distance himself from the issue by blaming someone else.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If he simply said, \"I had no idea, it wasn't me,\" that would be denial. But by blaming it on the general manager and firing him, he's trying to show that it was someone else's fault and that he's taking action to fix it by getting rid of the person who was responsible.\n\nSo, it seems like he's combining denial with evasion of responsibility. But since the question is asking for one strategy, I need to pick the one that best describes what he's doing.\n\nMaybe evasion of responsibility is the primary strategy here because he's shifting the blame onto someone else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he's doing corrective action by firing the general manager, but that seems more like a PR move to make himself look good rather than actually addressing the underlying issue.\n\nWait, the question is about image restoration strategies, so perhaps he's using multiple strategies: denial and evasion of responsibility primarily, with a touch of corrective action.\n\nBut since I have to choose one, maybe evasion of responsibility is the most accurate because he's blaming it on someone else to save his own image.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. Denial: He does deny knowledge, but that's only part of what he's doing.\n\nB. Evasion of responsibility: Blaming it on the general manager and firing him to shift the blame.\n\nC. Reducing the offensiveness: There's no real attempt to make the action seem less bad; he's not arguing that the waste disposal is necessary or anything like that.\n\nD. Corrective action: Firing the general manager could be seen as a corrective action, but it's more about shifting blame than actually addressing the environmental issue.\n\nSo, between denial and evasion of responsibility, I think evasion of responsibility is a better fit because he's not just denying knowledge but also actively blaming someone else to avoid looking bad himself.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. evasion of responsibility.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
