We need to find all values of \\( c \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) such that the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + c x^2 + 1) \\) is a field.\n\nFirst, I recall that for \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(f(x)) \\) to be a field, the polynomial \\( f(x) = x^3 + c x^2 + 1 \\) must be irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). That means \\( f(x) \\) shouldn't have any roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), and it shouldn't factor into polynomials of lower degree.\n\nSince we're working in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), the possible values for \\( c \\) are 0, 1, and 2, because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) consists of the equivalence classes of integers modulo 3, which are {0, 1, 2}.\n\nLet's check each value of \\( c \\) to see if \\( f(x) \\) is irreducible.\n\n**Case 1: \\( c = 0 \\)**\n\nSo, \\( f(x) = x^3 + 1 \\).\n\nLet's check if this has any roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\).\n\n- For \\( x = 0 \\): \\( 0^3 + 1 = 1 \\neq 0 \\)\n\n- For \\( x = 1 \\): \\( 1^3 + 1 = 2 \\neq 0 \\)\n\n- For \\( x = 2 \\): \\( 2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 2 \\) is a root, which means \\( f(x) \\) is reducible because it has a linear factor \\( (x - 2) \\). Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\) does not make \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(f(x)) \\) a field.\n\n**Case 2: \\( c = 1 \\)**\n\nNow, \\( f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 1 \\).\n\nCheck for roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\):\n\n- For \\( x = 0 \\): \\( 0^3 + 0^2 + 1 = 1 \\neq 0 \\)\n\n- For \\( x = 1 \\): \\( 1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 1 \\) is a root, meaning \\( f(x) \\) has a linear factor \\( (x - 1) \\), and thus it's reducible. Therefore, \\( c = 1 \\) does not make the quotient ring a field.\n\n**Case 3: \\( c = 2 \\)**\n\nNow, \\( f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 \\).\n\nCheck for roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\):\n\n- For \\( x = 0 \\): \\( 0^3 + 2\\cdot0^2 + 1 = 1 \\neq 0 \\)\n\n- For \\( x = 1 \\): \\( 1^3 + 2\\cdot1^2 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\neq 0 \\)\n\n- For \\( x = 2 \\): \\( 2^3 + 2\\cdot2^2 + 1 = 8 + 2\\cdot4 + 1 = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\neq 0 \\)\n\nSo, no roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). Since it's a cubic polynomial without roots in the field, and cubic polynomials over a field factor into linear factors or are irreducible, this means \\( f(x) \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(f(x)) \\) is a field when \\( c = 2 \\).\n\nWait a minute, but the problem also includes option D, which is \\( c = 3 \\). However, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), 3 is equivalent to 0 because \\( 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\). We already checked \\( c = 0 \\) and saw that \\( f(x) = x^3 + 1 \\) is reducible. So, \\( c = 3 \\) would behave the same as \\( c = 0 \\), and thus doesn't make the quotient ring a field.\n\nTherefore, the only value of \\( c \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) that makes \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + c x^2 + 1) \\) a field is \\( c = 2 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
