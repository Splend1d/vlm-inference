                    "text": "In a series circuit, the current is the same at all points in the circuit. This is one of the fundamental characteristics of series circuits. So, if the current in one lamp is 2 A, the current in the lamp next to it should also be 2 A.\n\nLet me think about this again to make sure. In a series circuit, components are connected one after another, so there's only one path for the current to flow. This means that whatever current flows through one component must also flow through the others because there's no branching.\n\nSo, if I have a battery connected to several lamps in series, the current that flows from the battery will be the same through each lamp. If one lamp has a current of 2 A, then all the other lamps in the series will also have a current of 2 A.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that in parallel circuits, the current can split and take different paths, so the current in each branch can be different. But in series, it's all in one path, so the current should be consistent throughout.\n\nLet me check if there's any exception to this rule. I think the only way the current would be different is if the circuit is not purely series, or if there are some special components that can alter the current, like current sources or something. But in a basic series circuit with resistive loads like lamps, the current should be the same everywhere.\n\nSo, in this case, the answer should be B. 2 A.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to be thorough. Option A says half, 1 A. That would only be the case if the lamps were in parallel, and even then, only if they had specific resistances that caused the current to split in that way. But in series, the current doesn't split, so this shouldn't be the case.\n\nOption C says it depends on which lamp is closer to the battery. In a series circuit, the current is the same regardless of the position of the components. The current doesn't decrease or increase based on the position in the circuit. So, this shouldn't be correct.\n\nOption D says not enough information to say. Well, if it's a purely series circuit and we know the current in one lamp, then we should be able to determine the current in the other lamp, as they should be the same.\n\nWait, maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the lamps have different resistances, and that's affecting the current. But in a series circuit, even if the resistances are different, the current is still the same through each component. The voltages across them might be different, but the current is the same.\n\nSo, unless the circuit is not purely series, or there are other components affecting the current, the current should be 2 A in the next lamp.\n\nI think the answer is B. 2 A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
