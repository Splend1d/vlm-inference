                    "text": "So here's this scenario: a customer orders a bowl of what's supposed to be homemade Manhattan clam chowder at a restaurant. While eating, they break a tooth on a pebble in the soup. The pebble wasn't something they could have found with a normal look or taste test. When they complain to the owner, the owner admits it wasn't homemade; it was canned chowder from a wholesale distributor.\n\nNow, the customer is suing the restaurant under strict liability. We need to figure out which option is most likely correct.\n\nFirst, let's understand what strict liability means in this context. Strict liability is a legal doctrine that holds a defendant liable for damages caused by their actions, regardless of fault or negligence. In product liability cases, strict liability means that even if the seller didn't know about the defect, they can still be held responsible if the product causes harm.\n\nIn this case, the product is the clam chowder, and the defect is the pebble inside it.\n\nOption A says the customer will recover if a reasonable consumer would not expect the presence of such a pebble in the chowder. This seems plausible because, generally, you don't expect foreign objects like pebbles in your soup. It's not something you'd normally find in clam chowder.\n\nOption B says the customer will recover, but only if the restaurant had prior notice of the defective condition of the soup. But strict liability typically doesn't require proof of notice; it's about the defect existing in the product regardless of the seller's knowledge.\n\nOption C says the customer won't recover because a reasonable inspection of the soup wouldn't have disclosed the existence of the pebble. But in strict liability, the lack of inspection might not be a defense if the product is defective.\n\nOption D says the customer won't recover because the soup wouldn't constitute an unreasonably dangerous product when it was served. But having a pebble in it seems pretty unreasonably dangerous, as it caused physical harm.\n\nGiven that it's a strict liability case, the focus is on whether the product was defective and caused harm, not on the restaurant's knowledge or inspection practices.\n\nSo, option A seems the most likely correct answer because it aligns with the idea that if a reasonable consumer wouldn't expect a pebble in their chowder, then it's a defective product, and the restaurant should be liable.\n\nAlso, considering that the chowder was canned and not homemade, as the menu suggested, there might be issues with misrepresentation, but in terms of strict liability, the key is the defect in the product.\n\nTherefore, the customer will most likely recover if a reasonable consumer would not expect a pebble in the chowder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
