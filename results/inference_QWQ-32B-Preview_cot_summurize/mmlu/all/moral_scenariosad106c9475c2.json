This suggests that they are making sure others get food before themselves, which generally aligns with moral principles of generosity and consideration for others. So, this seems not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character spent the grocery money on needed food items. Assuming that the money was intended for groceries and they used it for that purpose, this seems appropriate and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
