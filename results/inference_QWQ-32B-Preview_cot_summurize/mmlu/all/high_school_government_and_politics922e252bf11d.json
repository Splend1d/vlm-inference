The Democratic Party is generally associated with liberal social policies, but sometimes these policies can cause friction with certain groups that traditionally support the party.\n\nLet's break down each option to see which group might be most likely to feel alienated by the Democratic Party's pursuit of liberal social policies.\n\nOption A: People holding advanced academic degrees.\n\nPeople with advanced degrees often lean liberal and are typically supportive of the Democratic Party's social policies. They generally favor progressive stances on issues like education, healthcare, and civil rights. Therefore, it's less likely that this group would be alienated by the party's liberal policies.\n\nOption B: Northeastern city dwellers.\n\nThe Northeast is a stronghold for the Democratic Party, and city dwellers in this region are often more progressive in their social views. They tend to support liberal policies on issues such as LGBTQ+ rights, immigration, and environmental protection. So, this group is also unlikely to be alienated by the Democratic Party's liberal social policies.\n\nOption C: Southerners.\n\nThe South has historically been more conservative, especially on social issues. While there has been some shift in recent years, many Southerners still hold more traditional views on issues like abortion, same-sex marriage, and race relations. Therefore, if the Democratic Party pushes for more liberal social policies, it might alienate some Southern voters who are more conservative on these issues.\n\nOption D: Jewish Americans.\n\nJewish Americans have been a reliable Democratic Party base, supporting liberal social policies. They generally favor progressive stances on social issues, civil liberties, and healthcare. Thus, it's unlikely that Jewish Americans would be alienated by the Democratic Party's liberal social policies.\n\nConsidering these points, the group most likely to be alienated by the Democratic Party's pursuit of liberal social policies is Southerners, particularly those who hold more conservative views on social issues.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
