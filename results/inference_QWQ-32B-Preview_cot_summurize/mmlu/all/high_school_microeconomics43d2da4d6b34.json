                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Ray and Dorothy and what they should do with their time on a Saturday afternoon. They can both cook and pull weeds, and for every hour they spend cooking, Ray can pull 50 weeds and Dorothy can pull 100 weeds. I need to figure out who should do what based on some economic principles.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about absolute and comparative advantages. I think absolute advantage is when someone can produce more of something than another person, and comparative advantage is about who can produce something at a lower opportunity cost.\n\nSo, let's look at the absolute advantages here. For cooking, it doesn't specify how much they can cook per hour, only how many weeds they can pull per hour of cooking. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I need to interpret it differently.\n\nWait, maybe it's saying that for every hour they spend cooking, they could have pulled a certain number of weeds instead. So, Ray can pull 50 weeds per hour if he weren't cooking, and Dorothy can pull 100 weeds per hour if she weren't cooking. So, their opportunity cost of cooking is the number of weeds they could have pulled instead.\n\nSo, Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds per hour, and Dorothy's is 100 weeds per hour. That means Dorothy gives up more weeds to cook than Ray does.\n\nNow, absolute advantage: who can pull more weeds per hour? Dorothy can pull 100 weeds per hour compared to Ray's 50, so Dorothy has the absolute advantage in pulling weeds.\n\nBut the question is about who should do what, and the options mention pulling weeds and cooking, and refer to absolute and comparative advantages in cooking.\n\nLet me think about this again. Maybe I need to consider who has the comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nComparative advantage is about who has the lower opportunity cost in performing an activity. So, for cooking, Ray's opportunity cost is 50 weeds per hour, and Dorothy's is 100 weeds per hour. Therefore, Ray has a lower opportunity cost in cooking, meaning he has a comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nSo, according to the principle of comparative advantage, people should specialize in what they have a comparative advantage in.\n\nTherefore, Ray should cook, since he has a comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nWait, but let's check the options:\n\nA. Ray pulls weeds, since he has absolute advantage in cooking.\n\nWait, but Dorothy has the absolute advantage in pulling weeds, not Ray in cooking. So this seems incorrect.\n\nB. Dorothy pulls weeds, since she has absolute advantage in cooking.\n\nAgain, Dorothy has absolute advantage in pulling weeds, not in cooking. So this doesn't make sense.\n\nC. Dorothy cooks, since she has comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nBut actually, Ray has the comparative advantage in cooking, not Dorothy.\n\nD. Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nThis seems correct based on my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I need to look at it differently.\n\nLet's assume that both Ray and Dorothy have a certain number of hours to allocate between cooking and pulling weeds.\n\nFor every hour Ray spends cooking, he could have pulled 50 weeds, and for every hour Dorothy spends cooking, she could have pulled 100 weeds.\n\nSo, Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, and Dorothy's is 100 weeds.\n\nSimilarly, the opportunity cost of pulling weeds is the cooking they give up. So, for Ray, pulling one weed costs him 1/50 hours of cooking, and for Dorothy, it's 1/100 hours of cooking.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the opportunity costs more carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that Ray can cook a certain amount in an hour, say, x amount of food, and in that same hour, he could pull 50 weeds. Similarly, Dorothy can cook y amount of food in an hour and pull 100 weeds in that hour.\n\nBut since the problem only gives the weeds pulled per hour of cooking, maybe I need to think in terms of opportunity cost.\n\nOpportunity cost of cooking is the weeds not pulled, and opportunity cost of pulling weeds is the cooking not done.\n\nSo, Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, and Dorothy's is 100 weeds.\n\nSimilarly, Ray's opportunity cost of pulling weeds is 1/50 units of cooking, and Dorothy's is 1/100 units of cooking.\n\nNow, comparative advantage is about who has the lower opportunity cost in performing an activity.\n\nSo, for cooking, Ray has a lower opportunity cost (50 weeds vs. 100 weeds), so he has a comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nFor pulling weeds, Dorothy has a lower opportunity cost (1/100 units of cooking vs. 1/50 units of cooking), so she has a comparative advantage in pulling weeds.\n\nBut the question is about who should pull weeds based on cooking advantages.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of who should specialize in what they have a comparative advantage in.\n\nSo, Ray should specialize in cooking, and Dorothy should specialize in pulling weeds.\n\nBut the options are a bit confusing.\n\nOption A says Ray pulls weeds, since he has absolute advantage in cooking. But Dorothy has the absolute advantage in pulling weeds, not Ray in cooking.\n\nOption B says Dorothy pulls weeds, since she has absolute advantage in cooking. But again, she has absolute advantage in pulling weeds, not cooking.\n\nOption C says Dorothy cooks, since she has comparative advantage in cooking. But actually, Ray has the comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nOption D says Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking. This seems correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut let me check if there's any misunderstanding here.\n\nPerhaps the problem is trying to say that for every hour spent cooking, they could pull a certain number of weeds, implying that their time is trade-off between cooking and pulling weeds.\n\nIn that case, the opportunity cost of cooking is the weeds not pulled, and vice versa.\n\nSo, Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, and Dorothy's is 100 weeds.\n\nTherefore, Ray has a lower opportunity cost in cooking, so he should cook.\n\nDorothy has a lower opportunity cost in pulling weeds, so she should pull weeds.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct: Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
