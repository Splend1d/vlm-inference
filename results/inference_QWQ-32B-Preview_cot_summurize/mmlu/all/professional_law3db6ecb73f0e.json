The buyer told the owner that she was very interested in buying the business, but that she needed to get a loan from the bank to finance the purchase. The parties drafted a contract, signed by both parties, which stated that the buyer agreed to purchase the retail business from the owner for $250,000. The written agreement contained a provision wherein the sale would not take effect \"unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan from a bank to finance the purchase of the business. \" Subsequently, the buyer made no effort to attempt to obtain a loan from a bank so that the sale could be finalized. After several months, the owner filed suit against the buyer for breach of contract.

The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a \"condition\" to the buyer's duty to buy the business.\nB.

                    "text": "So here's this scenario: an owner wants to retire and sells his successful retail business. A buyer shows interest but says she needs a bank loan to finance the purchase. They sign a contract where the buyer agrees to buy the business for $250,000, but with a condition that the sale only takes effect if the buyer gets a bank loan to finance it. After signing, the buyer doesn't even try to get a loan, and months pass. Then, the owner sues the buyer for breach of contract. We need to figure out which argument is the owner's strongest support for his case.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a 'condition' to the buyer's duty to buy the business.\" Hmm, but in the contract, it clearly states that the sale won't take effect unless the buyer gets a loan from the bank. So, it does sound like getting the loan is a condition precedent to the sale taking effect. So, arguing that it's not a condition seems weak because the contract explicitly says it is.\n\nOption B: \"Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner.\" This is interesting. Sometimes, in contract law, conditions can be excused if their non-occurrence would lead to an unfair result, like forfeiture. But in this case, the buyer never even tried to satisfy the condition. So, maybe the owner could argue that the condition should be excused because the buyer didn't make any effort to fulfill it, thus breaching the contract.\n\nOption C: \"Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, it should be stricken from the contract because it is an unconscionable term.\" Unconscionable means shockingly one-sided or unfair. Is requiring a buyer to finance through a bank loan unconscionable? Probably not. It's a common practice in many business sales. So, this argument seems weak.\n\nOption D: \"The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.\" This is an interesting point. Even if the contract specifies that the sale is conditional on getting a loan, maybe there's an implied obligation for the buyer to make reasonable efforts to secure that loan. If the buyer doesn't even try, perhaps that's a breach of an implied term in the contract.\n\nComparing options B and D, both seem plausible, but D seems stronger because it directly addresses the buyer's inaction. By not making any effort to obtain the loan, the buyer may have breached an implied duty to act in good faith or to make reasonable efforts to fulfill the condition.\n\nSo, the owner's strongest argument is likely option D: the buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank."
