Let me see why each option contributes to societal complexity.\n\nOption A: Surplus food being stored in large, collective facilities suggests that there's more food than needed for immediate consumption. This surplus allows some members of society to engage in non-agricultural activities because not everyone has to focus on food production. This division of labor leads to specialization and complexity in society.\n\nOption B: Crop irrigation requiring the construction of dams or canals indicates that there is a need for coordinated efforts to manage water resources. Building such structures requires planning, organization, and often a hierarchical structure to oversee the project. This kind of collective effort fosters social structures and roles that contribute to complexity.\n\nOption C: Sedentary communities needing to defend themselves implies the development of protection mechanisms, which could include military structures, fortifications, and governance systems to manage defense. This need leads to the establishment of leadership and organizational frameworks, adding to the complexity of society.\n\nSo, all these factors\u2014surplus food storage, irrigation systems, and defense needs\u2014contribute to the complexity of societies by necessitating organization, specialization, and social structures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
