                    "text": "To determine which configuration of battery and resistors will create a circuit with the greatest current, we need to consider both the voltage provided by the battery and the total resistance in the circuit. The relationship between current, voltage, and resistance is governed by Ohm's Law, which states that the current \\( I \\) through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage \\( V \\) across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance \\( R \\) of the conductor. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{V}{R}\n\\]\n\nGiven this relationship, to maximize the current \\( I \\), we need to maximize the voltage \\( V \\) and minimize the resistance \\( R \\).\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step:\n\n**Option A: A high voltage battery with resistors arranged in series**\n\n- **Voltage**: High\n- **Resistors in series**: In a series circuit, the total resistance \\( R_{\\text{total}} \\) is the sum of the individual resistances. If we have resistors \\( R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_n \\), then:\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + \\cdots + R_n\n\\]\n\n- Therefore, the total resistance is higher when resistors are in series.\n\n**Option B: A high voltage battery with resistors arranged in parallel**\n\n- **Voltage**: High\n- **Resistors in parallel**: In a parallel circuit, the total resistance \\( R_{\\text{total}} \\) is given by the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances. For two resistors, this is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{R_n}\n\\]\n\n- Therefore, the total resistance is lower when resistors are in parallel compared to series.\n\n**Option C: A low voltage battery with resistors arranged in series**\n\n- **Voltage**: Low\n- **Resistors in series**: As above, higher total resistance.\n\n**Option D: A low voltage battery with resistors arranged in parallel**\n\n- **Voltage**: Low\n- **Resistors in parallel**: Lower total resistance compared to series.\n\nNow, let's compare these options based on Ohm's Law:\n\n- **Option A**: High \\( V \\), high \\( R \\)\n- **Option B**: High \\( V \\), low \\( R \\)\n- **Option C**: Low \\( V \\), high \\( R \\)\n- **Option D**: Low \\( V \\), low \\( R \\)\n\nTo maximize current \\( I \\), we need the highest possible \\( V \\) and the lowest possible \\( R \\). Therefore, **Option B**\u2014a high voltage battery with resistors arranged in parallel\u2014will yield the greatest current.\n\nTo further illustrate this, let's consider numerical examples. Suppose we have two resistors, each with a resistance of 10 ohms.\n\n**Example for Option A:**\n\n- Battery voltage: 20V\n- Resistors in series: \\( R_{\\text{total}} = 10\\, \\Omega + 10\\, \\Omega = 20\\, \\Omega \\)\n- Current: \\( I = \\frac{20V}{20\\, \\Omega} = 1A \\)\n\n**Example for Option B:**\n\n- Battery voltage: 20V\n- Resistors in parallel: \\( \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{10\\, \\Omega} + \\frac{1}{10\\, \\Omega} = \\frac{2}{10\\, \\Omega} \\) \u2192 \\( R_{\\text{total}} = 5\\, \\Omega \\)\n- Current: \\( I = \\frac{20V}{5\\, \\Omega} = 4A \\)\n\n**Example for Option C:**\n\n- Battery voltage: 10V\n- Resistors in series: \\( R_{\\text{total}} = 10\\, \\Omega + 10\\, \\Omega = 20\\, \\Omega \\)\n- Current: \\( I = \\frac{10V}{20\\, \\Omega} = 0.5A \\)\n\n**Example for Option D:**\n\n- Battery voltage: 10V\n- Resistors in parallel: \\( R_{\\text{total}} = 5\\, \\Omega \\)\n- Current: \\( I = \\frac{10V}{5\\, \\Omega} = 2A \\)\n\nFrom these examples, it is clear that **Option B** provides the highest current.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
