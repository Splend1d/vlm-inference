                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what a hypertonic solution is, and I've got these options to choose from. Let's see:\n\nOption A says: \"a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell.\"\n\nOption B: \"a solution that blocks off enteral tubes easily.\"\n\nOption C: \"a solution that has a lower concentration of solutes than the normal human cell.\"\n\nOption D: \"a solution with a high fibre content.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"hypertonic\" means in the context of solutions and cells. I remember that when we talk about tonicity, we're referring to the concentration of solutes in a solution and how that affects cells.\n\nSo, a hypertonic solution should have a higher concentration of solutes compared to another solution. In this case, it's compared to the normal human cell. So, if a solution has more solutes than the cell, it's hypertonic.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. There are also hypotonic solutions, which have fewer solutes than the cell, right? So, hypertonic would indeed have more solutes.\n\nOption A seems to match that definition. But let's look at the other options to be sure.\n\nOption B mentions blocking off enteral tubes easily. Enteral tubes are used for feeding or administering medications directly into the gastrointestinal tract. I don't recall anything about hypertonic solutions blocking these tubes. Maybe this is about viscosity or something else, but it doesn't sound right for defining hypertonicity.\n\nOption C says it has a lower concentration of solutes than the normal human cell. But that sounds like a hypotonic solution, not hypertonic. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption D mentions high fibre content. Fibre is related to diet and digestion, but I don't think it's relevant to defining a hypertonic solution. Maybe in some contexts, but it doesn't seem directly related here.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option A is the correct definition of a hypertonic solution.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me think about what happens when a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution. I think cells tend to lose water to the surrounding solution because the concentration of solutes outside is higher, causing the water to move out of the cell to balance the concentrations. This is osmosis.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in a hypertonic solution, the environment outside the cell has a higher solute concentration, leading to water moving out of the cell.\n\nOption B doesn't make much sense in this context. Maybe it's referring to something else, but it doesn't align with the definition of hypertonic.\n\nOption C is actually the definition of a hypotonic solution, where the solution has fewer solutes than the cell, causing water to move into the cell.\n\nOption D seems completely off track for this question.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
