                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** For n > 1, the set {1,2, ..., n-1} is a group under multiplication modulo n.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for a set to be a group under a certain operation. A group must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.\n\n- **Closure:** For any two elements a and b in the set, a * b mod n should also be in the set.\n\n- **Associativity:** For any a, b, c in the set, (a * b) * c mod n should equal a * (b * c) mod n.\n\n- **Identity:** There should be an element e in the set such that for any element a, a * e mod n = a.\n\n- **Invertibility:** For every element a in the set, there should be an element b such that a * b mod n = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nIn this case, the operation is multiplication modulo n, and the set is {1, 2, ..., n-1}.\n\nLet's check these properties:\n\n- **Closure:** Multiplying any two numbers in {1, 2, ..., n-1} and taking modulo n will result in a number between 0 and n-1. However, if n is not prime, some products might be 0 modulo n, which is not in the set {1, 2, ..., n-1}. For example, if n=4, then 2*2=4 \u22610 mod 4, but 0 is not in {1,2,3}. So, for n not prime, closure fails.\n\n- **Associativity:** Multiplication is associative, and modulo operation preserves associativity. So, this holds.\n\n- **Identity:** The number 1 is the identity element since any a * 1 \u2261 a mod n.\n\n- **Invertibility:** For each a in the set, there should be a b such that a * b \u22611 mod n. This is only guaranteed if a and n are coprime. If n is not prime, there are elements in {1, 2, ..., n-1} that share a common factor with n, hence no inverse.\n\nTherefore, for n > 1, the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} is a group under multiplication modulo n only if n is prime. If n is not prime, the set fails to be a group because not all elements have inverses, and closure might fail.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is false for some n > 1 (specifically, when n is not prime).\n\n**Statement 2:** There is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1.\n\nThis statement is asking if there exists an integer x that is the multiplicative inverse of 63 modulo 100.\n\nFor an inverse to exist, 63 and 100 must be coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor (gcd) must be 1.\n\nLet's find gcd(63, 100):\n\n- 100 \u00f7 63 = 1 with remainder 37\n\n- 63 \u00f7 37 = 1 with remainder 26\n\n- 37 \u00f7 26 = 1 with remainder 11\n\n- 26 \u00f7 11 = 2 with remainder 4\n\n- 11 \u00f7 4 = 2 with remainder 3\n\n- 4 \u00f7 3 = 1 with remainder 1\n\n- 3 \u00f7 1 = 3 with remainder 0\n\nSo, gcd(63, 100) = 1.\n\nSince the gcd is 1, 63 and 100 are coprime, and thus, an inverse exists.\n\nTherefore, there exists an integer x such that 63x \u22611 mod 100.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement 1 is false.\n\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
