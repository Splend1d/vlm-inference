                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about when most babies say their first words. The options are 7, 9, 12, or 15 months of age. I remember that babies develop language skills at different rates, but I think there's a general average age for saying the first word.\n\nLet me think about this. I have a cousin who said her first word around 10 months, and another friend's baby said theirs at 14 months. So, it seems like it can vary. But the question is asking for when \"most\" babies say their first words.\n\nI recall that the typical age is around one year old, which is 12 months. But maybe it's a little earlier or later. Let me consider each option:\n\nA. 7 months \u2013 That seems pretty early. At 7 months, babies are usually cooing and making babbling sounds, but not necessarily saying actual words.\n\nB. 9 months \u2013 Still pretty young. Some babies might start to imitate sounds more at this age, but I don't think most are saying words yet.\n\nC. 12 months \u2013 This seems about right. I think the average is around one year old.\n\nD. 15 months \u2013 That's a little over one year. Maybe some babies say their first words a bit later, but I think the average is closer to 12 months.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check this. Maybe I can recall something from a parenting book or article I've read. I seem to remember that between 10 and 15 months is the typical range for first words, with the average being around 12 months.\n\nAlso, I know that before saying words, babies go through various stages of language development, like cooing, babbling, and then saying simple words. So, by 12 months, they should be starting to say their first words.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I can eliminate some options. Option A, 7 months, is probably too early for most babies to say their first words. Option D, 15 months, might be a little late, but some babies do take longer.\n\nOption C, 12 months, seems like a good candidate. Option B, 9 months, might be early for most babies.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the question says \"most babies,\" which suggests the average or typical age. So, it's probably not the earliest or latest possible age.\n\nGiven that, I think 12 months is the best answer. But to be thorough, maybe I can look up some statistics or recall more specifics.\n\nI think in general, babies say their first words around 12 months, and by 18 months, they have a small vocabulary of about 50 words or so. So, 12 months makes sense as the age for the first word.\n\nAlso, I recall that pediatricians look for certain milestones at different ages. At the 12-month check-up, they often check if the baby is saying any words, and if not, it might be something to discuss.\n\nSo, based on that, I'm going to go with C. 12 months as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
