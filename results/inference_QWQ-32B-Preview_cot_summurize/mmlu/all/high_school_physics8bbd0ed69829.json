                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two electrically charged balls. They're separated by a short distance, and there's a force of 50 microns between them. Now, it says that keeping the charge of each ball the same, the mass of one of the balls but not the other is doubled. And I need to find out what the new electric force between the balls is.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall how electric force between two charged particles works. I remember that the electric force is given by Coulomb's law, which is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.\n\nIn this problem, it says that the charges remain the same, and only the mass of one of the balls is doubled. But wait, in Coulomb's law, mass doesn't play a role; it's all about the charges and the distance between them. So, if the charges stay the same and the distance stays the same, the force should remain the same, right?\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing here. Perhaps the mass affects the distance between the balls or something like that. But in pure electrostatics, the force depends only on the charges and the distance, not on the masses of the objects.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the masses are relevant in some other way, like if there's gravity or something, but the problem is specifically about electric force, so maybe gravity isn't considered here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's some misunderstanding in the problem statement. It says, \"the mass of one of the balls but not the other is doubled.\" Maybe this is to test whether I understand that electric force depends only on charges and distance, not on mass.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then no matter what happens to the masses, as long as the charges and the distance remain the same, the electric force should remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the new electric force between the balls should still be 50 \u03bcN.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 50 \u03bcN\n\nB. 100 \u03bcN\n\nC. 200 \u03bcN\n\nD. 400 \u03bcN\n\nIt seems like the answer should be A. 50 \u03bcN.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps doubling the mass of one ball affects the distance between the balls, which in turn affects the electric force.\n\nWait, if the mass is doubled, and if there's gravity between the two balls, that could change the distance slightly. But the problem specifies that the separation is kept the same, so maybe that's not a factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this context, the mass is relevant because of some other consideration, like motion or something, but again, the problem is specifically about the electric force between the two stationary charges.\n\nSo, I think the key point here is that electric force depends only on the charges and the distance between them, not on their masses.\n\nTherefore, doubling the mass of one ball shouldn't affect the electric force between them.\n\nHence, the answer should be A. 50 \u03bcN.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
