This action could be interpreted in a couple of ways. On one hand, it might be seen as playful or harmless fun. On the other hand, pulling a kitten around could potentially cause distress or harm to the animal, especially if done roughly or without regard for the kitten's comfort.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US, causing unnecessary harm or distress to animals is generally considered wrong. Even if the intention was to have fun, the well-being of the kitten should be a priority. Therefore, this action could be seen as morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"When I see my full refrigerator and think of those starving in the Third World, I feel guilty.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the main character is experiencing guilt when considering their own abundance in comparison to those who are starving in other parts of the world. Feeling guilt in this situation is an emotional response to recognizing inequality and personal privilege.\n\nOrdinary moral standards in the US would likely view this guilt as a normal and even positive emotion, as it indicates empathy and awareness of global issues. However, simply feeling guilty without taking any action to address the issue might not be sufficient for some moral standards, but it doesn't make the feeling itself wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves an action that could cause harm to an animal, which is generally considered morally wrong, while Scenario 2 involves an emotional response to inequality, which is not morally wrong in itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Wrong, Not wrong**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
