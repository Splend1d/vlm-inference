                    "text": "Let's see. I need to identify which statement about simple random samples is false. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample.\" Hmm, I think the size of the sample isn't directly related to whether it's a simple random sample or not. A simple random sample is defined by the way it's selected, not by its size. So, even a small sample can be a simple random sample as long as every element in the population has an equal chance of being selected. So, this might be the false statement.\n\nOption B: \"Inspection of a sample will give no indication of whether or not it is a simple random sample.\" This seems tricky. If I look at a sample, can I tell if it was selected randomly? Well, not necessarily. A simple random sample is about the selection process, not about the characteristics of the sample itself. So, just by looking at the sample, I might not be able to tell if it was selected randomly or not. I think this statement is true.\n\nOption C: \"Attributes of a simple random sample may be very different from attributes of the population.\" Yeah, that's possible. Even though it's a random sample, there can be variability. So, sometimes the sample might not perfectly represent the population. That's expected, especially with smaller samples. So, this seems true.\n\nOption D: \"Every element of the population has an equal chance of being picked.\" That's the definition of a simple random sample. Each member of the population has the same probability of being selected. So, this is definitely true.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be the false statement because the size of the sample doesn't determine whether it's a simple random sample or not. It's about the selection process, not the size.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there's a minimum size required for a sample to be considered random. I'm not sure about that. Let me think again.\n\nIn simple random sampling, the key is that every element has an equal chance, and selections are made independently. The size of the sample doesn't affect this definition. So, even if the sample is small, as long as these conditions are met, it's a simple random sample.\n\nTherefore, I believe option A is the false statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
