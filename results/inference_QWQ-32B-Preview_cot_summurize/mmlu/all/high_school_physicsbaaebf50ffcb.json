                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an artificial satellite orbiting Earth in a circular path just above the atmosphere, moving at a constant speed. Then, a small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1% without changing the direction of its velocity. We need to figure out what happens to the satellite's orbit after this collision.\n\nFirst, it's important to recall some basics about orbits. For an object to maintain a circular orbit around Earth, there needs to be a precise balance between its kinetic energy and its potential energy. The kinetic energy is related to its speed, and the potential energy is related to its distance from Earth's center.\n\nIn a circular orbit, the satellite's speed is constant, and the radius of the orbit is constant. The centripetal force required to keep the satellite in orbit is provided by Earth's gravitational pull.\n\nNow, when the meteor collides with the satellite at point P, it increases the satellite's speed by 1% without changing its direction. This means that at that instant, the satellite has more kinetic energy than it did before, but its direction remains the same.\n\nThis change in speed will affect the satellite's orbit. To understand how, let's consider the principles of orbital mechanics.\n\nIn orbital mechanics, the shape of an orbit is determined by the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential energy) and the angular momentum of the orbiting body.\n\nFor a circular orbit, the total mechanical energy is negative, and the magnitude of the kinetic energy is exactly half the magnitude of the potential energy.\n\nWhen the satellite's speed increases, its kinetic energy increases, which means the total mechanical energy becomes less negative, or in other words, it increases.\n\nNow, depending on how much the speed increases, the orbit can change in different ways.\n\nIn this case, the speed increases by only 1%, which is a small increment. So, the total energy increases, but not enough to escape Earth's gravity.\n\nWhen the total energy increases in a two-body problem like this, the orbit becomes more elliptical.\n\nIn a circular orbit, the eccentricity is zero, meaning it's a perfect circle. As energy increases, the eccentricity increases, transforming the orbit into an ellipse.\n\nNow, the question is, where in this new elliptical orbit is point P located?\n\nPoint P is where the collision occurred, and at that point, the satellite's speed increased by 1%.\n\nIn an elliptical orbit, there is a point called the periapsis, which is the point closest to the central body (in this case, Earth), and the apoapsis, which is the point farthest from the central body.\n\nTo determine whether P is the periapsis or the apoapsis, we need to consider the relationship between speed and position in an elliptical orbit.\n\nIn an elliptical orbit, the satellite moves fastest at periapsis and slowest at apoapsis. This is a consequence of conservation of angular momentum.\n\nGiven that the collision increased the satellite's speed at point P without changing its direction, and considering that in an elliptical orbit, the satellite moves fastest at periapsis, it might seem like P could be the periapsis.\n\nHowever, we need to think carefully about this.\n\nBefore the collision, the satellite was in a circular orbit with constant speed. At point P, its speed increased by 1%, but its direction remained the same.\n\nThis means that at point P, the satellite now has higher speed than it would have in the original circular orbit, but in the same direction.\n\nIn an elliptical orbit, the speed varies with position, being highest at periapsis and lowest at apoapsis.\n\nSo, if the satellite's speed at point P is higher than it was in the circular orbit, but in the same direction, it suggests that point P is closer to being the periapsis, where speeds are higher.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think about this again.\n\nIn a circular orbit, the speed is constant. In an elliptical orbit, speed increases as the satellite approaches periapsis and decreases as it moves towards apoapsis.\n\nIf the satellite's speed increases at point P, and assuming that the orbit becomes elliptical, then point P would correspond to a point where the speed is higher than in the circular orbit.\n\nIn an elliptical orbit, the point of highest speed is the periapsis.\n\nTherefore, it seems that point P would correspond to the periapsis, the closest approach to Earth.\n\nBut let's consider another perspective.\n\nPerhaps we can use the concept of the vis-viva equation, which relates the speed of an object in an orbit to its position and the parameters of the orbit.\n\nThe vis-viva equation is:\n\nv\u00b2 = \u03bc * (2/r - 1/a)\n\nwhere:\n\n- v is the speed of the satellite\n\n- \u03bc is the standard gravitational parameter of the central body (Earth in this case)\n\n- r is the distance from the satellite to the center of the Earth\n\n- a is the semi-major axis of the orbit\n\nIn the original circular orbit, r is constant, and a is equal to r.\n\nSo, v_circular\u00b2 = \u03bc / r\n\nAfter the collision, the speed increases to v = 1.01 * v_circular\n\nUsing the vis-viva equation for the new orbit:\n\n(1.01 * v_circular)\u00b2 = \u03bc * (2/r - 1/a)\n\nSubstituting v_circular\u00b2 = \u03bc / r:\n\n(1.01)\u00b2 * (\u03bc / r) = \u03bc * (2/r - 1/a)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.0201 * (\u03bc / r) = \u03bc * (2/r - 1/a)\n\nDivide both sides by \u03bc:\n\n1.0201 / r = 2/r - 1/a\n\nRearrange to solve for 1/a:\n\n1/a = 2/r - 1.0201 / r = (2 - 1.0201)/r = 0.9799 / r\n\nTherefore:\n\na = r / 0.9799 \u2248 1.0204r\n\nSo, the semi-major axis of the new elliptical orbit is approximately 1.0204 times the original radius r.\n\nThis means that the orbit has expanded slightly.\n\nNow, to find the positions of periapsis and apoapsis, we need to recall that in an elliptical orbit, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant, and one of the foci is located at the center of the Earth.\n\nThe periapsis is the closest point to Earth, and the apoapsis is the farthest point.\n\nThe distance at periapsis (q) and apoapsis (Q) can be expressed in terms of the semi-major axis a and the eccentricity e:\n\nq = a(1 - e)\n\nQ = a(1 + e)\n\nThe original circular orbit had r = a for the ellipse.\n\nGiven that the speed increased at point P, and considering the vis-viva equation, we can determine whether P corresponds to periapsis or apoapsis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the specific orbital parameters before and after the collision.\n\nBefore the collision, in the circular orbit:\n\n- Speed: v_circular = sqrt(\u03bc / r)\n\n- Energy: E = -\u03bc / (2r)\n\n- Angular momentum: h = r * v_circular = sqrt(\u03bc r)\n\nAfter the collision, speed increases to v = 1.01 * v_circular, direction remains the same.\n\nSo, new energy:\n\nE' = (v'^2 / 2) - \u03bc / r\n\nSubstitute v' = 1.01 * v_circular = 1.01 * sqrt(\u03bc / r)\n\nSo:\n\nE' = (1.01)^2 * (\u03bc / (2r)) - \u03bc / r = (1.0201 * \u03bc)/(2r) - \u03bc / r = (1.0201 - 2)/ (2r) * \u03bc = (-0.9799 * \u03bc)/(2r)\n\nWait, that seems off. Let's recalculate.\n\nActually:\n\nE' = (m v'^2)/2 - G M m / r\n\nWhere v' = 1.01 v_circular, and v_circular = sqrt(\u03bc / r)\n\nSo v'^2 = (1.01)^2 * (\u03bc / r) = 1.0201 * \u03bc / r\n\nTherefore:\n\nE' = (1.0201 * \u03bc)/(2r) - \u03bc / r = (1.0201 - 2)/ (2r) * \u03bc = (-0.9799 * \u03bc)/(2r)\n\nWait, that gives a negative value, which is expected since the orbit is still bound, but the magnitude of E' is less than the original E.\n\nOriginal E = -\u03bc / (2r)\n\nSo, E' / E = (-0.9799 * \u03bc)/(2r) divided by (-\u03bc)/(2r) = 0.9799\n\nMeaning E' = 0.9799 E\n\nSo, the energy has increased by a factor of 1 / 0.9799 \u2248 1.0204, which matches our earlier result for a = 1.0204 r.\n\nNow, to find the eccentricity e of the new orbit, we can use the formula:\n\ne = sqrt(1 + 2 E h\u00b2 / (\u03bc m))\n\nWhere h is the angular momentum, which remains constant because the collision did not change the direction of the velocity, only its magnitude.\n\nIn the circular orbit, h = r v_circular = r * sqrt(\u03bc / r) = sqrt(\u03bc r)\n\nAfter the collision, h remains the same.\n\nSo, e = sqrt(1 + 2 E' h\u00b2 / (\u03bc m))\n\nSubstitute E' = -0.9799 * \u03bc / (2r)\n\nAnd h\u00b2 = \u03bc r\n\nSo:\n\ne = sqrt(1 + 2 * (-0.9799 * \u03bc / (2r)) * (\u03bc r) / (\u03bc m))\n\nWait, actually, h\u00b2 / (\u03bc m) = r\n\nSo:\n\ne = sqrt(1 + 2 * E' * r)\n\nSubstitute E' = -0.9799 * \u03bc / (2r)\n\nSo:\n\ne = sqrt(1 + 2 * (-0.9799 * \u03bc / (2r)) * r / \u03bc)\n\nSimplify:\n\ne = sqrt(1 - 0.9799) = sqrt(0.0201) \u2248 0.1418\n\nSo, the eccentricity is approximately 0.1418.\n\nNow, in an elliptical orbit, the true anomaly (the angle from periapsis) can be found using the velocity vector.\n\nHowever, this might be getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps a simpler way is to consider the direction of the velocity increase.\n\nSince the collision increased the speed by 1% without changing the direction, it's like applying a tangential impulse.\n\nIn orbital mechanics, increasing the speed in the direction of motion results in a higher apoapsis, while decreasing the speed would lower the periapsis.\n\nWait, actually, in a circular orbit, increasing the speed will make the orbit more elliptical with the apoapsis increasing more than the periapsis.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in a circular orbit, increasing the speed will result in an elliptical orbit where the point of increase becomes the periapsis.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn a Hohmann transfer, for example, to go from a lower circular orbit to a higher one, you perform a prograde burn at periapsis to increase speed, which raises the apoapsis.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, by increasing the speed at point P, you are effectively raising the apoapsis.\n\nWait, but in the Hohmann transfer, the periapsis is the initial orbit, and the apoapsis is the target orbit.\n\nIn this problem, since we're starting from a circular orbit and increasing speed at point P, it's like performing a prograde burn at that point.\n\nTherefore, the new orbit should have point P as its periapsis, and the apoapsis will be at the point diametrically opposite in the original orbit.\n\nWait, but in a Hohmann transfer, the periapsis remains the initial orbit, and the apoapsis is raised.\n\nBut in this case, since we're starting from a circular orbit and performing a prograde burn at point P, the new orbit should have point P as its periapsis.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to recall the vis-viva equation again.\n\nThe vis-viva equation is:\n\nv\u00b2 = \u03bc * (2/r - 1/a)\n\nWhere:\n\n- v is the speed at position r\n\n- a is the semi-major axis\n\nIn the original circular orbit:\n\nv_circular\u00b2 = \u03bc / r\n\nAfter the collision:\n\nv' = 1.01 * v_circular\n\nSo:\n\n(1.01 v_circular)\u00b2 = \u03bc * (2/r - 1/a)\n\nSubstitute v_circular\u00b2:\n\n1.0201 * (\u03bc / r) = \u03bc * (2/r - 1/a)\n\nDivide both sides by \u03bc:\n\n1.0201 / r = 2/r - 1/a\n\nSolve for 1/a:\n\n1/a = 2/r - 1.0201 / r = (2 - 1.0201)/r = 0.9799 / r\n\nTherefore:\n\na = r / 0.9799 \u2248 1.0204 r\n\nSo, the semi-major axis has increased slightly.\n\nNow, in an elliptical orbit, the periapsis distance p and apoapsis distance a are related to the semi-major axis a and eccentricity e by:\n\np = a (1 - e)\n\na = a (1 + e)\n\nWe already have a \u2248 1.0204 r\n\nWe previously calculated e \u2248 0.1418\n\nTherefore:\n\np = 1.0204 r * (1 - 0.1418) \u2248 1.0204 r * 0.8582 \u2248 0.878 r\n\na = 1.0204 r * (1 + 0.1418) \u2248 1.0204 r * 1.1418 \u2248 1.163 r\n\nWait, but this would mean that the periapsis is closer to Earth than the original circular orbit, which is at r.\n\nBut in the problem, the satellite is orbiting just above the atmosphere, and increasing its speed should not make it come closer to Earth.\n\nThis seems counterintuitive.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in calculating the eccentricity.\n\nLet me recalculate e.\n\nWe have:\n\ne = sqrt(1 + 2 E h\u00b2 / (\u03bc m))\n\nWe have E' = -0.9799 * \u03bc / (2r)\n\nAnd h\u00b2 / (\u03bc m) = r\n\nSo:\n\ne = sqrt(1 + 2 * (-0.9799 * \u03bc / (2r)) * r / \u03bc) = sqrt(1 - 0.9799) = sqrt(0.0201) \u2248 0.1418\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, the periapsis distance p = a (1 - e) = 1.0204 r * (1 - 0.1418) \u2248 1.0204 r * 0.8582 \u2248 0.878 r\n\nWait, but this suggests that the periapsis is at 0.878 r, which is inside the original orbit.\n\nBut the satellite was originally at r, and increasing its speed should make its orbit larger, not smaller.\n\nThis doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the energy.\n\nLet me double-check the expression for E'.\n\nOriginal E = -\u03bc / (2r)\n\nAfter collision, v' = 1.01 v_circular = 1.01 * sqrt(\u03bc / r)\n\nSo, kinetic energy T' = (m v'^2)/2 = m * (1.01)^2 * (\u03bc / r)/2 = m * 1.0201 * \u03bc / (2r)\n\nPotential energy V' = -G M m / r = -\u03bc m / r\n\nTherefore, total energy E' = T' + V' = [1.0201 * \u03bc / (2r)] - [\u03bc / r] = [1.0201 - 2] * \u03bc / (2r) = (-0.9799 * \u03bc)/(2r)\n\nSo, E' = -0.9799 * E, where E is the original energy.\n\nWait, no.\n\nE = -\u03bc / (2r)\n\nE' = -0.9799 * \u03bc / (2r)\n\nTherefore, E' / E = [-0.9799 * \u03bc / (2r)] / [-\u03bc / (2r)] = 0.9799\n\nSo, E' = 0.9799 E\n\nWait, but E is negative, and E' is less negative, meaning that the total energy has increased.\n\nSo, the orbit should expand.\n\nBut according to the calculation of p = 0.878 r, which is less than r, that would suggest the periapsis is inside the original orbit.\n\nThis seems contradictory.\n\nPerhaps the error is in assuming that h remains constant.\n\nWait, h is angular momentum per unit mass, which is r v.\n\nBefore collision: h = r v_circular\n\nAfter collision: velocity direction is same, magnitude increased by 1%, so h' = r * 1.01 v_circular = 1.01 h\n\nWait, I think this is the mistake.\n\nAngular momentum h is conserved only if there is no external torque.\n\nIn this case, the meteor collision increases the speed tangentially without changing direction, which means it applies a tangential impulse, increasing h.\n\nTherefore, h is not constant; it increases by a factor of 1.01.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nOriginal h = r v_circular = r * sqrt(\u03bc / r) = sqrt(\u03bc r)\n\nAfter collision, v' = 1.01 v_circular, direction same, so h' = r v' = r * 1.01 v_circular = 1.01 h\n\nTherefore, h' = 1.01 h\n\nNow, for the new orbit, we have:\n\nE' = (m v'^2)/2 - \u03bc m / r = m * (1.01)^2 * (\u03bc / r)/2 - \u03bc m / r = m [1.0201 * \u03bc / (2r) - \u03bc / r] = m [1.0201"
