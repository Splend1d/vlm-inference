Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when doing math operations, there's something called the order of operations. I think it's like PEMDAS or something like that. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction. So, according to that, I should do division before addition.\n\nSo in this problem, 22 divided by 2 plus 9, I should first divide 22 by 2, and then add 9 to the result. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 22 divided by 2. That's straightforward: 22 \u00f7 2 = 11.\n\nNow, take that result and add 9: 11 + 9 = 20.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the answer should be 20.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me write it down: 22 / 2 + 9.\n\nOkay, division first: 22 / 2 = 11.\n\nThen addition: 11 + 9 = 20.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 10\n\nB. 11\n\nC. 20\n\nD. 2\n\nSo, C. 20 should be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's some other way to interpret the problem. For example, what if someone thinks that the division and addition should be done from left to right, without considering the order of operations. Let's see what happens if I do that.\n\nSo, starting from the left: 22 / 2 first, which is 11, and then plus 9, which is again 20.\n\nAlternatively, if someone mistakenly adds 9 to 22 first and then divides by 2, that would be: 22 + 9 = 31, and then 31 / 2 = 15.5, which isn't even one of the options.\n\nWait, but 15.5 isn't an option, so that's not likely.\n\nAnother mistake could be dividing 22 by 11, but that's not the expression given.\n\nSo, no, sticking to the order of operations, division before addition, it's 22 divided by 2 is 11, plus 9 is 20.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 20.\n\nBut why is there an option for 11? Maybe someone thought that after dividing 22 by 2, they should stop there and not add the 9. That would be incorrect, but perhaps that's where the option B. 11 comes from.\n\nSimilarly, option A. 10 and D. 2 might come from different misapplications of the order of operations.\n\nIn any case, I'm confident that C. 20 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
