So, multiple regression is when we have one dependent variable and multiple independent variables, right? And multicollinearity is something that can be a problem in this setup.\n\nOption A says that multicollinearity occurs when the predictors are highly correlated with one another. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think that's the definition I've heard before. If the independent variables are highly correlated, it can cause issues in the regression model because it becomes hard to estimate the individual effect of each predictor on the dependent variable.\n\nOption B mentions that multicollinearity occurs when the criterion measures are highly correlated with one another. Wait, in multiple regression, we typically have one criterion or dependent variable, not multiple ones. So, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe this option is referring to something else, but in the context of multiple regression, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says there is a low correlation between the predictors and the criterion. Well, if there's low correlation between predictors and the criterion, that might indicate that the predictors aren't very good at explaining the dependent variable, but I don't think that's multicollinearity. Multicollinearity is more about the relationship among the predictors themselves, not their relationship with the dependent variable.\n\nOption D is about a high and significant correlation between the predictors and the criterion. Again, this seems more related to the predictors' ability to predict the dependent variable rather than multicollinearity, which is about the intercorrelation among predictors.\n\nSo, going back to option A, it seems like the most accurate description. Multicollinearity is when the predictors are highly correlated with one another. That makes sense because when predictors are highly correlated, it becomes difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor on the dependent variable. This can lead to unstable estimates of the regression coefficients and inflated standard errors, which are problems in regression analysis.\n\nLet me double-check. I recall that multicollinearity is a phenomenon in which one predictor variable in a multiple regression model can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. So, yes, it's about the predictors being highly correlated among themselves.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. the predictors are highly correlated with one another.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
