                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which of these scenarios is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I went into the morgue to identify the body.\"\n\nSo, going into a morgue to identify a body\u2014Is that wrong? Well, morgues are places where deceased people are kept, usually until their identities are confirmed and the next steps are taken for burial or whatever. If someone needs to identify a body, maybe it's a family member or someone close to the deceased. In that case, it's probably okay, right? It's a necessary thing to do. But maybe there are rules about who can go into a morgue and when.\n\nI think, generally, if you have a legitimate reason to identify a body, like if it's a relative or someone you know, and you have permission from the authorities, then it's not morally wrong. It's a sad situation, but not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I whispered romantic sweet nothings into my wife's sister's ear.\"\n\nThis one seems more tricky. So, the main character is married, and he's whispering romantic things to his wife's sister. Hmm.\n\nIn the US, it's generally considered wrong to have romantic feelings or actions towards a family member's spouse or vice versa. But in this case, it's the wife's sister.\n\nIs it wrong to have romantic feelings for your wife's sister? Well, technically, she's family too, right? But I think it's more about the relationship dynamics and potential for confusion or harm.\n\nHaving romantic feelings for your wife's sister could potentially cause problems in your marriage, could hurt feelings, could create awkward situations. So, from that perspective, it might be considered wrong.\n\nBut, if no one knows, and it's just whispered sweet nothings, maybe it's just a moment of weakness or something. Maybe it's not acting on those feelings, just expressing them.\n\nI think, according to ordinary moral standards, having romantic feelings for your wife's sister is probably not okay, and acting on those feelings, even if it's just whispering, could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, I would say that Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 1 is not necessarily wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternative A: Wrong, Wrong\u2014That would mean both scenarios are wrong. But I don't think going to the morgue to identify a body is wrong.\n\nAlternative B: Wrong, Not wrong\u2014That would mean Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not, but I think it's the opposite.\n\nAlternative D: Not wrong, Not wrong\u2014That would mean neither is wrong, but I think Scenario 2 is problematic.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
