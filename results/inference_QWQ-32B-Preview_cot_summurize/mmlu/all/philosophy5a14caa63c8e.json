                    "text": "Let's see. Hare is a philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly for his development of prescriptivism. So, I need to recall what prescriptivism is and see which options align with that.\n\nFirst, consequentialism is an ethical theory that judges the rightness of actions based on their outcomes or consequences. Hedonism, on the other hand, is the idea that the highest good is happiness or pleasure. So, option A seems to be about specific ethical theories, but I'm not sure if they are the essential features of the logic of moral judgments according to Hare.\n\nOption B mentions universalizability and prescriptivity. Universalizability is the idea that moral judgments should apply universally, not just in specific cases. Prescriptivity is the notion that moral statements are prescriptive; they guide or prescribe actions. Hare is known for emphasizing the prescriptive aspect of moral language. So, this seems promising.\n\nContractualism is an ethical view that principles are right if they would be agreed upon by free and rational persons. Rule-following is about adhering to rules or norms. These seem related to moral judgments but might not be the core features Hare focuses on.\n\nConsistency and coherence are important in logic and ethics, ensuring that our beliefs and actions don't contradict each other. While these are essential in moral reasoning, I'm not sure if Hare specifically highlights them as the two essential features.\n\nGiven that Hare is associated with prescriptivism and emphasizes the universal aspect of moral judgments, option B seems the most accurate. So, I think the answer is B. Universalizability and prescriptivity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
