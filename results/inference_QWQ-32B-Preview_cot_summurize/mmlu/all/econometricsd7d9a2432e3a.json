Let's examine each option provided to determine which ones are correct.\n\n(i) The regressor: This is indeed one of the alternative names for the independent variable in regression analysis. A regressor is a variable that is used to predict or explain variations in the dependent variable.\n\n(ii) The regressand: This term actually refers to the dependent variable in a regression model, not the independent variable. The regressand is the variable being predicted or explained by the regressors.\n\n(iii) The causal variable: In some contexts, particularly when there is a theoretical basis for believing that changes in the independent variable cause changes in the dependent variable, the independent variable may be referred to as the causal variable.\n\n(iv) The effect variable: This term is not standard in regression analysis. Typically, the dependent variable is considered the effect, as it is the outcome that may be affected by changes in the independent variable.\n\nGiven this information, the correct choices are (i) The regressor and (iii) The causal variable. Therefore, the answer is B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
