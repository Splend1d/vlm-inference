                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about a student eating pizza while studying for an Economics exam. It says the student eats 3 slices of pizza, and it gives the marginal utility for each slice: first slice is 10 utils, second is 7 utils, and third is 3 utils. Then, it asks which statement holds true based on this data. There are four options:\n\nA. The student would not eat any more pizza.\n\nB. The marginal utility of the 4th slice of pizza will be 0.\n\nC. The student should have stopped eating pizza after 2 slices.\n\nD. The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 20 utils.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what marginal utility and total utility are. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction or utility gained from consuming one more unit of a good, in this case, a slice of pizza. Total utility, on the other hand, is the overall satisfaction gained from consuming a certain number of units.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the data:\n\n- 1st slice: 10 utils\n\n- 2nd slice: 7 utils\n\n- 3rd slice: 3 utils\n\nTo find the total utility from eating 3 slices, I should add up the marginal utilities of each slice:\n\nTotal utility = 10 + 7 + 3 = 20 utils\n\nSo, option D says that the total utility is 20 utils, which seems correct based on this calculation.\n\nBut let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says, \"The student would not eat any more pizza.\" Well, that might be true, but based on the information given, we don't know for sure. Maybe the student would eat more, but just didn't in this particular instance. So, we can't say for sure that this is true.\n\nOption B says, \"The marginal utility of the 4th slice of pizza will be 0.\" Again, we don't have information about the marginal utility of the 4th slice. Typically, marginal utility decreases as more units are consumed, but it doesn't necessarily have to be zero at any specific point. So, we can't confirm this.\n\nOption C says, \"The student should have stopped eating pizza after 2 slices.\" Should have stopped implies that eating the third slice was not beneficial. However, since the marginal utility of the third slice is still positive (3 utils), it means that eating the third slice added to the total utility, even if less than the previous slice. In general, as long as marginal utility is positive, it's beneficial to consume that additional unit. So, stopping after 2 slices would mean missing out on those additional 3 utils from the third slice. Therefore, this statement seems false.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there's a concept in economics about when to stop consuming based on marginal utility. I think the principle is that you should consume up to the point where marginal utility equals the price paid, or something like that. But in this question, there's no mention of price or cost, so maybe that doesn't apply here.\n\nGiven that, and based on the information provided, it seems that option D is the correct one, as it accurately calculates the total utility from the marginal utilities given.\n\nBut let's double-check the calculation to be sure.\n\nTotal utility after 3 slices:\n\n1st slice: 10 utils\n\n2nd slice: +7 utils, so total is 17 utils\n\n3rd slice: +3 utils, so total is 20 utils\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a concept about diminishing marginal utility, but that's already reflected in the decreasing marginal utilities given for each slice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a concept about total utility maximizing when marginal utility is zero, but again, that's not directly applicable here since we don't have information about subsequent slices beyond the third.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 20 utils.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
