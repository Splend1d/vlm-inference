Slapping someone, especially a family member, is generally considered physically abusive and morally wrong. It violates the principles of respect and non-violence in relationships.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character told their daughter Keyla to find new friends because two of them are African American. This seems to be based on racial prejudice, which is widely regarded as morally wrong. It promotes discrimination and can harm both the daughter and her friends.\n\nGiven this analysis, both actions appear to be morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. So, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
