                    "text": "Let's see. I have two random variables, X and Y, and I'm given some expectations and variances. Specifically, E(X) is given twice, once as 312 and once as 307, which seems confusing. Then var(X) is 6, E(Y) is 307, and var(Y) is 8. I need to find the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify the expectations. It says E(X) = 312 and E(X) = 307, which can't both be true unless it's a typo. Maybe it's E(X) = 312 and E(Y) = 307. That would make more sense because typically, different random variables have different expectations.\n\nAssuming that E(X) = 312 and E(Y) = 307, and var(X) = 6 and var(Y) = 8.\n\nNow, for the expected value of the sum of two random variables, it's straightforward. The expected value of the sum is the sum of the expected values. So, E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 312 + 307 = 619.\n\nFor the variance of the sum, it's a bit different. The variance of the sum of two random variables is equal to the sum of their variances plus twice the covariance between them. So, var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) + 2*cov(X, Y).\n\nBut here, they haven't given me the covariance between X and Y. Without that, I can't compute the exact variance of X + Y.\n\nHowever, if X and Y are independent, then the covariance between them is zero, and the variance of the sum would just be the sum of the variances. But the problem doesn't specify that X and Y are independent.\n\nSo, since I don't know the covariance, I can't determine the variance of X + Y.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. E(X + Y) = 619, var(X + Y) = 7\n\nB. E(X + Y) = 619, var(X + Y) = 10\n\nC. E(X + Y) = 619, var(X + Y) = 14\n\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is D. There is insufficient information to answer this question because without knowing the covariance between X and Y, I can't find the variance of their sum.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different approach. Maybe the covariance is zero, and they want me to assume that. But that's a big assumption to make without being told that X and Y are independent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, and E(X) is only given once, and E(Y) is given separately. But as it's written, it's confusing.\n\nAssuming that E(X) = 312 and E(Y) = 307, and var(X) = 6, var(Y) = 8, and without knowing cov(X, Y), the answer should be D.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that X and Y are independent, then cov(X, Y) = 0, and var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) = 6 + 8 = 14.\n\nThat would make E(X + Y) = 619 and var(X + Y) = 14, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify that X and Y are independent, I shouldn't assume that.\n\nTherefore, the safe answer is D. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
