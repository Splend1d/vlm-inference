                    "text": "So I've got this question here: Tom and Jerry enter into a contract where Tom agrees to sell Jerry $1,000 worth of heroin, which is illegal. And we need to figure out what kind of contract this is. The options are:\n\nA. quasi contract\n\nB. void contract\n\nC. voidable contract\n\nD. secondary party beneficiary contract\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with a quasi contract: I think that's when the court implies a contract between parties even though they didn't explicitly agree to one. It's like when someone benefits from something they shouldn't have, and the court steps in to make things fair.\n\nNext, a void contract: That's a contract that's not valid and has no legal effect. It's like it never existed in the eyes of the law.\n\nThen there's a voidable contract: This is a contract that can be canceled by one of the parties because of certain reasons, like misrepresentation or undue influence.\n\nAnd finally, a secondary party beneficiary contract: I'm not entirely sure about this one, but I think it's when a contract is made for the benefit of a third party who isn't directly involved in the agreement.\n\nNow, in this scenario, Tom and Jerry are agreeing to sell and buy heroin, which is illegal. So, the first thing that comes to mind is that this can't be a valid contract because it involves something illegal.\n\nI recall that contracts for illegal purposes are generally void. So, option B seems likely.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nQuasi contract: That doesn't seem to fit because Tom and Jerry did enter into an agreement; it's just that the agreement is for something illegal. A quasi contract is imposed by the court in the absence of an actual agreement.\n\nVoidable contract: This is typically when one party can choose to cancel the contract due to certain injustices, but in this case, the contract is illegal, which is different.\n\nSecondary party beneficiary contract: This seems unrelated to the illegality of the contract's subject matter.\n\nSo, it really looks like a void contract is the correct answer.\n\nTo double-check, I remember that for a contract to be valid, it needs to meet certain criteria, including that the subject matter is legal. Since selling heroin is illegal, the contract is void.\n\nAlso, I think that even if both parties agree to the contract, if it's for something illegal, it's not enforceable by either party. That reinforces the idea that it's a void contract.\n\nIs there any chance it could be voidable? Maybe if one party was forced into the contract or something, but the question doesn't mention any coercion.\n\nWait, perhaps if Jerry was coerced into buying the heroin, but again, the contract's subject matter is illegal, so it would still likely be void.\n\nI think the key here is the illegality of the substance being traded.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct answer is B. void contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
