                    "text": "Let's dive into this appeal case. So, we have a defendant who was convicted of murder, and now he's appealing his conviction. The issue at hand is whether it was proper for the prosecutor to call a police detective to testify about the defendant's refusal to take a lie detector test after he asserted his innocence.\n\nFirst off, let's recall some key principles. In the United States, defendants have a privilege against self-incrimination, which means they don't have to incriminate themselves. This is protected by the Fifth Amendment. Now, when it comes to lie detector tests, or polygraph tests, the law generally holds that a defendant cannot be compelled to take one, and refusing to take one can't be used against them in court. This is to protect that privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nIn this case, the detective testified that the defendant refused to take a lie detector test when given the opportunity. The defendant's trial attorney didn't object to this testimony. Now, the defendant, with a new attorney, is appealing, arguing that it was error to admit this testimony.\n\nSo, the appellate court needs to decide whether this was error, and if so, what kind of error it was. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Plain error, because the trial court should have acted on its own motion to order reference to the lie detector test stricken.\n\nB. Plain error, because admission of the detective's testimony violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nC. Harmless error, because the defendant's trial attorney failed to preserve the argument by timely objection.\n\nD. Harmless error, because the defendant's statements were admissions.\n\nLet's break these down one by one.\n\nOption A mentions \"plain error.\" Plain error is a concept in appellate review where the court can consider an error even if it wasn't properly preserved at trial. This is usually reserved for serious mistakes that affect the fairness of the trial. The option suggests that the trial court should have struck the reference to the lie detector test on its own, without being asked by either party.\n\nOption B also argues for plain error but specifically links it to the violation of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. This seems directly on point because the admission of the refusal to take a lie detector test could be seen as commenting on the defendant's exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nOption C suggests harmless error, which means that even if there was an error, it didn't affect the outcome of the trial. Here, it's argued that since the trial attorney didn't object, the argument wasn't preserved for appeal, and thus, any error would be considered harmless.\n\nOption D again argues for harmless error but bases it on the idea that the defendant's statements were admissions. However, the defendant only asserted his innocence, which isn't really an admission of guilt.\n\nNow, considering the principles I mentioned earlier, admitting evidence of the defendant's refusal to take a lie detector test seems problematic. It appears to comment on the defendant's exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination. Allowing such evidence could potentially penalize the defendant for asserting his rights, which is against the spirit of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nGiven that, options A and B seem more appropriate than C and D. Option C suggests that the error is harmless because there was no objection, but in reality, failing to object might not make the error harmless if it's a fundamental one. Option D is problematic because asserting innocence isn't an admission of guilt; in fact, it's the opposite.\n\nBetween A and B, option B seems more precise because it directly ties the error to the constitutional right against self-incrimination. Option A is more about the trial court's obligation to act on its own motion, which might be relevant, but the core issue is the constitutional protection.\n\nTherefore, the appellate court should likely find that it was plain error to admit the detective's testimony about the defendant's refusal to take a lie detector test, as it violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
