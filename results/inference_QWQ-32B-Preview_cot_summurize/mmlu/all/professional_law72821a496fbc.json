                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this widow who owned an apartment building, and she wrote a will leaving the building to her granddaughter, and the rest of her stuff to her friend and her assistant. Then, a year later, the granddaughter dies intestate, meaning she didn't leave a will, and she's only survived by her son. After that, the widow dies, and her will is being probated. Now, there's a dispute about who gets the apartment building\u2014whether it goes to the friend and assistant as residual beneficiaries, or to the granddaughter's son.\n\nThis jurisdiction has a statute that says: \"If a devisee of a grandparent or lineal descendant of a grandparent dies at the time of execution of the will or fails to survive the testator, the issue of the deceased person shall take the decedent's share under the will.\"\n\nSo, breaking this down:\n\n- A \"devisee\" is someone who is given real property by a will.\n\n- A \"lineal descendant\" would be direct descendants like children, grandchildren, etc.\n\n- \"Fails to survive the testator\" means dies before or at the same time as the testator.\n\n- \"Issue\" means descendants.\n\nSo, according to this statute, if the devisee (in this case, the granddaughter) is a grandchild and she dies before or at the same time as the testator (the widow), then her share under the will goes to her issue, which is her son.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the granddaughter died a year after the will was executed, before the testator (the widow) died. So, she failed to survive the testator.\n\nTherefore, according to the statute, the granddaughter's share (the apartment building) should pass to her issue, which is her son.\n\nBut, one might argue that since the granddaughter died intestate, meaning she didn't have a will, her share should go to her heir at law, which is her son anyway. But the statute seems to override that by specifying that in the context of wills, if a devisee who is a grandchild dies before the testator, their share goes to their issue.\n\nSo, in this case, the son should take the apartment building under the anti-lapse statute.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because under the anti-lapse statute, the granddaughter's interest passes to her son.\n\nThis seems correct based on the statute.\n\nB. Yes, because rules relating to lapse of class gifts do not apply to specific devises.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure about this one. It mentions \"class gifts,\" which are different from specific devises. In this case, the apartment building was specifically devised to the granddaughter, not to a class of beneficiaries. So, perhaps this is trying to say that since it's a specific devise, not a class gift, different rules apply. But the statute seems to handle specific devises anyway.\n\nC. No, because intestate succession is inapplicable to devolution of title to specific devisees.\n\nWait, the granddaughter died intestate, but the question is about the widow's will and who gets the apartment building upon her death. So, the granddaughter's intestacy might not directly affect the disposition under the widow's will.\n\nD. No, because the granddaughter predeceased the widow, title to the apartment building passes to the friend and assistant under the residuary clause of the will.\n\nBut according to the anti-lapse statute, if a devisee dies before the testator, their share goes to their issue, not to the residual beneficiaries.\n\nSo, this seems incorrect because it ignores the anti-lapse statute.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A: Yes, because under the anti-lapse statute, the granddaughter's interest passes to her son.\n\nOption B also says yes, but its reasoning seems less directly applicable compared to A.\n\nOption C says no, but that doesn't align with the anti-lapse statute.\n\nOption D says no, again ignoring the anti-lapse statute.\n\nSo, A seems to be the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
