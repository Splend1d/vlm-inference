                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"What is the largest factor of 54,321 that is less than 54,321?\" And there are options: A. 6, B. 121, C. 18107, D. 54,320. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a factor is. A factor of a number is another number that divides it completely without leaving a remainder. So, for 54,321, I need to find its factors and then identify the largest one that is still smaller than 54,321 itself.\n\nOption D is 54,320, which is just one less than 54,321. But is 54,320 a factor of 54,321? Let me check by dividing 54,321 by 54,320. If I do that, the quotient should be 1 with a remainder of 1, because 54,320 times 1 is 54,320, and 54,321 minus 54,320 is 1. So, it's not a factor.\n\nOption C is 18,107. Is this a factor of 54,321? Let me try dividing 54,321 by 18,107. If 18,107 times 3 is 54,321, then it is a factor. Let me calculate 18,107 times 3: 18,107 times 3 is 54,321. Yes, that's exact. So, 18,107 is a factor of 54,321.\n\nNow, is there any factor larger than 18,107 but less than 54,321? Well, since 18,107 times 3 is 54,321, the only larger factor would be 54,321 itself, but the problem specifies a factor less than 54,321. So, 18,107 should be the largest factor meeting the criteria.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to be sure. Option B is 121. Is 121 a factor of 54,321? Let's divide 54,321 by 121. 121 times 448 is 54,112, and 54,321 minus 54,112 is 209. 121 times 449 is 54,229, which is still less than 54,321. 121 times 449 is 54,229, and 54,321 minus 54,229 is 92, which is not zero. So, 121 is not a factor.\n\nOption A is 6. Is 6 a factor of 54,321? Well, 54,321 divided by 6 is 9,053.5, which is not a whole number, so 6 is not a factor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C, 18,107.\n\nWait a minute, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that there's a larger factor than 18,107 but less than 54,321? Let's see, if 18,107 times 3 is 54,321, then the only other factors would be 1 and perhaps others in between. But since 18,107 is a prime number, maybe there are no other factors.\n\nActually, to confirm, I should check if 18,107 is a prime number. If it is, then the only factors of 54,321 would be 1, 18,107, and 54,321. Since the problem asks for the largest factor less than 54,321, it would indeed be 18,107.\n\nBut is 18,107 a prime number? I'm not sure off the top of my head. Maybe I should check by trying to divide it by prime numbers up to its square root.\n\nThe square root of 18,107 is approximately 134.56, so I need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 134.\n\nLet's start with 2: 18,107 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n\nNext, 3: Add the digits: 1 + 8 + 1 + 0 + 7 = 17. 17 is not divisible by 3, so 18,107 is not divisible by 3.\n\nNext, 5: It doesn't end with 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.\n\nNext, 7: Divide 18,107 by 7. 7 times 2,586 is 18,102, and 18,107 minus 18,102 is 5, so not divisible by 7.\n\nNext, 11: Alternating sum: 1 - 8 + 1 - 0 + 7 = 1 - 8 = -7 + 1 = -6 - 0 = -6 + 7 = 1, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nNext, 13: Divide 18,107 by 13. 13 times 1,392 is 18,096, and 18,107 minus 18,096 is 11, not zero.\n\nNext, 17: 17 times 1,065 is 18,105, and 18,107 minus 18,105 is 2, not zero.\n\nNext, 19: 19 times 953 is 18,107. Wait, is that right? Let's calculate: 19 times 953.\n\n19 times 900 is 17,100.\n\n19 times 53 is 1,007.\n\nTotal is 17,100 + 1,007 = 18,107.\n\nSo, 19 times 953 equals 18,107.\n\nThat means 18,107 is divisible by 19 and 953.\n\nTherefore, 18,107 is not a prime number; it has factors 19 and 953.\n\nSo, the factors of 54,321 are 1, 19, 953, 18,107 (which is 19 times 953), and 54,321.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 18,107 times 3 is 54,321, but that doesn't make sense now because 19 times 953 is 18,107, and 18,107 times 3 is 54,321. So, 54,321 is 19 times 953 times 3.\n\nWait, but 19 times 953 is 18,107, and 18,107 times 3 is 54,321. So, the prime factors of 54,321 are 3, 19, and 953.\n\nTherefore, the factors of 54,321 are 1, 3, 19, 57 (which is 3 times 19), 953, 2,859 (3 times 953), 18,107 (19 times 953), and 54,321.\n\nSo, among these factors, the largest one less than 54,321 is 18,107.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 18,107, which matches this conclusion.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought 18,107 is not a prime, but according to my calculation, it's 19 times 953, but 953 is also a prime number. Let me confirm that.\n\nIs 953 a prime number? Let's check by testing divisibility by primes up to the square root of 953, which is approximately 30.87.\n\nPrimes up to 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.\n\n- 953 divided by 2: it's odd, so no.\n\n- Divided by 3: sum of digits is 9 + 5 + 3 = 17, not divisible by 3.\n\n- Divided by 5: doesn't end with 0 or 5.\n\n- Divided by 7: 7 times 136 is 952, 953 - 952 = 1, not divisible.\n\n- Divided by 11: alternating sum is 9 - 5 + 3 = 7, not divisible by 11.\n\n- Divided by 13: 13 times 73 is 949, 953 - 949 = 4, not zero.\n\n- Divided by 17: 17 times 56 is 952, 953 - 952 = 1, not zero.\n\n- Divided by 19: 19 times 50 is 950, 953 - 950 = 3, not zero.\n\n- Divided by 23: 23 times 41 is 943, 953 - 943 = 10, not zero.\n\n- Divided by 29: 29 times 32 is 928, 953 - 928 = 25, not zero.\n\nTherefore, 953 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 54,321 are 3, 19, and 953.\n\nTherefore, the factors of 54,321 are:\n\n1, 3, 19, 57, 953, 2,859, 18,107, and 54,321.\n\nAmong these, the largest factor less than 54,321 is 18,107.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C, 18,107.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to confirm this without listing all the factors? Maybe by dividing 54,321 by its smallest prime factor.\n\nThe smallest prime factor is 3. So, 54,321 divided by 3 is 18,107. That's the largest factor less than 54,321.\n\nAlternatively, if I divide by 19, I get 54,321 / 19 = 2,859.\n\nAnd if I divide by 953, I get 54,321 / 953 = 57.\n\nSo, among these, 18,107 is indeed the largest factor less than 54,321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 18,107.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18107} \\]"
