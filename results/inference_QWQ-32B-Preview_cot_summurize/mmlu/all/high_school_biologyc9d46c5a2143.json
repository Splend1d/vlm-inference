                    "text": "Let's see, I need to pick the correct statement about meiosis. Meiosis is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, which is important for sexual reproduction. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The daughter cells are genetically identical to the parent cells.\" Hmm, in meiosis, the daughter cells are not identical to the parent cells because meiosis involves recombination and independent assortment, which lead to genetic variation. So, this doesn't sound right.\n\nOption B says: \"Homologues pair during prophase II.\" I think homologous pairing happens during prophase I of meiosis, not prophase II. In meiosis II, the sister chromatids separate, but homologous chromosomes have already separated by that point in meiosis I. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says: \"DNA replication occurs before meiosis I and meiosis II.\" I recall that DNA replication occurs only once, before meiosis I, and not before meiosis II. Meiosis II is similar to mitosis, where the sister chromatids separate, but there's no additional DNA replication before meiosis II. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D says: \"The number of chromosomes is reduced.\" Yes, that's one of the key features of meiosis. Meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half, creating haploid cells from diploid cells. This is essential for sexual reproduction, where gametes fuse to restore the diploid number. So, this seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, reducing the chromosome number, and in meiosis II, the sister chromatids separate, similar to mitosis, but the chromosome number remains haploid.\n\nSo, option D is correct because meiosis results in daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
