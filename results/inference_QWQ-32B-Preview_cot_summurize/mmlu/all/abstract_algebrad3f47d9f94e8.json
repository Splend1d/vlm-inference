                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"The element (4, 2) of Z_12 \u00d7 Z_8 has order...\" and then it gives options A. 4, B. 8, C. 12, D. 6. I need to find the order of this element in the direct product of these two groups. I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but let's try to work through this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the order of an element in a direct product of groups means. If you have a element (a, b) in G \u00d7 H, where G and H are groups, then the order of (a, b) is the least positive integer n such that (a, b)^n equals the identity element in G \u00d7 H. In other words, a^n is the identity in G and b^n is the identity in H.\n\nIn this case, the groups are Z_12 and Z_8, which are additive groups of integers modulo 12 and 8, respectively. So, the operation is addition modulo 12 and 8. The identity element in Z_12 is 0, and in Z_8 is also 0.\n\nTherefore, the order of (4, 2) in Z_12 \u00d7 Z_8 is the smallest positive integer n such that n*(4, 2) equals (0, 0), where the multiplication is scalar multiplication in each component.\n\nSo, n*(4, 2) = (n*4 mod 12, n*2 mod 8). We need both components to be zero.\n\nThat means:\n\nn*4 \u2261 0 mod 12\n\nand\n\nn*2 \u2261 0 mod 8\n\nI need to find the smallest n that satisfies both of these congruences.\n\nLet's look at the first congruence: n*4 \u2261 0 mod 12.\n\nThis means that 12 divides n*4.\n\nSimilarly, the second congruence: n*2 \u2261 0 mod 8, meaning 8 divides n*2.\n\nI need to find the smallest n that satisfies both divisibility conditions.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in a direct product of cyclic groups, the order of an element (a, b) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of a and b in their respective groups.\n\nSo, maybe I can find the order of 4 in Z_12 and the order of 2 in Z_8, and then take their LCM.\n\nThat might be easier.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, find the order of 4 in Z_12.\n\nThe order of an element a in Z_n is n / gcd(n, a), where gcd is the greatest common divisor.\n\nSo, order of 4 in Z_12 is 12 / gcd(12, 4).\n\ngcd(12, 4) is 4.\n\nTherefore, order is 12 / 4 = 3.\n\nSimilarly, order of 2 in Z_8 is 8 / gcd(8, 2).\n\ngcd(8, 2) is 2.\n\nSo, order is 8 / 2 = 4.\n\nNow, the order of (4, 2) in Z_12 \u00d7 Z_8 is LCM(3, 4).\n\nLCM of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\nTherefore, the order is 12.\n\nBut let's check if that's correct by verifying the original condition.\n\nWe found that n = 12 satisfies both n*4 \u2261 0 mod 12 and n*2 \u2261 0 mod 8.\n\nIndeed, 12*4 = 48, and 48 mod 12 is 0.\n\nSimilarly, 12*2 = 24, and 24 mod 8 is 0.\n\nSo, n = 12 works.\n\nBut is there a smaller n that also works?\n\nLet's check n = 6.\n\n6*4 = 24, 24 mod 12 is 0.\n\n6*2 = 12, 12 mod 8 is 4, not 0.\n\nSo, n = 6 does not work.\n\nn = 4:\n\n4*4 = 16, 16 mod 12 is 4, not 0.\n\nSo, n = 4 doesn't work.\n\nn = 8:\n\n8*4 = 32, 32 mod 12 is 8, not 0.\n\nSo, n = 8 doesn't work.\n\nn = 12 works, as we saw.\n\nTherefore, the order is indeed 12.\n\nWait, but let's double-check with n = 12.\n\nn = 12:\n\n12*4 = 48, 48 mod 12 is 0.\n\n12*2 = 24, 24 mod 8 is 0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the LCM method seems to make sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 12.\n\nBut the options include D. 6, and we saw that n = 6 doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that in some cases the order could be a divisor of LCM.\n\nBut in this case, LCM is 12, and 6 is a divisor of 12, but as we saw, n = 6 doesn't satisfy both congruences.\n\nTherefore, the order must be 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the orders.\n\nLet me double-check the order calculations.\n\nOrder of 4 in Z_12:\n\nIndeed, order is 12 / gcd(12, 4) = 12 / 4 = 3.\n\nBecause 4*3 = 12, which is 0 mod 12.\n\nSimilarly, order of 2 in Z_8:\n\n8 / gcd(8, 2) = 8 / 2 = 4.\n\nBecause 2*4 = 8, which is 0 mod 8.\n\nLCM of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to see this.\n\nSuppose the order is k.\n\nThen, k*(4, 2) = (0, 0).\n\nSo, (4k mod 12, 2k mod 8) = (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, 4k \u2261 0 mod 12 and 2k \u2261 0 mod 8.\n\nSo, 4k is a multiple of 12, and 2k is a multiple of 8.\n\nThat means k must be a multiple of 12/ gcd(4,12) = 12/4 = 3.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, from 4k \u2261 0 mod 12, we have that 12 divides 4k, which means that k must be a multiple of 12 / gcd(4,12) = 12/4 = 3.\n\nSimilarly, from 2k \u2261 0 mod 8, we have that 8 divides 2k, so k must be a multiple of 8 / gcd(2,8) = 8/2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, k must be a multiple of both 3 and 4.\n\nThe smallest such k is LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nTherefore, the order is 12.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 12.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the exponents.\n\nIn multiplicative notation, the order of (a, b) is LCM of orders of a and b.\n\nBut here, the groups are additive, but the concept is similar.\n\nSo, yes, LCM makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the generator.\n\nBut in this case, since it's a direct product, the LCM approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is C. 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
