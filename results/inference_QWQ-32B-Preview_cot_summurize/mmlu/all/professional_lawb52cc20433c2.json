                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this law problem. It's about a 12-year-old boy who played a prank by balancing a bucket of ice-cold water on a partially open door in the guest bedroom. His parents were having a dinner party, and he thought his dad would put the guests' coats in there. But his dad decided to keep the coats in the hall closet instead. Later, one of the guests went into the guest bedroom looking for the bathroom and opened the door, and the bucket fell on his head, causing a severe cut that needed stitches. Now, if the guest sues the boy for negligence, what's the most likely outcome?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The boy wins because a child's conduct cannot be negligent.\n\nB. The boy wins because the guest unreasonably assumed the risk by entering an unfamiliar room instead of asking for directions to the bathroom.\n\nC. The boy loses because this \"practical joke\" posed a risk of severe harm, so the boy had a duty to exercise as much care as a reasonable adult.\n\nD. The boy loses because he did not act with the amount of care that one would expect from a 12-year-old child.\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what negligence means. Negligence is when someone fails to act with the care that a reasonable person would have in a similar situation, and that failure causes harm to another person. So, in this case, the question is whether the boy was negligent in setting up the bucket.\n\nOption A says the boy wins because a child's conduct cannot be negligent. I don't think that's right. Kids can be negligent; it just might be evaluated based on what's expected of their age group. So, maybe this isn't the correct answer.\n\nOption B says the boy wins because the guest assumed the risk. Hmm, the guest was looking for the bathroom and might have opened the wrong door. But did the guest assume the risk of being hit by a bucket of water? That seems unlikely. People don't usually expect buckets to fall on their heads when they open a door in someone's house. So, maybe this isn't the best answer either.\n\nOption C says the boy loses because the prank posed a risk of severe harm, so he had to act like an adult. This is interesting. Maybe the court would expect him to consider the potential for serious injury and act accordingly. On the other hand, maybe the standard is different for a 12-year-old.\n\nOption D says the boy loses because he didn't act with the care expected of a 12-year-old. This seems plausible. Courts often use an age-appropriate standard for children, meaning they are expected to act like a reasonable person of their age would.\n\nLet me think about this some more. In law, children are sometimes held to a lower standard of care than adults. So, probably, option C isn't correct because it says he had to act like a reasonable adult.\n\nOption A is probably incorrect because, as I thought earlier, children can be negligent; they just might have a different standard based on their age and maturity.\n\nOption B seems weak because it's unlikely that the guest would be considered to have assumed the risk of being hit by a bucket.\n\nThat leaves option D, which seems the most reasonable. The boy should have acted with the care that a typical 12-year-old would have in the same situation. In this case, setting up a bucket to fall on someone's head might not be considered careful, especially since it could cause harm.\n\nAlso, the fact that he left the house to play at a friend's house means that he didn't supervise or prevent the prank from happening, which might add to his negligence.\n\nSo, I think the most likely result is that the boy loses because he didn't act with the amount of care expected of a 12-year-old child.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
