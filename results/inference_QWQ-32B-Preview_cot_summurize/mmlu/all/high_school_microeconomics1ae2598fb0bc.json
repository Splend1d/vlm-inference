                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, we're trying to figure out which of these goods\u2014plastic, automobiles, computers, or air\u2014provides both the largest total utility and the smallest marginal utility. To answer this, we need to understand what total utility and marginal utility mean.\n\nTotal utility is the overall satisfaction or benefit a person gets from consuming a good or service. Marginal utility, on the other hand, is the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of that good or service.\n\nGenerally, as a person consumes more of a good, the total utility increases, but the marginal utility decreases. This is known as the law of diminishing marginal utility. So, for a good that we consume a lot of, the total utility might be high, but the marginal utility of each additional unit is low.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Plastic: Plastic is a versatile material used in many products. People don't directly consume plastic; they consume products made from plastic. So, it's a bit tricky to assess its utility directly.\n\nB. Automobiles: These are big-ticket items that people buy to satisfy transportation needs. Most people don't buy multiple cars, so the total utility might not be as high as for some other goods, and the marginal utility of an additional car would be low for most people.\n\nC. Computers: Similar to automobiles, computers are significant purchases that satisfy specific needs, like work or entertainment. Again, most people don't need multiple computers, so the total utility might not be as high as for more frequently consumed goods, and the marginal utility of an extra computer would be low.\n\nD. Air: Air is essential for survival. People consume a large amount of air every day, and it provides a huge total utility because without it, life isn't possible. However, the marginal utility of an additional unit of air (beyond what's necessary for survival) is very low because once basic needs are met, extra air doesn't provide much additional benefit.\n\nConsidering this, air seems to fit the description of providing both the largest total utility (since it's essential for life) and the smallest marginal utility (because beyond a certain point, extra air doesn't add much benefit).\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nPlastic, as I mentioned, is more of a raw material used in various products. It's not directly consumed for utility, so it might not be the best fit.\n\nAutomobiles and computers are high-ticket items with significant utility, but their total utility might not be as vast as something like air, which is continuously consumed in large quantities.\n\nTherefore, air appears to be the good that provides both the largest total utility and the smallest marginal utility.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
