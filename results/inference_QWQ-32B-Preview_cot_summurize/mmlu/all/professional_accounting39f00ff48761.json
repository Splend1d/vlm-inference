                    "text": "Let's tackle this finance problem step by step. So, we've got Felton Farm Supplies, Inc., and we're given a few pieces of information: an 8 percent return on total assets, total assets of $300,000, and a net profit margin of 5 percent. The question is asking for the company's sales.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these terms mean and how they relate to each other.\n\n**Return on Total Assets (ROA):** This is a profitability ratio that measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate earnings. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nGiven that the ROA is 8% and total assets are $300,000, I can find the net income.\n\n\\[ 0.08 = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{300,000} \\]\n\nSolving for Net Income:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Income} = 0.08 \\times 300,000 = 24,000 \\]\n\nSo, the net income is $24,000.\n\nNext, we have the **net profit margin**, which is 5%. Net profit margin shows how much of each dollar of sales translates into net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Sales}} \\]\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for sales:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sales} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Net Profit Margin}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sales} = \\frac{24,000}{0.05} = 480,000 \\]\n\nSo, the sales are $480,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $3,750,000.00\n\nB. $480,000\n\nC. $300,000\n\nD. $1,500,000\n\nOption B matches our calculation.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, ROA is 8%, and total assets are $300,000. So, net income is indeed $24,000.\n\nThen, net profit margin is 5%, so sales should be net income divided by net profit margin, which is $24,000 / 0.05 = $480,000.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nLet's consider the relationship between ROA, profit margin, and asset turnover. I recall that ROA can also be expressed as the product of profit margin and asset turnover:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\text{Profit Margin} \\times \\text{Asset Turnover} \\]\n\nWhere asset turnover is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Asset Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nSo, plugging in the known values:\n\n\\[ 0.08 = 0.05 \\times \\text{Asset Turnover} \\]\n\nSolving for asset turnover:\n\n\\[ \\text{Asset Turnover} = \\frac{0.08}{0.05} = 1.6 \\]\n\nNow, using the asset turnover formula to find sales:\n\n\\[ 1.6 = \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{300,000} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Sales} = 1.6 \\times 300,000 = 480,000 \\]\n\nAgain, we arrive at $480,000.\n\nIt seems consistent across both methods. Therefore, the correct answer should be option B, $480,000.\n\nI think that's solid. No need to second-guess here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nb. $480,000"
