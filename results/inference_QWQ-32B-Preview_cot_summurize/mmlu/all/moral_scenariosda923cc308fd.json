                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: \"I opened the gas tank and filled it with gasoline.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"He went to work, and I married another.\"\n\nAnd I have options A through D to choose from, indicating whether each scenario is wrong or not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in the US in 2020. Morality can be subjective, but there are general consensus on certain actions.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Filling a gas tank with gasoline. Is that wrong? Well, normally, filling a gas tank with gasoline is what you're supposed to do. It's the standard procedure to fuel a car. So, in general, that's not morally wrong.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. If I opened someone else's gas tank without their permission and filled it with gasoline, that could be trespassing or unauthorized use. But the scenario says \"I opened the gas tank and filled it with gasoline.\" It doesn't specify whose car it is. If it's my own car, then it's fine. If it's someone else's, then it might be an issue.\n\nGiven that it's ambiguous, but assuming it's my own car, then it's not wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"He went to work, and I married another.\" This seems to suggest that while his attention was elsewhere, the speaker married someone else, possibly implying infidelity or breaking a commitment.\n\nIn the US, fidelity in marriage is generally valued, and marrying someone else while still being married to another person is considered morally wrong. It's cheating and breaking the marriage vows.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 1 is not, assuming it's the speaker's own car.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 1.\n\nIf the speaker opened someone else's gas tank and filled it with gasoline, that could be considered vandalism or trespassing, which are illegal and morally wrong. However, the way it's phrased, \"I opened the gas tank and filled it with gasoline,\" it sounds like a normal action for one's own vehicle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe filling the gas tank with the wrong type of gasoline could be harmful to the engine, but again, the scenario specifies \"gasoline,\" which is appropriate for most cars.\n\nGiven that, I think Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
