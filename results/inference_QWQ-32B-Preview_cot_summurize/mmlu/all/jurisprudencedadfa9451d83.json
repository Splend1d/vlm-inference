Hart wrote \"The Concept of Law.\" He was a legal philosopher, and his book is considered a classic in legal theory. Austin and Bentham are also associated with legal theory, but their works are different. Austin is known for his theory of command law, and Bentham was an influential figure in utilitarianism and legal reform. So, I believe Hart is the correct answer here."
