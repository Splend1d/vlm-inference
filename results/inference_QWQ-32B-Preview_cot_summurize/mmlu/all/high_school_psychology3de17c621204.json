                    "text": "Let's see. The radio station wants to estimate how much the typical supporter contributes during a fund-drive. They have a sample of 30 supporters with different contribution amounts: 22 gave $60, 6 gave $1,000, and 2 gave $10,000. They need to choose the best measure of central tendency based on this data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what central tendency means. It's a way to describe the center point of a data set. There are several measures of central tendency, like mean, median, and mode. The question mentions median, mode, histogram, and ANOVA, but ANOVA isn't a measure of central tendency, so maybe there's a typo or something.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. Median\n\nB. Mode\n\nC. Histogram\n\nD. ANOVA\n\nWait, ANOVA is Analysis of Variance, which is used to compare means across groups, not a measure of central tendency. Maybe option D was meant to be something else, like mean or something else, but it's not. So, perhaps it's a trick question, and ANOVA is not the right choice here.\n\nNow, among the remaining options, median and mode are measures of central tendency, and histogram is a graphical representation of data. A histogram can show the distribution of the data, but it's not a measure of central tendency itself. So, maybe the question is asking for the most useful measure of central tendency, which would be either median or mode.\n\nLet's think about the data. There are 30 supporters:\n\n- 22 gave $60\n\n- 6 gave $1,000\n\n- 2 gave $10,000\n\nSo, the majority, which is 22 out of 30, gave $60. That's almost 73% of the sample. Then, there are a few who gave more, with six giving $1,000 and two giving $10,000.\n\nIn this case, the mode would be $60, since it's the most frequent contribution. The median would be the middle value when all contributions are ordered. Since there are 30 entries, the median would be the average of the 15th and 16th values.\n\nLet's order the data:\n\n- The first 22 values are $60\n\n- The next 6 are $1,000\n\n- The last 2 are $10,000\n\nSo, the 15th and 16th values are both $60, so the median is $60.\n\nThe mean would be the total amount divided by the number of supporters. Let's calculate that to see how it compares.\n\nTotal amount = (22 * $60) + (6 * $1,000) + (2 * $10,000) = $1,320 + $6,000 + $20,000 = $27,320\n\nNumber of supporters = 30\n\nMean = $27,320 / 30 = approximately $910.67\n\nSo, the mean is $910.67, the median is $60, and the mode is $60.\n\nNow, the radio station wants to estimate the amount typical supporters contribute. The mean is $910.67, but most people gave $60, which is the median and the mode.\n\nIn this case, the mean is skewed higher by the few large contributions. So, if they want to know what a typical supporter gives, the mean might not be representative because it's pulled up by the high contributions.\n\nTherefore, the median or the mode would be better measures of central tendency in this scenario.\n\nBetween median and mode, they are both $60 in this case. So, either would give the same value.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for which measure would provide the most useful information. Since the median and mode are the same, perhaps the mode is more straightforward because it directly tells us the most common contribution amount.\n\nBut, in many cases, the median is preferred as a measure of central tendency when there are outliers, which seem to be present here with the $10,000 contributions.\n\nWait, but in this specific sample, the median and mode are both $60, which matches the majority of the contributions.\n\nPerhaps the radio station is interested in understanding the typical contribution, which is $60, but also needs to consider the impact of the larger contributions on their total funds.\n\nHowever, since the question is specifically about measures of central tendency and which one would provide the most useful information, and given that the median and mode are both $60, perhaps the median is a better choice because it is less affected by outliers and it represents the middle value, which in this case aligns with the mode.\n\nAlternatively, the mode directly tells us the most frequent contribution, which might be useful for understanding the most common behavior of supporters.\n\nBut, in general, for skewed distributions, which this seems to be, the median is often preferred as a measure of central tendency.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. Median\n\nB. Mode\n\nC. Histogram\n\nD. ANOVA\n\nSince ANOVA is not a measure of central tendency, it can be eliminated.\n\nHistogram is a graphical representation, not a measure of central tendency, so perhaps it's not the answer they're looking for.\n\nBetween median and mode, since they are both $60 in this case, perhaps the median is the better choice because it is a more general measure of central tendency and is less affected by extreme values.\n\nHowever, in this specific sample, since the mode is the same as the median, maybe either would work.\n\nBut perhaps the question is testing which measure is more appropriate in the presence of outliers.\n\nGiven that, the median is generally more robust to outliers, so it might be the preferred measure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Median.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
