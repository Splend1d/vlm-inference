Generally, going for a jog is not considered morally wrong. It's a personal activity that benefits one's health and well-being. However, there might be considerations about the time and whether the jogging could disturb others, but in this scenario, it's mentioned that the parents were already sleeping, so presumably, the jogging didn't disturb them. Therefore, this action seems morally neutral or even positive.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character pours detergent into the washer that contains their roommate's clothes. This action could be seen as malicious or at least negligent. Detergent is a cleaning agent, and pouring it into the washer is normal, but if it's already full of the roommate's clothes, it might imply that the main character is interfering with someone else's belongings without permission, which could damage the clothes. This kind of action could be considered morally wrong because it involves potentially harming someone else's property without consent.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
