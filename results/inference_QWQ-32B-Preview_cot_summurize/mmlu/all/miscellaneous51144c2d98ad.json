The gastrointestinal tract includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. Additionally, gastroenterologists also deal with the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, which are considered accessory organs of the digestive system.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Brain - This is examined by neurologists or neurosurgeons.\n\nB. Skeleton - Orthopedic specialists or rheumatologists deal with skeletal issues.\n\nC. Stomach - This is correct, as the stomach is part of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nD. Nose - Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialists or otolaryngologists examine the nose.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Stomach.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the stomach is indeed a part of what a gastroenterologist examines, their expertise extends beyond just the stomach to include the entire gastrointestinal tract and related organs.\n\n\n"
