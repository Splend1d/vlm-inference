                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about audit independence. So, the key here is to identify which situation wouldn't impair the auditor's objectivity, integrity, or independence with respect to the audit client. That means we're looking for the option where the auditor's judgment isn't likely to be compromised due to some favor or gift from the client.\n\nFirst, let's understand why this is important. Auditors are supposed to be objective and unbiased when they're auditing a company's financial statements. If they receive gifts or favors from the client, it might influence their judgment, even if unintentionally. This could lead to a loss of public trust in the auditing process.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. An auditor takes the client\u2019s audit committee to Las Vegas for the weekend.\n\nThis seems like a significant gift. Going to Las Vegas for the weekend probably includes accommodation, meals, entertainment, maybe even gambling. That's a lot of value, and it could certainly be seen as impairing the auditor's independence. The audit committee is supposed to oversee the auditing process, and if the auditor is treating them to an expensive trip, it might compromise the auditor's objectivity.\n\nB. An out-of-town client takes the audit engagement team out to dinner at a renowned local restaurant.\n\nHere, the client is taking the audit team out to dinner at a famous restaurant. Now, while this is still a favor, it's probably less substantial than option A. It's a single meal at a nice place, but it's not an entire weekend getaway. So, compared to option A, this might be less likely to impair independence.\n\nC. An auditor provides client management with box seats for the season at a major league baseball franchise.\n\nThis seems like a significant gift as well. Box seats for an entire season at a major league baseball game would be quite valuable. This could definitely be seen as impairing the auditor's independence because it's a substantial benefit provided to the client's management.\n\nD. A client takes the audit engagement team on a two-day ski trip after the audit team worked for two consecutive weekends.\n\nIn this scenario, the client is taking the audit team on a two-day ski trip as a gesture of appreciation for their hard work over two weekends. While this is a nice gesture, it's important to consider the value of the trip and whether it could be perceived as influencing the auditor's judgment.\n\nComparing all these options, option B seems the least likely to impair independence. It's a single dinner at a renowned restaurant, which is probably still a nice gesture, but not as extensive as the other options.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that even small gifts or favors can potentially influence judgment, so auditors are generally advised to avoid accepting any gifts from clients to maintain their independence.\n\nIn conclusion, among the given options, B. An out-of-town client takes the audit engagement team out to dinner at a renowned local restaurant, would be the situation least likely to impair objectivity, integrity, or independence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
