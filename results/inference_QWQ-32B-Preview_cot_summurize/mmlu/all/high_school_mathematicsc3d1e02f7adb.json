The triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nGiven that the longest side is 10, we need to check if the sum of the other two sides is greater than 10. Additionally, the difference between the two sides should be less than 10, but since 10 is the longest side, this condition is already satisfied if the sum is greater than 10.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A: 4 and 7**\n\nSum: 4 + 7 = 11\n\nSince 11 > 10, these sides can form a triangle.\n\n**Option B: 5 and 5**\n\nSum: 5 + 5 = 10\n\nSince 10 is not greater than 10, these sides cannot form a triangle.\n\n**Option C: 3 and 9**\n\nSum: 3 + 9 = 12\n\nSince 12 > 10, these sides can form a triangle.\n\n**Option D: 9 and 8**\n\nSum: 9 + 8 = 17\n\nSince 17 > 10, these sides can form a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the pair that cannot form a triangle with the longest side of 10 is option B: 5 and 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
