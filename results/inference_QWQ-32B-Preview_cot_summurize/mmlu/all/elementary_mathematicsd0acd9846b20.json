                    "text": "So I have this equation to solve: 6.73 equals z over 7.74. So, it's written like 6.73 = z / 7.74. I need to find the value of z. There are options provided, but I think it's important to understand how to solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to isolate z. Since z is divided by 7.74, I should do the opposite operation to both sides of the equation to solve for z. The opposite of division is multiplication. So, I should multiply both sides by 7.74.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n6.73 = z / 7.74\n\nMultiply both sides by 7.74:\n\n6.73 * 7.74 = (z / 7.74) * 7.74\n\nOn the right side, the 7.74 in the denominator and the numerator cancel each other out, leaving just z.\n\nSo, z = 6.73 * 7.74\n\nNow, I need to calculate 6.73 multiplied by 7.74. I can do this manually or use a calculator. Since this is a learning exercise, I'll show the manual multiplication.\n\nFirst, ignore the decimals and multiply 673 by 774.\n\n673 * 774:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n774 * 600 = 464,400\n\n774 * 70 = 54,180\n\n774 * 3 = 2,322\n\nNow, add those up:\n\n464,400\n\n+54,180\n\n= 518,580\n\n+2,322\n\n= 520,902\n\nNow, account for the decimals. In 6.73 and 7.74, there are a total of 4 decimal places (two in each number). So, the result should have 4 decimal places.\n\nTherefore, z = 52.0902\n\nNow, let's check if this makes sense by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: 6.73 = z / 7.74\n\nPlug in z = 52.0902:\n\n6.73 = 52.0902 / 7.74\n\nLet me do the division to check.\n\n52.0902 divided by 7.74.\n\nUsing a calculator for precision, 52.0902 \u00f7 7.74 = 6.73\n\nPerfect, it checks out.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 52.0902\n\nB. 1.0112\n\nC. \u22121.0102\n\nD. 51.5902\n\nThe correct answer is A. 52.0902\n\nIt's important to be careful with decimals and to always check your work by plugging the value back into the original equation. This helps ensure accuracy and builds confidence in your solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{52.0902} \\]"
