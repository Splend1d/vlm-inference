I'm a bit rusty on the order of operations, so I'll have to remember to follow PEMDAS\u2014Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFirst, I'll look at the innermost parentheses. There are two sets inside the brackets: (2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5) and (8 \u00f7 4).\n\nLet's solve (2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5):\n\n2 \u00d7 6 is 12, and then minus 5 is 7. So, that part is 7.\n\nNext, (8 \u00f7 4):\n\n8 divided by 4 is 2.\n\nNow, the expression inside the brackets is 7 + 2, which is 9.\n\nSo, the expression now becomes 3 \u00d7 [9] \u2013 1.\n\nNext, multiplication: 3 \u00d7 9 is 27.\n\nThen, subtract 1: 27 \u2013 1 equals 26.\n\nLooking back at the options, 26 is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, innermost parentheses:\n\n(2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5):\n\n2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n\n12 \u2013 5 = 7 Correct.\n\n(8 \u00f7 4) = 2 Correct.\n\nThen, [7 + 2] = 9 Correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 Correct.\n\nFinally, 27 \u2013 1 = 26 Correct.\n\nSeems like the answer should be C. 26.\n\nBut the user says the teacher said it's not C. Hmm, maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps there are different grouping symbols or maybe I misread the expression.\n\nThe expression is: 3 \u00d7 [(2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5) + (8 \u00f7 4)] \u2013 1\n\nI think I handled the grouping correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression is 3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5) + (8 \u00f7 4) \u2013 1, without the outer brackets around both terms.\n\nBut the way it's written, there are brackets around both (2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5) and (8 \u00f7 4), and then overall brackets.\n\nWait, no, it's 3 \u00d7 [ (2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5) + (8 \u00f7 4) ] \u2013 1.\n\nSo, the brackets are grouping the sum of (2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5) and (8 \u00f7 4).\n\nI think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo in the expression, but assuming it's written correctly, I think 26 is the correct answer.\n\nPerhaps the teacher made a mistake or perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression was meant to be different, but as it's written, I think 26 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the teacher considers the answer is 26, which is option C, but the user thinks it's incorrect because they saw another answer.\n\nWait, the user says the teacher said it's not C, but according to my calculation, it should be C.\n\nMaybe the teacher has a different answer key or maybe there's a mistake in the teacher's calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different order of operations being considered, but standard PEMDAS should apply here.\n\nI think I'll stick with 26 as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
