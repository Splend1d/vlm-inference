                    "text": "Let's see what Source 2 is telling us about religion in the period 1750-1900 CE. So, Source 2 is the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil from March 25, 1824. It's a primary source from that time, which is great for understanding the attitudes and policies regarding religion back then.\n\nLooking at Article 5, it says, \"The Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion will continue to be the religion of the Empire.\" That suggests that Catholicism was the official religion of the Empire of Brazil. But then it goes on to say, \"Followers of all other religions are allowed to worship within their households, or particular houses for that intent, so long as there is nothing indicating this on the exterior of the Temple.\" So, while Catholicism was the official religion, other religions were tolerated to some extent, but with certain restrictions.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Religious uniformity was expected of the citizens of most states in the period.\n\nWell, in this case, Brazil had an official religion, Catholicism, but other religions were allowed in private. So, it's not complete uniformity, but there was an official religion. But the question is about the period 1750-1900 CE, and whether this was common in most states. I know that in many European countries during this time, there was an official state religion, but toleration of other religions was increasing. So, this might not be entirely accurate for all states in the period.\n\nB. Religious toleration gained acceptance with the laws of most states in the period.\n\nThis seems more plausible. The Constitution allows for other religions to be practiced in private, which is a form of toleration. And historically, during the Enlightenment and afterward, there was a growing trend toward religious toleration in many parts of the world. So, this could be a supported inference.\n\nC. Religious authority was the basis of the divine right of monarchs to rule their states in the period.\n\nThe Constitution mentions that the Emperor is the \"Perpetual Defender of Brazil,\" which might imply some divine right, but it doesn't explicitly state that religious authority is the basis for his rule. Also, the divine right of kings was more prominent in earlier centuries, and by the 19th century, this concept was being challenged by ideas of constitutional monarchy and separation of powers. So, while there might be some elements of divine right, it's not clearly supported by this source.\n\nD. Religious influence on the populations of states declined due to scientific advancements.\n\nThis option is about the general trend of declining religious influence due to science. While it's true that scientific advancements in this period did challenge religious beliefs in some ways, this source doesn't provide direct evidence for that. It's more about the legal status of religion in the Empire of Brazil.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option B is the best inference supported by Source 2. The Constitution allows for other religions to be practiced privately, which indicates a degree of religious toleration, aligning with the broader trend of increasing toleration in the period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
