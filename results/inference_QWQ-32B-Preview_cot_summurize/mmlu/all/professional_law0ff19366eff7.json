                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about summary judgment in civil litigation. I need to choose the correct statement from the options given. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Summary judgment can be entered only after all discovery has been completed.\" Hmm, I remember that summary judgment is a procedure to resolve a case without a trial, based on the pleadings and supporting materials. Discovery is the process where parties exchange information and evidence before trial. But does summary judgment have to wait until discovery is fully done?\n\nI think the idea is that summary judgment can be sought at certain points during the discovery process, not necessarily after everything is completed. In fact, one of the goals of summary judgment is to avoid unnecessary discovery by resolving the case early if there are no genuine disputes over material facts. So, I'm not sure if this is correct.\n\nOption B states: \"Motion for summary judgment is the proper motion on the ground that plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action.\" Okay, failing to state a cause of action is typically addressed by a motion to dismiss, like a 12(b)(6) motion in Federal Court, where the defendant argues that even if the facts are true, the plaintiff doesn't have a legal claim.\n\nSummary judgment, on the other hand, is used when there's no dispute over the material facts, and one party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. So, this seems incorrect because summary judgment isn't the right motion to challenge the sufficiency of the complaint; that's what a motion to dismiss is for.\n\nOption C says: \"Since both parties have filed summary judgment motions that assert there are no genuine issues of material fact, summary judgment for plaintiff or defendant will be granted.\" This one is interesting. If both sides are saying there are no factual disputes, does that mean the court will grant summary judgment to one of them?\n\nWell, summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. If both sides agree there are no factual disputes, then the court can decide the legal issues without a trial. However, just because both sides make this assertion doesn't automatically mean summary judgment will be granted; the court still needs to review the submissions to confirm there are indeed no genuine issues of material fact.\n\nSo, while this might be possible, it's not necessarily always the case. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nOption D: \"If plaintiff's proofs submitted in support of his motion for summary judgment are not contradicted and if plaintiff's proofs show that no genuine issue of material fact exists, summary judgment will be granted even if defendant's answer denied plaintiff's complaint.\" Okay, this seems plausible.\n\nIn summary judgment practice, the moving party has to show that there are no genuine issues of material fact, and the non-moving party then has the opportunity to present evidence showing there are such issues. If the plaintiff moves for summary judgment and submits evidence that demonstrates no genuine issues of fact, and the defendant doesn't contradict that evidence, then summary judgment should be granted to the plaintiff, even if the defendant's answer denies the complaint.\n\nDenials in the answer don't substitute for actual evidence creating a factual dispute. So, if the plaintiff's evidence is uncontroverted and shows no genuine issue of fact, summary judgment should be granted.\n\nComparing all the options, option D seems to be the most accurate statement about summary judgment. Options A and B are incorrect based on my understanding, and option C is somewhat vague.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
