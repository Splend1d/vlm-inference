I've seen pictures of Amish women wearing bonnets, and I don't recall bonnets being a traditional part of the other communities listed.\n\nBut let me double-check. Sikh women sometimes wear a headscarf called a dupatta, but not bonnets. Roman Catholic nuns used to wear habits that included head coverings, but I don't think those are called bonnets. And \"Christian\" is a broad term; different Christian denominations have different traditions regarding headwear.\n\nSo, I'm pretty sure it's the Amish community that traditionally wears bonnets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
