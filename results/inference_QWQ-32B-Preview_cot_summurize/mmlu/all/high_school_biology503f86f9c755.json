                    "text": "Let's see. So, we have this scenario with pocket mice in the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico. There are black lava formations surrounded by light-colored sandy desert, and there are dark-colored mice in the lava areas and light-colored mice in the desert. I need to figure out which statement is correct about this situation.\n\nOption A says: \"The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.\" Hmm, that sounds plausible. Maybe the dark and light mice came from the same ancestor not too long ago.\n\nOption B: \"The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.\" Okay, so this is suggesting that there was one population of mice, and due to mutations, they split into two different species. But is that what's happening here? They're still both pocket mice, so maybe they haven't become entirely different species.\n\nOption C: \"Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\" That makes sense. Maybe the color of the mice affects their survival in different environments. Dark mice might blend in better in the lava formations, and light mice in the desert.\n\nOption D: \"Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.\" This seems similar to C, but it's more specific. It suggests that all mice were originally dark, and as the environment changed, some mice mutated to be light-colored, which was advantageous in the desert.\n\nLet me think about this. First, the lava formations are black, and the desert is light-colored. So, predators like owls or hawks might have an easier time spotting mice that don't blend in with their environment. For example, a dark mouse in the light sand might stand out, making it easier prey, and similarly, a light mouse in the black lava might be more visible.\n\nThis sounds like natural selection at work, where mice with colors that match their environment have a better chance of surviving and reproducing. So, over time, the population in each area would tend to have more individuals with colors that blend in better.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA says they descended from a recent common ancestor. That could be true, but it doesn't explain why they have different colors now.\n\nB says they diverged into two species because of mutations. Well, maybe they're on their way to becoming different species, but in the scenario described, they're still the same species\u2014pocket mice. So, perhaps that's going too far.\n\nC says selection favors some phenotypes over others, which aligns with my thinking about natural selection based on color.\n\nD is similar to C but more specific about the original color and the change over time.\n\nBetween C and D, C is more general and accurate. D makes an assumption about the original color being dark, which might not necessarily be the case. Maybe the original mice were already varied in color, and selection just favored certain colors in certain environments.\n\nAlso, the statement in D that \"as the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed\" seems a bit off. Lava doesn't directly decompose into sand; it weathers and erodes over time, but that's a separate issue.\n\nMoreover, mutations can lead to color variations, but it's the selection process that favors certain colors in certain environments, leading to the observed distribution.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the most accurate statement is C: \"Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\" This captures the essence of natural selection acting on the mouse population based on their coloration in different environments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
