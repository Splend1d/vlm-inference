                    "text": "So I've got this question about the distance between the lowest and highest points on Earth. The lowest point is the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is 35,840 feet below sea level, and the highest point is the summit of Mount Everest, which is 29,028 feet above sea level. I need to estimate the distance between these two points. The options are A) 6,000 feet, B) 7,000 feet, C) 64,000 feet, and D) 65,000 feet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. The distance between the lowest and highest points should be the total vertical distance from the bottom of the Mariana Trench to the top of Mount Everest. To find this, I think I need to add the depth of the trench and the height of the mountain because one is below sea level and the other is above sea level.\n\nSo, if I add 35,840 feet (depth of the trench) and 29,028 feet (height of Everest), that should give me the total distance between the two points.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n35,840 + 29,028 = ?\n\nFirst, adding the thousands: 35,000 + 29,000 = 64,000\n\nThen, adding the hundreds: 840 + 28 = 868\n\nSo, total distance is 64,000 + 868 = 64,868 feet.\n\nNow, looking at the options, C is 64,000 feet and D is 65,000 feet. Since 64,868 is closer to 65,000, I think D is the best estimate.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's a better way to estimate this without adding the exact numbers. Let's try rounding the numbers first.\n\nThe depth of the Mariana Trench is 35,840 feet. Rounding to the nearest thousand, that's about 36,000 feet.\n\nThe height of Mount Everest is 29,028 feet. Rounding to the nearest thousand, that's about 29,000 feet.\n\nNow, adding these rounded numbers: 36,000 + 29,000 = 65,000 feet.\n\nAgain, that points to option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the precision of the numbers given. The depths and heights are given to the exact foot, but the options are in thousands, so estimating to the nearest thousand should be sufficient.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the order of magnitude. Both 35,840 and 29,028 are in the tens of thousands, so their sum should be in the sixties thousand, which again points to D.\n\nOptions A and B are much smaller, around 6,000 and 7,000 feet, which can't be right because even the height of Everest alone is almost 30,000 feet, so the total distance should be much larger.\n\nOption C is 64,000 and D is 65,000. Given that the exact sum is 64,868, which is closer to 65,000, D seems to be the better estimate.\n\nI think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
