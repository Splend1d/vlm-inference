                    "text": "In 1993, a rancher had good record title to a 20-acre orange grove in fee simple absolute. In 1994, the rancher delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the rancher, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed. In 2007 for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered adeed of the orange grove naming the orange grower and his heirs as grantees. Before the grower had paid the retiree and taken his deed, the grower visited the orange grove and observed the fence. However, the buyer was not present when the grower visited the property and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094if anyone \u0080\u0094was using it. In any case, the grower did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. This jurisdiction uses Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Indices and has no Tract Index. In 2008, what is the present state of title to the orange grove if the jurisdiction's recording act provides: \"Every conveyance of real property shall be invalid as against any person, except the grantor, his heirs, and assigns, having actual notice thereof, unless it is recorded as provided by statute\"?\n\nA. In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title and, therefore, would acquire record title to the orange grove.\nB. In a race \u0080\u0094notice jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire equitable title to the orange grove, because he erected the fence and failed to inform the buyer of the prior rancher-to-son instrument.\nC. In a race \u0080\u0094notice jurisdiction, the buyer, as subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior rancher-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the orange grove.\nD. In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree would acquire record title to the orange grove even though he failed to record his deed.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this complex scenario involving multiple conveyances and recording issues. I need to determine the present state of title to the orange grove in 2008, given the jurisdiction's recording act and the sequence of events.\n\nFirst, let's understand the recording act in this jurisdiction: \"Every conveyance of real property shall be invalid as against any person, except the grantor, his heirs, and assigns, having actual notice thereof, unless it is recorded as provided by statute.\" This sounds like a \"notice\" recording statute, meaning that unrecorded deeds are valid against those who don't have actual notice of them, but are invalid against those who do have actual notice.\n\nNow, let's outline the sequence of events:\n\n1. **1993:** Rancher owns the orange grove in fee simple absolute.\n\n2. **1994:** Rancher delivers a deed to his son for $1,000, naming the son and his heirs as grantees. The son neglects to record this deed.\n\n3. **1998:** Farmer, aware of the rancher-to-son deed, buys a deed from the rancher for $10,000, naming the farmer and his heirs as grantees. The farmer records this deed promptly. The farmer's intent is to acquire color of title and obtain ownership by adverse possession. The farmer constructs a fence around the orange grove.\n\n4. **1999:** Son sells the orange grove to a retiree for $15,000, signing a deed naming the retiree and his heirs as grantees. The retiree makes no effort to search the title, examine the property, or record the deed.\n\n5. **2003:** Buyer pays the farmer $20,000 and receives a deed naming the buyer and his heirs as grantees. The buyer examines the property, searches the title, and has no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. The buyer records his deed and regularly visits the property twice a week.\n\n6. **2007:** Retiree sells the orange grove to an orange grower for $25,000, signing a deed naming the grower and his heirs as grantees. Before the transaction, the grower visits the property and observes the fence but doesn't attempt to search the title.\n\n7. **2008:** Determine the present state of title.\n\nGiven that this is a notice jurisdiction, the key factors are who has actual notice of prior deeds and whether they recorded their deeds.\n\nLet's analyze each party's position:\n\n- **Son:** Received a deed in 1994 but didn't record it. Since he didn't record, anyone without actual notice of this deed can acquire valid title against him.\n\n- **Farmer:** Knew about the rancher-to-son deed but still bought from the rancher and recorded his deed in 1998. By recording, he provides constructive notice to future purchasers.\n\n- **Retiree:** Bought from the son in 1999 without recording the deed or checking the title. Since the farmer had recorded his deed earlier, the retiree should have known about it if he had checked the records.\n\n- **Buyer:** Bought from the farmer in 2003, examined the property and searched the title, and recorded his deed. He had no knowledge of the prior rancher-to-son instrument.\n\n- **Grower:** Bought from the retiree in 2007, observed the fence but didn't search the title.\n\nNow, let's consider the chains of title:\n\n1. **Rancher to Son (1994, unrecorded)**\n\n2. **Rancher to Farmer (1998, recorded)**\n\n3. **Son to Retiree (1999, unrecorded)**\n\n4. **Farmer to Buyer (2003, recorded)**\n\n5. **Retiree to Grower (2007, unrecorded)**\n\nIn a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser without notice of prior unrecorded deeds can acquire valid title against prior unrecorded deeds.\n\n- The farmer had actual notice of the rancher-to-son deed but still bought from the rancher and recorded his deed. His recording gives constructive notice to others.\n\n- The retiree bought from the son, who had an unrecorded deed, and the retiree didn't record or check the title. The retiree should have known about the farmer's recorded deed if he had checked the records.\n\n- The buyer bought from the farmer, recorded his deed, and had no knowledge of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Since he searched the title and recorded his deed, he's a bona fide purchaser for value without notice.\n\n- The grower bought from the retiree, observed the fence but didn't search the title. He's a subsequent purchaser without recording his deed.\n\nGiven this analysis, in 2008:\n\n- The buyer has a recorded deed from the farmer, who had recorded his deed earlier. The buyer is a bona fide purchaser without notice of the prior unrecorded deeds.\n\n- The grower has an unrecorded deed from the retiree, who himself had an unrecorded deed.\n\nTherefore, the buyer has the superior title because he is a bona fide purchaser for value, having recorded his deed and had no notice of prior claims.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent bona fide purchaser, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title and, therefore, would acquire record title to the orange grove.\n\n- This is incorrect because the grower didn't record his deed, and in a notice jurisdiction, unrecorded deeds are invalid against subsequent bona fide purchasers without notice.\n\nB. In a race-notice jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire equitable title to the orange grove, because he erected the fence and failed to inform the buyer of the prior rancher-to-son instrument.\n\n- This is incorrect because the jurisdiction is a notice jurisdiction, not specified as race-notice. Additionally, the farmer recorded his deed, giving constructive notice to others.\n\nC. In a race-notice jurisdiction, the buyer, as subsequent bona fide purchaser without notice of the prior rancher-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the orange grove.\n\n- This is plausible, but the jurisdiction is specified as a notice jurisdiction, not race-notice. However, in a notice jurisdiction, recording provides protection to bona fide purchasers without notice.\n\nD. In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree would acquire record title to the orange grove even though he failed to record his deed.\n\n- This is incorrect because in a notice jurisdiction, unrecorded deeds are invalid against subsequent bona fide purchasers without notice, and the retiree didn't record his deed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. In a race-notice jurisdiction, the buyer, as subsequent bona fide purchaser without notice of the prior rancher-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the orange grove.\n\nHowever, there's a slight confusion because the jurisdiction is described as a notice jurisdiction, not explicitly as a race-notice jurisdiction. But given the options, C seems to be the closest match, emphasizing the buyer's status as a subsequent bona fide purchaser without notice and having recorded his deed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
