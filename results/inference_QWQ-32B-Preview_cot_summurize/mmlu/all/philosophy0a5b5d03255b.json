So, Moore is a philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly for his book \"Principia Ethica.\" I think the question is asking about what he considers the most basic or essential issue in ethics.\n\nOption A says whether life is worth living. That seems more like a existential question or a question of personal values, but I'm not sure if that's the core issue in ethics according to Moore.\n\nOption B is whether God exists. Now, the existence of God is certainly relevant to ethics, especially for those who base their moral beliefs on religious teachings. But I don't recall Moore focusing specifically on the existence of God as the fundamental question in ethics.\n\nOption C is how \"good\" is to be defined. That sounds promising because Moore is famous for his \"open question argument,\" where he argues that \"good\" is a simple, non-natural property that can't be defined in terms of natural properties like pleasure, desire fulfillment, etc. So, defining \"good\" seems central to his ethical theory.\n\nOption D is whether morality is objective. This is related to whether moral truths exist independently of human opinions or if morality is subjective and varies from person to person. Moore does argue for an objective morality, but I'm not sure if this is the most fundamental question in his view.\n\nLet me think about this again. In \"Principia Ethica,\" Moore introduces the concept of \"the good\" as something that is good in itself, and he argues that it's a simple, indefinable quality. He criticizes other ethical theories for committing the \"naturalistic fallacy\" by trying to define \"good\" in terms of natural properties.\n\nSo, it seems like the heart of Moore's ethics is about understanding and defining what \"good\" is. Therefore, option C might be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe option D is also closely related. If morality is objective, then there are moral facts that are true regardless of what people think, and that aligns with Moore's view. However, the question is asking for the most fundamental question in ethics according to Moore, and I think that fundamentally, it's about the definition of \"good.\"\n\nAlso, considering that Moore's open question argument is central to his ethics, which questions any attempt to define \"good\" in terms of something else, it seems that the definition of \"good\" is indeed the foundational issue in his ethical theory.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: how \"good\" is to be defined.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
