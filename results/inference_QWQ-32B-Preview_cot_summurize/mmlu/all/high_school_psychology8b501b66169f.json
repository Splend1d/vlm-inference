                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. Mayella thinks that doing well on an AP exam is all about luck. We need to figure out which option best describes her belief.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each option means.\n\nA. High academic self-efficacy: This refers to someone who believes in their own ability to succeed academically. They think they can do well because of their skills and efforts.\n\nB. Internal locus of control: This is when someone believes that they have control over their life and outcomes. They think that their actions and decisions affect what happens to them.\n\nC. External locus of control: This is the opposite of internal locus of control. People with this belief think that external factors, like luck or fate, control their lives and outcomes.\n\nD. High achievement motivation: This is about having a strong desire to achieve and succeed. People with high achievement motivation set high goals and work hard to reach them.\n\nNow, Mayella believes that getting a good grade on an AP exam is a matter of luck. That sounds like she thinks external factors, like luck, are determining her grade rather than her own efforts or abilities.\n\nSo, if she thinks luck is the key, that aligns with an external locus of control. She's attributing her success to external factors beyond her control.\n\nOn the other hand, high academic self-efficacy (option A) would be believing in her own abilities to succeed, which is not what she's doing here.\n\nAn internal locus of control (option B) is about believing that you control your own destiny, which again contradicts her belief in luck.\n\nHigh achievement motivation (option D) is about having a strong drive to achieve, which isn't directly related to her belief in luck determining her grade.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable answer is C. an external locus of control.\n\nTo double-check, let's see if there's any other way to interpret her belief.\n\nIf she thinks luck is involved, maybe she also believes that studying doesn't help, or that the outcome is unpredictable. That further supports the idea that she has an external locus of control because she's not attributing the outcome to her own actions or efforts.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
