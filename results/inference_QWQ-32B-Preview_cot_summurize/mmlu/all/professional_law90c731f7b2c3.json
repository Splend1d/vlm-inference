                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal question about jury size in a federal civil case. So, there's a man who got hurt on a bus and he\u2019s suing the bus company for damages. He wanted a jury trial, and they picked six jurors plus two alternates. But during the trial, three jurors got sick one after another, and they replaced two of them with alternates. Then, a third juror got sick, and the court excused that one too. So now, there are only five jurors left, and the parties agreed to let them decide the case. The jury decided in favor of the bus company, and the man is asking for a new trial because he says five jurors aren\u2019t enough.\n\nThe question is, should the court grant his motion for a new trial? And there are four options:\n\nA. No, because the court properly excused the three jurors due to illness.\n\nB. No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.\n\nC. Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.\n\nD. Yes, because there must be at least 12 jurors on a federal civil jury.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what the requirements are for jury size in federal civil cases. I remember that in criminal cases, there are specific rules about jury size, but civil cases might be different.\n\nLet me think about this. In federal courts, for civil cases, the standard jury size is six members, but I think there can be more. I think the Seventh Amendment guarantees a right to trial by jury in civil cases, but it doesn\u2019t specify the number of jurors. So, the number is probably set by court rules or statutes.\n\nI think Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure addresses jury size. Let me look that up.\n\nOkay, Rule 48 says that the court may set the number of jurors, and it must be at least six, but not more than twelve, unless the parties stipulate otherwise.\n\nSo, in this case, they had six jurors originally, which is the minimum. But now, due to illnesses, only five are left. The parties agreed to let these five decide the case.\n\nSo, option C says yes, because there must be at least six jurors. But here, they agreed to five. Option D says yes, because there must be at least 12, but that doesn\u2019t seem right because the rule says the maximum is usually twelve, not the minimum.\n\nOption A says no, because the court properly excused the jurors due to illness. That seems reasonable, but is it enough?\n\nOption B says no, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from fewer than six jurors.\n\nSo, I need to see what the law says about reducing the jury size mid-trial.\n\nI think that in federal civil cases, if jurors are excused during the trial, and there are fewer than the original number, the parties can agree to proceed with fewer jurors. But is there a minimum number?\n\nLet me check the law again.\n\nRule 48 also says that if during the trial, a juror can\u2019t continue, the court can replace them with an alternate, if available. But in this case, they only had two alternates, and they used them to replace the first two who got sick. Then, a third juror got sick, but there were no more alternates, so the court excused that juror, leaving five.\n\nNow, the parties agreed to let the five decide the case.\n\nSo, is five acceptable in federal civil cases?\n\nAccording to Rule 48, the jury must have at least six members, unless the parties stipulate otherwise. So, normally, six is the minimum.\n\nBut in this case, the parties stipulated to a verdict from five jurors.\n\nSo, does that make it okay?\n\nI think that stipulation might not be valid if it violates the rule\u2019s requirement for a minimum of six jurors.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the stipulation is allowed, and the court can go below six if both parties agree.\n\nI need to think about this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court has the discretion to allow fewer jurors under certain circumstances, like juror illnesses.\n\nBut according to the rule, it seems like six is the minimum, unless the parties agree otherwise.\n\nIn this case, they agreed to go down to five.\n\nSo, is that permissible?\n\nI\u2019m not sure.\n\nLet me consider the purpose of having a minimum number of jurors.\n\nHaving at least six jurors is probably to ensure a diverse enough perspective and to have a sufficient number of people deliberating to reach a fair decision.\n\nBut if both parties agree to proceed with fewer jurors, maybe that\u2019s acceptable.\n\nHowever, the rule seems to set six as the minimum, so perhaps even with agreement, the court cannot go below that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in cases where jurors are excused due to valid reasons like illness, the court can proceed with fewer jurors, even below six, if the parties agree.\n\nI think I need to look for case law on this point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\u2019s an exception in the rule for situations where alternates are exhausted and more jurors can\u2019t be added.\n\nBut I don\u2019t have specific case law on this, so I\u2019ll have to make an educated guess based on the rule.\n\nGiven that Rule 48 requires at least six jurors, unless the parties stipulate otherwise, and in this case, they stipulated to five, maybe that\u2019s acceptable.\n\nBut option C says yes, meaning the court should grant the new trial because six is the minimum.\n\nOption B says no, because the parties stipulated to fewer than six.\n\nSo, perhaps the stipulation overrides the rule\u2019s requirement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule\u2019s requirement is mandatory and can\u2019t be waived by the parties.\n\nI\u2019m not sure.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nIn criminal cases, the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to an impartial jury, and there are specific requirements for jury size.\n\nBut in civil cases, it\u2019s different because it\u2019s governed by statutory and procedural rules.\n\nSo, following the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 48 seems to be the governing law here.\n\nGiven that, and assuming that the rule requires at least six jurors unless the parties stipulate otherwise, and here they did stipulate otherwise, perhaps the five-person jury is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the court should not grant the motion for a new trial.\n\nSo, option B seems correct: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the stipulation can override the rule\u2019s minimum requirement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stipulation is only valid within the parameters set by the rule.\n\nThe rule says the jury must consist of at least six and not more than twelve, unless the parties stipulate otherwise.\n\nSo, the stipulation allows for variations, but not below six unless agreed.\n\nBut in this case, they agreed to go below six to five.\n\nIs that allowed?\n\nMaybe the rule doesn\u2019t permit going below six, even with stipulation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stipulation can allow for fewer than six only with court approval.\n\nI need to check the exact language of Rule 48.\n\nLooking it up, Rule 48(a) says: \u201cThe parties may stipulate in writing to a jury of fewer than six or more than twelve but not more than twenty jurors.\u201d\n\nSo, it seems that with a written stipulation, the parties can agree to have fewer than six jurors.\n\nIn this case, the stipulation was likely verbal, as it was during the trial, but maybe that\u2019s sufficient.\n\nSo, if the parties stipulated to five jurors, and Rule 48 allows for stipulations to have fewer than six, then perhaps it\u2019s acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the court should not grant the motion for a new trial.\n\nSo, option B is correct: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.\n\nOption A is also \u201cno,\u201d but for a different reason, saying it\u2019s because the court properly excused the jurors due to illness.\n\nWhile that may be true, the illness is what led to the need for alternates and ultimately to having fewer than six jurors.\n\nBut the key point is the stipulation, not just the excusing of jurors.\n\nOption C is \u201cyes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.\u201d\n\nBut according to Rule 48, with a stipulation, that\u2019s not necessarily the case.\n\nOption D is \u201cyes, because there must be at least 12 jurors on a federal civil jury,\u201d which is incorrect because the standard is six to twelve, with stipulations allowed for more or fewer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
