                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out who the major beneficiaries of Medicaid are in the U.S. The options are single men, the elderly, women and children, or undocumented residents. I need to choose one of these groups as the primary beneficiary.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what Medicaid is. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. It covers a wide range of services, including hospital stays, doctor visits, and nursing home care, among others.\n\nNow, considering the groups listed:\n\nA. Single men - While some single men may qualify for Medicaid based on income and other criteria, I'm not sure if they are the major beneficiaries.\n\nB. The elderly - The elderly are often in need of more medical care, but I think there's another program for them called Medicare. Medicaid does play a role in covering some costs for the elderly, especially those in nursing homes or with limited income, but I'm not sure if they are the major beneficiaries.\n\nC. Women and children - This seems plausible. Many Medicaid recipients are women and children, particularly those with lower incomes who might not have access to other forms of health insurance.\n\nD. Undocumented residents - I believe that undocumented immigrants have limited access to Medicaid. In most cases, only emergency services are covered for undocumented immigrants, so they are probably not the major beneficiaries.\n\nLet me look up some statistics to confirm this.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2018, children made up about 44% of Medicaid enrollees, adults around 35%, and the elderly and people with disabilities about 21%. So, children and adults together make up the majority, with adults including both men and women.\n\nBut breaking it down further, I recall that a significant portion of adult Medicaid recipients are women, particularly those with dependent children.\n\nAlso, the Women's Health Initiative and other programs under Medicaid target women's health issues, so women might be a substantial beneficiary group.\n\nHowever, when considering women and children together, that would cover a large portion of Medicaid enrollees.\n\nOn the other hand, the elderly, while an important group, make up a smaller percentage, as mentioned earlier.\n\nUndocumented immigrants, as I thought, have very limited access to Medicaid, mostly emergency services only.\n\nSingle men would be included in the adult category, but perhaps they make up a smaller proportion compared to women with children.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the specific demographics.\n\nIn the adult category, a significant number are likely to be women, especially those with children, who qualify through programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or through expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that women and children are the major beneficiaries of Medicaid.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Women and children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
