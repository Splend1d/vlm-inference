                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which aspect of cell structure shows the unity of all life. The options are:\n\nA. All cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane.\n\nB. All cells have at least one nucleus.\n\nC. All cells carry out cellular respiration in mitochondria.\n\nD. The surface-to-volume ratio of all cells is the same.\n\nI think the key here is understanding what \"unity of all life\" means. It probably refers to characteristics that are common to all living cells, showing that they all belong to the same biological system.\n\nOption A says that all cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane. I know that the plasma membrane is important because it regulates what enters and leaves the cell. But is this true for all cells?\n\nI recall that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have plasma membranes. Eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane, and prokaryotic cells have a cell membrane, sometimes with additional structures like a cell wall. So, basically, all cells have some kind of membrane enclosing them.\n\nOption B states that all cells have at least one nucleus. Now, I know that eukaryotic cells have nuclei, but prokaryotic cells don't. They have a region where their DNA is located, called the nucleoid, but it's not enclosed by a membrane. So, this can't be the correct answer because not all cells have a nucleus.\n\nOption C says that all cells carry out cellular respiration in mitochondria. Again, I know that mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for cellular respiration. Prokaryotic cells don't have mitochondria; they carry out respiration on their plasma membrane or through other mechanisms. So, this can't be true for all cells.\n\nOption D mentions that the surface-to-volume ratio of all cells is the same. I don't think that's accurate. Different cells come in different sizes and shapes, so their surface-to-volume ratios vary. This ratio is important for cellular function, but it's not the same across all cells.\n\nSo, considering these points, option A seems to be the best answer. All cells, whether eukaryotic or prokaryotic, are surrounded by some kind of plasma membrane. This is a fundamental characteristic that unites all forms of life.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
