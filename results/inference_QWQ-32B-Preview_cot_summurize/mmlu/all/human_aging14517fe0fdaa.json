                    "text": "I'm trying to recall the name of the woman who did a longitudinal study on herself and noticed that her memory retrieval difficulty increased as she aged. The options are Clark, Smith, Whitebear, and Ebbinghaus. I think I remember something about this, but I'm a bit fuzzy.\n\nFirst off, Ebbinghaus is a famous name in memory studies. He's known for his work on the forgetting curve, but I think he was a man, and his studies were more experimental rather than longitudinal self-studies. So, maybe Ebbinghaus isn't the right choice here.\n\nLet's think about Clark. I don't recall any prominent memory researcher named Clark who did a longitudinal study on herself. Maybe it's not Clark.\n\nSmith is a very common name, so it's probably not that. I might be misremembering it.\n\nWhitebear sounds familiar. I think there was a study related to thought suppression or something like that, but I'm not sure if that's the same as a longitudinal memory study.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's Elizabeth Loftus or Mary A. Thomas, but those names aren't in the options. Perhaps it's someone less well-known.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\nA. Clark - Not ringing any bells.\n\nB. Smith - Too generic, probably not this one.\n\nC. Whitebear - Hmm, maybe related to thought suppression, but not sure about a longitudinal memory study.\n\nD. Ebbinghaus - Famous for memory studies, but I think he was a man and his research was different.\n\nMaybe I need to look up some information about longitudinal studies on memory and aging. I recall that longitudinal studies track the same individuals over a long period, which can be decades. These studies are crucial for understanding how cognition changes with age.\n\nIn the context of memory, aging is often associated with declines in various cognitive functions, including memory retrieval. So, it makes sense that someone would conduct a longitudinal study to document these changes over time.\n\nI think the person in question might be a woman who decided to study her own memory decline as she aged. Perhaps she kept detailed records of her memory abilities at different ages and observed the difficulties she faced in retrieving information.\n\nLet me try to eliminate some options. Ebbinghaus is definitely not the right choice because his work was more focused on the properties of memory in general, not on longitudinal changes with age.\n\nBetween Clark, Smith, and Whitebear, I'm going to take a guess that it might be Whitebear. I think I remember something about a study with that name related to memory, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's none of the above, but since it's a multiple-choice question, I have to pick one.\n\nWait, maybe it's Carol Clark. I seem to recall a researcher named Carol Clark who did work on memory. But again, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a made-up name, and I need to choose based on process of elimination.\n\nGiven that Ebbinghaus is probably not the right answer, and Smith is too generic, I'll choose between Clark and Whitebear.\n\nI think I'll go with Whitebear for this one.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nc.
