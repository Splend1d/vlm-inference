This is because Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium that causes gonorrhea, typically infects the urethra in males, leading to symptoms such as urethritis, which includes urethral discharge and dysuria (painful urination).\n\nHere's a brief overview of why the other options are less common:\n\nA. Anus: While anal gonorrhea can occur, especially in men who have sex with men, it is not the most common site for specimen collection in men.\n\nB. Bladder: Gonococcal infections can ascend to the bladder, but it is more common to test the urethra first due to easier accessibility and higher likelihood of detecting the infection there.\n\nD. Testicle: Testicular infections can occur as a complication of untreated gonorrhea, but again, the urethra is the primary site of infection and thus the preferred site for initial testing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Urethra."
