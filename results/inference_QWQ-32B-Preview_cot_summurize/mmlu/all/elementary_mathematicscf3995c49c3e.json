                    "text": "Let's look at each option one by one to see which statement is true.\n\nOption A says: \"All hexagons are triangles because they have at least 3 sides.\"\n\nWell, a hexagon has 6 sides, and a triangle has 3 sides. Just because a shape has at least 3 sides doesn't mean it's a triangle. A triangle must have exactly 3 sides. So, hexagons are not triangles. This statement is false.\n\nOption B says: \"All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides.\"\n\nAn octagon has 8 sides, and a polygon is any closed shape with straight sides. The minimum number of sides a polygon can have is 3, which is a triangle. Since an octagon has 8 sides, which is more than 3, it is indeed a polygon. In fact, all octagons are polygons by definition. So, this statement is true.\n\nOption C says: \"All parallelograms are rectangles because they have 2 sets of parallel sides.\"\n\nA parallelogram has two sets of parallel sides, and a rectangle is a type of parallelogram where all angles are right angles. However, not all parallelograms have right angles. For example, a rhombus is a parallelogram with all sides equal, but its angles are not necessarily right angles. So, not all parallelograms are rectangles. This statement is false.\n\nOption D says: \"All rhombi are squares because they have 4 sides that are all the same length.\"\n\nA rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides of equal length. A square is a special type of rhombus where all angles are right angles. So, while all squares are rhombi, not all rhombi are squares because they might not have right angles. For example, a diamond shape is a rhombus but not a square. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only true statement is option B: \"All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
