Ferguson (1896), which held that racial segregation did not violate the Constitution as long as the facilities provided for different races were equal. However, in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, effectively overturning Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nThe Court in Brown v. Board of Education determined that segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states that no state shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" The Court reasoned that segregation in public schools was inherently unequal because it stigmatized minority students and denied them the same educational opportunities as their white counterparts.\n\nTherefore, the amendment that was violated by the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, according to Brown v. Board of Education, is the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)."
