                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about Jean Piaget's view on children. Piaget was a famous psychologist who studied how children think and learn. So, I need to recall what his theory says about children.\n\nOption A says \"blank slates.\" I think this is more associated with John Locke's idea, where he believed that at birth, the mind is like a blank slate, and all knowledge comes from experience or perception. But Piaget had a different perspective.\n\nOption B says \"less intelligent than adults.\" Well, Piaget did believe that children think differently from adults, but he didn't necessarily see them as less intelligent. He proposed that children go through distinct stages of cognitive development, each with its own way of thinking, and that these stages are universal.\n\nOption C says \"little scientists.\" Hmm, this sounds familiar. Piaget emphasized that children actively construct their understanding of the world through experience and interaction. He compared their learning process to that of scientists, who formulate hypotheses, test them, and then adjust their understanding based on the results. So, in a way, children are like little scientists, exploring and making sense of their environment.\n\nOption D says \"shaped by culture.\" This seems more aligned with cultural psychologists or anthropologists who study how culture influences development. While culture does play a role, Piaget's theory is more focused on universal stages of cognitive development.\n\nConsidering these points, I think the best answer is C: \"little scientists.\" Piaget's theory emphasizes the active role of children in constructing their own knowledge, similar to how scientists work by forming hypotheses and testing them against evidence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
