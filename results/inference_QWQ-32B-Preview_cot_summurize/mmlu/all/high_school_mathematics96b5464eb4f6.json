                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about bacteria growing in a culture. It says that the bacteria increase at a rate proportional to the number present. That sounds like exponential growth, right? So, I think I can model this with an exponential function.\n\nGiven that the initial population is 200 and it triples in 10 hours, I need to find out how many bacteria there will be after 1 full day, which is 24 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for exponential growth. I think it's something like:\n\n\\[P(t) = P_0 \\cdot e^{kt}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(P(t)\\) is the population at time \\(t\\),\n\n- \\(P_0\\) is the initial population,\n\n- \\(k\\) is the growth rate,\n\n- \\(t\\) is time.\n\nBut I also remember that sometimes it's written as:\n\n\\[P(t) = P_0 \\cdot a^t\\]\n\nI'm not sure which one to use here. Maybe I can use both and see which one fits better.\n\nGiven that the population triples in 10 hours, I can set up an equation to find the growth rate.\n\nUsing the first formula:\n\n\\[P(t) = P_0 \\cdot e^{kt}\\]\n\nAt \\(t = 10\\) hours, \\(P(10) = 3 \\times P_0 = 600\\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[600 = 200 \\cdot e^{10k}\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 200:\n\n\\[3 = e^{10k}\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\\ln(3) = 10k\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[k = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{10}\\]\n\nNow, I need to find \\(P(24)\\):\n\n\\[P(24) = 200 \\cdot e^{24 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(3)}{10}}\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponent:\n\n\\[24 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(3)}{10} = \\frac{24}{10} \\ln(3) = 2.4 \\ln(3)\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[P(24) = 200 \\cdot e^{2.4 \\ln(3)}\\]\n\nI know that \\(e^{\\ln(3)} = 3\\), so:\n\n\\[e^{2.4 \\ln(3)} = (e^{\\ln(3)})^{2.4} = 3^{2.4}\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[P(24) = 200 \\times 3^{2.4}\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(3^{2.4}\\). I don't have a calculator right now, so I'll have to approximate this.\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[3^2 = 9\\]\\[3^3 = 27\\]\n\nSo \\(3^{2.4}\\) should be between 9 and 27. Maybe around 15 or so? But that's a rough estimate.\n\nAlternatively, I can use logarithms to calculate this more accurately.\n\nLet me try using logarithms.\n\nLet \\(x = 3^{2.4}\\)\n\nThen, taking natural logs:\n\n\\[\\ln(x) = 2.4 \\ln(3)\\]\n\nI know that \\(\\ln(3)\\) is approximately 1.0986.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\\ln(x) = 2.4 \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.63664\\]\n\nNow, to find \\(x\\), I can use the fact that \\(x = e^{\\ln(x)}\\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[x \\approx e^{2.63664}\\]\n\nI know that \\(e^2 \\approx 7.389\\), and \\(e^3 \\approx 20.0855\\).\n\nSo \\(e^{2.63664}\\) should be between \\(e^2\\) and \\(e^3\\). Let me try to calculate it more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the Taylor series expansion for \\(e^x\\), but that might be too time-consuming without a calculator.\n\nMaybe I can approximate \\(e^{2.63664}\\) as follows:\n\n\\[e^{2.63664} \\approx e^{2.64} \\approx e^{2 + 0.64} = e^2 \\times e^{0.64}\\]\n\nI know \\(e^2 \\approx 7.389\\), and \\(e^{0.64}\\) is approximately 1.897 (since \\(e^{0.693} \\approx 2\\), and 0.64 is a bit less).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[e^{2.64} \\approx 7.389 \\times 1.897 \\approx 14.04\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(3^{2.4} \\approx 14.04\\).\n\nSo, \\(P(24) = 200 \\times 14.04 \\approx 2808\\).\n\nLooking at the options, the closest one is D. 2793.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the second formula I mentioned earlier:\n\n\\[P(t) = P_0 \\cdot a^t\\]\n\nGiven that the population triples in 10 hours, so:\n\n\\[3 = a^{10}\\]\n\nTaking the 10th root:\n\n\\[a = 3^{1/10}\\]\n\nTherefore, the population at time \\(t\\) is:\n\n\\[P(t) = 200 \\cdot (3^{1/10})^t = 200 \\cdot 3^{t/10}\\]\n\nSo, at \\(t = 24\\):\n\n\\[P(24) = 200 \\cdot 3^{24/10} = 200 \\cdot 3^{2.4}\\]\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, again, \\(P(24) = 200 \\cdot 3^{2.4} \\approx 200 \\times 14.04 \\approx 2808\\), which rounds to 2793 based on the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the approximate number of bacteria after 1 full day is 2793.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2793} \\]"
