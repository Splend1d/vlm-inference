                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these responses is most likely acquired through classical conditioning. I remember that classical conditioning is when an organism learns to associate two stimuli, so that one stimulus triggers a response that was originally triggered by another stimulus.\n\nOption A is about a woman who's anxious when driving on a highway after being in a major accident there. So, she's associating the highway with the traumatic accident, right? That seems like classical conditioning because the highway is now triggering an anxiety response due to the association with the accident.\n\nOption B is about a baby crying when waking up disoriented from a nap. This seems more like a natural reflex or maybe something the baby has learned through experience, but it's not clear that it's classical conditioning.\n\nOption C is about a contact lens wearer blinking uncontrollably when something gets in their eye. That seems like a natural reflex to protect the eye. Probably not classical conditioning.\n\nOption D is about a child startled by a loud clap of thunder in the middle of the night. Again, this seems like a natural startle response to a sudden loud noise. Not likely classical conditioning.\n\nSo, comparing all these, option A seems to be the best fit for classical conditioning because it involves associating a specific environment (the highway) with a traumatic event (the accident), leading to an anxiety response whenever she drives on that highway.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
