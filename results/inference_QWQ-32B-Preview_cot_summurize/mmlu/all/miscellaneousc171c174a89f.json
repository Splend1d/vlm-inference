Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is equivalent to a 'lorry' in British English.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a 'lorry' is in Britain. I think it's some kind of vehicle, but I'm not entirely sure. I remember that in the UK, they use different words for some things compared to American English. For example, they say 'boot' instead of 'trunk' in a car, and 'biscuits' instead of 'cookies'. So, maybe 'lorry' is another term for a type of vehicle.\n\nLet me eliminate some options that don't make sense. Option A is 'a toaster'. That's a kitchen appliance for toasting bread. That can't be a lorry. So, I can cross that out.\n\nOption C is 'a babysitter'. That's a person who looks after children while their parents are away. That doesn't seem related to a lorry at all.\n\nOption D is 'an elevator'. That's a mechanism for moving people or goods from one floor to another in a building. Again, not a vehicle.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, option B, 'a truck', seems to be the most plausible answer. But I should confirm if 'lorry' indeed refers to a truck in British English.\n\nI recall that in Britain, large goods vehicles are often called lorries, whereas in American English, we call them trucks. For example, delivery trucks, cargo vehicles, that sort of thing. So, it makes sense that a lorry in Britain would be equivalent to a truck in American English.\n\nLet me think about it some more. Is there any other meaning of 'lorry' that I might be missing? Maybe in British slang or something. But from what I know, 'lorry' primarily refers to a large vehicle used for carrying goods or materials.\n\nI don't think it's used to refer to a person or an appliance, so options A, C, and D can definitely be ruled out.\n\nTherefore, I'm fairly confident that the answer is B, a truck.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
