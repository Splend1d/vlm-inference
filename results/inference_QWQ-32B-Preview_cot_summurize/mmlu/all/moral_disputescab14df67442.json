The question is worrying that the freedom of association might justify policies that exclude people based on race. Wellman is supposed to have a stance on this, and I need to figure out which option correctly represents his view.\n\nOption A says that such a policy would wrongly disrespect existing citizens who belong to that race. That sounds plausible, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what Wellman says.\n\nOption B is that this is an implication we have to accept. That seems like he's accepting that exclusion based on race is a valid exercise of freedom of association, which doesn't sound right to me, but maybe.\n\nOption C is that this is unavoidable in all philosophical positions on immigration policy. That seems too broad. Not all philosophers agree on immigration policies, so it's unlikely that all positions lead to this implication.\n\nOption D is none of the above, which is possible, but I should make sure I've considered all the options carefully.\n\nI recall that Wellman is a proponent of what's called \"liberal nationalism,\" which generally holds that nation-states have the right to control their membership based on certain principles, including cultural and national self-determination. However, he also emphasizes that such control should be exercised in a way that respects individual rights and avoids discrimination.\n\nGiven that, I think Wellman would likely argue that excluding people based solely on race is not a justifiable exercise of freedom of association, especially if it discriminates against existing citizens of that race. So, option A seems the most aligned with his views.\n\nOption B doesn't sound right because Wellman is generally concerned with ethical constraints on immigration policies, and accepting racial exclusion as a necessary implication doesn't align with his emphasis on justice and rights.\n\nOption C is too sweeping, as not all philosophical positions support racial exclusion in immigration policies.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is A: such a policy would wrongly disrespect existing citizens who belong to that race.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
