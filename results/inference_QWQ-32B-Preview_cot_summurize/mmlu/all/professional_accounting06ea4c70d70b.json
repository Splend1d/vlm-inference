                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option is correct for this auditing question. The question is about when an auditor might stratify a population for a substantive test. Stratification is a technique used in sampling where the population is divided into subgroups or strata based on certain characteristics before sampling. This is often done to improve the precision of the sample results.\n\nOption A says that the auditor suspects management fraud has occurred during the year. While fraud is certainly a concern for auditors, stratification isn't typically directly related to fraud detection in substantive testing. Fraud detection usually involves other procedures beyond just stratifying the population.\n\nOption B mentions that the desired assessed level of control risk is less than the prior year. Control risk relates to the risk that\u5185\u90e8\u63a7\u5236 is insufficient to prevent or detect and correct material misstatements. Stratification in substantive testing is more about the characteristics of the population being tested rather than the assessed level of control risk.\n\nOption C says that the technique to be used is attribute sampling. Attribute sampling is generally used in tests of controls to estimate the rate of deviation from prescribed controls. Substantive testing, on the other hand, is concerned with the amounts and is more aligned with variables sampling. Stratification can be used in both types of sampling, but it's more common in variables sampling for substantive tests.\n\nOption D states that the auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts. This sounds like a good candidate for stratification. In substantive testing, especially when dealing with monetary units, auditors might stratify the population based on the size of the amounts. This is because larger amounts have a greater potential impact on the financial statements, and thus, the auditor might want to ensure that these larger amounts are adequately represented in the sample.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the correct answer is D. The auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts. Stratification allows the auditor to allocate more sample selections to the stratum containing larger amounts, thereby increasing the precision of the estimate for those larger amounts.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about why the other options aren't as suitable.\n\nOption A: Suspecting fraud might lead an auditor to perform additional substantive tests or to modify the nature of the tests, but it doesn't directly relate to the need to stratify the population for substantive testing.\n\nOption B: The assessed level of control risk affecting the substantive testing is more about determining the extent and nature of substantive testing, but not necessarily about stratifying the population.\n\nOption C: Attribute sampling is for testing controls, not for substantive testing of amounts, so stratification in this context wouldn't be typically applied.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
