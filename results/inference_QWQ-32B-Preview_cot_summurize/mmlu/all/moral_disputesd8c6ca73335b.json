                    "text": " I'm trying to answer this question about Nathanson's support for a particular kind of retributivism. The options are preventive, proportional, equality, and retaliatory. I need to recall what Nathanson's stance is on retributivism.\n\nFirst, I remember that retributivism is a theory of punishment that focuses on the idea that punishment is justified as a form of moral revenge or desert for the offense committed. There are different types of retributivism, and the question is asking which one Nathanson supports.\n\nOption A is \"preventive.\" I think preventive approaches to punishment are more about deterrence and incapacitation, which are utilitarian concepts aimed at preventing future crimes rather than focusing on the moral desert of the offender. So, this seems less likely to be a type of retributivism.\n\nOption B is \"proportional.\" Proportional retributivism emphasizes that the severity of the punishment should be proportional to the gravity of the offense. This aligns with the idea of \"an eye for an eye\" or lex talionis, where the punishment is commensurate with the crime committed. This seems like a plausible type of retributivism that Nathanson might support.\n\nOption C is \"equality.\" I'm not sure what exactly \"equality\" retributivism would entail. Perhaps it refers to treating all offenders equally or ensuring that similar crimes receive similar punishments. While equality is important in retributivism, it's not clear if this is a distinct type of retributivism.\n\nOption D is \"retaliatory.\" Retaliatory retributivism seems closely related to proportional retributivism, as it involves retaliating against the offender in a way that mirrors the offense. It's about paying back the offender in kind for the harm caused.\n\nI need to recall Nathanson's specific views. I remember that Stephen Nathanson is a philosopher who has written about retributivism and punishment. In his work, he argues for a proportional theory of retributivism. He emphasizes that punishment should be proportional to the moral gravity of the offense and the culpability of the offender.\n\nNathanson critiqued the classical retributivist position that punishment is inherently just because it gives the offender what he deserves, regardless of the consequences. Instead, he proposed a modified retributivism that takes into account the proportionality of punishment.\n\nTherefore, based on my recall of Nathanson's arguments, I believe that the correct answer is B. proportional.\n\nTo confirm, I can think about the characteristics of proportional retributivism. It focuses on ensuring that the punishment fits the crime, both in terms of the severity of the offense and the blameworthiness of the offender. This approach tries to avoid excessive or insufficient punishment and aims for a just balance.\n\nIn contrast, preventive approaches are more forward-looking, aiming to deter future crimes or protect society by incapacitating the offender. Equality might refer to treating like cases alike, but it's not specifically a type of retributivism.\n\nRetaliatory retributivism seems similar to proportional retributivism, but the term \"retaliatory\" might imply a more vengeance-driven approach, which Nathanson likely would not fully endorse.\n\nGiven this analysis, I'm confident that the answer is B. proportional.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
