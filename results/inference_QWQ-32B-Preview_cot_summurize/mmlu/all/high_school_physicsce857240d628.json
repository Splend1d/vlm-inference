                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rigid, solid container with a constant volume holding an ideal gas. Initially, the gas has volume \\(v_1\\), temperature \\(T_1\\), and pressure \\(P_1\\). Then, the temperature is increased in an isochoric process. We need to determine which statement is NOT true.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what an isochoric process is. \"Isochoric\" means constant volume, so in this process, the volume of the gas doesn't change. The container is rigid, so that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's recall the ideal gas law: \\(PV = nRT\\), where \\(P\\) is pressure, \\(V\\) is volume, \\(n\\) is the number of moles of gas, \\(R\\) is the ideal gas constant, and \\(T\\) is temperature in Kelvin.\n\nSince the volume is constant in this process, and the amount of gas (n) doesn't change, the relationship between pressure and temperature is directly proportional, according to the ideal gas law. That is, if temperature increases, pressure increases, and vice versa, assuming volume is constant.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The average speed of the molecules increases.\n\nWe know that the average speed of gas molecules is related to the temperature. Specifically, the root mean square speed (\\(v_{rms}\\)) is given by \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{3kT}{m}}\\), where \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant, \\(T\\) is temperature, and \\(m\\) is the mass of a molecule. So, as temperature increases, the average speed of the molecules increases. Therefore, statement A is true.\n\nB. The pressure increases.\n\nAs we've established from the ideal gas law, if temperature increases while volume remains constant, pressure should increase. So, statement B is true.\n\nC. The kinetic energy of the system increases.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a gas is related to its temperature. The average kinetic energy per molecule is \\(\\frac{3}{2}kT\\). Therefore, as temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the system increases. So, statement C is true.\n\nD. The volume increases.\n\nBut wait, this is an isochoric process, which means the volume is constant. So, the volume does not change; it does not increase. Therefore, statement D is NOT true.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider what happens in an isochoric process. Since the volume is constant, any change in temperature directly affects the pressure, as per the ideal gas law. The kinetic energy and molecular speeds are directly related to temperature, so they increase as temperature increases. Volume, however, remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true is D: The volume increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
