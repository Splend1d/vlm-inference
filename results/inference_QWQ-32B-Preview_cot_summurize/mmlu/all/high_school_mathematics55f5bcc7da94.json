                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a point (x, y) is randomly picked from inside a rectangle with vertices at (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), and (0,2). I need to find the probability that x is less than y. The options are 1/12, 1/6, 2/3, and 1/3. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the rectangle. It's a rectangle on the xy-plane with a width of 3 units (from x=0 to x=3) and a height of 2 units (from y=0 to y=2). So, the area of the rectangle is 3 times 2, which is 6 square units. That makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that x < y for a point (x, y) inside this rectangle. Probability is generally the ratio of the favorable area to the total area. So, in this case, it's the area where x < y divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nLet me try to figure out where x < y within the rectangle. If I plot the line x = y, that would be a diagonal line where x equals y. But in this rectangle, since x goes up to 3 and y goes up to 2, the line x = y will cut through the rectangle.\n\nWait a minute, if x can be up to 3 and y up to 2, then the line x = y will only be relevant where y = x and x is less than or equal to 2, because beyond that, y can't be more than 2.\n\nLet me sketch this out. The rectangle has corners at (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), and (0,2). The line x = y will start at (0,0) and go up to (2,2), because at x=2, y=2, and then for x > 2, y can't exceed 2.\n\nSo, the region where x < y would be above the line x = y within the rectangle.\n\nLet me see: for x between 0 and 2, y can be from x to 2. And for x between 2 and 3, y can be from 0 to 2, but in this region, x is always greater than y because x is at least 2 and y is at most 2.\n\nWait, no. When x is greater than 2, y can be up to 2, so x can be greater than y only if y is less than x. But since y max is 2 and x is between 2 and 3, x can be greater than y only if y is less than x.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think differently.\n\nMaybe I can find the area where x < y and then divide it by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nThe total area is 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nNow, the area where x < y: that's the region above the line x = y within the rectangle.\n\nFrom x = 0 to x = 2, the line x = y is within the rectangle, and from x = 2 to x = 3, the line x = y is outside the rectangle because y can't be greater than 2.\n\nSo, the area where x < y is the area above the line x = y from x = 0 to x = 2, and within the rectangle.\n\nThat would be a triangular region from (0,0) to (2,2), but since y can't exceed 2, it's a right triangle with base 2 and height 2.\n\nThe area of this triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that x < y is the favorable area divided by the total area, which is 2 / 6 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1/3.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider integrating over the region where x < y within the rectangle.\n\nThe total area is 6, as before.\n\nThe area where x < y: for x from 0 to 2, y goes from x to 2.\n\nSo, the integral would be \u222b from x=0 to x=2 \u222b from y=x to y=2 dy dx.\n\nThat's \u222b from 0 to 2 (2 - x) dx = [2x - (1/2)x^2] from 0 to 2 = (4 - 2) - (0 - 0) = 2.\n\nAgain, that's 2 square units.\n\nDivided by the total area of 6, that's 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for x > 2, y can be from 0 to 2, but in this region, x is always greater than y because y max is 2 and x is up to 3.\n\nSo, no part of the region where x > 2 contributes to x < y.\n\nTherefore, the only contribution is from the triangle where x < y, which is 2 square units, giving a probability of 1/3.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the line x = y divides the rectangle into two regions: one where x < y and one where x > y.\n\nBut because the rectangle is not square, these regions are not equal in area.\n\nIn a square rectangle, say from (0,0) to (2,2), the regions would be equal, each with area 2, giving probability 1/2.\n\nBut here, the rectangle is longer in the x-direction, so the region where x < y is smaller.\n\nIndeed, getting 1/3 makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1/3.\n\nLooking back at the options: A. 1/12, B. 1/6, C. 2/3, D. 1/3.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
