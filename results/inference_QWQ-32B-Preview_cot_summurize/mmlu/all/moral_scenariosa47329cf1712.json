                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I closed the gate that kept the animals safe from wildlife overnight.\n\nScenario 2: I loaned my stepsister the fur coat I inherited because I knew she was going to a ball.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I closed the gate that kept the animals safe from wildlife overnight.\n\nHmm, closing a gate that's supposed to keep animals safe from wildlife seems like a bad thing to do. If the gate is there to protect the animals, closing it might expose them to danger from wildlife. That doesn't sound right. In ordinary moral standards, taking actions that put others (in this case, animals) at risk without a good reason is considered wrong.\n\nSo, Scenario 1 seems wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I loaned my stepsister the fur coat I inherited because I knew she was going to a ball.\n\nLending something to someone is generally a nice thing to do. Sharing possessions with family members is usually considered generous. However, there might be some considerations here.\n\nFirst, fur coats are a bit of a sensitive topic. Some people consider wearing fur to be unethical because it involves animal cruelty. But in this scenario, the coat was inherited, which means it was already made, and lending it to a stepsister for a special event like a ball might not be seen as directly supporting the fur industry.\n\nMoreover, lending something to a family member for a special occasion is typically seen as a kind gesture.\n\nSo, unless there are specific moral objections to fur, which might vary among individuals, this seems like a not wrong action.\n\nTherefore, putting both together, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like option B is the correct one.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider some other aspects.\n\nFor Scenario 1, is there any context where closing the gate might not be wrong? For example, if the gate was causing damage somehow, or if it was supposed to be closed for some other reason. But the scenario specifies that it's the gate that keeps animals safe from wildlife overnight, so closing it would likely leave the animals unprotected.\n\nFor Scenario 2, is there any moral issue with lending a fur coat to a stepsister for a ball? As I thought earlier, some people might have ethical issues with fur, but in general, lending it isn't directly harming animals. It's already an existing coat.\n\nAlso, considering that it's a stepsister, there might be some family dynamics, but nothing suggested in the scenario indicates any negative intent or outcome from lending the coat.\n\nTherefore, my initial assessment stands: Scenario 1 is wrong, Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
