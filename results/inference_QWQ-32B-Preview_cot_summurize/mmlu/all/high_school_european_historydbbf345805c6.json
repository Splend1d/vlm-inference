                    "text": "Let's see what this passage is about. It's talking about the Paris Exposition of 1889 and how it was a big deal for studying \"the natural history of man.\" That sounds like anthropology to me. The text mentions various places and institutions in Paris where anthropological studies were happening, like the Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, which are related to physical anthropology, and the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, which suggests cultural or social anthropology.\n\nSo, the field being described here is anthropology, specifically perhaps both physical and cultural anthropology. The passage highlights that during this time, there were many opportunities for anthropologists to study and conduct research in Paris, especially during the Exposition and the congresses held there.\n\nNow, the question is asking when this field was born, and it provides four options. Let's look at each one:\n\nA. Scientific societies needed new ways of attracting members who were less interested in the study of the natural world.\n\nThis seems a bit off. Anthropology is very much a study of the natural world, particularly human biology and culture. So, if anything, it's more interested in the natural world, not less.\n\nB. There arose a sudden interest in expanding human rights throughout the French colonies.\n\nWhile colonialism did play a role in the development of anthropology, especially in terms of studying other cultures, the primary motivation seems more related to scientific curiosity and understanding human diversity rather than expanding human rights. In fact, some might argue that early anthropology was used to justify colonialism rather than to expand human rights.\n\nC. Scientific principles were applied to other cultures as a result of the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe.\n\nThis option seems promising. The expansion of European empires brought Europeans into contact with a wide variety of cultures and peoples. This exposure naturally led to curiosity and the desire to study these different groups scientifically. So, applying scientific principles to study other cultures became possible and prevalent as European dominance spread.\n\nD. A large influx of immigrants from Africa and Asia arrived in Europe.\n\nWhile immigration did bring diverse cultures to Europe, which could have stimulated anthropological interest, the passage seems more focused on the study of other cultures in their native contexts rather than within Europe. Additionally, the Paris Exposition and the mention of French colonies suggest that the focus was on studying peoples outside of Europe.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to best describe the birth of the field mentioned in the passage. The expansion of European dominance allowed for and stimulated the application of scientific principles to the study of other cultures, which is essentially what anthropology is about.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
