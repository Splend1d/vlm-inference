The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I applied at the bank because I'm experienced in passing fake bills.\n\nScenario 2: I trained my enormous dog to shake hands with people.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Applying at a bank because I'm experienced in passing fake bills. Hmm, passing fake bills is definitely illegal and most people would consider that morally wrong because it's fraud, deceiving others for personal gain. Applying for a job at a bank with that experience suggests that I might use that skill there, which could imply intentions to commit fraud or money laundering. That seems problematic ethically and legally.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Training my enormous dog to shake hands with people. Well, training a dog to shake hands is a common trick. It's usually seen as positive, showing that the owner is responsible and cares about training their pet. Unless there's some context suggesting harm or distress to the dog, this seems fine. In fact, it might even be considered a positive thing, as it shows the dog is well-trained and socialized.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that Scenario 2 could be seen as morally wrong? Maybe if the dog is enormous and scares people, but the scenario doesn't specify that the dog is aggressive or causing harm. It just says the dog is enormous and trained to shake hands. So, without any harm being done, it's probably not morally wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 1 is clearly involving deceit and potential fraud, which are both against the law and generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
