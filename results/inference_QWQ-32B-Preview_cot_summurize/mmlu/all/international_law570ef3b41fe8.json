I know a bit about this, but I need to make sure I get it right.\n\nOption A says that the Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. I think that's right. I remember that the Human Rights Act basically brings the rights and freedoms protected by the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, so that people can enforce them in UK courts without having to go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. So, that sounds correct.\n\nOption B says that the Human Rights Act allows a court to invalidate primary legislation. Hmm, I think that's not entirely accurate. From what I know, under the Human Rights Act, courts cannot actually strike down or invalidate primary legislation. What they can do is make a 'declaration of incompatibility.' That means they can say that a particular piece of primary legislation doesn't comply with the Human Rights Act, but the law remains on the books until Parliament chooses to change it. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption C states that the Human Rights Act allows any person with a reasonable case to bring a case before a court. I think this is somewhat vague. In reality, the Human Rights Act does allow individuals to bring claims in UK courts if they believe their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights have been breached by public authorities. But it's not just any person with any reasonable case; it has to be related to their rights under the Convention and usually involves some interaction with a public authority. So, while there's some truth to it, it's perhaps not precise enough.\n\nOption D says that the Human Rights Act incorporates the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights into UK law. I don't think that's correct. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is a different document from the European Convention on Human Rights. The Human Rights Act specifically incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights, not the EU Charter. The EU Charter has its own status and applies within the context of EU law.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think option A is the correct statement. The Human Rights Act 1998 does indeed incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
