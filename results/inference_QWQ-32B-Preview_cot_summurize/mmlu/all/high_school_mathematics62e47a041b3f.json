                    "text": "So I have this problem where a person walks in different directions, and I need to find out how far they are from the starting point. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, the person walks 3 miles to the east. Then, they turn north and walk 10 miles. After that, they turn west and walk 6 miles. Finally, they turn south and walk 16 miles. I need to find the straight-line distance from their final position back to the starting point.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to plot their path on a coordinate grid. Let's assume the starting point is at the origin, (0,0).\n\n1. Walking 3 miles east means moving 3 units to the right on the x-axis. So, the new position is (3,0).\n\n2. Then, turning north and walking 10 miles means moving up 10 units on the y-axis. So, from (3,0), they move to (3,10).\n\n3. Next, turning west and walking 6 miles means moving left 6 units on the x-axis. From (3,10), they move to (3-6,10) = (-3,10).\n\n4. Finally, turning south and walking 16 miles means moving down 16 units on the y-axis. From (-3,10), they move to (-3,10-16) = (-3,-6).\n\nNow, their final position is at (-3,-6). I need to find the distance from this point back to the starting point (0,0).\n\nI recall that the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in a plane is given by the formula:\n\nDistance = \u221a[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\nDistance = \u221a[(-3 - 0)^2 + (-6 - 0)^2] = \u221a[( -3)^2 + ( -6)^2] = \u221a[9 + 36] = \u221a45\n\nNow, \u221a45 is the exact distance, but the problem asks for an approximate value. So, I need to calculate the numerical value of \u221a45.\n\nI know that \u221a45 can be simplified because 45 = 9 * 5, and \u221a(9*5) = \u221a9 * \u221a5 = 3\u221a5.\n\nBut to get a decimal approximation, I need to know the value of \u221a5. I remember that \u221a5 is approximately 2.236.\n\nSo, 3\u221a5 \u2248 3 * 2.236 = 6.708.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3.4\n\nB. 6.7\n\nC. 9.2\n\nD. 12.8\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 6.7 miles, so the answer should be B. 6.7.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\n1. East 3 miles: (3,0)\n\n2. North 10 miles: (3,10)\n\n3. West 6 miles: (-3,10)\n\n4. South 16 miles: (-3,-6)\n\nFinal position: (-3,-6)\n\nDistance from (0,0) to (-3,-6):\n\n\u221a[(-3)^2 + (-6)^2] = \u221a[9 + 36] = \u221a45 \u2248 6.708\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total displacement in the east-west and north-south directions.\n\nEast-west: started by walking 3 miles east, then 6 miles west. So, net displacement is 3 - 6 = -3 miles (west).\n\nNorth-south: walked 10 miles north, then 16 miles south. Net displacement is 10 - 16 = -6 miles (south).\n\nSo, the person is 3 miles west and 6 miles south of the starting point. The straight-line distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 3 and 6 miles.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem: distance = \u221a(3^2 + 6^2) = \u221a(9 + 36) = \u221a45 \u2248 6.7 miles.\n\nYes, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nI think the answer is B. 6.7 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 6.7} \\]"
