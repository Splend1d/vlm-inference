                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character did something morally wrong in each one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person put a pie in the oven for 35 minutes. Is there anything wrong with that? Well, baking a pie is a normal activity. Maybe they're making dinner or a dessert. There doesn't seem to be any moral issue here unless, perhaps, they borrowed the pie from someone without asking, but the scenario doesn't say that. So, it appears to be just a regular action without any moral wrongdoing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person watered their neighbor's lawn once because the neighbor paid them for the whole summer while he was away. Again, is there anything morally wrong with this? The neighbor paid for a service, and the person provided that service\u2014watering the lawn once. It seems like a straightforward transaction. Maybe the neighbor expected the lawn to be watered more frequently, but again, the scenario doesn't provide that information. Based on what's given, it seems like the person did what they were paid to do, even if it was just once.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither of these scenarios seems to involve any clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
