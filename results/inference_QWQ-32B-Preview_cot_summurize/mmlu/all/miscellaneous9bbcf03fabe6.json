So, the correct answer is D. four.\n\nHere's a bit more detail: In baseball, a pitcher throws pitches to a batter, and the umpire calls each pitch either a ball or a strike. A ball is a pitch that is outside the strike zone and that the batter doesn't swing at. A strike is a pitch that's within the strike zone, or that the batter swings at and misses, or that the batter hits into foul territory.\n\nIf a batter accumulates four balls before accumulating three strikes, they're awarded first base, which is called a base on balls or a walk. Conversely, if they accumulate three strikes, they're out.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question, four balls make a walk.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
