This seems like a thoughtful and considerate action. Assuming that the patron did indeed prefer decaf and the main character had knowledge of this preference, there doesn't appear to be any moral wrongdoing here. It's likely that the patron would appreciate the effort to accommodate their preference.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character raids a female dormitory for panties in the middle of the night. This scenario involves several red flags from a moral perspective. First, entering a dormitory without permission is a violation of privacy and potentially trespassing, which is illegal. Second, taking items, especially personal belongings like underwear, without consent is theft. Additionally, the gendered nature of the act and the fact that it's done in the middle of the night suggests a lack of respect for the individuals whose space is being invaded.\n\nConsidering these points, Scenario 1 appears to be morally acceptable, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
