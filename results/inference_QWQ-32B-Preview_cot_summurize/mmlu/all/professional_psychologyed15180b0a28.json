                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about self-instructional training for impulsive children and what it involves. So, first off, I need to understand what self-instructional training is. I think it's a type of cognitive-behavioral technique where children are taught to talk themselves through tasks, kind of like giving themselves internal instructions to guide their behavior.\n\nNow, the question is asking which option best describes how this training helps impulsive children. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"attend better to tasks by writing down their lesson objectives in advance.\" Hmm, writing down objectives can certainly help with organization and focus, but self-instructional training is more about verbalizing thoughts and guiding behavior through self-talk. Writing things down is a part of it, but it seems like this option is focusing more on the writing aspect rather than the self-instructional talking.\n\nOption B says: \"change their self-statements to increase their task-oriented behavior.\" This sounds more aligned with what I think self-instructional training is about. It involves modifying the way children think or talk to themselves, which in turn affects their behavior. So, if they can change their self-statements to be more task-focused, that should help reduce impulsivity and improve task orientation.\n\nOption C says: \"focus their thoughts on mood-elevating cognitions.\" While improving mood can be a beneficial side effect, I don't think this is the primary goal of self-instructional training for impulsive children. The main aim is to help them manage their behavior and stay on task, not necessarily to elevate their mood.\n\nOption D says: \"use programmed instructions to shape adaptive behavior gradually.\" Programmed instructions sound like a type of behavioral therapy where tasks are broken down into small steps, and reinforcement is used to shape behavior over time. While this might be related, it seems more behaviorally focused rather than cognitively focused like self-instructional training.\n\nComparing all these options, option B seems to best capture the essence of self-instructional training. It's about changing internal self-talk to influence external behavior, specifically to make them more task-oriented.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any other options could also be correct. Option A, while it involves planning and organization, seems more like a behavioral strategy rather than a self-instructional one. Option C is more about emotional regulation, which, again, isn't the primary focus here. Option D sounds like a behavioral intervention, not specifically cognitive.\n\nTherefore, I believe option B is the most accurate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
