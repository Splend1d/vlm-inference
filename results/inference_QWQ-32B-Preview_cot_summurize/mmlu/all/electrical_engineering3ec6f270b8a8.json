The options are resolution, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. I think it might be sensitivity, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nResolution is the smallest change in the input that causes a detectable change in the output. So, it's about how finely the instrument can distinguish between different values.\n\nAccuracy is how close the measured value is to the true or accepted value. It's about the correctness of the measurement.\n\nPrecision is about the reproducibility of the measurement. If you take multiple measurements under the same conditions, precision refers to how close those measurements are to each other.\n\nSensitivity is the ratio of the change in output to the change in input. It tells you how much the output changes in response to a small change in the input.\n\nSo, the question is asking for the smallest change in the measured variable that the instrument will respond to. That sounds a lot like sensitivity. Sensitivity is about how much the instrument responds to a small change in the input.\n\nBut wait, resolution also seems related because it's about the smallest detectable change. So, what's the difference between resolution and sensitivity?\n\nResolution is more about the instrument's ability to distinguish between two close values, whereas sensitivity is about how much the output changes in response to a change in input.\n\nMaybe I need to look up the definitions to be sure.\n\nAccording to my notes, resolution is the smallest change in stimulus that produces a detectable change in the output. Sensitivity is the ratio of the change in output to the change in input.\n\nSo, resolution is about the smallest detectable change, and sensitivity is about the relationship between changes in input and output.\n\nIn this case, the question is about the smallest change in the measured variable that the instrument will respond to, which seems to align more with resolution.\n\nBut sensitivity is also related because it describes how responsive the instrument is to changes in the input.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the options again.\n\nA. resolution: the smallest change in input that causes a detectable change in output.\n\nB. accuracy: how close the measurement is to the true value.\n\nC. precision: the reproducibility of the measurement.\n\nD. sensitivity: the ratio of change in output to change in input.\n\nGiven that, it seems like resolution is the most appropriate term for the smallest change in measured variable that the instrument will respond to.\n\nAccuracy and precision don't really relate to the instrument's ability to detect small changes; they're more about the correctness and reproducibility of the measurements.\n\nSensitivity is related, but it's more about the magnitude of the response to a change, not necessarily the smallest detectable change.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. resolution.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I should check a reference or think of an example.\n\nSuppose I have a digital scale that measures weight. The smallest division on the scale is 1 gram. So, the resolution would be 1 gram, meaning it can detect changes as small as 1 gram.\n\nIf I add an object that weighs 0.5 grams, the scale might not show a change because it's below the resolution limit.\n\nSimilarly, in a thermometer, if the smallest division is 0.1 degrees, then the resolution is 0.1 degrees.\n\nSo, in general, resolution defines the instrument's ability to detect small changes in the measured variable.\n\nSensitivity, on the other hand, would describe how much the output (like the deflection on a pointer or the numerical display) changes in response to a change in temperature.\n\nFor example, a thermometer with a sensitivity of 10 units per degree would show a larger deflection for a given temperature change than one with a sensitivity of 5 units per degree.\n\nBut the smallest change it can detect would still be related to its resolution.\n\nTherefore, in the context of the question, which is about the smallest change the instrument can respond to, resolution seems to be the correct term.\n\nI think option A is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
