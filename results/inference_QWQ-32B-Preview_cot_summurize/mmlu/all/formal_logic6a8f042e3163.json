                    "text": "So I've got this logic problem here, and I need to construct truth tables for two propositions and then figure out if they're logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent. The propositions are:\n\n1. \\( C \\supset (D \\lor C) \\)\n\n2. \\( C \\cdot \\sim D \\)\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what these logical connectives mean.\n\n- \\( \\supset \\) is the material implication, which is false only when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.\n\n- \\( \\lor \\) is the disjunction, which is true if at least one of the operands is true.\n\n- \\( \\cdot \\) is the conjunction, which is true only if both operands are true.\n\n- \\( \\sim \\) is negation, which flips the truth value of the operand.\n\nSo, to construct the truth tables, I need to evaluate both propositions for all possible combinations of truth values for C and D. Since there are two variables, there will be 4 rows in the truth table: TT, TF, FT, FF for C and D respectively.\n\nLet me list the truth values for C and D:\n\n1. C = T, D = T\n\n2. C = T, D = F\n\n3. C = F, D = T\n\n4. C = F, D = F\n\nNow, let's evaluate the first proposition: \\( C \\supset (D \\lor C) \\)\n\nFirst, I need to find the value of \\( D \\lor C \\) for each row, and then see if C implies that value.\n\nRow 1:\n\n- C = T, D = T\n\n- \\( D \\lor C \\) = T \u2228 T = T\n\n- \\( C \\supset (D \\lor C) \\) = T \u2283 T = T\n\nRow 2:\n\n- C = T, D = F\n\n- \\( D \\lor C \\) = F \u2228 T = T\n\n- \\( C \\supset (D \\lor C) \\) = T \u2283 T = T\n\nRow 3:\n\n- C = F, D = T\n\n- \\( D \\lor C \\) = T \u2228 F = T\n\n- \\( C \\supset (D \\lor C) \\) = F \u2283 T = T\n\nRow 4:\n\n- C = F, D = F\n\n- \\( D \\lor C \\) = F \u2228 F = F\n\n- \\( C \\supset (D \\lor C) \\) = F \u2283 F = T\n\nSo, for the first proposition, in all four rows, the value is T.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the second proposition: \\( C \\cdot \\sim D \\)\n\nRow 1:\n\n- C = T, D = T\n\n- \\( \\sim D \\) = ~T = F\n\n- \\( C \\cdot \\sim D \\) = T \u00b7 F = F\n\nRow 2:\n\n- C = T, D = F\n\n- \\( \\sim D \\) = ~F = T\n\n- \\( C \\cdot \\sim D \\) = T \u00b7 T = T\n\nRow 3:\n\n- C = F, D = T\n\n- \\( \\sim D \\) = ~T = F\n\n- \\( C \\cdot \\sim D \\) = F \u00b7 F = F\n\nRow 4:\n\n- C = F, D = F\n\n- \\( \\sim D \\) = ~F = T\n\n- \\( C \\cdot \\sim D \\) = F \u00b7 T = F\n\nSo, for the second proposition, it's true only in row 2, where C is T and D is F.\n\nNow, I need to compare these two columns to see if they're logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent.\n\nFirst, logical equivalence means that the two propositions have the same truth value in every possible scenario. Looking at the truth tables:\n\n- Row 1: First prop = T, Second prop = F \u2192 not equal\n\n- Row 2: First prop = T, Second prop = T \u2192 equal\n\n- Row 3: First prop = T, Second prop = F \u2192 not equal\n\n- Row 4: First prop = T, Second prop = F \u2192 not equal\n\nSince they're not equal in all rows, they're not logically equivalent.\n\nNext, contradiction means that the two propositions have opposite truth values in every possible scenario. Looking at the truth tables:\n\n- Row 1: First prop = T, Second prop = F \u2192 opposite\n\n- Row 2: First prop = T, Second prop = T \u2192 same\n\n- Row 3: First prop = T, Second prop = F \u2192 opposite\n\n- Row 4: First prop = T, Second prop = F \u2192 opposite\n\nThey're not opposite in all rows, so they're not contradictory.\n\nNow, consistency means that there is at least one row where both propositions are true. Looking at the truth tables:\n\n- Row 1: First prop = T, Second prop = F \u2192 not both true\n\n- Row 2: First prop = T, Second prop = T \u2192 both true\n\n- Row 3: First prop = T, Second prop = F \u2192 not both true\n\n- Row 4: First prop = T, Second prop = F \u2192 not both true\n\nYes, in row 2, both propositions are true, so they are consistent.\n\nInconsistency would mean that there is no row where both are true, but since there is row 2 where both are true, they are not inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. The question says: \"If neither, determine whether they are consistent or inconsistent.\"\n\nWe've determined they are neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, and then determined they are consistent because there is at least one row where both are true.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is C. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
