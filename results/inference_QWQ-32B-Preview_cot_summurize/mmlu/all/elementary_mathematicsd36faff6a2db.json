                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: the original price of a new bicycle is $138.00, and it's marked down by 15%. I need to find the new price after the markdown. The options are A. $20.70, B. $117.30, C. $123.00, and D. $153.00.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a markdown means. A markdown is a reduction in price, so if something is marked down by 15%, that means 15% of the original price is being subtracted from the original price to get the new price.\n\nSo, the new price should be the original price minus 15% of the original price.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNew Price = Original Price - (15% of Original Price)\n\nI know that 15% is the same as 15/100 or 0.15 in decimal form.\n\nSo, New Price = $138.00 - (0.15 \u00d7 $138.00)\n\nFirst, I'll calculate 0.15 times $138.00.\n\n0.15 \u00d7 138 = ?\n\nWell, 0.10 times 138 is 13.8, and 0.05 times 138 is half of that, which is 6.9. So, 13.8 plus 6.9 is 20.7.\n\nSo, 0.15 \u00d7 138 = $20.70.\n\nNow, subtract that from the original price:\n\n$138.00 - $20.70 = $117.30.\n\nSo, the new price is $117.30.\n\nLooking back at the options, B is $117.30, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate what percentage of the original price you're actually paying after the markdown.\n\nIf the markdown is 15%, that means you're paying 100% - 15% = 85% of the original price.\n\nSo, New Price = 85% of Original Price\n\nWhich is 0.85 \u00d7 $138.00.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.85 \u00d7 138 = ?\n\n0.80 times 138 is 110.4, and 0.05 times 138 is 6.9. So, 110.4 plus 6.9 is 117.3.\n\nSo, again, $117.30.\n\nThis confirms my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if $117.30 is indeed the correct new price by seeing if the difference between the original and new price is 15% of the original.\n\nOriginal price: $138.00\n\nNew price: $117.30\n\nDifference: $138.00 - $117.30 = $20.70\n\nNow, is $20.70 equal to 15% of $138.00?\n\nWell, 15% of $138.00 is $20.70, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is indeed 15% of the original price, which confirms that the new price is correctly calculated.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula:\n\nNew Price = Original Price \u00d7 (1 - markdown percentage)\n\nSo, New Price = $138.00 \u00d7 (1 - 0.15) = $138.00 \u00d7 0.85 = $117.30\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nIs there any chance that the markdown could be applied differently, like perhaps on sale price or something? But the problem says it's marked down 15%, which typically means directly off the original price.\n\nAlso, checking the options:\n\nA. $20.70 is the amount of the markdown, not the new price.\n\nB. $117.30 is what I calculated as the new price.\n\nC. $123.00 is higher than the original price, which doesn't make sense for a markdown.\n\nD. $153.00 is even higher; that would be a price increase, not a markdown.\n\nSo, option B makes the most sense.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The new price after a 15% markdown on a $138.00 bicycle is $117.30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
