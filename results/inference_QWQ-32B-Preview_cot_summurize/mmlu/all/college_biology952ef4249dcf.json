There are different types of them, each with their own special roles.\n\nThe question is asking about a specific type of immunoglobulin that has something called epsilon heavy chains and is found on the surfaces of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes. It's asking which class of antibodies this belongs to.\n\nLet me recall what I know about immunoglobulin classes. There are several classes: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE. Each one has different characteristics and functions.\n\nIgG is the most common type and is found in all body fluids. IgA is found in mucous membranes and helps protect entry points like the mouth and nose. IgM is usually the first to respond to a new infection. IgD's function isn't entirely clear, but it's thought to be involved in triggering B-cell activation. And IgE is associated with allergic reactions and protection against parasites.\n\nNow, the question mentions epsilon heavy chains. I think epsilon is specific to IgE. I recall that each class of immunoglobulin has a unique type of heavy chain: alpha for IgA, gamma for IgG, mu for IgM, delta for IgD, and epsilon for IgE.\n\nAlso, it mentions that these immunoglobulins are located on the plasma membranes of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes. I know that mast cells and basophils are cells involved in allergic reactions and inflammation. IgE is known to bind to these cells, causing them to release histamine and other mediators when triggered.\n\nSo, putting it all together, immunoglobulins with epsilon heavy chains found on mast cells and basophils should be IgE.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is IgA. IgA is more associated with mucous membranes and doesn't have epsilon chains.\n\nOption C is IgD. IgD has delta heavy chains, not epsilon.\n\nOption D is IgM. IgM has mu heavy chains.\n\nSo, none of these match the description given in the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. IgE.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
