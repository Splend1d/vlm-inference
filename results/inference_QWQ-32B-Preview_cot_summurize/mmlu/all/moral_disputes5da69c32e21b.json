Kass likely worries that cloned individuals will be seen as curiosities and also that they will be scrutinized in relation to the person they are clones of. Cloning raises a lot of ethical questions, and one of the concerns is how society will treat cloned individuals. If they are treated as mere copies or curiosities, that could lead to a lot of problems. Additionally, being compared constantly to the original person could put a lot of pressure on the cloned individual and affect their sense of identity and autonomy. So, both A and B seem like valid worries for Kass."
