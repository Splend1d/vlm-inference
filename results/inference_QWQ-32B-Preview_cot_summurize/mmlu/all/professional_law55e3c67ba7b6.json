The high school was severely damaged and needed to be rebuilt. As a consequence, the city council held an emergency meeting to determine what measures should be taken to locate an appropriate alternative facility in which to conduct classes. Thereupon, the city council passed the following resolution: \"During restoration of the high school building, classes shall be conducted at the most suitable facility which submits the lowest bid. In determining a \u0080\u0098suitable' facility, the city council shall consider such factors as location and available classroom space. \"Several bids were submitted. The lowest bid was submitted by a church. The church was located on the same block as the high school and contained sufficient seating capacity for all students. In addition, there were a sufficient number of separate rooms to allow different classes to meet at the same time. The city council voted unanimously to accept the church's offer. Furthermore, the church agreed to remove all religious symbols and paraphernalia from the classrooms utilized by the students. Only the main chapel was exempt, so that it could remain open for prayer. No high school classes or activities were to be held in the main chapel. A parent of one of the high school students is upset at this arrangement. On his son's behalf, the parent has filed suit in federal district court to challenge the constitutionality of permitting public school classes to be held in a church. Judgment for whom?\n\nA. The city, because the classroom arrangement does not inhibit or advance religion.\nB. The city, because the church was the lowest bidder in accordance with the emergency ordinance.\nC. The plaintiff, because the present arrangement for conducting classes in a church-owned facility constitutes excessive entanglement with religion.\nD. The plaintiff, because the emergency measure was not necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n"

They decide to use the lowest bid from a suitable facility, and a church ends up being the lowest bidder. The church agrees to remove all religious stuff from the classrooms, except for the main chapel, which will stay as is for prayers, but no classes or activities will be held there.\n\nA parent is upset about this and is suing on behalf of their son, challenging the constitutionality of holding public school classes in a church. We need to figure out who should win the lawsuit: the city or the plaintiff.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal principles involved here, especially regarding the separation of church and state. The First Amendment has a clause about \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" which has been interpreted to mean that government institutions shouldn't be too closely tied to religious ones.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether allowing public school classes to be held in a church violates this establishment clause.\n\nOption A says the city wins because the classroom arrangement doesn't inhibit or advance religion. That sounds plausible, but I need to dig deeper.\n\nOption B also favors the city, but it focuses on the fact that the church was the lowest bidder in accordance with the emergency ordinance. While that might be true, I'm not sure if that alone makes it constitutional.\n\nOption C is for the plaintiff, arguing that this arrangement constitutes excessive entanglement with religion. Entanglement is a key concept in establishment clause cases.\n\nOption D also favors the plaintiff but mentions that the emergency measure wasn't necessary to further a compelling state interest. That sounds like it's related to strict scrutiny in constitutional law.\n\nLet me start by considering the Supreme Court's rulings on similar issues. In cases like Lemon v. Kurtzman, the Court established a test to determine whether a law violates the establishment clause. The Lemon test has three prongs:\n\n1. The statute must have a secular legislative purpose.\n\n2. Its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion.\n\n3. It must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.\n\nSo, applying this to the current situation:\n\n1. Secular legislative purpose: The city council's purpose was to find a temporary place for classes after the school burned down. That seems secular enough.\n\n2. Primary effect: The arrangement is to hold classes in a church, but with religious symbols removed from the classrooms. Only the chapel remains with religious artifacts, and it's not used for classes or activities. So, it might be argued that the primary effect doesn't advance or inhibit religion, since the classrooms are secular.\n\n3. Excessive entanglement: This is tricky. Having classes in a church does involve some level of interaction between the school and the church. But, since the church is just providing space and isn't involved in the educational content, maybe it's not excessive.\n\nHowever, in more recent cases, the Supreme Court has sometimes moved away from the Lemon test and toward other standards, like the coercion test or the endorsement test.\n\nFor example, in Agostini v. Felton, the Court modified the Lemon test, focusing more on whether the government aid is neutral and available to both religious and nonreligious groups.\n\nIn this case, the city council's resolution was to accept the lowest bid from a suitable facility, without specifying religious or nonreligious status. So, it seems neutral on its face.\n\nBut, in practice, a church was the lowest bidder. Now, is there a problem with that?\n\nAnother relevant case is School District of Abington Township v. Schempp, where the Court ruled that public schools cannot require students to participate in religious activities.\n\nIn this scenario, the church agrees to remove religious symbols from the classrooms, and no classes or activities are to be held in the chapel. So, it seems like they're trying to maintain a separation between religious and educational spaces.\n\nHowever, some might argue that just being in a church building could have a subtle religious influence, even if religious symbols are removed.\n\nOn the other hand, the city council was in an emergency situation and needed to find a temporary solution quickly. The church was the most suitable and cheapest option available.\n\nNow, considering the plaintiff's arguments, they might claim that having classes in a church entangles the government with religion too much, even if precautions are taken to keep religion out of the classrooms.\n\nAlternatively, they might argue that the city should have found a secular option, even if it cost more, to avoid any appearance of endorsing religion.\n\nBut, in emergencies, governments sometimes have to make tough choices and may need to use available resources, including religious facilities, for secular purposes.\n\nI recall that during natural disasters, schools and churches often open their doors as shelters for displaced people. In those cases, using a church as a shelter is generally accepted, even though it's a religious facility.\n\nSimilarly, here, the church is being used temporarily for its available space, with measures in place to keep religion separate from education.\n\nMoreover, the church agreed to remove all religious symbols and paraphernalia from the classrooms, which suggests they're making an effort to maintain a secular environment for the classes.\n\nOnly the chapel remains with religious items, and it's not being used for classes or activities. So, it's like having a secular space within a religious building, but with clear boundaries.\n\nBut, some might argue that the overall atmosphere of being in a church building could still have a religious impact, even if the classrooms themselves are secular.\n\nThis gets into somewhat subjective territory.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The city wins because the classroom arrangement doesn't inhibit or advance religion.\n\nThis seems plausible, given the measures taken to remove religious symbols and not use the chapel for classes.\n\nB. The city wins because the church was the lowest bidder in accordance with the emergency ordinance.\n\nWhile procedurally correct, this doesn't directly address the constitutional concerns.\n\nC. The plaintiff wins because the arrangement constitutes excessive entanglement with religion.\n\nThis is a strong argument, as using a church for public school classes does involve a significant relationship between government and religion.\n\nD. The plaintiff wins because the emergency measure wasn't necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n\nThis seems similar to arguing that the city shouldn't be allowed to use a religious facility even in an emergency, which might be a stretch.\n\nConsidering the Lemon test, the arrangement seems to have a secular purpose, and measures are in place to ensure that the primary effect isn't to advance or inhibit religion.\n\nAs for entanglement, while there is some entanglement, it might not be excessive, especially given the temporary nature of the arrangement and the precautions taken.\n\nMoreover, in emergencies, courts sometimes allow temporary measures that might not be permissible under normal circumstances.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the most appropriate: the city wins because the classroom arrangement doesn't inhibit or advance religion.\n\nOption C might be a close second, but given the steps taken to secularize the classrooms, I think the entanglement is minimized.\n\nOption D seems less convincing, as the city does have a compelling interest in providing education to its students, and in an emergency, temporary measures may be necessary.\n\nSo, my answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
