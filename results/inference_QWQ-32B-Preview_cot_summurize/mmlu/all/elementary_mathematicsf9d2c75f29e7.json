The problem says that the number of strawberries he ate is even, and the number of apples is odd. We need to look at the options provided and determine which one correctly represents this situation.\n\nFirst, let's recall what even and odd numbers are. An even number is any integer that is divisible by 2 without a remainder, like 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. An odd number is any integer that is not divisible by 2, so numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. SSSSS; AAA\n\nHere, SSSSS means 5 strawberries, and AAA means 3 apples. Is 5 an even number? No, 5 is odd. So this option is incorrect because the number of strawberries should be even.\n\nB. SSSSS; AAAA\n\nSSSSS is 5 strawberries, which is odd, and AAAA is 4 apples, which is even. But the problem says strawberries should be even and apples should be odd. So this doesn't match.\n\nC. SSSSSSSS; AAAA\n\nSSSSSSSS is 8 strawberries, which is even, and AAAA is 4 apples, which is even. But apples should be odd, so this is not correct.\n\nD. SSSSSSSS; A\n\nSSSSSSSS is 8 strawberries, which is even, and A is 1 apple, which is odd. This matches the condition: even number of strawberries and odd number of apples.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. Is there any other option where strawberries are even and apples are odd? Option A has strawberries as odd, B has both even and odd incorrect, C has strawberries even but apples even, and D has strawberries even and apples odd. Yes, only D matches the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
