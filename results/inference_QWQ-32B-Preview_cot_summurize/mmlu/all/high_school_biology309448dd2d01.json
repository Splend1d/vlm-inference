                    "text": "This question is about understanding the basic unit on which natural selection operates. Natural selection is a fundamental mechanism of evolution, and it's crucial to grasp what it acts upon directly.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. a species' gene frequency\n\nThis refers to the proportion of different alleles in an entire species. While changes in gene frequency over generations are a result of evolution, including natural selection, natural selection doesn't directly act on the species level. It operates at a more granular level.\n\nB. a population's gene frequency\n\nSimilar to option A, but focused on a population rather than the entire species. Populations are groups of interbreeding individuals of the same species. Evolutionary changes, including those driven by natural selection, are observed in populations over time. However, natural selection acts on individuals within populations based on their traits, not directly on gene frequencies.\n\nC. an individual's genome\n\nThe genome is the complete set of genetic material in an organism. While natural selection does influence which genomes are passed on to the next generation based on the traits they encode, it's not accurate to say that natural selection directly acts on the genome itself. Instead, it acts on the expression of that genome in the form of traits.\n\nD. an individual's phenotype\n\nThe phenotype is the set of observable characteristics of an individual, which are determined by its genotype (genome) and the environment. Natural selection acts on phenotypes because these are what interact with the environment and affect an organism's survival and reproduction.\n\nConsidering this, the smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts is the individual's phenotype. This is because natural selection favors traits that enhance survival and reproduction in a given environment, and these traits are part of the phenotype.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. an individual's phenotype.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
