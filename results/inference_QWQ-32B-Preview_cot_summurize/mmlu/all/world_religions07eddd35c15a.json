                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about a female poet from the eighth century CE who is worshipped in South Indian temples dedicated to Vishnu. The options are Andal, Devi, Ganga, and Kali. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I know that South Indian temples dedicated to Vishnu are likely to be Vaishnavite temples. So, the poet probably has a connection to Vaishnavism.\n\nLet me think about Andal. I've heard of Andal before; she's a well-known Alvar saint in Vaishnavism. The Alvars were a group of 12 poet-saints who lived mostly in Tamil Nadu and contributed to the development of Vaishnavism in South India. Andal is the only female among the Alvars. She is famous for her works \"Thiruppavai\" and \"Nacciyar Tirumozhi,\" which are collections of devotional poems dedicated to Lord Vishnu.\n\nSo, Andal seems like a strong candidate. But let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nDevi: Devi is a general term for goddess in Hinduism. There are many forms of Devi, representing different aspects of the divine feminine. However, I don't recall any specific poet named Devi from the eighth century who is worshipped in Vishnu temples.\n\nGanga: Ganga is the goddess of the Ganges River. While she is an important deity in Hinduism, I don't think she is known as a poet or is primarily worshipped in Vishnu temples.\n\nKali: Kali is another form of Devi, associated with time, change, power, and destruction. She is mainly worshipped in Shaktism, which is a different tradition from Vaishnavism. So, it's unlikely that she is worshipped in Vishnu temples for her poetry.\n\nGiven this information, Andal seems to be the most appropriate answer. She is a female poet from the eighth century CE, associated with Vaishnavism, and her works are revered in South Indian Vishnu temples.\n\nI should also note that Andal is often depicted in Vishnu temples, especially those dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his various forms, such as Ranganatha in Srirangam. Her devotion and poetry are central to the Vaishnavite tradition in Tamil Nadu.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is Andal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
