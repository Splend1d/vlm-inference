Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage by Calvin Coolidge and see what he's reacting against. So, Coolidge is talking about the importance of protecting people's rights to enjoy the fruits of their own labor and how taxation can be a form of taking away that right. He says that taxation should only be used when it's necessary for public policy and that excessive taxation is a sign of tyranny and the breakdown of free government.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of when this was said. Coolidge was the 30th President of the United States, serving from 1923 to 1929. His presidency was during the Roaring Twenties, a period of economic prosperity and social change. His approach to governance was marked by small government and limited federal intervention in the economy.\n\nOption A suggests that Coolidge is reacting against the economic policies of his predecessor, Warren G. Harding. Harding was known for his laissez-faire approach and for reducing taxes, which was continued by Coolidge. So, it's unlikely that Coolidge would be reacting against Harding's policies, as they were aligned.\n\nOption B mentions the growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, there was indeed a rise in socialist and communist ideas in the United States, which worried many politicians and business leaders. Coolidge, being a conservative, might have been concerned about these radical movements, but the passage doesn't directly address radical politics. It's more focused on taxation and government spending.\n\nOption C refers to populist agitation in the West. Populism was a significant movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the agricultural regions of the Midwest and West. Populists advocated for government intervention in the economy to help farmers and workers, often proposing higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. This seems relevant because Coolidge is emphasizing the right to keep one's earnings and warning against excessive taxation.\n\nOption D mentions the governmental policies of the Progressive Era. The Progressive Era, roughly from the 1890s to the 1920s, was characterized by reforms aimed at increasing democracy and government regulation of business. Progressives often supported higher taxes to fund social programs and regulate the economy. Coolidge, with his emphasis on limited government and low taxes, might be reacting against these Progressive policies.\n\nNow, considering the options, both C and D seem plausible. Populist agitation in the West and Progressive policies both advocated for more government intervention and potentially higher taxes, which Coolidge is arguing against in this passage.\n\nHowever, the passage specifically mentions that \"one of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\" This suggests that Coolidge is concerned about any movement that leads to increased taxation and government interference with personal property rights.\n\nGiven that the Progressive Era included policies that expanded government regulation and sometimes increased taxes for social purposes, and that populist movements in the West were pushing for similar measures, both could be targets of Coolidge's concerns.\n\nBut perhaps Progressive policies are a broader category that includes populist agitation in the West. Progressives were active across the country, not just in the West, and their influence extended beyond agricultural issues to urban reform, trust-busting, and social welfare programs.\n\nCoolidge, as a proponent of limited government, would likely see both populism and Progressivism as threats to individual liberty and property rights, but the question is asking for which one he is reacting against in this specific passage.\n\nLooking back at the passage, Coolidge emphasizes that the right to enjoy the rewards of one's own industry is fundamental, and that taxation should only be used for necessary public policy. He warns that excessive taxation is a sign of tyranny.\n\nThis aligns more closely with criticisms of Progressive policies, which often involved increased taxation to fund social programs and regulatory agencies. Progressives believed in using the government to address social and economic inequalities, which sometimes required higher taxes.\n\nPopulism in the West was also pushing for similar measures, but it was more localized and focused on specific issues like railroad regulation, monetary policy, and subsidies for farmers.\n\nGiven that Progressivism was a broader movement that encompassed various reform efforts at both the state and federal levels, and that it had a significant impact on federal policies, it might be more accurate to say that Coolidge is reacting against the governmental policies of the Progressive Era.\n\nMoreover, by the 1920s, the Progressive Era was giving way to a period of conservatism and laissez-faire economics, which Coolidge represented. Therefore, it makes sense that he would be reacting against the Progressive policies that he sought to reverse or limit.\n\nIn conclusion, while populist agitation in the West was certainly a factor, Coolidge's remarks seem more directed at the broader philosophical shift brought about by the Progressive Era, which advocated for a more active role of government in the economy and society, often through taxation and regulation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
