                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about radioactive decay. It says that the half-life of a substance is 8 years, and I need to find out how long it will take for two-thirds of the substance to decay. The options are A. 4.68, B. 7.69, C. 12.21, and D. 12.68 years. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what half-life means. Half-life is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. So, in this case, every 8 years, half of the remaining substance decays.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the time it takes for two-thirds of the substance to decay. That means, if I start with, say, 100 grams of the substance, I want to find out how long it takes until only one-third of it remains, because two-thirds have decayed.\n\nSo, if I start with amount \\( N_0 \\), after some time \\( t \\), the amount left is \\( N = N_0 \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^{t/t_{1/2}} \\), where \\( t_{1/2} \\) is the half-life.\n\nI need to find \\( t \\) when \\( N = \\frac{1}{3} N_0 \\).\n\nSo, setting up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} N_0 = N_0 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t/8}\n\\]\n\nI can cancel \\( N_0 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t/8}\n\\]\n\nNow, to solve for \\( t \\), I can take the natural logarithm of both sides.\n\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t/8}\\right)\n\\]\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, \\( \\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{t}{8} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\nt = 8 \\times \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate the natural logs.\n\nFirst, \\( \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\ln(1) - \\ln(3) = 0 - \\ln(3) = -\\ln(3) \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2) \\)\n\nSo, plugging back in:\n\n\\[\nt = 8 \\times \\frac{-\\ln(3)}{-\\ln(2)} = 8 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can calculate \\( \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)} \\). This is essentially \\( \\log_2(3) \\), which is approximately 1.58496.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nt = 8 \\times 1.58496 \\approx 12.6797 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nLooking at the options, D. 12.68 years is the closest to my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet's consider that after one half-life (8 years), half of the substance decays, so we have half left.\n\nAfter another half-life (16 years total), half of the remaining half decays, so we have a quarter left.\n\nBut the question is asking for two-thirds to decay, which means one-third remains.\n\nSo, is there a way to find the exact time between 8 and 16 years when the remaining amount is one-third?\n\nFrom my earlier calculation, \\( t = 8 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)} \\), which is approximately 12.68 years, which matches option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for exponential decay:\n\n\\[\nN(t) = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant.\n\nThe half-life is related to the decay constant by:\n\n\\[\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{8}\n\\]\n\nNow, set \\( N(t) = \\frac{1}{3} N_0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} N_0 = N_0 e^{- (\\ln(2)/8) t}\n\\]\n\nAgain, cancel \\( N_0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} = e^{- (\\ln(2)/8) t}\n\\]\n\nTake natural log of both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = - \\frac{\\ln(2)}{8} t\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\nt = - \\frac{8 \\ln(1/3)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{8 \\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx 12.68 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nSo, again, I get approximately 12.68 years.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 12.68 years.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if any of the other options make sense.\n\nOption A. 4.68 years:\n\nIf I plug t=4.68 into the equation:\n\n\\[\nN(t) = N_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4.68/8} \\approx N_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{0.585} \\approx N_0 \\times 0.687\n\\]\n\nSo, approximately 68.7% remains, which means about 31.3% has decayed, not two-thirds.\n\nOption B. 7.69 years:\n\n\\[\nN(t) = N_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{7.69/8} \\approx N_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{0.961} \\approx N_0 \\times 0.523\n\\]\n\nSo, about 52.3% remains, meaning about 47.7% has decayed, still not two-thirds.\n\nOption C. 12.21 years:\n\n\\[\nN(t) = N_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{12.21/8} \\approx N_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1.526} \\approx N_0 \\times 0.327\n\\]\n\nSo, about 32.7% remains, meaning about 67.3% has decayed, which is close to two-thirds, but not exact.\n\nOption D. 12.68 years:\n\n\\[\nN(t) = N_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{12.68/8} \\approx N_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1.585} \\approx N_0 \\times 0.333\n\\]\n\nSo, approximately 33.3% remains, meaning exactly two-thirds has decayed.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nIt's possible that option C is included to test if students round appropriately or make calculation errors, but the exact calculation leads to approximately 12.68 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
