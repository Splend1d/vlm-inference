Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about Martin Luther King Jr.'s letter from Birmingham Jail. The question is asking about a continuity in U.S. history based on the language in this passage. The options are debates over free speech, voting rights, federal power and states' rights, or debates over amending the Constitution.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the passage is saying. Martin Luther King Jr. is explaining why he's in Birmingham, even though he's from Atlanta. He says it's because injustice is there, and he can't ignore it. He talks about how all communities are interconnected and that injustice anywhere threatens justice everywhere. He emphasizes that no one can be an outsider in this country when it comes to fighting for justice.\n\nNow, thinking about the options:\n\nA. Debates over free speech. Well, King was certainly exercising his right to free speech by writing this letter and speaking out against injustice. But is that the main continuity here? Maybe, but let's look at the other options.\n\nB. Debates over voting rights. Voting rights were a big issue during King's time, especially leading up to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. However, in this passage, King doesn't specifically mention voting rights. He's talking more broadly about injustice and the interconnectedness of communities.\n\nC. Debates over federal power and states' rights. This seems relevant because during the civil rights movement, there was a lot of tension between the federal government and state governments, especially in the South, over enforcing civil rights laws. King mentions that injustice in one place affects everywhere else, which could relate to the idea of federal power being needed to override state laws that perpetuate injustice.\n\nD. Debates over the procedures of amending the Constitution. This seems less directly related to the passage. While constitutional amendments have been important in advancing civil rights, King doesn't mention amendments in this excerpt.\n\nConsidering these points, I think option C, debates over federal power and states' rights, is the best answer. King's argument that injustice anywhere threatens justice everywhere suggests a need for a broader, more unified approach to justice, which could imply a role for federal power in ensuring rights are protected across all states.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of being \"tied in a single garment of destiny\" indicates a national responsibility that goes beyond individual states' boundaries. This aligns with the idea that federal power should play a role in addressing issues that states may not adequately handle on their own.\n\nSo, I believe the continuity in U.S. history that this passage demonstrates is debates over federal power and states' rights.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
