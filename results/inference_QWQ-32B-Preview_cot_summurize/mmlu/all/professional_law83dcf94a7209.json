Most of the coastline is privately owned by persons who have permanent or vacation residences on their coastal lands. A man purchased a two-acre tract of littoral (i. e. , coastal) land in the state. When the man bought the property, there was a narrow concrete walkway (about 20 feet in length and 5 feet in width) adjoining the land. The walkway, which was designed to provide pedestrian access to the beach, was owned by the State Coastal Commission. When the man moved into his beach house, he noticed that the walkway was rarely used. As a result, the man decided to enclose the walkway and construct a paddle ball court over the entire area.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, we have a man who bought a two-acre tract of coastal land in a state on the eastern seaboard. Along with the land, there's a narrow concrete walkway that's owned by the State Coastal Commission, designed to provide pedestrian access to the beach. The man notices that the walkway is rarely used, so he decides to enclose it and build a paddle ball court over it without notifying the commission. He's been using this area for a period longer than what's required for adverse possession.\n\nNow, he's bringing an action to establish title to the walkway area. We need to figure out what he must establish to prevail in this lawsuit. The options are:\n\nA. Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.\n\nB. Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.\n\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\n\nD. Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.\n\nFirst, let's understand what adverse possession is. Adverse possession is a legal concept where a person can gain legal title to a property by occupying it for a certain period, which is defined by state law, and meeting certain conditions like open and notorious use, exclusive possession, and without the owner's permission.\n\nIn this case, the man has been using the walkway area for a period longer than required for adverse possession, and he's been using it exclusively for his paddle ball court. So, it seems like he might be trying to claim adverse possession.\n\nBut there's a catch: the property is owned by a governmental entity, the State Coastal Commission. Governments have special rules when it comes to property rights and adverse possession.\n\nOption A suggests that real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote. Abandonment is one of the elements of adverse possession, meaning that the original owner has abandoned the property, allowing the possessor to claim it. However, for governmental entities, abandonment might require a formal act or declaration, not just non-use.\n\nOption B states that lack of use by the state created an irrevocable license in him. A license is a temporary permission to use someone else's property, but it's revocable unless it's coupled with an interest. In this case, the man didn't have any permission to use the walkway; he just started using it. So, it's not really a license, irrevocable or otherwise.\n\nOption C says that real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession. This is the key point. Generally, governments have sovereign immunity, which protects them from certain legal actions and can also affect how their property rights are treated. In many jurisdictions, governments cannot lose property through adverse possession because of this immunity. However, some states have statutes that allow for adverse possession against the government under certain conditions.\n\nOption D proposes that there's a defect in the chain of title, meaning that the state doesn't actually own the land. If that's the case, then the man might be able to establish title through adverse possession or by finding that he has a better claim to the property.\n\nGiven that the man is bringing an action to establish title to the walkway area, he would need to show that he has met the requirements for adverse possession, despite the property being owned by the state.\n\nSo, looking back at the options:\n\nA is about abandonment without an official vote, which might be relevant, but it's not the main issue here.\n\nB is about creating an irrevocable license, which doesn't seem to apply since there was no license granted in the first place.\n\nC directly addresses whether the state can lose its property through adverse possession.\n\nD is about a defect in the chain of title, which isn't mentioned in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, the most directly relevant option is C: real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\n\nHowever, we need to consider whether this is actually possible. In many jurisdictions, governments are exempt from adverse possession claims due to sovereign immunity. But laws vary by state, and some states have enacted statutes that allow for adverse possession against the government under certain conditions.\n\nGiven that, the man would need to establish that, in this particular state, real property interests can indeed be lost by the state through adverse possession. If the state law allows for it, then he might succeed; otherwise, he probably won't.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. He must establish that real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
