Investigations into the consequences of state security policies showed that women were subject to masculine dominated war policies as the likely victims as casualties of war or as post conflict targets. Women are increasingly subject to violence as a product of social circumstance.\nB. Gendered consequences of security issues have not challenged international relations theory. Constructivist theories of the state were mainstreamed without undermining the ideas of state as the centre of military power, or as the highest organization of human community.\nC. Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles.\nD. The literature that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s was primarily concerned with the ways in which women had served the purposes of nationalist campaigns, focusing on the biological characteristics of women as sexually reproductive beings, and with little focus on critical analysis.\n"

                    "text": "I think the correct answer is C. Feminist and critical security theory have indeed expanded our understanding of gender security issues by highlighting that war has gendered consequences. This means that the impacts of war are different for men and women due to their respective social roles and expectations. By recognizing these differences, we can better address the specific needs and experiences of both men and women in conflict situations. This has also led to a rethinking of traditional notions of security and the roles that men and women play in warfare and peacebuilding.\n\nOption A is partially correct in stating that women are often victims of war and post-conflict violence, but it doesn't fully capture the broader impact of feminist and critical security studies. These studies go beyond just identifying women as victims; they challenge the very constructs of security and question why certain issues are considered security threats while others are not.\n\nOption B is incorrect because gendered consequences of security issues have indeed challenged international relations theory. Feminist scholars have critiqued the traditional state-centric approach and pushed for a more inclusive understanding of security that considers the experiences of all individuals, not just those in positions of power.\n\nOption D seems to describe some of the earlier feminist analyses from the 1980s and 1990s, but it doesn't accurately represent the full scope of the literature. Many feminist and critical security scholars during that period were engaged in critical analysis and were not merely focusing on biological characteristics. They were challenging the patriarchal structures that underpin security policies and practices.\n\nSo, overall, I believe option C is the most accurate reflection of how feminist and critical security investigations have expanded our understanding of gender security issues.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
