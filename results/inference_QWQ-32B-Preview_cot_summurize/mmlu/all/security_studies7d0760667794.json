This suggests that one limitation is the lack of clarity or agreement on what constitutes human rights and whether they are truly universal. Different cultures and societies may have varying interpretations of human rights, which can complicate the justification for intervention.\n\nOption B claims that advocates of humanitarian intervention exaggerate the global consensus on using force to protect human rights. This implies that there might not be as much international agreement on this issue as some proponents claim. In reality, there can be significant disagreements among nations about when and how to intervene militarily for humanitarian purposes.\n\nOption C states that any norm endorsing the use of force to protect individual rights could be abused by powerful states. This highlights a potential problem of power imbalance, where stronger countries might use the guise of humanitarian intervention to pursue their own interests or impose their will on weaker states.\n\nOption D says all of the above, meaning that all these limitations apply to the case for humanitarian intervention.\n\nConsidering these options, I think the best answer is D, as all three points\u2014uncertainty about universal human rights, exaggeration of global consensus, and the risk of abuse by powerful states\u2014present significant limitations to the case for humanitarian intervention.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
