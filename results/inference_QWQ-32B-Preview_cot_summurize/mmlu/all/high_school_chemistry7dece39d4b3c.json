                    "text": "So I need to figure out which of these reactions has the greatest decrease in entropy. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. Generally, gases have higher entropy than liquids, and liquids have higher entropy than solids because gas molecules are more spread out and have more freedom to move around.\n\nSo, I need to look at each reaction and see how the entropy changes from reactants to products.\n\nLet's start with option A:\n\nA. C(s) + CO2(g) \u2192 2 CO(g)\n\nHere, we have solid carbon and one molecule of carbon dioxide gas producing two molecules of carbon monoxide gas. Solids have low entropy, and gases have high entropy. So, going from one gas molecule to two gas molecules, entropy should increase because there are more gas molecules now.\n\nWait, but the question is about the greatest decrease in entropy, so this one seems like it's increasing entropy, not decreasing.\n\nOption B:\n\nB. 2 Na(s) + O2(g) \u2192 Na2O2(s)\n\nHere, we have two moles of solid sodium reacting with one mole of oxygen gas to produce one mole of solid sodium peroxide. So, reactants are two solids and one gas, and products are all solids. Gases have higher entropy than solids, so removing the gas and forming more solids would decrease entropy.\n\nThis seems promising for a decrease in entropy.\n\nOption C:\n\nC. CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nIn this reaction, methane gas reacts with two molecules of oxygen gas to produce one molecule of carbon dioxide gas and two molecules of water gas. So, total gas molecules: reactants have 1 + 2 = 3 gases, and products have 1 + 2 = 3 gases. Seems like the number of gas molecules is the same, so entropy might not change much.\n\nBut wait, water in the gas phase still counts as a gas. So, perhaps entropy remains relatively the same, or maybe there's a slight change depending on the molecular complexities.\n\nOption D:\n\nD. 2 NI3(s) \u2192 3 I2(s) + N2(g)\n\nHere, two moles of solid nitrogen triiodide decompose into three moles of solid iodine and one mole of nitrogen gas. So, reactants are solids, and products are solids and a gas. Introducing a gas increases entropy because gases have higher entropy than solids.\n\nSo, this reaction increases entropy.\n\nWait, but the question is about the greatest decrease in entropy. So, options A and D increase entropy, while option B decreases entropy, and option C maybe doesn't change much.\n\nSo, between options B and C, which one shows a greater decrease in entropy?\n\nOption B: 2 Na(s) + O2(g) \u2192 Na2O2(s)\n\nHere, we're removing one gas molecule and forming solids. So, entropy decreases.\n\nOption C: CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nThe number of gas molecules remains the same, but the types of gases change. Maybe there's a slight change in entropy, but probably not as significant as removing a gas and forming solids.\n\nSo, option B seems to have a greater decrease in entropy.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn option B, we're removing one gas molecule and forming solids. Gases have much higher entropy than solids, so this should be a significant decrease.\n\nIn option C, the number of gas molecules stays the same, so entropy change is minimal.\n\nTherefore, option B should have the greatest decrease in entropy.\n\nWait, but let's make sure that in option B, all products are solids. Yes, sodium peroxide is a solid.\n\nAnd in option D, we're forming a gas, which increases entropy.\n\nIn option A, we're forming more gas molecules, which also increases entropy.\n\nSo, only option B involves removing a gas and forming solids, which should lead to a decrease in entropy.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
