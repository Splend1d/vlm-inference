I need to figure out which of these countries has the largest Muslim population exceeding 200 million.\n\nFirst, I should understand what is meant by \"largest Muslim country.\" I think it refers to the country with the highest number of Muslim inhabitants. So, I need to look up the Muslim population in each of these countries.\n\nLet me start with Indonesia. I've heard that Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in the world, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers. I should check reliable sources to get accurate data.\n\nSimilarly, Pakistan is also known for having a large Muslim population, but again, I need to verify the numbers.\n\nIraq and Turkey also have significant Muslim populations, but I suspect they might be smaller compared to Indonesia and Pakistan.\n\nI should consider the percentage of Muslims in each country as well as the total population to calculate the number of Muslim adherents.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n1. Indonesia:\n\n- Total population: According to recent estimates, around 270 million.\n\n- Percentage Muslim: Approximately 87%.\n\n- So, Muslim population: 270 million * 0.87 = around 235 million.\n\n2. Pakistan:\n\n- Total population: Around 220 million.\n\n- Percentage Muslim: About 97%.\n\n- Muslim population: 220 million * 0.97 = around 213 million.\n\n3. Iraq:\n\n- Total population: Approximately 40 million.\n\n- Percentage Muslim: Around 95%.\n\n- Muslim population: 40 million * 0.95 = 38 million.\n\n4. Turkey:\n\n- Total population: Around 84 million.\n\n- Percentage Muslim: About 99%.\n\n- Muslim population: 84 million * 0.99 = around 83 million.\n\nFrom these calculations, it seems that Indonesia has the largest Muslim population, with around 235 million, followed by Pakistan with around 213 million.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"more than 200 million adherents.\" Both Indonesia and Pakistan exceed this number, but Indonesia has a larger population.\n\nBut wait, the question might be referring to the country with the largest proportion of Muslims, but I think it's more about the absolute number of Muslims.\n\nLet me double-check the percentages and populations to ensure accuracy.\n\nIndonesia:\n\n- World Bank data shows a population of about 273 million in 2020.\n\n- Pew Research Center indicates that about 87% of Indonesia's population is Muslim.\n\n- So, 273 million * 0.87 = approximately 237 million Muslims.\n\nPakistan:\n\n- World Bank data: around 225 million people.\n\n- Pew Research: approximately 96% Muslim.\n\n- So, 225 million * 0.96 = about 216 million Muslims.\n\nIraq:\n\n- World Bank: around 40 million.\n\n- Pew Research: about 95% Muslim.\n\n- Thus, 40 million * 0.95 = 38 million Muslims.\n\nTurkey:\n\n- World Bank: approximately 84 million.\n\n- Pew Research: around 99% Muslim.\n\n- Therefore, 84 million * 0.99 = about 83 million Muslims.\n\nSo, Indonesia clearly has the largest Muslim population, followed by Pakistan.\n\nBut the question mentions \"more than 200 million adherents.\" Both Indonesia and Pakistan exceed this, but Indonesia has a significantly higher number.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Indonesia.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a country larger than Indonesia in terms of Muslim population. Let me think about India, but although India has a large Muslim population, the percentage is lower. Let's check:\n\nIndia:\n\n- Population: Over 1.3 billion.\n\n- Muslim percentage: About 14%.\n\n- So, 1.3 billion * 0.14 = approximately 182 million Muslims, which is less than Indonesia and Pakistan.\n\nSo, India doesn't exceed 200 million Muslims.\n\nAre there any other countries with a large Muslim population? Maybe Bangladesh:\n\n- Population: Around 165 million.\n\n- Muslim percentage: About 90%.\n\n- Muslim population: 165 million * 0.90 = 148.5 million, which is still less than Indonesia and Pakistan.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, Indonesia has the largest Muslim population, exceeding 200 million.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Indonesia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
