Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how long it takes her to develop one roll of film. Since 2 rolls take 18 minutes, one roll would take half of that time. So, 18 minutes divided by 2 is 9 minutes per roll.\n\nNow, if one roll takes 9 minutes, then 8 rolls would take 8 times 9 minutes. Let's calculate that: 8 times 9 is 72 minutes.\n\nNext, I need to see which option corresponds to 72 minutes. Let's look at the choices:\n\nA. 42 minutes\n\nB. 1 hour 12 minutes\n\nC. 1 hour 20 minutes\n\nD. 1 hour 44 minutes\n\nWait a minute, 72 minutes is equal to 1 hour and 12 minutes because 60 minutes make an hour and 72 minus 60 is 12 minutes.\n\nSo, 72 minutes is the same as 1 hour and 12 minutes.\n\nLooking back at the options, B says 1 hour 12 minutes, which matches our calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again: 2 rolls take 18 minutes, so 1 roll takes 18 / 2 = 9 minutes.\n\n8 rolls would be 8 * 9 = 72 minutes.\n\n72 minutes is 1 hour and 12 minutes.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions. If 2 rolls take 18 minutes, then 8 rolls would take (8 / 2) times 18 minutes. That is 4 times 18 minutes, which is 72 minutes. Same result.\n\nAnother way: using the rate. Tara's developing rate is 2 rolls per 18 minutes, which simplifies to 1 roll per 9 minutes, as I did before.\n\nSo, for 8 rolls, it's 8 rolls times 9 minutes per roll, which is 72 minutes.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 72 minutes, or 1 hour and 12 minutes, is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 1 hour 12 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
