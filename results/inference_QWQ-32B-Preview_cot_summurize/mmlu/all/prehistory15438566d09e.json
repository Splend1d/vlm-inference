                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the \"Lion Man\" from Hohlenstein-Stadel cave is an example of. The options are mobiliary art, long-distance trade of exotic raw materials, parietal art, or a Venus figurine. I think I need to recall what each of these terms means to determine the correct answer.\n\nFirst, mobiliary art refers to portable artworks created in the prehistoric period, like sculptures or carvings that can be moved. Parietal art, on the other hand, is art done on permanent surfaces like cave walls or ceilings, such as cave paintings and engravings. Venus figurines are prehistoric statuettes depicting female figures, often with exaggerated sexual features, and are considered a type of mobiliary art.\n\nNow, the Lion Man is a prehistoric ivory sculpture found in the Hohlenstein-Stadel cave in Germany. It's a figurine that combines human and lion characteristics, dating back to about 40,000 years ago. Given that it's a small, portable sculpture, it seems to fit under mobiliary art.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to be sure. Long-distance trade of exotic raw materials refers to the exchange of rare or valuable materials over significant distances, like ivory, obsidian, or shells. While the Lion Man is made of ivory, which could have been traded from a distance, the question is asking what the Lion Man is an example of, not about the material it's made from. So, this option doesn't seem directly relevant.\n\nVenus figurines are specifically depictions of female forms, often associated with fertility or mother goddess concepts in prehistoric times. The Lion Man, however, is a composite figure of a human and a lion, so it doesn't fit the description of a Venus figurine.\n\nParietal art involves artworks on fixed surfaces like cave walls, which the Lion Man isn't, as it's a free-standing sculpture.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate category for the Lion Man is mobiliary art, as it's a portable prehistoric sculpture.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
