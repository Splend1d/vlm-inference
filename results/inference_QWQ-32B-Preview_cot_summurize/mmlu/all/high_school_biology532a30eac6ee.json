                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Chemical substances released by organisms that elicit a physiological or behavioral response in other members of the same species are known as...\" and then it gives options: A. auxins, B. hormones, C. pheromones, D. enzymes. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about chemical substances that are released by organisms and have an effect on other members of the same species. So, it's something that one organism puts out there, and it causes some kind of reaction in others of its kind.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: Auxins. I think auxins are plant hormones, right? They're involved in things like growth and development in plants. But the question is about substances that affect other members of the same species, not necessarily just within the same organism. So, auxins might not be the best fit here.\n\nOption B: Hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that are secreted by glands in an organism's endocrine system. They travel through the bloodstream and regulate various physiological functions like growth, metabolism, and reproduction. But hormones typically act within the same organism, not necessarily between different organisms. So, maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption C: Pheromones. I've heard of pheromones before, especially in the context of animals attracting mates or marking territory. From what I remember, pheromones are chemicals that animals produce to communicate with others of the same species. So, they seem to fit the description in the question pretty well.\n\nOption D: Enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions. They speed up chemical processes in cells, but they don't really function as signals between organisms. So, this doesn't seem to match the description in the question.\n\nComparing all these options, pheromones stand out as the substances that are released by organisms to elicit responses in others of the same species. Auxins are more specific to plants and internal regulation, hormones act within the same organism, and enzymes are involved in catalyzing reactions, not in communication between organisms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. pheromones.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
