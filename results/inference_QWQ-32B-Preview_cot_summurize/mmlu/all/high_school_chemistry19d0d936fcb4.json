                    "text": "Let's think about this question step by step. We're asked which factor, when changed, will alter the numerical value of the equilibrium constant. The options are:\n\nA. The pressure of reactants\n\nB. The pressure of products\n\nC. The temperature\n\nD. The total mass of the chemicals present\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an equilibrium constant is. In chemistry, the equilibrium constant (like Kc or Kp) is a value that describes the equilibrium state of a chemical reaction. It's defined as the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients, at equilibrium.\n\nNow, the key point here is that the equilibrium constant is temperature-dependent. This is because equilibrium constants are based on the standard free energy change of the reaction, which in turn depends on temperature.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The pressure of reactants.\n\nChanging the pressure of reactants can shift the position of equilibrium, according to Le Chatelier's principle. If you increase the pressure of reactants in a gaseous reaction, the system may shift to reduce that pressure, perhaps by favoring the side with fewer moles of gas. However, the equilibrium constant itself doesn't change unless the temperature changes. So, changing the pressure of reactants doesn't change the equilibrium constant.\n\nOption B: The pressure of products.\n\nSimilarly, changing the pressure of products can shift the equilibrium position. If you increase the pressure of products, the system might shift to produce more reactants to counteract that change. Again, though, the equilibrium constant remains the same unless the temperature changes.\n\nOption C: The temperature.\n\nThis is a crucial one. Temperature affects the equilibrium constant because it affects the kinetic energy of the molecules and the rates of the forward and reverse reactions. In exothermic reactions, increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium towards the reactants, decreasing K. In endothermic reactions, increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium towards the products, increasing K. So, temperature directly affects the value of the equilibrium constant.\n\nOption D: The total mass of the chemicals present.\n\nThe total mass of the chemicals doesn't affect the equilibrium constant. The equilibrium constant is a ratio of concentrations or partial pressures, not dependent on the absolute amounts of substances present. Changing the total mass might change the concentrations, which could shift the position of equilibrium, but it won't change the value of K itself.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer should be C. The temperature.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider what happens when we change temperature. The equilibrium constant is temperature-dependent because it reflects the balance between the forward and reverse reaction rates, which are both affected by temperature. The Arrhenius equation tells us that reaction rates increase with temperature, but the extent to which they do so depends on the activation energies of the forward and reverse reactions.\n\nIn contrast, changes in pressure or concentration affect the position of equilibrium but not the equilibrium constant itself, as long as the temperature remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. The temperature.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
