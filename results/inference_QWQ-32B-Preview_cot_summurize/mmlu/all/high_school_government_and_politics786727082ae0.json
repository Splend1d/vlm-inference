                    "text": "If no presidential candidate receives a majority of the electoral college vote, then who becomes the president?\n\nLet's see here. I remember that the President of the United States is elected by the Electoral College, not directly by the popular vote. So, if no candidate gets a majority of the electoral votes, there must be a fallback plan. Let's think about the options given:\n\nA. The candidate who wins the popular national vote.\n\nWait, but I thought the popular vote doesn't decide the presidency. It's the electoral votes that matter. So, maybe this isn't the correct answer.\n\nB. The incumbent vice president of the United States.\n\nHmm, that seems unlikely. The vice president doesn't automatically become president if no one gets a majority in the Electoral College. That might happen in other scenarios, like if the president dies or is impeached, but not in this case.\n\nC. Whomever is selected by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nI don't think the Supreme Court has a direct role in electing the president. They might resolve disputes, but they don't choose the president directly.\n\nD. The candidate who wins the majority of votes in the House.\n\nAh, now this sounds familiar. I think there's a process called \"contingent election\" where, if no candidate gets an electoral college majority, the House of Representatives chooses the president from the top three candidates.\n\nLet me double-check that. According to the 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, if no presidential candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the selection of president falls to the House of Representatives. In this scenario, the House would choose the president from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes.\n\nSimilarly, the Senate would choose the vice president from the top two vice presidential candidates.\n\nSo, based on that, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I haven't missed anything. Is there any other scenario or exception where another option could apply?\n\nOption A is popular vote winner, but as I recall, the electoral college system is designed to be different from the popular vote. There have been instances where a candidate won the electoral college but lost the popular vote, like in 2000 and 2016. So, it's unlikely that the popular vote winner would become president if they didn't get the electoral college majority.\n\nOption B, the incumbent vice president, doesn't seem right in this context. The vice president doesn't automatically succeed to the presidency unless the president is unable to serve, such as in the case of death, resignation, or removal from office.\n\nOption C, the Supreme Court selecting the president, isn't accurate either. The Supreme Court's role is to interpret the constitution and laws, not to elect officials.\n\nTherefore, option D appears to be the correct answer. The candidate who wins the majority of votes in the House of Representatives would become president if no candidate secured an electoral college majority.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this process can lead to interesting political dynamics, as each state's delegation in the House gets one vote. So, it's not necessarily about the number of individual representatives voting but the state's overall preference.\n\nIn summary, if no presidential candidate receives a majority of the electoral college vote, the House of Representatives selects the president from the top three candidates.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
