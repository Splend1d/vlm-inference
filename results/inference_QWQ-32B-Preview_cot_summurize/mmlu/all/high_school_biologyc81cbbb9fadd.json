                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about crossing-over during meiosis. So, crossing-over is when chromosomes swap pieces of DNA during meiosis, right? It's like shuffling cards to create new combinations. Now, the question is asking what this process allows scientists to determine.\n\nOption A says \"the chance for variation in zygotes.\" That sounds plausible because crossing-over does create genetic diversity, which means zygotes can be more varied. But I think there might be a more specific answer.\n\nOption B is \"the rate of mutations.\" Hmm, crossing-over isn't directly about mutations. Mutations are changes in DNA sequence, whereas crossing-over is the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption C is \"the distance between genes on a chromosome.\" Okay, this rings a bell. I think scientists can use crossing-over frequencies to map the positions of genes on chromosomes. The idea is that genes that are closer together are less likely to be separated by crossing-over, so they tend to be inherited together. So, maybe this is the answer.\n\nOption D is \"which traits are dominant or recessive.\" Dominance and recessiveness are about how alleles express themselves when combined in an organism. Crossing-over doesn't directly determine that; it's more about shuffling existing alleles.\n\nSo, between options A and C, I think C is more precise. Crossing-over frequencies can be used to create genetic maps that show the relative positions of genes on chromosomes. The closer two genes are, the lower the chance of a crossover occurring between them, and thus they are more likely to be inherited together, or linked.\n\nTo confirm, I remember that geneticists use recombination frequencies to calculate the distance between genes in map units, or centiMorgans. So, yes, crossing-over allows them to determine the distance between genes on a chromosome.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. The distance between genes on a chromosome.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
