Whoever sells intoxicating liquor to any person who is intoxicated or inebriated is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section shall not apply in the case of sales of intoxicating liquor by a hotel, motel, or inn to any person registered and resident as a guest in such hotel, motel, or inn for consumption upon the premises thereof. \"\"Section 1213. It shall be unlawful for any vendor with a valid state liquor license to sell intoxicating beverages on Sunday. Anyone in violation of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not less than $100 or more than $1,000. \"The state authorities have regularly enforced the aforementioned dram shop statute and \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales. At 12:30 a. m. on Sunday morning, a customer entered a liquor store and purchased a bottle of wine. The clerk who made the sale, thought the time was 11:30 p. m. Saturday night because that was the time shown on the store's wall clock. Unknown to the clerk, the clock was malfunctioning and was running an hour behind. Thus, the clock displayed the wrong time when the clerk sold the wine to the customer. When the clerk made the sale, the customer did not appear to be visibly inebriated. After making the purchase, the customer drank the entire bottle of wine. He then drove off in his car and struck a pedestrian, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the customer was intoxicated from drinking the wine. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the liquor store, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the liquor store was negligent per se by selling the wine in violation of the \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales.\nB. Yes, because the accident would not have occurred but for the sale of the wine to the customer.\nC. No, because the purpose of the \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales was not to prevent accidents caused by drivers driving while intoxicated.\nD. No, because the clerk did not violate the dram shop statute, and his violation of the \"blue law\" resulted from the clock's malfunctioning.\n"

                    "text": "I have this legal scenario to analyze. There are two statutes in play here: one about selling liquor to intoxicated persons and another about prohibiting liquor sales on Sundays. The pedestrian is injured by a customer who bought wine from a liquor store early Sunday morning, got drunk, and then caused the accident.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the statutes:\n\n1. **Section 1212**: Prohibits selling intoxicating liquor to anyone who is intoxicated or inebriated. It's a misdemeanor. There's an exception for hotels, motels, or inns selling to registered guests on premises.\n\n2. **Section 1213**: Makes it unlawful for vendors with a state liquor license to sell intoxicating beverages on Sunday. Violation is a misdemeanor with a fine of $100 to $1,000.\n\nNow, the facts:\n\n- The customer bought a bottle of wine at 12:30 a.m. on Sunday.\n\n- The clerk thought it was 11:30 p.m. Saturday due to a malfunctioning clock running an hour behind.\n\n- The customer didn't appear intoxicated at the time of purchase.\n\n- After purchasing, the customer drank the entire bottle and then drove, hitting a pedestrian while intoxicated.\n\nThe pedestrian is asserting a claim against the liquor store. I need to determine if the pedestrian will prevail.\n\nOption A says yes, because the liquor store was negligent per se by violating the \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales.\n\nNegligence per se occurs when there's a violation of a statute intended to protect a particular class of persons, and the plaintiff is within that class. Here, the statute is Section 1213, prohibiting Sunday sales.\n\nIs this statute intended to prevent accidents caused by drunk drivers? That's a key question. If the purpose is to prevent such accidents, then maybe. But if it's for moral or religious reasons, perhaps not.\n\nOption C directly addresses this: No, because the purpose of the \"blue law\" was not to prevent accidents caused by drivers driving while intoxicated.\n\nSo, I need to consider the purpose of the Sunday sales prohibition. Traditionally, blue laws restricted certain activities on Sundays for moral or religious reasons. It's possible that the primary purpose isn't to prevent drunk driving accidents.\n\nOption B says yes, because the accident wouldn't have occurred but for the sale of the wine to the customer.\n\nThis is the \"but for\" causation test. True, but for the sale, the customer wouldn't have had the wine to drink and cause the accident. But in legal terms, is the store liable just because their sale was a contributing factor?\n\nOption D says no, because the clerk didn't violate the dram shop statute, and his violation of the \"blue law\" resulted from the clock's malfunctioning.\n\nSo, regarding Section 1212, the clerk didn't sell to an intoxicated person; the customer didn't appear intoxicated at the time of sale. So, no violation there.\n\nAs for Section 1213, the violation was due to a clock malfunction. The clerk thought it was still Saturday night. Does this affect liability?\n\nIn terms of negligence per se, intent matters. If the violation was unintentional due to a clock error, perhaps the store shouldn't be held strictly liable.\n\nBut laws are often strictly enforced, regardless of intent, especially regulatory laws like blue laws.\n\nHowever, in the context of a dram shop claim, where the store is being sued for selling alcohol that contributed to an accident, the focus might be different.\n\nI think the key here is whether the Sunday sales prohibition was intended to protect the public from drunk driving accidents.\n\nIf the purpose was primarily moral or religious, then perhaps the pedestrian wouldn't prevail based on the blue law violation.\n\nBut if the purpose includes public safety, then maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store can be liable under dram shop laws for selling to an already intoxicated person, but in this case, the customer didn't appear intoxicated at the time of sale.\n\nWait, Section 1212 excepts sales by hotels, motels, or inns to registered guests on premises. But this is a liquor store, so that doesn't apply.\n\nSo, the store violated Section 1213 by selling on Sunday, unaware due to the clock error.\n\nNow, assuming that the blue law's purpose isn't primarily to prevent drunk driving accidents, then option C might be correct: no, because the purpose of the blue law wasn't to prevent such accidents.\n\nBut if the purpose includes public safety, then option A might be correct: yes, because of negligent per se violation of the blue law.\n\nI need to consider the likely intent of the legislature in enacting the blue law. If it's purely moral or religious, then perhaps not intended to prevent accidents. If it's to reduce public intoxication and related incidents, then maybe.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is C: no, because the purpose of the blue law prohibiting Sunday liquor sales was not to prevent accidents caused by drivers driving while intoxicated.\n\nThe violation of the blue law doesn't directly relate to the cause of the accident, which was the customer's intoxication and reckless driving after consuming the wine.\n\nAdditionally, since the clerk didn't sell to an intoxicated person, there's no violation of Section 1212.\n\nTherefore, the pedestrian likely won't prevail in the claim against the liquor store.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
