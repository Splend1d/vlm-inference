                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one. I need to determine whether each statement is true or false.\n\n**Statement 1:** If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what aH represents. aH is the left coset of H in G generated by a, which is the set {ah | h \u2208 H}.\n\nNow, for aH to be a subgroup of G, it must satisfy the subgroup criteria: closure, identity, inverses, and associativity (inherited from G).\n\nLet's consider the \"if\" part: if a is in H, then aH is a subgroup of G.\n\nIf a is in H, then aH = H, because multiplying every element of H by an element of H just gives back H (since H is closed under the group operation). Since H is a subgroup by assumption, aH = H is indeed a subgroup of G.\n\nNow, the \"only if\" part: if aH is a subgroup of G, then a is in H.\n\nSuppose aH is a subgroup of G. Then, it must contain the identity element e of G, because every subgroup contains the identity. So, e \u2208 aH, which means there exists some h \u2208 H such that a h = e. Therefore, a = h\u207b\u00b9, and since H is a subgroup, h\u207b\u00b9 is in H. Thus, a is in H.\n\nSo, both directions hold, and Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.\n\nWait a minute, I think there might be a mistake here. Let's recall the standard result about when two left cosets are equal.\n\nI believe the standard result is that aH = bH if and only if a\u207b\u00b9 b is in H.\n\nLet me check this.\n\nSuppose aH = bH. Then, in particular, a = a e \u2208 bH, so there exists h \u2208 H such that a = b h. Therefore, a\u207b\u00b9 b = h\u207b\u00b9, which is in H since H is a subgroup.\n\nConversely, suppose a\u207b\u00b9 b \u2208 H. Then, there exists h \u2208 H such that a\u207b\u00b9 b = h, so b = a h. Therefore, for any h' \u2208 H, b h' = a (h h'), which shows that bH \u2286 aH. Similarly, since h is invertible, a = b h\u207b\u00b9, so aH \u2286 bH. Hence, aH = bH.\n\nSo, the correct condition is aH = bH if and only if a\u207b\u00b9 b \u2208 H.\n\nBut Statement 2 says aH = bH if and only if ab \u2208 H. That doesn't match the standard result. So, Statement 2 seems to be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation. Perhaps in some special cases, like abelian groups, but even in abelian groups, the standard result holds.\n\nWait, in abelian groups, aH = bH if and only if a\u207b\u00b9 b \u2208 H, just like in non-abelian groups. The commutativity doesn't change this.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
