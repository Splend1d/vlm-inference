There's an exception for emergency circumstances, like federal hospitals that might need to operate differently. Now, Congress had assumed that offices would be open five days a week when they passed the appropriations statute, but they didn't actually put that requirement in the statute or any other law.\n\nThe question is, is the President's order constitutional?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the heads of the various executive agencies have final responsibility for the operation of those agencies' offices.\n\nB. No, because when they passed the statute appropriating monies for the operation of executive agencies, members of Congress assumed that those agencies' offices would be open five days per week.\n\nC. Yes, because the Constitution vests the President with plenary authority to direct the administration of all federal agencies in any manner the President deems expedient.\n\nD. Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand the roles here. The President is the head of the executive branch, and Congress is the legislative branch. There's a separation of powers between them.\n\nOption A says no, because the heads of executive agencies have final responsibility for their offices. But, in reality, while agency heads have a lot of discretion in running their agencies, the President, as the head of the executive branch, does have authority over them. So, maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B says no, because Congress assumed offices would be open five days a week when they passed the appropriations statute. But, the key point is that Congress didn't actually include that requirement in the statute. They just assumed it. So, unless it's explicitly in the law, maybe the President has leeway here.\n\nOption C says yes, because the Constitution gives the President complete authority to direct the administration of federal agencies. Hmm, the Constitution does give the President the power to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, and to supervise the executive branch. But, does it give plenary authority in all matters? Maybe not absolutely plenary, but certainly significant authority.\n\nOption D says yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and isn't prohibited by any statute. This seems plausible because, since Congress didn't prohibit it, and it's within the President's managerial authority, it should be constitutional.\n\nLet me think about this more deeply. In times of emergency, like a severe fuel shortage, the President might have broader powers to take necessary actions to address the crisis. The President is responsible for the overall operation of the executive branch and managing federal resources.\n\nAlso, considering that the President's order allows for exceptions in emergency circumstances, like federal hospitals, which suggests that it's not an across-the-board mandate without consideration for necessary operations.\n\nOn the other hand, Congress holds the purse strings through its appropriations power. However, in this case, they didn't specify the number of days offices should be open in the statute.\n\nMaybe the key here is that since Congress didn't prohibit the President from issuing such an order, and it's within the President's managerial authority over the executive branch, it's constitutional.\n\nOption D seems to align with that thinking.\n\nOption C is attractive, but \"plenary authority\" might be too broad. The President doesn't have unlimited authority; there are checks and balances.\n\nOption A might be incorrect because, while agency heads have significant responsibility, the President still has oversight authority.\n\nOption B is perhaps weak because congressional assumptions without legislative action might not carry legal weight.\n\nSo, I think D is the best answer: Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute."
