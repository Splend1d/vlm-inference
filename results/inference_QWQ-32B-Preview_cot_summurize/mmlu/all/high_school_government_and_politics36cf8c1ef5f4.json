                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and it gives four options: A, B, C, and D. Each option describes a different action or prohibition related to voting rights.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was all about. I remember that it was a significant piece of legislation in the United States that aimed to overcome legal barriers at the state and local levels that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote as guaranteed under the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nOption A says it granted women the right to vote. But I think women's right to vote was already established with the 19th Amendment in 1920. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says it banned race-based discrimination. That sounds plausible because the act was indeed about removing racial barriers to voting. But I need to check if that's the primary focus.\n\nOption C says it granted African-Americans the right to vote. Again, the 15th Amendment, ratified in 1870, already granted African-American men the right to vote. So, perhaps the Voting Rights Act was more about enforcing that right.\n\nOption D says it suspended the use of literacy tests at voting centers. I recall that literacy tests were one of the tools used to disenfranchise African-American voters, especially in the Southern states. So, this also seems relevant.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. The 15th Amendment guaranteed the right to vote regardless of race, but in practice, many states, particularly in the South, used various tactics like literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses to prevent African Americans from voting.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 was designed to address these discriminatory practices. It suspended the use of literacy tests in certain jurisdictions and provided for federal oversight of voter registration in areas with a history of discriminatory practices.\n\nSo, while option B is somewhat accurate in that it banned race-based discrimination in voting, the more specific action was suspending literacy tests and providing for federal enforcement of voting rights.\n\nOption D seems more precise in describing one of the key provisions of the act. Additionally, the act also required jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to get federal approval before changing voting laws, which is known as preclearance.\n\nBut looking back at the options, only D mentions suspending literacy tests, which was indeed a crucial part of the act.\n\nLet me double-check the other options:\n\n- A: Women's suffrage was already achieved with the 19th Amendment.\n\n- B: Banning race-based discrimination is a broad statement, and while the act did aim to prevent such discrimination, it might be too vague compared to the specific measures outlined in the act.\n\n- C: Granting African-Americans the right to vote was done by the 15th Amendment, so this isn't accurate for the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nTherefore, the most correct answer among the options provided is D: suspended the use of literacy tests at voting centers.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the act did much more than that, including providing for federal oversight and preclearance, but based on the options given, D seems to be the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
