The delegation's goal was twofold: to study the problem and to formulate regulations in a bilateral agreement that would protect the endangered species and provide for a permanent commission that would continually monitor enforcement of the proposed regulations. After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers. Assume that after the treaty goes into effect, a state legislature enacts a statute that provides that \"any licensed rabbit-hunter in the state and its surrounding environs may increase his monthly catch of rabbits from 10 to 15 in each of the specified months of the authorized rabbit-hunting season from the first day of October until the last day of February. \" If challenged, the enactment of the aforementioned statute would most likely be declared\n\nA. constitutional, because the regulation of hunting is within the area of state action.\nB. constitutional, because the enactment falls within the Tenth Amendment's reservedpowers.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause.\nD. unconstitutional, because all treaties are the supreme law of the land.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about a treaty between two countries to protect certain species of rabbits and prevent their extinction. There's a delegation that studies the problem and drafts regulations, and then the presidents of both countries agree to form a permanent commission to oversee and enforce these regulations. Later, a state legislature passes a law that allows licensed hunters in the state to catch more rabbits during the hunting season. The question is, if someone challenges this state law, what would likely happen?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Constitutional, because regulating hunting is a state matter.\n\nB. Constitutional, because it falls under the Tenth Amendment's reserved powers.\n\nC. Unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause.\n\nD. Unconstitutional, because all treaties are the supreme law of the land.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand the legal principles involved here. There's a treaty between two countries, which is an agreement between nations. In the US legal system, treaties are considered part of the supreme law of the land, on the same level as the Constitution and federal laws. This comes from the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution, which says that the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties are the supreme law of the land, and anything that conflicts with them is invalid.\n\nSo, if the state law allows hunters to catch more rabbits, but the treaty is aimed at protecting these species and preventing their extinction, there might be a conflict. The treaty probably sets certain regulations that the permanent commission is supposed to enforce, and if the state law allows activities that go against those regulations, there could be a problem.\n\nOption A says it's constitutional because regulating hunting is a state matter. Traditionally, states have had the power to regulate hunting and fishing within their borders, but this power isn't absolute, especially when it comes into conflict with federal law or treaties.\n\nOption B mentions the Tenth Amendment's reserved powers. The Tenth Amendment says that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states or the people. So, if regulating hunting isn't specifically given to the federal government, it might be considered a state power. However, again, if there's a treaty in place that conflicts with the state law, the treaty would take precedence due to the Supremacy Clause.\n\nOption C suggests it's unconstitutional because it violates the commerce clause. The commerce clause gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. But in this case, the state law is about hunting within its own borders, which might not directly involve interstate commerce. So, this seems less likely.\n\nOption D says it's unconstitutional because all treaties are the supreme law of the land. This seems relevant because the treaty is supreme, and if the state law conflicts with it, the state law would be invalid.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, I think D is the most accurate. The treaty is part of the supreme law of the land, and if the state law allows activities that contradict the treaty's goals of protecting the rabbit species, then the state law would likely be declared unconstitutional.\n\nBut let me think about this a bit more. Maybe there are cases where states can regulate hunting even if there's a federal treaty. Perhaps there are areas where state regulations are allowed as long as they don't conflict with federal laws or treaties.\n\nI recall that under the principle of preemption, federal law preempts state law when there's a direct conflict. So, if the treaty sets certain regulations that the permanent commission must enforce, and the state law allows activities that violate those regulations, then the state law would be preempted by the treaty.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the treaty only applies to certain areas or certain aspects of rabbit protection, and the state law is regulating something else. But based on the information given, it seems like the state law is allowing more hunting, which might conflict with the treaty's goal of preventing extinction.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any exceptions or carve-outs where state laws can still apply even in the face of a treaty. Perhaps if the treaty allows for state regulations that are consistent with its goals, but in this case, the state law seems to be going against the treaty's objectives.\n\nFurthermore, the permanent commission is granted enforcement powers, which suggests that it has the authority to ensure that the regulations are followed by both countries and their subnational entities, including states.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the state law would be deemed unconstitutional because it conflicts with the treaty, which is part of the supreme law of the land.\n\nOption D seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) unconstitutional, because all treaties are the supreme law of the land."
