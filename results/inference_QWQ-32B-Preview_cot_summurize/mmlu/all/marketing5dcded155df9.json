                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about sales techniques. It's asking about making a lot of unwanted sales calls to people the salesperson doesn't know. The options are multilevel marketing, cold canvassing, center-of-influence method, and sales-associate method. I need to pick the one that best describes this process.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means. Let's start with multilevel marketing. I think this is a business model where salespeople not only sell products but also recruit other salespeople, and they earn commissions on their recruits' sales too. It's like a pyramid where each level earns from the levels below them. But in the question, it's about making unsolicited sales calls to unknown customers, so I'm not sure if this fits.\n\nNext, cold canvassing. I think \"canvassing\" means going door-to-door or contacting people to sell something, and \"cold\" probably means approaching people who aren't expecting the contact and don't know the salesperson. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing\u2014making many unsolicited sales calls to unknown customers. This seems promising.\n\nThen there's the center-of-influence method. I'm not entirely sure what this is, but it sounds like a strategy where salespeople identify influential people in a community and use their endorsement to sell products. Maybe something like getting a recommendation from a trusted source. This doesn't seem to match the description of making\u5927\u91cfunsolicited calls.\n\nLastly, the sales-associate method. I think this refers to salespeople working in a retail setting, where they assist customers in-store and make sales directly to them. Again, this doesn't align with the scenario of making unknown customers unsolicited sales calls.\n\nBased on this, it seems like cold canvassing is the most appropriate answer. It directly relates to approaching unknown customers without prior invitation, which matches the description in the question.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check. Multilevel marketing involves selling and recruiting, which is different from just making sales calls. Center-of-influence is more about leveraging referrals from influential people, and sales-associate is about in-person sales in a retail environment. None of these seem to fit the scenario as well as cold canvassing does.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. cold canvassing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
