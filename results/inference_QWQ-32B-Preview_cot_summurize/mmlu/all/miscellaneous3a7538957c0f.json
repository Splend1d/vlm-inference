                    "text": "So I've got this question here about measurements of a block of wood. The true length is 1.010 cm, and there are three measurements: 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm. I need to figure out which statement is true concerning these measurements. The options are:\n\nA. They are precise and accurate.\n\nB. They are precise but not accurate.\n\nC. They are accurate but not precise.\n\nD. They are neither precise nor accurate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"precise\" and \"accurate\" mean in this context.\n\nAccuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true or accepted value. So, if the measurements are close to 1.010 cm, they are accurate.\n\nPrecision refers to how close the measurements are to each other. So, if the measurements are close to each other, regardless of the true value, they are precise.\n\nLooking at the measurements: 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm.\n\nFirst, let's check for accuracy. How close are these to 1.010 cm?\n\n- 1.4 cm is 1.4 - 1.010 = 0.390 cm off.\n\n- 1.2 cm is 1.2 - 1.010 = 0.190 cm off.\n\n- 0.9 cm is 0.9 - 1.010 = -0.110 cm off.\n\nSo, none of them are very close to 1.010 cm. The closest is 0.9 cm, which is off by 0.110 cm, but even that's not extremely close.\n\nNow, let's check for precision. How close are the measurements to each other?\n\n- The difference between 1.4 and 1.2 is 0.2 cm.\n\n- Between 1.2 and 0.9 is 0.3 cm.\n\n- And between 1.4 and 0.9 is 0.5 cm.\n\nSo, there's a fairly significant spread between the measurements. They are not very close to each other.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the measurements are neither precise nor accurate.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nAccuracy: Measurements are not close to the true value.\n\nPrecision: Measurements are not close to each other.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. They are neither precise nor accurate.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe one of them is closer than I think. Let's look again.\n\nThe true value is 1.010 cm.\n\n- 1.4 cm is quite a bit higher.\n\n- 1.2 cm is higher but closer.\n\n- 0.9 cm is lower but closer than the others.\n\nIf I consider the average of the measurements:\n\n(1.4 + 1.2 + 0.9) / 3 = 3.5 / 3 = 1.1667 cm.\n\nThat's still not very close to 1.010 cm.\n\nAnd the spread is fairly large, as shown earlier.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider what the other options would mean.\n\nA. Precise and accurate: Measurements are close to each other and close to the true value. Clearly not the case here.\n\nB. Precise but not accurate: Measurements are close to each other but not close to the true value. In this case, the measurements are not even close to each other, so this doesn't fit.\n\nC. Accurate but not precise: Measurements are close to the true value but not close to each other. Here, the measurements are not really close to the true value, except maybe 0.9 cm, but even that has some deviation.\n\nD. Neither precise nor accurate: Measurements are not close to each other and not close to the true value. This matches what I've observed.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
