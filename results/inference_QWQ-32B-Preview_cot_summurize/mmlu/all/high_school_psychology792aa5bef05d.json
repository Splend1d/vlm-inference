I need to figure out which taste is most commonly associated with toxic substances for humans.\n\nFirst, I should think about why certain tastes might be linked to toxicity. Maybe our taste buds have evolved to help us avoid poisonous things. Like, certain tastes might signal that something is bad for us.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Sour: Sour tastes are often associated with acidity. For example, lemon juice is sour because it's acidic. But not all acidic things are toxic. In fact, many fruits are acidic but perfectly safe to eat. So, maybe sour isn't the best indicator of toxicity.\n\nB. Sweet: Sweet tastes usually indicate the presence of sugars, which are energy sources and generally beneficial. However, some toxic substances can also taste sweet, like certain alkaloids. But overall, sweetness seems more associated with desirable foods than with toxins.\n\nC. Salty: Salty tastes indicate the presence of salts, particularly sodium chloride. Salt is essential for bodily functions, but too much can be harmful. However, salt itself isn't typically considered toxic in normal quantities. There are some toxic salts, like sodium cyanide, but they aren't commonly encountered in everyday life.\n\nD. Bitter: Bitter tastes are often associated with alkaloids and other compounds that can be toxic. Many plant defenses are bitter-tasting to deter herbivores. For example, caffeine and quinine are bitter and have some toxicity at high doses. Also, in taste aversion learning, animals, including humans, tend to avoid foods that taste bitter because they often signal poison.\n\nSo, considering this, it seems like bitter tastes are most commonly associated with toxicity.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a reason why sour or bitter could both be possible answers.\n\nSour tastes could indicate spoilage or acidity, which in some cases might be related to toxicity. For example, spoiled foods can sometimes taste sour and might contain harmful bacteria. However, not all sour foods are toxic; many fermented foods are sour but beneficial.\n\nOn the other hand, bitter tastes seem more consistently linked to potential toxins. Our ability to detect bitter tastes may have evolved specifically to help us avoid ingesting poisonous plants.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D. bitter.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll look up some information to confirm this.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that many toxic plant compounds are bitter-tasting alkaloids. For example, strychnine and nicotine are both bitter and highly toxic. Our taste receptors for bitterness are numerous and sensitive, suggesting an important role in avoiding toxins.\n\nAdditionally, there's a concept in evolutionary biology called the \"bitterness-toxicity relationship,\" which suggests that the bitter taste serves as a warning sign for potentially harmful substances.\n\nTherefore, it seems confirmed that substances toxic to humans often taste bitter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
