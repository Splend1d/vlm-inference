On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nMao's quotation is best understood in the context of which of the following?\n\nA.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, Mao is talking about the spontaneous forces of capitalism in the countryside. He mentions that new rich peasants are appearing everywhere, and some poor peasants are still struggling. He sees a polarization: some getting richer and others staying poor or even getting poorer. He's concerned that if this continues, it will cause problems for the worker-peasant alliance, which is fundamental to communist ideology.\n\nMao proposes that the solution is to gradually bring about the socialist transformation of agriculture, along with industrialization and the transformation of other sectors like handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce. He talks about cooperation and eliminating the rich-peasant economy and individual economy in the countryside, aiming for all rural people to become increasingly well off together.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Governments in communist countries implementing liberal political and economic reforms to mitigate social unrest.\n\nThis seems to suggest that communist governments are adopting liberal reforms to handle social issues. But in Mao's quote, he's advocating for socialist transformation, which is more aligned with communist principles rather than liberal reforms. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nB. Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population.\n\nThis option talks about collectivization and reducing inequality. Mao's quote is all about socialist transformation and cooperation in agriculture, which is essentially collectivization. He explicitly states that this is necessary to reduce polarization and make sure all peasants become well off together. This seems to align closely with what Mao is saying.\n\nC. Governments promoting policies intended to hasten industrialization.\n\nWhile Mao does mention simultaneous industrialization, the main focus of the quote is on the transformation of agriculture and reducing inequality in the countryside. Industrialization is mentioned but not as the primary concern here. So, this might not be the best fit.\n\nD. Governments promoting capitalist policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population.\n\nThis option suggests promoting capitalist policies to reduce inequality. However, Mao is arguing against the spontaneous forces of capitalism in the countryside and is advocating for socialist transformation to address inequality. So, this directly contradicts Mao's position.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B seems to be the best fit. Mao is discussing the need to promote collectivization of land to reduce inequality between different sectors of the population, specifically in the countryside.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
