                    "text": "Let's see. So, the question is about what happens when the per unit price of labor, which is a variable resource, increases. We need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these terms means:\n\n- AFC stands for Average Fixed Cost. It's the total fixed cost divided by the quantity of output produced.\n\n- MPL is the Marginal Product of Labor, which is the additional output produced by hiring one more unit of labor.\n\n- ATC is Average Total Cost, which is the total cost divided by the quantity of output.\n\n- MC is Marginal Cost, which is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output.\n\nNow, the per unit price of labor is increasing. Labor is a variable resource, meaning its cost varies with the level of output.\n\nLet me think about how this affects each of the options.\n\nOption A: An upward shift in AFC.\n\nAFC is average fixed cost, and fixed costs don't change with the level of output. Since labor is a variable cost, an increase in its price shouldn't directly affect AFC. So, probably A is not correct.\n\nOption B: An upward shift in MPL.\n\nMPL is the marginal product of labor, which is related to production, not directly to costs. If the price of labor increases, it doesn't necessarily mean that each additional worker is more productive. In fact, possibly firms might hire less labor because it's more expensive, which could affect MPL, but I'm not sure about an upward shift. This seems unlikely.\n\nOption C: A downward shift in ATC.\n\nATC is average total cost, which is (total fixed cost + total variable cost) divided by quantity. If the price of labor increases, total variable cost increases, which would typically lead to an increase in ATC, not a downward shift. So, C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D: An upward shift in MC.\n\nMC is marginal cost, which is the additional cost of producing one more unit. If the price of labor increases, the cost of producing each additional unit would increase, because labor is involved in production. Therefore, MC should increase.\n\nWait, but let's think deeper. If labor becomes more expensive, firms might substitute other inputs for labor, maybe capital, which could affect the marginal cost differently. However, in the short run, especially if capital is fixed, an increase in labor price would directly increase the marginal cost.\n\nAlso, considering that labor is a variable input, its cost directly affects the variable cost, which in turn affects MC.\n\nSo, an upward shift in MC seems plausible.\n\nLet me eliminate the other options to confirm.\n\nOption A: AFC shouldn't be affected because fixed costs don't change with the price of variable inputs.\n\nOption B: MPL is related to production, not costs, and an increase in labor price doesn't directly imply an increase in MPL.\n\nOption C: ATC should increase with an increase in variable costs, not decrease.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination, D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nMoreover, economically, it makes sense that if the cost of a variable input like labor increases, the marginal cost of production would also increase.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. An upward shift in MC.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
