                    "text": "Let's see what Keynesian theory says about economic policies, especially regarding fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nFirst off, Keynesian economics is based on the ideas of John Maynard Keynes, who argued that government intervention is necessary to stabilize economic fluctuations and promote growth. This is particularly important during times of economic downturns or recessions.\n\nOption A says that the FED should not conduct monetary policy. But I don't think that's accurate. Keynesians do believe in the role of monetary policy, but they might argue that it has limitations, especially when interest rates are very low, like during a recession. So, while they don't completely dismiss monetary policy, they might not see it as the primary tool.\n\nOption B states that changes in the money supply have significant effects. Again, Keynesians might not entirely disagree, but they often emphasize the effectiveness of fiscal policy over monetary policy, especially in certain circumstances. So, while changes in the money supply can have effects, Keynesians might argue that these effects are less reliable or potent compared to fiscal measures.\n\nOption C says that fiscal policy is the preferred way of shifting the aggregate demand curve. This sounds right. Keynesian economics places a strong emphasis on fiscal policy\u2014government spending and taxation\u2014as the main tools to influence aggregate demand and stabilize the economy. During a recession, Keynesians would advocate for increased government spending or tax cuts to boost demand, and during inflationary periods, they might suggest the opposite.\n\nOption D suggests that the FED should allow the money supply to grow at a constant rate. This sounds more like a monetarist view, which is associated with Milton Friedman, rather than Keynesian theory. Monetarists believe in controlling the money supply to achieve price stability and economic growth, often proposing a constant growth rate for the money supply.\n\nGiven these points, I think the correct answer is C: fiscal policy is the preferred way of shifting the aggregate demand curve, according to Keynesian theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
