                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"What is the least perfect square with 3 different prime factors? The options are A. 300, B. 9, C. 900, D. 666.\" Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a perfect square is. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself. For example, 9 is a perfect square because it's 3 times 3.\n\nNext, I need to consider that this perfect square should have exactly three different prime factors. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. For instance, the prime factors of 9 are 3 and 3, but that's only one distinct prime factor.\n\nSo, I need a perfect square that has exactly three different prime factors. That means the prime factorization of the number should include three distinct primes, each raised to an even power because it's a perfect square.\n\nLet me think about the smallest possible such number. The smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5. If I take these three primes and raise each to the power of 2 (since they need to be even exponents for the number to be a perfect square), I get:\n\n2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2 * 5\u00b2 = 4 * 9 * 25 = 900.\n\nSo, 900 is a perfect square with three different prime factors: 2, 3, and 5.\n\nBut wait, is this the smallest such number? Let's check the other options to see if any of them are smaller and also satisfy the condition.\n\nOption A is 300. Let's factorize 300:\n\n300 divided by 2 is 150,\n\n150 divided by 2 is 75,\n\n75 divided by 3 is 25,\n\n25 divided by 5 is 5,\n\n5 divided by 5 is 1.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 300 are 2\u00b2 * 3 * 5\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, here the exponent of 3 is 1, which is odd. For a number to be a perfect square, all exponents in its prime factorization must be even. So, 300 is not a perfect square because of the exponent of 3 being 1.\n\nOption B is 9. Let's factorize 9:\n\n9 is 3 * 3, which is 3\u00b2.\n\nSo, 9 is a perfect square, but it only has one distinct prime factor, which is 3. The problem asks for three different prime factors, so 9 doesn't qualify.\n\nOption C is 900, which we already determined is a perfect square with three different prime factors: 2, 3, and 5.\n\nOption D is 666. Let's factorize 666:\n\n666 divided by 2 is 333,\n\n333 divided by 3 is 111,\n\n111 divided by 3 is 37,\n\n37 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 666 are 2 * 3\u00b2 * 37.\n\nAgain, the exponent of 2 is 1, which is odd, so 666 is not a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, only 900 satisfies the condition of being a perfect square with three different prime factors.\n\nBut wait, is there a smaller number than 900 that fits this description? Let's think about it.\n\nSuppose I take the smallest primes: 2, 3, and 5, as I did before. Any smaller combination would involve smaller primes or lower exponents, but since exponents must be even for a perfect square, I can't lower them below 2 without making them zero, which would remove that prime factor.\n\nSo, 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2 * 5\u00b2 = 4 * 9 * 25 = 900 seems to be the smallest possible perfect square with three different prime factors.\n\nLet me consider if there's a way to have a smaller product with three different prime factors, all raised to even powers.\n\nSuppose I try to include a smaller prime, like 2, 3, and 7:\n\n2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2 * 7\u00b2 = 4 * 9 * 49 = 1764, which is larger than 900.\n\nOr 2, 3, and 11: 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2 * 11\u00b2 = 4 * 9 * 121 = 4356, even larger.\n\nSo, indeed, 2, 3, and 5 give the smallest product.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 900.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
