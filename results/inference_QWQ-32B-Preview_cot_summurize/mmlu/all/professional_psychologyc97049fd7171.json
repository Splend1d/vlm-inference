                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about children's reactions to pressure based on their activity levels. It says that children who have a high activity level tend to react to pressure by:\n\nA. becoming anxious\n\nB. becoming passive\n\nC. increasing nonproductive motor activity\n\nD. becoming physically and behaviorally abusive\n\nHmm, I need to think about this carefully. First, I should understand what is meant by \"high activity level.\" I think this refers to children who are naturally more energetic and restless, maybe always on the go, having a lot of physical energy.\n\nNow, when these children face pressure, how do they typically react? Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: becoming anxious. Well, pressure can certainly cause anxiety in many people, including children. But is this specifically true for children with high activity levels? Maybe, but I'm not sure if this is the most characteristic reaction for them.\n\nOption B: becoming passive. This seems counterintuitive. If a child is usually very active, it's unlikely that they would become passive under pressure. Passivity doesn't seem aligned with their natural disposition.\n\nOption C: increasing nonproductive motor activity. This sounds plausible. If a child is already high in activity level, pressure might amplify that, leading to more movement that doesn't serve a particular purpose. Maybe they fidget more, can't sit still, or engage in aimless running around.\n\nOption D: becoming physically and behaviorally abusive. This is a serious option, and while some children might react aggressively under pressure, I'm not sure if this is a universal or even common reaction for all high-activity-level children. It might be more related to individual temperament or other factors.\n\nLet me try to recall any psychology lessons or readings I've done related to children's behavior under stress. I remember that different children have different coping mechanisms based on their temperament. High activity levels might be associated with a certain type of temperament, perhaps approaching situations with more energy and movement.\n\nIn stressful situations, some children might channel their energy into more activity, possibly nonproductive motor activity, as option C suggests. This could be a way for them to release tension or cope with the pressure physically.\n\nOn the other hand, becoming anxious (option A) is a possible reaction, but maybe more common in children who are already prone to anxiety, not necessarily those with high activity levels.\n\nBecoming passive (option B) seems unlikely for high-energy children, as they are more likely to express themselves through action rather than inaction.\n\nAs for option D, while some children might become aggressive under pressure, it's important to note that not all high-activity-level children would resort to physical or behavioral abuse. This might be more related to other factors, such as upbringing or the specific circumstances.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option C, increasing nonproductive motor activity, is the most appropriate answer. It aligns with the idea that children with high activity levels would express their reactions to pressure through increased physical movement that may not have a clear purpose.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up some research or theories on this topic. Unfortunately, I don't have access to specific studies right now, but based on general knowledge and reasoning, I'll go with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
