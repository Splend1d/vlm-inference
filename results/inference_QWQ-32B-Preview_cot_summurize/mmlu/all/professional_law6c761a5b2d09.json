Thereafter, the property owner constructed a shopping center on the property and leased commercial buildings and parking facilities to various tenants. The shopping center, which was located near a public high school, attracted many teenagers who often loitered in the parking lot. The youths frequently harassed shoppers and damaged autos by breaking off windshield wipers and radio antennas. Customarily, the local police department patrolled the shopping center and drove by three or four times each day. This, however, did not prevent the teenagers from hanging out at the shopping center.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this law problem. So, there's a property owner who has a 20-acre tract outside the city, and they built a shopping center there. They leased the buildings and parking to different tenants. The shopping center is near a high school, and lots of teenagers hang out there, sometimes causing trouble like harassing shoppers and damaging cars. The police used to patrol the area a few times a day, but that didn't stop the teenagers from loitering.\n\nOne day, a shopper's car was damaged by a rock thrown by an unknown youth while she was shopping. Now, she's suing the property owner for the damage to her car. The question is, will she most likely:\n\nA. Win, unless the person who damaged her car can be identified.\n\nB. Win, if the damage could have been prevented with better security measures by the property owner.\n\nC. Not win, because the car was damaged by a third person's malicious act.\n\nD. Not win, because the police were responsible for providing security.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand the legal principles here. It seems like the shopper is claiming that the property owner is liable for the damage to her car caused by these teenagers.\n\nI think this might relate to premises liability, which is when a property owner is responsible for injuries or damages that occur on their property due to their negligence or failure to maintain safety.\n\nIn this case, the property owner owns the shopping center and the parking lot. So, they might have a duty to provide a certain level of security for shoppers and their property.\n\nThe fact that the police patrolled the area but didn't prevent the teenagers from loitering suggests that even with some police presence, the problems persisted.\n\nNow, option A says she'll prevail unless the person who damaged her car can be identified. But in many cases, you don't need to identify the specific person who caused the damage to hold someone liable, especially if it's due to a general condition or failure to maintain safety.\n\nOption B says she'll prevail if the damage could have been prevented with reasonable security measures. This sounds a lot like premises liability, where the property owner is expected to take reasonable steps to protect shoppers from foreseeable harm.\n\nOption C says she won't prevail because it was a third person's malicious act. But in premises liability, sometimes property owners can be held liable for acts of third parties if they were foreseeable and reasonable steps could have been taken to prevent them.\n\nOption D says she won't prevail because the police had the primary duty to provide security. This might suggest that the property owner isn't responsible because the police are supposed to handle such issues. But I'm not sure if that's accurate in this context.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the property owner knew or should have known that there was a problem with teenagers loitering and causing trouble, and that shoppers were at risk, then perhaps they have a duty to take additional security measures beyond what the police are providing.\n\nMaybe they could have hired private security, installed better lighting, or taken other steps to make the area safer.\n\nIf they didn't take such steps, and a shopper's car got damaged as a result, then it's possible that the property owner could be held liable.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps the property owner can argue that providing security is the responsibility of the police, and they can't be expected to duplicate those efforts.\n\nBut I think in premises liability, the property owner has a responsibility to ensure the safety of their premises for shoppers, especially if there's a known issue with vandalism and harassment.\n\nSo, maybe option B is the correct answer: the shopper will prevail if the damage could have been prevented with reasonable security measures taken by the property owner.\n\nOption C says she won't prevail because it's a third person's malicious act. But in some jurisdictions, property owners can be liable for third-party actions if they fail to provide adequate security.\n\nOption D says she won't prevail because the police had the primary duty. But again, in premises liability, the property owner still has responsibilities beyond what the police do.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the most likely correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's consider option A: she'll prevail unless the person who damaged her car can be identified. This seems similar to holding the property owner liable for the acts of an unknown person, which might not be standard in premises liability.\n\nIn many cases, you need to show that the property owner's negligence contributed to the incident, not just that someone caused damage.\n\nSo, perhaps B is better because it specifically mentions reasonable security measures, which directly relates to the property owner's duty of care.\n\nOption C might be tempting, but it seems to suggest that the property owner can't be held liable for third-party actions, which isn't always the case in premises liability.\n\nOption D places the blame on the police, but again, in premises liability, the property owner has their own responsibilities.\n\nTherefore, I believe the shopper will most likely prevail if she can show that the damage to her car could have been prevented had the property owner taken reasonable security measures.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
