The stages are:\n\n1. **Precontemplation**: The individual has no intention to change behavior in the near future and may not recognize the need for change.\n\n2. **Contemplation**: The individual is aware that a problem exists and is considering making a change but has not yet made a commitment to take action.\n\n3. **Preparation**: The individual intends to take action in the immediate future and may begin taking small steps toward behavior change. Typically, this stage involves planning to take action within the next month, but sometimes it can be within the next six months.\n\n4. **Action**: The individual has made specific, observable modifications in their behavior, experiences, or environment in the past six months.\n\n5. **Maintenance**: The individual works to prevent relapse and consolidate the gains attained during action. This stage lasts as long as necessary to prevent returning to previous behaviors.\n\n6. **Termination**: The individual has no temptation and is confident that they will not return to their old habits.\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer is C. preparation, as it is in this stage that individuals plan to take action within the next six months to alter their problematic behavior."
