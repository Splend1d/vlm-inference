                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement is about T-scores. I know that T-scores are a type of standard score, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me recall what I've learned about standard scores and then look at each option.\n\nFirst off, standard scores are used to express how far a raw score is from the mean in terms of standard deviations (SD). The most common type of standard score is the z-score, which directly tells you the number of standard deviations a score is above or below the mean. For example, a z-score of +1.0 means the score is one standard deviation above the mean.\n\nNow, T-scores are another type of standard score, often used in psychological testing. I think they are transformed z-scores, scaled to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. This scaling makes it easier to interpret scores without dealing with negative numbers, as z-scores can be negative.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. \"Shows how many standard deviations a score is above or below the mean: a score of +1.0 means it\u2019s 1 SD above the mean.\"\n\nThis sounds like a description of z-scores. It directly states that the score indicates the number of standard deviations from the mean, which is the definition of a z-score. So, this doesn't seem to be about T-scores.\n\nB. \"M=50, SD=10 - it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI.\"\n\nThis looks promising. M=50 and SD=10 are characteristic of T-scores. The MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) is a psychological test that uses T-scores to report results. So, this seems like a likely candidate.\n\nC. \"Standard nine: M=5, SD=approx 2\"\n\nI'm not familiar with \"standard nine,\" but from what I can gather, it seems like another type of standard score with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of approximately 2. This doesn't match the properties of T-scores, so it's probably not the correct choice.\n\nD. \"M=100, SD=15 or 16\"\n\nThis sounds like IQ scores, which often have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 or 16, depending on the test. While this is another type of standard score, it's not specifically about T-scores.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B seems to be the correct statement about T-scores. It mentions the mean and standard deviation that are characteristic of T-scores and references a psychological test that uses them.\n\nTo double-check, I can recall that T-scores are designed to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, which makes it easy to interpret scores where 50 is average, scores above 50 are above average, and scores below 50 are below average. This scaling is particularly useful in psychological assessments to avoid negative scores and to provide a more intuitive scale.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: M=50, SD=10 - it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
