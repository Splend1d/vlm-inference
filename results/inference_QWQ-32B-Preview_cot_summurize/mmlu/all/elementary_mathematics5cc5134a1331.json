                    "text": "Let's see. I have this number pattern that starts with 28, and each next number is gotten by adding 14. So, the pattern is 28, 42, 56, 70, and so on. The question is asking which statement is true about these numbers.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. All numbers can be divided equally by 10.\n\nB. All numbers can be divided equally by 4.\n\nC. All numbers can be divided equally by 8.\n\nD. All numbers can be divided equally by 7.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which of these divisors\u201410, 4, 8, or 7\u2014can divide every number in this pattern without leaving a remainder.\n\nFirst, let's list out a few terms of the pattern to see if I can spot a pattern or a common characteristic.\n\nStarting with 28, and adding 14 each time:\n\n1st term: 28\n\n2nd term: 28 + 14 = 42\n\n3rd term: 42 + 14 = 56\n\n4th term: 56 + 14 = 70\n\n5th term: 70 + 14 = 84\n\n6th term: 84 + 14 = 98\n\n7th term: 98 + 14 = 112\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, let's check each option:\n\nOption A: Divisible by 10.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112.\n\nIs 28 divisible by 10? 28 \u00f7 10 = 2.8, which is not a whole number. So, no.\n\nIs 42 divisible by 10? 42 \u00f7 10 = 4.2, again not a whole number.\n\n70 is divisible by 10 (70 \u00f7 10 = 7), but not all numbers in the pattern are divisible by 10. For example, 28 and 42 are not. So, option A is not correct.\n\nOption B: Divisible by 4.\n\nLet's check:\n\n28 \u00f7 4 = 7, which is a whole number.\n\n42 \u00f7 4 = 10.5, which is not a whole number.\n\n56 \u00f7 4 = 14, whole number.\n\n70 \u00f7 4 = 17.5, not a whole number.\n\n84 \u00f7 4 = 21, whole number.\n\n98 \u00f7 4 = 24.5, not a whole number.\n\n112 \u00f7 4 = 28, whole number.\n\nSo, some numbers are divisible by 4, but not all. For example, 42 and 70 are not. Therefore, option B is not correct.\n\nOption C: Divisible by 8.\n\nLet's check:\n\n28 \u00f7 8 = 3.5, not a whole number.\n\n42 \u00f7 8 = 5.25, not a whole number.\n\n56 \u00f7 8 = 7, whole number.\n\n70 \u00f7 8 = 8.75, not a whole number.\n\n84 \u00f7 8 = 10.5, not a whole number.\n\n98 \u00f7 8 = 12.25, not a whole number.\n\n112 \u00f7 8 = 14, whole number.\n\nAgain, not all numbers are divisible by 8. So, option C is not correct.\n\nOption D: Divisible by 7.\n\nLet's check:\n\n28 \u00f7 7 = 4, whole number.\n\n42 \u00f7 7 = 6, whole number.\n\n56 \u00f7 7 = 8, whole number.\n\n70 \u00f7 7 = 10, whole number.\n\n84 \u00f7 7 = 12, whole number.\n\n98 \u00f7 7 = 14, whole number.\n\n112 \u00f7 7 = 16, whole number.\n\nHmm, all these numbers are divisible by 7. Let's see if this pattern holds for any number in the sequence.\n\nThe general term of the sequence can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 28 + (n - 1) * 14, where n is the position in the sequence.\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = 28 + 14n - 14\n\na_n = 14n + 14\n\na_n = 14(n + 1)\n\nNow, since 14 is divisible by 7 (14 \u00f7 7 = 2), and (n + 1) is an integer for any positive integer n, then a_n is always divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, all numbers in the pattern are divisible by 7.\n\nSo, option D is correct.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about why the other options aren't correct.\n\nOption A: Not all numbers end with a 0, which is necessary for divisibility by 10.\n\nOption B: Divisibility by 4 requires that the last two digits form a number that's divisible by 4. For example, 42 ends with 42, and 42 \u00f7 4 = 10.5, which is not a whole number. Similarly, 70 ends with 70, and 70 \u00f7 4 = 17.5, not a whole number.\n\nOption C: Divisibility by 8 requires that the last three digits form a number that's divisible by 8. For example, 28 is not divisible by 8, and 42 is not, as shown earlier.\n\nOption D: As shown, all terms are divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
