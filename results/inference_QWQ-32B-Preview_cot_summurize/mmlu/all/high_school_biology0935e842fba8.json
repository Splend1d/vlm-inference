                    "text": "Let's tackle this genetics problem step by step. So, we have two guinea pigs with black coats being crossed, and their offspring have both black and white coats. We're told that black coat is dominant over white coat, and in the offspring, three quarters have black coats and one quarter have white coats. We need to figure out the most likely genotypes of the parents based on this information.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the concept of dominance in genetics. When we say black coat is dominant over white coat, it means that if an individual has at least one dominant allele (let's denote it as B), it will have a black coat. The recessive allele is denoted as b, and only if an individual has two recessive alleles (bb) will it have a white coat.\n\nNow, the parents both have black coats, so their genotypes could be either BB or Bb. The offspring ratios can give us clues about the parents' genotypes.\n\nOption A is bb \u00d7 bb. But wait, bb individuals have white coats, and the parents here have black coats. So, this can't be right.\n\nOption B is Bb \u00d7 Bb. Let's consider what offspring would result from this cross. If both parents are Bb, then the possible combinations are:\n\n- B from parent 1 and B from parent 2: BB\n\n- B from parent 1 and b from parent 2: Bb\n\n- b from parent 1 and B from parent 2: Bb\n\n- b from parent 1 and b from parent 2: bb\n\nSo, the expected ratio is 1 BB : 2 Bb : 1 bb. Since BB and Bb both have black coats, and bb has a white coat, the phenotypic ratio would be 3 black : 1 white. That matches exactly with the observation in the problem: three quarters black and one quarter white.\n\nOption C is Bb \u00d7 bb. Let's see what that gives:\n\n- B from parent 1 and b from parent 2: Bb\n\n- b from parent 1 and b from parent 2: bb\n\nSo, the offspring would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). But in the problem, it's three quarters black and one quarter white, so this doesn't match.\n\nOption D is BB \u00d7 Bb.\n\n- B from parent 1 and B from parent 2: BB\n\n- B from parent 1 and b from parent 2: Bb\n\nSo, all offspring would be either BB or Bb, both of which have black coats. But in the problem, there are white-coated offspring, so this can't be the case.\n\nTherefore, the most likely genotypes of the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option B.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the punnett square for Bb \u00d7 Bb:\n\n```\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 B \u00a0 \u00a0b\n\nB \u00a0BB \u00a0 Bb\n\nb \u00a0Bb \u00a0 bb\n\n```\n\nAs we can see, three out of four squares have at least one B, resulting in black coats, and one square has bb, resulting in a white coat. This matches the observed ratio in the offspring.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
