                    "text": "Let's see, I need to figure out which procedure a CPA usually performs when reviewing the financial statements of a nonissuer. So, first things first, I should understand what a nonissuer is. A nonissuer is a company that doesn't have publicly traded securities, meaning its stocks or bonds aren't traded on public exchanges. So, it's a private company or a small public company that doesn't have to follow the same reporting requirements as larger public companies.\n\nNow, a CPA, or Certified Public Accountant, reviews these financial statements to provide some assurance to the users that the statements are fairly presented. This is different from an audit, which provides a higher level of assurance. In a review engagement, the CPA doesn't perform as much testing and procedures as in an audit.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Make inquiries of management concerning restrictions on the availability of cash balances.\n\nThis seems like something a CPA might do. Inquiring about restrictions on cash could be important because restrictions can affect the company's liquidity and ability to pay its bills. However, I'm not sure if this is a standard procedure in a review engagement.\n\nB. Communicate deficiencies in the design of internal control to the entity's audit committee.\n\nHmm, this sounds more like an audit procedure. In an audit, CPAs do assess internal controls, especially for issuers, but for a nonissuer review, I don't think this is a standard procedure. Reviews of nonissuer financial statements don't typically include an evaluation of internal controls.\n\nC. Examine trend analysis to determine the appropriateness of the CPA's assessment of detection risk.\n\nThis sounds a bit technical. Detection risk is a concept in auditing that relates to the risk that the auditor's procedures will not detect a material misstatement. In a review engagement, the CPA performs analytical procedures, which could include trend analysis, to identify any unusual items or potential misstatements. So, this seems plausible.\n\nD. Evaluate management's plans for dealing with negative trends and financial difficulties.\n\nThis also seems relevant. If there are negative trends or financial difficulties, it's important for the CPA to understand management's plans to address these issues, as they could affect the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nBetween C and D, I think D is more directly related to the review procedure. In a review, the CPA is supposed to read the financial statements and perform analytical procedures to determine whether they appear appropriate. If there are negative trends or financial difficulties, evaluating management's plans would be crucial.\n\nWait, but option A also seems important. Restrictions on cash balances could indicate liquidity problems, which are related to financial difficulties. So, maybe A is also a procedure they perform.\n\nBut the question is asking for which procedure the CPA usually performs in a review engagement. I think options C and D are more directly related to the review procedures.\n\nLet me think about this differently. In a review, the CPA doesn't perform an in-depth evaluation of internal controls, so option B is less likely. Option A is about inquiring about restrictions on cash, which is important, but I'm not sure if it's a standard procedure in a review.\n\nOption C is about using trend analysis to assess detection risk, which seems like an analytical procedure that CPAs would perform in a review to understand the financial statements better.\n\nOption D is about evaluating management's plans in response to negative trends and financial difficulties, which is important for assessing the going concern assumption.\n\nI think both C and D are procedures that CPAs would perform in a review engagement, but if I had to choose one, I'd go with D because it directly deals with the assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern, which is a critical aspect of financial statement review.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nd."
