On May 10, without notif'ing the retailer, the collector sold her coin collection to a novice collector, for $60,000. The next day, the collector sent a letter to the retailer, regretfully informing him that she had sold the coin collection. This letter was received by the retailer on May 13. However, on May 12, the retailer read an article on the internet, published by a reputable site that reports coin collecting news, concerning the collector's sale of her coin collection to the novice collector. After reading the article, the retailer immediately sent an e-mail to the collector accepting her offer to buy the coin collection. This e-mail was read by the collector that same afternoon, May 12.

                    "text": "So here's this scenario about a coin collector and a retailer. The collector has a big collection and sends a letter on May 1 offering to sell it to the retailer for $50,000, with a deadline of May 15 to accept. The retailer gets the letter on May 3. Then, on May 10, without telling the retailer, the collector sells the collection to another person, a novice collector, for $60,000. On May 11, the collector sends a letter to the retailer saying she's already sold the collection, and the retailer gets this letter on May 13.\n\nBut here's the twist: on May 12, the retailer reads an article online about the collector selling the collection to the novice collector. Right after reading this, the retailer sends an email accepting the original offer from the collector, and the collector reads this email the same afternoon, May 12.\n\nThe question is: Was the retailer's email on May 12 effective as an acceptance?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the collector's May 11 letter did not effectuate a revocation, since it was not received by the retailer until May 13.\n\nB. Yes, because consideration is not necessary under the UCC for the creation of a sale of goods contract.\n\nC. No, because the collector's sale of the coin collection on May 10 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\n\nD. No, because the retailer's reading the article on the internet on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand the basics of offer and acceptance in contract law, especially regarding the revocation of offers and the timing of communications.\n\nIn contract law, an offer can be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance, as long as the revocation is communicated to the offeree before they send acceptance. However, there are some exceptions, like option contracts where the offeree pays consideration for the right to accept within a certain period.\n\nHere, the collector made an offer to the retailer on May 1, with a deadline of May 15. The retailer has until May 15 to accept. The collector then sells the collection to someone else on May 10 and sends a letter to the retailer on May 11 saying she's sold it, which the retailer receives on May 13.\n\nBut the retailer sends acceptance on May 12, before receiving the revocation letter.\n\nSo, the key issue is whether the collector's sale on May 10 and the subsequent letter on May 11 revoking the offer are effective before the retailer's acceptance on May 12.\n\nLet's consider the general rule: An offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance, but the revocation must be communicated to the offeree.\n\nIn this case, the collector sold the collection to someone else on May 10, which might imply an intention to revoke the offer to the retailer, but the revocation letter was sent on May 11 and received on May 13.\n\nThe retailer sent acceptance on May 12, which was read by the collector on the same day.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\n- May 1: Offer made to retailer.\n\n- May 3: Offer received by retailer.\n\n- May 10: Collector sells collection to novice.\n\n- May 11: Collector sends revocation letter.\n\n- May 12: Retailer reads about sale in article and sends acceptance, which is read by collector same day.\n\n- May 13: Revocation letter received by retailer.\n\nNow, under the mailbox rule, acceptance is effective when sent, but only if it is sent before the offer is revoked.\n\nBut here, the revocation was sent on May 11 and received on May 13, after the acceptance was sent on May 12.\n\nSo, according to the mailbox rule, the acceptance is effective when sent, on May 12, and the revocation is effective when received, on May 13.\n\nTherefore, the acceptance would be effective before the revocation.\n\nSo, option A seems plausible: Yes, because the collector's May 11 letter did not effectuate a revocation since it was not received by the retailer until May 13.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider.\n\nThe collector sold the collection to the novice on May 10. Does this sale terminate the offer to the retailer?\n\nUnder UCC \u00a7 2-206(1), an offer to buy or sell goods may be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance, but not if the offer is irrevocable under law or by agreement.\n\nIs there any provision making the offer irrevocable?\n\nWell, under UCC \u00a7 2-205, a firm offer by a merchant is irrevocable for the time stated or a reasonable time up to three months, even without consideration, if it's in writing and signed.\n\nIs the collector a merchant? Maybe, but it's not specified. Assuming not, then perhaps this doesn't apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps under the UCC, an offer can't be revoked if the offeree has relied on it to their detriment, but that's promissory estoppel, which requires reliance and detriment.\n\nHere, the retailer didn't act based on the offer before May 12, so maybe not applicable.\n\nAnother consideration: Did the collector's sale to the novice on May 10 constitute a revocation of the offer to the retailer?\n\nPerhaps. By selling to someone else, the collector can't perform the original offer to the retailer, so it might be implied that the offer is revoked.\n\nBut, generally, an offer can be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance, and selling to someone else would support revocation.\n\nHowever, the revocation must be communicated to the offeree to be effective.\n\nHere, the collector sent a letter on May 11 notifying the retailer of the sale, but it was received on May 13.\n\nSo, again, the acceptance was sent on May 12, before the revocation was received.\n\nTherefore, the acceptance should be effective.\n\nBut option C says no, because the collector's sale on May 10 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\n\nThis seems similar to the argument that by selling to someone else, the offer is revoked.\n\nBut, as per the communication requirement, since the revocation wasn't received until May 13, the acceptance sent on May 12 should be effective.\n\nSo, option A seems more correct.\n\nOption B says yes, because consideration is not necessary under the UCC for the creation of a sale of goods contract.\n\nWell, under the UCC, a contract for the sale of goods can be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct on the part of both parties.\n\nSo, consideration is not necessarily required in the same way as in common law contracts.\n\nBut in this case, the issue is not about consideration but about the effectiveness of acceptance versus revocation.\n\nSo, option B might be somewhat irrelevant to the issue at hand.\n\nOption D says no, because the retailer's reading the article on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\n\nThis is an interesting point.\n\nDid the retailer lose the power of acceptance by learning that the collector had already sold the collection?\n\nUnder UCC \u00a7 2-206(2), if the offer specifies a time for acceptance and the offeree accepts after learning that the offer has been revoked, the acceptance is ineffective unless the offeree relies on the offer in good faith and revocation is ineffective under subsection (3).\n\nSubsection (3) deals with firm offers by merchants, which may not apply here.\n\nSo, here, the retailer accepted on May 12 after reading about the sale on May 12.\n\nDid this knowledge terminate the power of acceptance?\n\nUnder \u00a7 2-206(2), if the offeree accepts after learning of revocation, the acceptance is ineffective, unless there's good faith reliance.\n\nBut in this case, the revocation was not yet received by the retailer on May 12.\n\nHowever, the retailer learned from another source that the collector had sold the collection.\n\nSo, perhaps this constitutes knowledge that the offer was revoked, even if the revocation letter hadn't been received yet.\n\nTherefore, the acceptance might be ineffective.\n\nThis aligns with option D.\n\nBut contrast this with option A, which says the revocation didn't take effect because it wasn't received.\n\nSo, there's a conflict here.\n\nPerhaps both arguments have merit.\n\nLet me try to reconcile them.\n\nOn one hand, the revocation letter was sent on May 11 but received on May 13, after the acceptance was sent on May 12.\n\nSo, under the mailbox rule, the acceptance should be effective.\n\nOn the other hand, the retailer learned from another source on May 12 that the collector had sold the collection, which might imply that the offer was revoked before the acceptance was sent.\n\nSo, perhaps the acceptance is ineffective because the retailer knew, or should have known, that the offer was no longer open.\n\nThis is a tricky distinction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reading of the article doesn't constitute actual knowledge of revocation, since the revocation letter hadn't been received yet.\n\nBut the article reports that the collector sold the collection, which would suggest that the offer to the retailer is no longer valid.\n\nSo, perhaps the retailer should have understood that the offer was revoked as of May 10, even without receiving the revocation letter.\n\nTherefore, accepting after learning this information might make the acceptance ineffective.\n\nThis seems to support option D.\n\nHowever, under the UCC, revocation generally requires communication to the offeree.\n\nBut here, the offeree learned through another channel that the offer was no longer valid.\n\nIs that equivalent to communication by the offeror?\n\nMaybe.\n\nIt's similar to learning that the offer has been withdrawn or that performance is impossible.\n\nIn such cases, the power of acceptance is terminated.\n\nTherefore, even though the revocation letter wasn't received, the retailer's knowledge from another source might terminate the power of acceptance.\n\nThis would mean that option D is correct: No, because the retailer's reading the article on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\n\nOption C suggests that the sale on May 10 terminated the power of acceptance.\n\nWhile that might be true in terms of the collector's ability to perform, the formal termination would require communication to the retailer, which didn't happen until May 13.\n\nBut, given that the retailer learned independently on May 12, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nIn conclusion, option D seems to be the most accurate, as the retailer's knowledge from the article on May 12 would terminate the power of acceptance, making the subsequent acceptance ineffective.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
