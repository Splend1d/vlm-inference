                    "text": "Let's dive into these options to figure out which one best illustrates a negative externality and suggests the right approach to eliminate it. First off, what's a negative externality? It's when an individual or a company engages in an activity that imposes a cost on society or the environment without bearing the full cost themselves. So, pollution is a classic example because the polluter doesn't pay for the health issues or environmental damage their actions cause.\n\nOption A: Air pollution from a factory harming children in a small community. The proposed solution is to tax the citizens of the community. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. The factory is the one causing the pollution, so shouldn't they be the ones facing some kind of penalty or regulation to curb their emissions? Taxing the citizens who are already suffering from the pollution seems unfair. So, this doesn't sound like the best example.\n\nOption B: Your neighbor plants a fragrant blooming cherry tree in her front yard. The proposed solution is to give a tree subsidy to your neighbor. Now, planting a tree is generally a positive thing, as it can provide oxygen, shade, and beauty to the neighborhood. This seems more like a positive externality, where the neighbor's action benefits others without them being compensated for it. Offering a subsidy could be a way to encourage more of these positive actions, but the question is about negative externalities. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: The waste from a hog farm pollutes a neighbor's drinking water. The proposed solution is to give a subsidy to the hog farmer. Wait a minute, the hog farm is causing pollution, which is a negative externality. Subsidizing them wouldn't address the issue; in fact, it might encourage more of the same harmful behavior. Instead, perhaps there should be regulations or taxes on the farm to incentivize them to reduce their pollution. So, this doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption D: Air pollution from a power plant is harming trees in your community. The proposed solution is to tax the production of electricity. This seems more aligned with addressing a negative externality. By taxing the production of electricity, especially if the tax reflects the social cost of the pollution, it can encourage the power plant to reduce its emissions or invest in cleaner technologies. This is a common economic approach to internalizing the external cost.\n\nComparing all these options, Option D appears to be the best example of a negative externality with an appropriate plan to eliminate it. The power plant is causing pollution, which harms the community's trees, and taxing the production of electricity can help reduce that pollution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
