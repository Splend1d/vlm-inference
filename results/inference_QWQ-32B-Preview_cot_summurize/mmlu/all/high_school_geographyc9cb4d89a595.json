                    "text": "Let's see. I need to find out which statement about the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is not correct. I know that the EEZ is an area where a country has special rights over the natural resources, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The EEZ extends up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the coastline.\" I think that sounds right. I remember that the EEZ gives a country control over a 200-nautical-mile zone from its coast. So, that seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"Countries have the right to exploit natural resources in their EEZ.\" Yeah, that's the whole point of the EEZ. Countries can exploit both living and non-living resources within their EEZ. So, this should be correct too.\n\nOption C: \"Countries can exploit resources on the continental shelf extending up to 350 nautical miles (560 km) beyond their EEZ.\" Hmm, I know that the continental shelf can extend beyond the EEZ, but I'm not sure about the exact distance. Maybe 350 nautical miles is correct, but I need to confirm that.\n\nOption D: \"A country does not have the right to exploit living resources in its EEZ.\" Wait a minute, this contradicts what I know about EEZs. If a country has an EEZ, doesn't it have the right to exploit both living and non-living resources there?\n\nLet me double-check. The EEZ is defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which grants coastal states sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting natural resources, both living and non-living, within their EEZ up to 200 nautical miles from their coast.\n\nSo, according to UNCLOS, countries do have the right to exploit living resources in their EEZ. Therefore, statement D seems incorrect.\n\nBut let me make sure about option C. I think the continental shelf can extend beyond the EEZ, up to a certain limit. According to UNCLOS, the continental shelf may extend beyond 200 nautical miles, but there are provisions and limits based on geological and bathymetric criteria. So, while 350 nautical miles might be possible in some cases, it's not a fixed rule. Maybe the statement is too generalized.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the statement that is NOT correct. Between option C being somewhat accurate depending on the situation and option D being outright incorrect, I think option D is clearly the wrong statement.\n\nSo, my answer is D. A country does not have the right to exploit living resources in its EEZ.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
