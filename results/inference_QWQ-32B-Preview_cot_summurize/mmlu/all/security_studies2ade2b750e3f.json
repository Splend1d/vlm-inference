The impact of environmental problems seems unlikely to diminish so that the relevance of environmental security for policy will likely increase, particularly multilateral action on common security concerns to achieve forms of social organization that are ecologically sustainable. In some sense, current practices of national security are an impediment to achieving environmental security for all people.\n\nLet me explain why I think this is the best choice.\n\nFirst, option A suggests that after 9/11, there was a reversion to traditional security thinking, and environmental security would still get attention from analysts and policymakers. While that might have been the case initially, over time, the urgency of environmental issues has grown, and they have become more integrated into security discourse. So, while environmental security does get attention, the trend is towards recognizing it as a critical component of overall security, not just a niche area.\n\nOption B talks about increasing evidence of negative environmental effects influencing national security interests. This is certainly true, and it does lead to national unilateral actions to protect their own interests. However, the problem with unilateral approaches is that environmental issues are often transnational, and unilateral actions can sometimes exacerbate problems for other nations, potentially leading to conflicts. So, while national interests drive actions, this approach might not be sustainable in the long run.\n\nOption C asserts that national security practices are the most effective means to achieve environmental security reforms. It emphasizes the state's capabilities, such as control over violence and centralized resources, which make it suitable for entering into transnational agreements. While states do have these capabilities, the reality is that environmental challenges often require cooperative, multilateral approaches because they don't respect national borders. Climate change, for example, affects everyone, and no single nation can solve it alone.\n\nOption D, which I think is the best answer, acknowledges that environmental problems are not going away and that their impact will likely increase. Therefore, the relevance of environmental security in policy will grow, especially the need for multilateral action to address common security concerns. It also suggests that current national security practices might be an impediment to achieving environmental security for all, implying that a shift towards more cooperative and sustainable forms of social organization is necessary.\n\nThis aligns with the growing recognition that environmental security is not just about protecting nations from external threats but also about ensuring the sustainability of the planet for all its inhabitants. It highlights the need for international cooperation and suggests that traditional national security approaches, which often prioritize state interests over global ones, might need to be rethought.\n\nIn summary, while all options have elements of truth, option D best captures the long-term trends in environmental security by emphasizing the increasing importance of multilateral action and the need to move beyond traditional national security practices to achieve ecological sustainability.\n\n"
