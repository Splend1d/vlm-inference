I think it means that the document is private and not open to just anyone to see. So, it's something that's protected and only certain people are allowed to access it.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: a government 'white paper'. I know that white papers are usually documents that present the government's policy proposals or decisions. I think these are meant to be public, right? So, people can access them to understand the government's stance on certain issues. So, probably not closed access.\n\nOption B: confidential medical records. Hmm, medical records are definitely personal. They contain sensitive information about a person's health, which is private and protected by laws like HIPAA in the US. So, these should have closed access, only accessible to the person themselves and perhaps their healthcare providers and authorized persons.\n\nOption C: household account book. This seems like a personal financial record. It would include information about income, expenses, savings, etc., which are private details about a person's financial situation. So, this should also have closed access, only for the household members or whoever is authorized to manage the finances.\n\nOption D: the shares register of a business. Now, this depends on the type of business. If it's a public company, the share register might be a matter of public record, at least in terms of who the major shareholders are. But for private companies, the share register could be more private. However, I think generally, share registers can be accessed by certain authorities or for specific purposes, but not just anyone can access them. So, it might have some level of closed access.\n\nWait, but the question is about personal documents. Is a shares register a personal document? Well, if it's a personal business or something, maybe, but it seems more like a business document rather than a strictly personal one.\n\nComparing all the options, confidential medical records and household account books seem like the most personal and with the strictest closed access.\n\nBut the question asks for which ONE is a personal document with closed access. So, I need to choose the best answer.\n\nMaybe between B and C, but perhaps confidential medical records are more universally considered to have closed access due to privacy laws and ethical considerations.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. confidential medical records.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
