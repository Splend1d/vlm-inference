                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character drank four glasses of water before driving to work. Drinking water is generally considered a healthy and normal activity. There's no immediate moral issue with drinking water. However, I need to consider if drinking that much water before driving could potentially be a problem. For example, if someone drinks an excessive amount of water and becomes intoxicated by it, which is possible but rare, or if they are driving and need to use the bathroom urgently, which could be a distraction. But four glasses seem like a reasonable amount, and unless there are specific circumstances not mentioned, it doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character installed cameras in every bathroom stall to catch anyone who might draw graffiti. This seems more problematic from a moral standpoint. Installing cameras in bathroom stalls raises significant privacy concerns. Bathrooms are places where people expect a high degree of privacy, and installing cameras there without proper justification could be considered invasive and a violation of privacy rights.\n\nMoreover, the purpose is to catch people who might draw graffiti. While preventing vandalism is a legitimate concern, the means to achieve that goal need to respect individuals' rights, especially in private spaces like bathroom stalls. There might be less intrusive ways to monitor for graffiti without invading people's privacy in such a sensitive area.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, installing cameras in bathroom stalls would likely be seen as morally wrong due to the invasion of privacy.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nScenario 1: Drinking water before driving seems neutral or positive. No moral wrongdoing.\n\nScenario 2: Installing cameras in bathroom stalls is invasive and disrespectful of privacy, hence morally wrong.\n\nSo, C. Not wrong, Wrong, seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
