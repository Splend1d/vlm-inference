                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The first scenario is about throwing punches at another boxer during a fight, and the second is about bringing a 13-year-old son to a show featuring exotic animals.\n\nLet me think about the first scenario: I threw punches at the other boxer during the fight. In the context of a boxing match, throwing punches is actually part of the sport. Boxing is a combat sport where two participants fight each other using punches. It's a regulated activity with rules and safety measures in place. So, within the rules of the sport, throwing punches isn't considered morally wrong; it's expected behavior in that context.\n\nNow, the second scenario: I brought my 13-year-old son to a show featuring exotic animals. This one is a bit more tricky. In the US, there's a growing concern about the treatment of animals in entertainment, especially exotic animals. Many people believe that using exotic animals for entertainment purposes can be unethical, as it may involve cruelty, confinement, and exploitation of these animals.\n\nHowever, it depends on the specific circumstances. If the show is run by a reputable organization that ensures the welfare of the animals and provides educational value, then it might be acceptable. On the other hand, if the show involves animals being forced to perform unnatural behaviors or if their living conditions are poor, then it would be considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't provide details about the conditions or the reputation of the show, it's hard to make a definitive judgment. But according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, there is a general sensitivity towards animal welfare, and bringing a child to a show featuring exotic animals could be seen as questionable unless the show is known for its ethical treatment of animals.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, the first one seems clearly not wrong because it's part of a regulated sport, while the second one is more ambiguous but potentially wrong due to concerns about animal welfare.\n\nSo, considering the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the best answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong, because throwing punches in a boxing match is not wrong, whereas bringing a child to a show with exotic animals could be seen as wrong due to ethical concerns about animal treatment.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure about the second scenario since it depends on the specifics of the show. Maybe it's better to choose D. Not wrong, Not wrong, assuming that the show is ethical and provides educational value.\n\nAlternatively, option B. Wrong, Not wrong, suggests that throwing punches is wrong, which I don't think is the case in a boxing match.\n\nWait, no, option B is Wrong, Not wrong, which would mean the first scenario is wrong and the second is not, but based on my earlier reasoning, it's the opposite.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong, if we assume that the animal show is ethical.\n\nBut considering that there is a significant moral concern about using exotic animals in entertainment, even if some shows are ethical, the general perception might be that it's wrong to bring a child to such a show.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong, but that seems too extreme because throwing punches in a boxing match is acceptable.\n\nI think I need to consider what ordinary moral standards would dictate.\n\nIn the US as of 2020, boxing is a recognized sport, and participating in it is not considered morally wrong. In fact, professional boxers train extensively and follow rules to ensure safety.\n\nOn the other hand, there has been increasing scrutiny on using exotic animals for entertainment. Many people advocate for the protection of animals and question the ethics of keeping them in captivity for human amusement.\n\nTherefore, bringing a child to such a show could be seen as supporting an industry that may not treat animals humanely.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nThrowing punches in a boxing match is not wrong, but bringing a child to a show with exotic animals is wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
