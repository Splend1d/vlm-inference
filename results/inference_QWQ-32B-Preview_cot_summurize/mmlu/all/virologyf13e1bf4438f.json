The condition affecting the fetus is called congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Among the options provided, the most accurate answer is:\n\nA. By crossing the placenta early in pregnancy and infecting the foetus\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Transmission to the Fetus:**\n   - Rubella virus can cross the placenta from the mother to the developing fetus, particularly during the first trimester when the fetus is most vulnerable to teratogenic effects.\n   - The virus infects the fetus directly, leading to a range of developmental abnormalities.\n\n2. **Mechanism of Damage:**\n   - Once the virus infects the fetus, it can cause cell death and disrupt normal development in various organs, including the heart, eyes, ears, and brain.\n   - The virus can also integrate into the fetal DNA, leading to persistent infection and long-term health issues.\n\n3. **Comparison with Other Options:**\n   - **Option B: By only infecting the placenta**\n     - While the placenta can be infected by the rubella virus, the primary concern is the infection of the fetus itself. Placental infection is a part of the process but not the sole cause of fetal abnormalities.\n   - **Option C: By inducing cytokines and chemokines in the mother**\n     - Although maternal immune responses, including the production of cytokines and chemokines, can affect the fetus, the direct infection of the fetus by the rubella virus is the primary mechanism causing abnormalities.\n   - **Option D: By raising the temperature of the mother and inducing an abnormal immune reaction to the foetus**\n     - Fever in the mother due to rubella infection can be a concern, but it is the direct viral infection of the fetus that leads to the characteristic abnormalities of CRS. An abnormal immune reaction to the fetus is not the primary mechanism in rubella-induced abnormalities.\n\n4. **Prevention:**\n   - Vaccination against rubella is highly effective in preventing CRS. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is routinely administered to children and is crucial for preventing rubella infection in pregnancy.\n\nIn summary, the key mechanism by which rubella causes fetal abnormalities is through the direct transmission of the virus across the placenta to the fetus, leading to infection and subsequent developmental disruptions."
