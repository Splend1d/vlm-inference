                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about prima facie duties as discussed by W.D. Ross. Prima facie duties are those duties that appear to be binding at first glance, but they can be overridden by more important duties in certain situations. Ross identified several such duties in his ethical theory.\n\nThe options given are:\n\nA. the duty to keep promises\n\nB. the duty not to harm others\n\nC. the duty to protect our natural environment\n\nD. the duty of nonmaleficence\n\nI need to figure out which one of these is not a prima facie duty that Ross discusses.\n\nFirst, I recall that Ross talked about duties like fidelity (keeping promises), reparation (compensating for harms), gratitude, justice, beneficence, self-improvement, and nonmaleficence (not harming others). So, options A, B, and D seem to align with what I remember of Ross's duties.\n\nOption A, the duty to keep promises, corresponds to fidelity, which is one of Ross's prima facie duties.\n\nOption B, the duty not to harm others, seems similar to nonmaleficence, which I think is also mentioned by Ross.\n\nOption D, the duty of nonmaleficence, is probably another way of saying the same thing as option B\u2014avoiding harm to others.\n\nNow, option C is about the duty to protect our natural environment. I don't recall Ross discussing environmental duties specifically. His focus was more on duties towards other people, like keeping promises, not harming them, being just, and so on.\n\nRoss's ethical theory is pretty old, developed in the early 20th century, and environmental ethics as a distinct field emerged much later. So, it's unlikely that he would have included a duty specifically related to protecting the natural environment among his prima facie duties.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C, the duty to protect our natural environment, as it is not a prima facie duty that Ross discusses.\n\nTo double-check, I can list out Ross's prima facie duties:\n\n1. Fidelity (keeping promises)\n\n2. Reparation (compensating for harms)\n\n3. Gratitude\n\n4. Justice\n\n5. Beneficence (helping others)\n\n6. Self-improvement\n\n7. Nonmaleficence (not harming others)\n\nNone of these directly mention environmental protection. So, my initial thought seems correct.\n\nI should also consider whether nonmaleficence and the duty not to harm others are the same. It seems like they are; perhaps option B and D are two ways of expressing the same duty. If that's the case, then including both might be a bit redundant, but in the context of the question, they likely refer to the same duty.\n\nIn any case, option C stands out as not being part of Ross's list of prima facie duties.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. the duty to protect our natural environment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
