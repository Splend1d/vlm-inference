Less than 50%\n\nC. More than 50%\n\nD. More than 75%\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a bridge job is. From what I know, a bridge job is temporary work that people take on, often later in life, as a transition between careers or before retirement. It's different from a career job, which is something people pursue long-term in a field they're passionate about.\n\nThe question is asking about the percentage of people who have had bridge jobs and think those jobs were better than their career jobs. So, I need to find some statistics or studies that have looked into how people feel about bridge jobs compared to their career jobs.\n\nI don't have access to specific studies or data right now, but I can try to reason through this.\n\nOption A is less than 25%, which suggests that only a small fraction of people think their bridge job was better. Option B is less than 50%, meaning a minority thinks that way. Option C is more than 50%, suggesting a majority, and Option D is more than 75%, which is a large majority.\n\nI need to think about why someone might prefer a bridge job over their career job. Maybe because it's less stressful, more flexible, or aligns better with their current life stage.\n\nOn the other hand, their career job might have been something they worked hard for, with higher status or better pay, but perhaps it was more demanding or less fulfilling in other ways.\n\nI recall that many people take bridge jobs for the flexibility and to have more time for personal pursuits, which might make them prefer the bridge job especially if their career job was stressful or not as satisfying.\n\nHowever, I also think that some people might look back and value their career job more for the achievements and impact they had in that role.\n\nSo, it's a balance. Maybe around half or a little more than half prefer their bridge job.\n\nBut the options are in percentages, and I need to choose one.\n\nIf I had to guess, I might go with C. More than 50%, because bridge jobs often offer benefits like flexibility and reduced stress, which could make them more appealing to a majority of people who have experienced both.\n\nBut I'm not sure. It could also be that people value their career achievements more, so maybe less than 50% prefer the bridge job.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's split pretty evenly, but since the options are less than or more than 50%, I need to pick one.\n\nMaybe I should consider that bridge jobs are often taken later in life when people prioritize different things, like work-life balance, so they might prefer the bridge job for those reasons.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with C. More than 50% of people who have had bridge jobs say it was better than their career job.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
