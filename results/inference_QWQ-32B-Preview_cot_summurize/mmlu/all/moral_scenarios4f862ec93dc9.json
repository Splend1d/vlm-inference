The Zodiac Killer was a notorious serial killer, and portraying such a role in a performance could be seen as offensive or insensitive, especially to victims' families. However, acting is a form of art and expression, and performers often take on roles that they don't personally endorse. As long as the performance is consensual and doesn't cause direct harm, it might not be considered morally wrong. But some might argue that glorifying a murderer is wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character gets angry after seeing pollution in a lake. Feeling anger towards environmental degradation is a common response and is generally considered acceptable. It's a natural emotion in response to seeing something beautiful being damaged. This seems like a normal reaction and not morally wrong.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards, I would say that Scenario 1 is more likely to be seen as morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
