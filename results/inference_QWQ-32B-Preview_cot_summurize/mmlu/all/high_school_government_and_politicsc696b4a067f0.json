                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about electoral systems and single-member districts. It's asking for a direct result of such a system. The options are:\n\nA. Only two major parties can successfully be supported.\n\nB. National campaigns can be conducted without incurring great expense.\n\nC. Third parties can be as successful as the two major political parties.\n\nD. Each political party tends to focus its campaign on a single issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a single-member district is. In a single-member district, only one person is elected to represent that district, usually in a legislative body like Congress or Parliament. This is different from multi-member districts where multiple people are elected to represent the same district.\n\nNow, I've heard that single-member districts tend to favor a two-party system. Let me think about why that might be. If there's only one seat to win, candidates have to appeal to the majority of voters to get the most votes. In such a system, smaller parties might have a harder time winning because they might get a significant portion of the vote but still not enough to beat the candidates from the larger parties.\n\nSo, option A says only two major parties can successfully be supported. That sounds plausible. But I should check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B says national campaigns can be conducted without incurring great expense. I'm not sure about that. Actually, in single-member districts, campaigns might be focused more locally, but national parties still have to support their candidates across many districts, which could be expensive. So, I'm not convinced by this one.\n\nOption C says third parties can be as successful as the two major political parties. But based on what I just thought about, single-member districts might make it harder for third parties to succeed because they have to win a majority in a district to get any representation at all. So, this seems contradictory to what I'm understanding.\n\nOption D says each political party tends to focus its campaign on a single issue. I don't think that's a direct result of single-member districts. Parties usually have platforms with multiple issues, and even in single-member districts, they need to address a range of concerns important to the voters in that district.\n\nSo, going back to option A, it seems like the most logical choice. Single-member districts tend to lead to a two-party system because it's harder for smaller parties to win seats. The larger parties have more resources and broader appeal, making it difficult for third parties to gain traction.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing about single-member districts. Perhaps they do allow for more diverse representation or something like that. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, in some cases, single-member districts can lead to more representative government because each district can have a representative who closely reflects the views of the local constituents. However, in terms of party representation at the national level, it still tends to favor the two major parties.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any other factors that could influence the success of third parties in single-member districts. For example, election laws, voter preferences, or the presence of runoff elections.\n\nBut generally speaking, in many countries that use single-member districts, like the United States, the two-party system is dominant. Third parties struggle to gain significant representation because they can't win enough districts to have a substantial presence in the legislature.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the correct answer. Only two major parties can successfully be supported in a single-member district electoral system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
