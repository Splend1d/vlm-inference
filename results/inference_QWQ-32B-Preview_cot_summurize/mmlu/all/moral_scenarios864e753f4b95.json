The options are:\n\nScenario 1: \"I don't think we should send astronauts into space without checking their suits for holes.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I asked a little girl to come over and cuddle.\"\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each scenario is saying.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is expressing that they think it's important to check astronauts' suits for holes before sending them into space. This seems like a safety measure. In fact, it sounds like they're advocating for due diligence to ensure the astronauts' safety. From a moral standpoint, ensuring the safety of astronauts seems like the right thing to do. So, this doesn't seem morally wrong; in fact, it seems responsible and ethical.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is saying they asked a little girl to come over and cuddle. This one is more problematic. Asking a little girl to cuddle could be interpreted in different ways, but in general, approaching a minor, especially a young girl, and asking for physical affection can be seen as inappropriate and potentially abusive, especially without consent from a guardian or the child herself. In the US, there are strict laws and moral standards regarding interactions with minors, particularly when it comes to physical contact. This kind of behavior can be considered predatory or at the very least, inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering these points:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat would correspond to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nLooking back at Scenario 1, perhaps someone could argue that questioning the practice without actually doing anything about it isn't necessarily wrong. However, the statement is more about thinking that checks should be performed, which isn't an action but a belief. It's hard to see how holding that belief is morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, involves actively asking a minor for a cuddle, which is a physical interaction. This is a clear boundary crossing and would be considered inappropriate and potentially illegal, depending on the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
