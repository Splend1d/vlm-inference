                    "text": "This question is about contract law, specifically dealing with offers, acceptances, and revocations. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a freight company that was offered a large order of tires from a wholesale tire distributor under specified terms. The purchasing agent then calls the wholesaler to say that the company is facing a critical financial crisis and can't afford to make the purchase. So, the agent is essentially communicating that they won't be accepting the offer.\n\nThen, the seller sends an acceptance form the next day and ships the goods with an invoice. The purchasing company doesn't pay and ships the goods back. The seller sues for lost profit, arguing that the purchasing agent's words didn't clearly revoke the offer.\n\nNow, the question is whether the seller will prevail. The options are:\n\nA. Yes, because a revocation of an offer requires explicit words of rejection to be enforced.\n\nB. Yes, because the seller must be able to rely on a definite order of goods.\n\nC. No, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.\n\nD. No, because a buyer is never in breach of an agreement when it rejects goods prior to their shipment.\n\nLet's consider each option.\n\nOption A says yes, the seller will prevail because revocation requires explicit words of rejection. In contract law, revocation of an offer must be clearly communicated to the offeree to be effective. If the communication is unclear or ambiguous, the offer may still be considered valid.\n\nIn this case, the purchasing agent said, \"We are confronting a critical financial crisis and cannot afford to make the purchase.\" This seems like a clear indication that they are not accepting the offer and, in fact, revoking their interest in the purchase. However, the seller argues that this wasn't a clear revocation.\n\nOption B says yes, the seller will prevail because the seller must be able to rely on a definite order. This touches on the principle of reliance in contract law. If a seller relies on an order being definite and acts upon it by shipping goods, there might be an expectation that the buyer will honor the agreement.\n\nBut in this scenario, the purchasing agent had already communicated that they couldn't make the purchase due to financial issues. So, the seller should have considered this communication as a revocation of the offer before proceeding to ship the goods.\n\nOption C says no, the seller won't prevail because the words of revocation were clear enough. This aligns with what I thought earlier. The purchasing agent clearly stated that they couldn't afford the purchase due to a financial crisis. This seems like a straightforward revocation of the offer.\n\nOption D says no, because a buyer is never in breach when rejecting goods prior to shipment. But in this case, the goods were already shipped by the seller after the buyer had communicated their inability to proceed with the purchase.\n\nWait, the seller shipped the goods after the buyer had revoked the offer. So, perhaps the buyer isn't bound to accept the goods because the offer was revoked before shipment.\n\nHowever, in contract law, if an offer is revoked, it must be done properly, and the revocation must be communicated to the offeree before they act on the offer.\n\nIn this scenario, the purchasing agent communicated the revocation to the wholesaler before the seller sent the acceptance form and shipped the goods.\n\nSo, the key question is whether the purchasing agent's communication was sufficient to revoke the offer.\n\nIn contract law, revocation of an offer must be clear and unambiguous. The language used by the purchasing agent seems clear: \"We are confronting a critical financial crisis and cannot afford to make the purchase.\" This indicates that they are not accepting the offer and are revoking their interest in the purchase.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the revocation was effective, and the seller shouldn't have proceeded with shipping the goods expecting payment.\n\nGiven this analysis, options C and D seem more plausible. Option C states that the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off, which aligns with my understanding.\n\nOption D, however, says that a buyer is never in breach when rejecting goods prior to shipment. But in this case, the seller shipped the goods despite the buyer's revocation, so the buyer isn't rejecting goods that have already been shipped; rather, they are refusing to accept and pay for goods sent after they had revoked the offer.\n\nTherefore, option D might not be entirely accurate because the buyer's rejection comes after the seller's shipment, which complicates the situation.\n\nMoreover, in contract law, if an offer is properly revoked before acceptance, there is no contract formed, and the buyer isn't obligated to accept the goods or pay for them.\n\nIn conclusion, the purchasing agent's communication was likely sufficient to revoke the offer, meaning that the seller shouldn't have proceeded with shipping the goods expecting payment.\n\nTherefore, the seller won't prevail in their suit for lost profit.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C: No, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
