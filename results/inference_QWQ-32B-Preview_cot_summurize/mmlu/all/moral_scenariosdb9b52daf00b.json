Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character tells someone she looks pretty in her new dress. That seems like a nice compliment. It's positive and probably makes the other person feel good. There's nothing morally wrong with giving a compliment.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character tosses their trash into a trash can while walking by it. That sounds like they're disposing of their garbage properly, which is responsible and considerate of the environment. Again, nothing wrong there.\n\nSo, neither scenario involves any morally wrong actions. That's why I chose D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
