Distributors. B. Franchising. C. Merchant. D. Retailers.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to figure out which of these options best fits the description provided. The key points are that they sell directly to end consumers and they may purchase from manufacturers or wholesalers.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these terms means.\n\nA. Distributors: These are companies that handle the distribution of products from manufacturers to retailers or other businesses. They don't typically sell directly to consumers. So, if distributors are handling the logistics of getting products from makers to sellers, they're not the ones selling directly to the end users. That doesn't seem to match the description.\n\nB. Franchising: This is a method of distributing goods or services involving a franchisor and franchisees. The franchisor provides a business model, brand, and support, while the franchisees operate their own units. Franchising is a type of business model, not a direct type of seller to consumers. For example, McDonald's is a franchisor, and the individual McDonald's restaurants are franchisees. While franchisees do sell to end consumers, \"franchising\" as a whole isn't specifically described as selling directly to consumers; it's more about the business model.\n\nC. Merchant: This term is a bit broad. A merchant can be anyone who trades goods or services. In the context of e-commerce, a merchant might be someone who sells products online. However, the term isn't as specific as some of the other options. It could encompass retailers, but it's not exclusively for those selling directly to consumers.\n\nD. Retailers: These are businesses that sell goods or services directly to consumers. They can purchase from manufacturers directly or through wholesalers. This seems to align closely with the description provided. Retailers are the final point of sale before the product reaches the consumer.\n\nGiven these explanations, option D, Retailers, seems to be the best fit for the description. They sell directly to end consumers and may purchase from manufacturers or wholesalers.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if any other option could fit.\n\nOption A, Distributors, as I mentioned, typically don't sell directly to consumers; they handle the distribution between manufacturers and retailers.\n\nOption B, Franchising, is a business model that can include retailers (like fast-food restaurants), but franchising itself isn't synonymous with selling directly to consumers. It's more about how the business is structured and operated.\n\nOption C, Merchant, is quite broad and isn't specifically about selling to end consumers.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D. Retailers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
