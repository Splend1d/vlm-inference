                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about cache memory policies. So, we've got write-through and write-back policies, and write-allocation is always being used. We need to figure out which statement is true based on these assumptions.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what each term means:\n\n- **Hit ratio**: This is the percentage of accesses (both reads and writes) that are satisfied by the cache without needing to go to main memory.\n\n- **Write-through**: With this policy, every write operation not only updates the cache but also immediately updates the main memory.\n\n- **Write-back**: Here, writes only update the cache. The main memory is updated only when the cache line is evicted from the cache.\n\n- **Write-allocation**: This means that when there's a write miss (the data to be written isn't in the cache), a new cache line is allocated and loaded from main memory before performing the write operation.\n\nGiven that write-allocation is always used, we need to compare write-through and write-back policies in terms of hit ratio and the percentage of write operations that result in main memory operations.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n**Option A: Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.**\n\nTo evaluate this, we need to think about how each policy affects the cache's contents and, consequently, the hit ratio.\n\nIn write-through, every write operation updates both the cache and main memory immediately. Since the cache is being kept consistent with main memory for writes, you might think that this could lead to a higher hit ratio because the cache has the most up-to-date data.\n\nHowever, in write-back, writes only update the cache, and main memory is only updated when a cache line is evicted. This means that the cache can have newer data than main memory for some time. Because of this, write-back can potentially keep more data in the cache without needing to evict lines as frequently, which might lead to a higher hit ratio.\n\nBut, considering that write-allocation is always used, which means that on a write miss, a new cache line is allocated and loaded from main memory before performing the write, this might mitigate some differences between the policies.\n\nI'm not entirely sure yet, so let's look at the next options.\n\n**Option B: Write-through usually results in a better hit ratio than write-back.**\n\nThis is the opposite of option A. If write-back can keep data in the cache longer without needing to evict lines immediately, it might lead to a better hit ratio. However, with write-allocation, write misses in both policies will involve loading data into the cache, so perhaps the difference isn't as significant.\n\nMaybe this isn't the case, but I need to think more carefully.\n\n**Option C: The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through.**\n\nIn write-through, every write operation causes an update to main memory. In write-back, writes only cause main memory updates when a cache line is evicted.\n\nSo, for write-through, every write operation has a main memory operation. For write-back, only some writes\u2014those that cause a cache line eviction\u2014have main memory operations.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of write operations resulting in main memory operations is higher for write-through than for write-back.\n\nSo, this statement seems true: write-back will never have a larger percentage of write operations causing main memory operations than write-through.\n\nBut let's confirm this.\n\nIn write-through:\n\n- Every write operation causes a main memory operation.\n\nIn write-back:\n\n- Only writes that cause a cache line to be evicted cause main memory operations.\n\nTherefore, the percentage for write-back is less than or equal to that of write-through.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\n**Option D: The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-through than for write-back.**\n\nThis is the opposite of option C. According to the previous reasoning, this would be false because write-through always has a higher or equal percentage of write operations causing main memory operations compared to write-back.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIf write-allocation is always used, does that affect the percentage of write operations causing main memory operations?\n\nIn write-allocation, on a write miss, a new cache line is allocated and loaded from main memory before performing the write.\n\nIn write-through:\n\n- Write hit: update cache and main memory.\n\n- Write miss: allocate a new cache line, load from main memory, update cache and main memory.\n\nSo, every write operation, whether hit or miss, causes a main memory operation in write-through.\n\nIn write-back:\n\n- Write hit: update cache only.\n\n- Write miss: allocate a new cache line, load from main memory, update cache.\n\nMain memory is only accessed during write misses, and main memory is only updated when a cache line is evicted.\n\nTherefore, in write-back, main memory operations for writes only happen during write misses and during evictions.\n\nIn write-through, every write operation causes a main memory operation.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of write operations causing main memory operations is higher in write-through than in write-back.\n\nHence, option C is correct: the percentage for write-back will never be larger than that for write-through.\n\nOption A says write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about this. The hit ratio depends on various factors like the access pattern, cache size, and associativity.\n\nWrite-back can potentially have a better hit ratio because it keeps data in the cache longer without evicting it immediately, as in write-through.\n\nBut with write-allocation, write misses in both policies involve loading data into the cache, so perhaps the difference is minimal.\n\nHowever, in write-back, since main memory is only updated on eviction, the cache can hold newer data longer, which might lead to more hits.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nOption B is the opposite, suggesting write-through has a better hit ratio, which seems less likely compared to write-back.\n\nGiven that, option A might be true, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nHowever, option C seems clearly correct based on the definitions of write-through and write-back.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
