                    "text": "So I've got this passage from a history book about housing policies in Britain after World War I, and I need to figure out which attitude prevalent after the war is evident in this text. The options are:\n\nA. Women's suffrage should increase\n\nB. Democratization of society\n\nC. Increased disillusionment and cynicism\n\nD. The rise of communism as a world power\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the passage is saying. It mentions \"Addison's Act,\" which was probably a housing act named after someone named Addison. It seems like this act was created because people were afraid that if the working class didn't get what they wanted after the war, there might be a revolution similar to the one in Russia.\n\nSo, after the war, there was a fear of revolution, especially influenced by what happened in Russia with the Bolsheviks. That makes sense because Russia had a communist revolution in 1917, and there were fears in other countries, especially in Europe, that similar uprisings could happen.\n\nBut then it says that by 1920, that fear was beginning to recede. People weren't as worried about revolution anymore, and because of that, Addison's policy was being seen as too expensive or maybe not necessary anymore.\n\nThere's a mention of a specific housing scheme in Kingfield Street that was approved but then deferred by the government's Housing Board. The council was surprised by this decision. Then in May 1921, the government cut the housing target by half, which suggests a significant shift in priorities or perhaps a change in political climate.\n\nSo, what does this tell me about the attitudes after World War I?\n\nOption A is about women's suffrage increasing. While it's true that women's suffrage was a big issue around this time, especially with women gaining the right to vote in some countries after their contributions in the war, this passage doesn't mention anything about women or suffrage. So, I don't think that's the right answer.\n\nOption B is about the democratization of society. Again, democratization could be a post-war trend, but the passage doesn't directly talk about changes in democracy or political systems. It's focused on housing policies and the government's attitude towards them.\n\nOption C is about increased disillusionment and cynicism. After World War I, there was certainly a sense of disillusionment among many people in Europe and elsewhere because of the devastation caused by the war. Perhaps the government's change in attitude towards housing could be seen as cynical or disillusioned, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption D is about the rise of communism as a world power. The passage mentions the fear of a revolution similar to Russia's, which was a communist revolution. So, communism is definitely a theme here.\n\nBut let's look deeper. Initially, there was fear of revolution, but by 1920, that fear was receding. That might suggest that the threat of communism was perceived to be decreasing.\n\nWait, but the act was conceived because of the fear of revolution, and when that fear lessened, the act was seen as extravagant. So, perhaps the attitude is that the initial fear was overblown, and now they're pulling back on the policies that were implemented out of that fear.\n\nBut which of the options best captures this shift?\n\nLet me consider option D again: the rise of communism as a world power. The passage does mention the fear of a revolution similar to Russia's, which was communist. So, the rise of communism was certainly a concern.\n\nBut the passage seems to suggest that by 1920, that fear was beginning to recede. Maybe the government felt that the threat wasn't as imminent anymore, so they could scale back on the housing provisions that were intended to prevent a revolution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the government was becoming more cynical about the need for these housing provisions, thinking that they were too costly and maybe not as necessary as initially thought.\n\nWait, the passage says that the government's housing board deferred the Kingfield Street scheme \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time.\" This sounds like they're being fiscally cautious, perhaps reflecting a broader attitude of conservatism or pragmatism.\n\nBut none of the options directly mention fiscal conservatism or pragmatism.\n\nOption C is about increased disillusionment and cynicism. Maybe the government was becoming disillusioned with the idea that extensive housing programs were necessary to prevent revolution. Perhaps they thought that the initial fears were overblown, and now they could scale back without risking upheaval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the public or the government was disillusioned with the idea that such measures could truly prevent social unrest.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me look back at the passage. It says that Addison's act was conceived out of the belief that working-class aspirations needed to be met quickly after the war to prevent a revolution like in Russia. By 1920, that fear was receding, and his policy was being seen as extravagant.\n\nSo, it seems like initially, there was a sense of urgency and fear that led to a more generous housing policy, but as that fear subsided, the policy was seen as too generous or unnecessary.\n\nThis could reflect a shift towards a more cynical or disillusioned attitude towards the initial fears. Maybe people thought that the threat wasn't as serious as initially believed, and therefore, the expensive housing programs weren't justified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a growing belief that communism wasn't as big a threat as feared, so the measures to counter it could be scaled back.\n\nBut option D is about the rise of communism as a world power, not necessarily about the perception of communism within Britain.\n\nWait, perhaps the rise of communism as a world power was becoming more accepted or less feared by 1920, leading to a reduction in preventive measures like the housing act.\n\nBut that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attitude is that communism is rising, but Britain needs to be more pragmatic and can't afford extensive social programs to counter it.\n\nBut again, that doesn't directly map to any of the options.\n\nLet me consider option C again: increased disillusionment and cynicism.\n\nAfter World War I, there was certainly a sense of disillusionment with the idea that the war would end all wars and bring about a utopian peace. Instead, the peace treaties were seen as flawed, and there was economic turmoil.\n\nPerhaps this housing policy shift reflects a broader disillusionment with the idea that social programs could prevent social unrest. Maybe there was a growing cynicism about the effectiveness of such policies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the government was becoming disillusioned with the cost of these programs and decided to scale back.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider option B: democratization of society.\n\nPerhaps the shift in housing policy reflects a change in how the government viewed its responsibilities to the working class. Maybe there was a move towards greater democratization initially, but then a pullback as fears of revolution subsided.\n\nHowever, the passage doesn't explicitly mention anything about democratization.\n\nOption A is about women's suffrage increasing, which, as I thought earlier, isn't directly addressed in the passage.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is C: increased disillusionment and cynicism.\n\nThe passage seems to indicate a change in attitude from one of fear and urgency to one of cost-cutting and perhaps skepticism about the need for extensive housing programs.\n\nThis could reflect a broader disillusionment with the idea that such measures are necessary to prevent social unrest, or perhaps just a general cynicism about the effectiveness of government spending.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a sign of growing conservatism or a return to pre-war attitudes.\n\nBut since none of the other options seem to fit as well, I'll go with C: increased disillusionment and cynicism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
