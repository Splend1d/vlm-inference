Hmm, I need to figure out what \u22124 plus \u22123 equals.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you add two negative numbers, the result is more negative. Like, if you owe someone money and you owe another person money, in total, you owe even more. So, in this case, \u22124 and \u22123 are both negative numbers, so adding them should give me a number that's even more negative.\n\nLet me think about it on a number line. If I start at \u22124 and I add \u22123, that means I'm moving 3 more steps to the left on the number line, because negative means left. So, starting at \u22124, one step left is \u22125, two steps is \u22126, and three steps is \u22127. So, it seems like \u22124 plus \u22123 is \u22127.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I can think of it in terms of temperatures. If it's \u22124 degrees and the temperature drops by another 3 degrees, what's the new temperature? It would be \u22127 degrees. Okay, that makes sense too.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of addition of negative numbers as subtraction of positive numbers. So, \u22124 + (\u22123) is the same as \u22124 \u2212 3. And \u22124 minus 3 is \u22127.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using the concept of absolute values. The absolute value of \u22124 is 4, and the absolute value of \u22123 is 3. If I add these absolute values, I get 4 + 3 = 7. But since both numbers are negative, the result should also be negative. So, it's \u22127.\n\nOkay, all these methods are leading me to the same answer: \u22127. So, I think the correct choice is A. \u22127.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options. Option B is \u22121. That would be the case if I were adding \u22124 and +3, because \u22124 + 3 = \u22121. But in this problem, it's \u22124 plus \u22123, so that's not correct.\n\nOption C is 1. That would happen if I were adding 4 and \u22123, which is 4 + (\u22123) = 1. But again, the problem is \u22124 plus \u22123.\n\nOption D is 7. That would be the result if both numbers were positive, but they're not.\n\nSo, none of the other options make sense in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is A. \u22127.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
