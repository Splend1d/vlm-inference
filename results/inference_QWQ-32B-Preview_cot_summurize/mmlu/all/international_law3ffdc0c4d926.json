                    "text": "Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the term \"rock\" has a specific legal definition that affects the maritime entitlements of such features. Let's analyze each option to determine which one accurately describes a 'rock' under UNCLOS.\n\nOption A states: \"Rocks are the islands that are less than 10 square miles.\" This option suggests that the size of the island, specifically its land area, determines whether it is classified as a rock. However, UNCLOS does not specify a particular size threshold for defining rocks. Therefore, this option is not accurate.\n\nOption B says: \"Rocks are the islands that do not have any maritime zone.\" This statement implies that rocks do not generate any maritime zones, such as territorial seas or exclusive economic zones (EEZ). While there is some truth to this, it is not entirely accurate because rocks can have a territorial sea, but they do not have an EEZ or continental shelf rights. So, this option is partially correct but not precise.\n\nOption C states: \"Rocks are the islands which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and according to article 121 (3) have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf.\" This option aligns closely with the actual definition under UNCLOS. Article 121(3) of UNCLOS specifies that \"rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.\" Therefore, this seems to be the correct definition.\n\nOption D says: \"Rocks are the small islands that can sustain human habitation.\" This option contradicts the UNCLOS definition because it suggests that rocks can sustain human habitation, which is the opposite of the convention's criteria. According to UNCLOS, rocks are those islands that cannot sustain human habitation or economic life on their own.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is Option C: \"Rocks are the islands which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and according to article 121 (3) have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf.\"\n\nThis definition is crucial in maritime boundary disputes and the delimitation of maritime zones because it determines whether a particular feature can generate full maritime entitlements, including an EEZ and continental shelf, or only a limited zone, such as a territorial sea. Islands that can sustain human habitation or economic life are entitled to the full complement of maritime zones, whereas rocks are limited in their maritime entitlements."
