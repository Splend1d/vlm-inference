                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two objects, A and B, with equal charges and equal masses. They're not moving because the gravitational force between them is balancing the electrostatic force. So, initially, these two forces are equal.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formulas for these forces:\n\n1. **Gravitational Force (Fg):**\n\n\\[ F_g = G \\frac{m_A m_B}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n\n- \\( m_A \\) and \\( m_B \\) are the masses of objects A and B,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between their centers.\n\n2. **Electrostatic Force (Fe):**\n\n\\[ F_e = k \\frac{q_A q_B}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant,\n\n- \\( q_A \\) and \\( q_B \\) are the charges on objects A and B,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between their centers.\n\nGiven that initially \\( F_g = F_e \\), we can set these equal:\n\n\\[ G \\frac{m_A m_B}{r^2} = k \\frac{q_A q_B}{r^2} \\]\n\nSince \\( r^2 \\) is common in both equations, it cancels out:\n\n\\[ G m_A m_B = k q_A q_B \\]\n\nNow, it's given that initially \\( m_A = m_B = m \\) and \\( q_A = q_B = q \\). Plugging these in:\n\n\\[ G m \\cdot m = k q \\cdot q \\]\n\n\\[ G m^2 = k q^2 \\]\n\nOkay, so this is the initial condition for equilibrium.\n\nNow, the mass of object A is halved. So, the new mass of A is \\( \\frac{m}{2} \\), while mass of B remains \\( m \\).\n\nWe need to find what change should be made to maintain equilibrium. That means the new gravitational force should still equal the new electrostatic force.\n\nLet's denote the new charges or masses with a prime ('). We need to find which option keeps \\( F_g' = F_e' \\).\n\nFirst, write the new gravitational force:\n\n\\[ F_g' = G \\frac{\\left( \\frac{m}{2} \\right) m}{r^2} = G \\frac{m^2}{2 r^2} \\]\n\nAnd the new electrostatic force:\n\n\\[ F_e' = k \\frac{q_A' q_B'}{r^2} \\]\n\nWe need:\n\n\\[ G \\frac{m^2}{2 r^2} = k \\frac{q_A' q_B'}{r^2} \\]\n\nAgain, \\( r^2 \\) cancels out:\n\n\\[ G \\frac{m^2}{2} = k q_A' q_B' \\]\n\nFrom the initial condition, we have \\( G m^2 = k q^2 \\). So, let's substitute \\( G m^2 \\) with \\( k q^2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{k q^2}{2} = k q_A' q_B' \\]\n\nThe \\( k \\) cancels out:\n\n\\[ \\frac{q^2}{2} = q_A' q_B' \\]\n\nNow, we need to see which option satisfies this equation.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A: the charge on Object A were doubled**\n\nSo, \\( q_A' = 2q \\), \\( q_B' = q \\):\n\n\\[ q_A' q_B' = (2q)(q) = 2q^2 \\]\n\nBut we need \\( \\frac{q^2}{2} = q_A' q_B' \\), which would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{q^2}{2} = 2q^2 \\]\n\nThis is not true. So, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: the charge on Object B were halved**\n\nSo, \\( q_A' = q \\), \\( q_B' = \\frac{q}{2} \\):\n\n\\[ q_A' q_B' = q \\left( \\frac{q}{2} \\right) = \\frac{q^2}{2} \\]\n\nThis matches the required equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{q^2}{2} = \\frac{q^2}{2} \\]\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\n**Option C: the charge on Object B were doubled**\n\nSo, \\( q_A' = q \\), \\( q_B' = 2q \\):\n\n\\[ q_A' q_B' = q (2q) = 2q^2 \\]\n\nBut we need:\n\n\\[ \\frac{q^2}{2} = 2q^2 \\]\n\nThis is not true. So, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: the mass on Object B were halved**\n\nWait, option D talks about changing the mass of Object B, but the question specifies that only the charge on Object B is to be changed in options B and C. However, to be thorough, let's consider what happens if we halve the mass of Object B.\n\nSo, if \\( m_B' = \\frac{m}{2} \\), then the new gravitational force is:\n\n\\[ F_g' = G \\frac{\\left( \\frac{m}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{m}{2} \\right)}{r^2} = G \\frac{m^2}{4 r^2} \\]\n\nAnd the electrostatic force remains \\( F_e' = k \\frac{q_A q_B}{r^2} = k \\frac{q^2}{r^2} \\)\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n\\[ G \\frac{m^2}{4 r^2} = k \\frac{q^2}{r^2} \\]\n\n\\[ G \\frac{m^2}{4} = k q^2 \\]\n\nBut from the initial condition, \\( G m^2 = k q^2 \\). So:\n\n\\[ \\frac{G m^2}{4} = k q^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{k q^2}{4} = k q^2 \\]\n\nThis is not true unless \\( q = 0 \\), which isn't the case. So, halving the mass of Object B does not maintain equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B: the charge on Object B were halved.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
