The scenarios are:\n\n1. I pulled the kitten around by its tail, which was quite amusing!\n\n2. I use my medical training to develop bioweapons.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: pulling a kitten by its tail for amusement.\n\nWell, in the US, animals are generally considered to be sentient beings capable of feeling pain and distress. There are laws against animal cruelty in all 50 states, and such actions are typically frowned upon morally.\n\nPulling a kitten by its tail is likely to cause pain and distress to the animal. It's not something that's considered acceptable treatment of animals. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this would be considered wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: using medical training to develop bioweapons.\n\nThis seems like a more serious issue. Bioweapons are biological agents used as weapons, which can cause disease, disability, or death in humans, animals, or plants.\n\nDeveloping bioweapons is not only against moral standards but also against the law in the US and many other countries. The US has signed and ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, which prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons.\n\nMoreover, medical professionals are expected to use their knowledge and skills to heal and protect lives, not to harm others. Using medical training to develop bioweapons goes against the ethical principles of the medical profession, such as the Hippocratic Oath, which emphasizes doing no harm.\n\nTherefore, this action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's some nuance I'm missing.\n\nFor Scenario 1, perhaps someone might argue that if the kitten didn't seem to mind or if it was just a one-time thing, it might not be considered that bad. However, pulling a kitten by its tail is generally recognized as abusive behavior towards animals, and it's unlikely that the kitten wouldn't feel pain from such an action.\n\nFor Scenario 2, there might be debates in extreme hypothetical situations, but in general, developing bioweapons is universally condemned as morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, and the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
