These shared experiences can shape behaviors, attitudes, and health outcomes in ways that differ from other cohorts. Let's consider each option to see which could be influenced by a cohort effect.\n\n**A. Depression**\n\nDepression can be influenced by a variety of factors, including genetic predisposition, life events, and social environment. A cohort effect might be observed if a particular generation experienced unique stressors or supportive conditions that affect their rates of depression compared to other generations. For example, individuals who grew up during economic recessions or wartime may have higher rates of depression due to the lasting impact of those experiences.\n\n**B. Alcoholism**\n\nAlcoholism is also influenced by a mix of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. Cohort effects could play a role if certain generations were exposed to different cultural attitudes toward alcohol use, varying levels of alcohol availability, or distinct social norms regarding drinking. For instance, the \"baby boomer\" generation may have different drinking patterns compared to millennials due to differing cultural norms and experiences.\n\n**C. Dementia**\n\nDementia is primarily associated with aging and is more common in older adults. While there may be some cohort effects related to lifestyle factors, education levels, or healthcare access that vary between generations, the primary driver of dementia is age rather than generational experiences. However, it's possible that certain cohorts have lower rates of dementia due to improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and education over time.\n\n**D. Suicide**\n\nSuicide rates can be influenced by a range of factors, including mental health, socioeconomic status, and cultural attitudes toward suicide. Cohort effects might be evident if certain generations have different suicide rates due to shared experiences such as war, economic depression, or cultural shifts in attitudes toward mental health and suicide.\n\nAmong these options, all could potentially be influenced by cohort effects to some degree. However, the question asks for which of the following age differences could be, in part, a cohort effect. Given that, all options A, B, C, and D could exhibit cohort effects, but the extent to which cohort effects influence each may vary.\n\nIf I had to choose one that is most likely to be influenced by cohort effects, I might select **B. Alcoholism**, because alcohol use and abuse are heavily influenced by cultural and social norms, which can vary significantly between cohorts. Different generations may have grown up with different attitudes toward drinking, varying levels of alcohol availability, and distinct social pressures related to alcohol consumption.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that all of these options could be influenced by cohort effects, and in reality, multiple factors interplay to influence rates of depression, alcoholism, dementia, and suicide across different age groups.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
