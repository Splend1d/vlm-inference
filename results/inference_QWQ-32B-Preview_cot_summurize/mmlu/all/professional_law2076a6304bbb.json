                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a statute that requires candidates for lieutenant governor to get 5,000 registered voter signatures to get on the ballot. There's a candidate who didn't make it because she didn't have enough signatures, and now she's challenging the constitutionality of this requirement. I need to figure out which argument would best support the statute if it were established to be true.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. It is constitutional under the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nB. It is necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n\nC. The candidate's petition contained 2,000 false signatures.\n\nD. Only one other candidate successfully petitioned to have his name placed on the ballot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Fifteenth Amendment is about. I know it's related to voting rights, specifically that the right to vote shall not be denied based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. So, if the statute is being challenged on constitutional grounds, perhaps the candidate is arguing that the signature requirement is discriminatory in some way, possibly violating the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nOption A says the statute is constitutional under the Fifteenth Amendment. If the candidate is challenging the statute on grounds that it violates the Fifteenth Amendment, then arguing that it's constitutional under that amendment would be a direct response to her claim. So, if the state can show that the signature requirement doesn't violate the Fifteenth Amendment, that could support the statute.\n\nOption B says it's necessary to further a compelling state interest. This sounds like the state is arguing that the signature requirement serves an important purpose, maybe to ensure that only serious candidates appear on the ballot, to reduce ballot clutter, or to prevent fraud. If the state can show that this requirement is necessary to achieve a compelling interest, that could be a strong argument in favor of the statute.\n\nOption C mentions that the candidate's petition had 2,000 false signatures. If this is true, it might indicate that the candidate didn't meet the requirement honestly, but I'm not sure how that directly supports the constitutionality of the statute. Maybe it suggests that the signature requirement is necessary to ensure the integrity of the petition process.\n\nOption D says only one other candidate successfully petitioned to have his name placed on the ballot. This might indicate that the signature requirement is stringent, but again, I'm not sure how that directly supports the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nComparing these options, I think option B is the strongest argument in support of the statute. If the state can demonstrate that the signature requirement is necessary to further a compelling state interest, that would provide a solid constitutional basis for the statute.\n\nOption A might be relevant if the candidate is specifically arguing that the statute violates the Fifteenth Amendment, but the question doesn't specify that. It just says \"challenging the constitutionality,\" which could encompass various constitutional grounds.\n\nOption C about false signatures seems more like a procedural issue with the candidate's specific petition rather than a general argument supporting the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nOption D about only one other candidate making it seems more like a factual statement about the competitiveness of the election, but doesn't directly speak to why the statute is constitutional.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best argument in support of the statute, if established, would be option B: it is necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
