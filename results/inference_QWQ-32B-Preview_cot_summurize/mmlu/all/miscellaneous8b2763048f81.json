She is often associated with the blooming of flowers and the beauty of nature during springtime. In Roman mythology, Flora was celebrated during the Floralia festival, which was held in April and May to mark the beginning of spring.\n\nDiana, on the other hand, is the Roman goddess of the hunt, the moon, and childbirth. She is often associated with wildlife and is considered a protector of women.\n\nEcho is a mountain nymph in Greek and Roman mythology who was cursed by Hera to only repeat the last words spoken to her. She fell in love with Narcissus, but her love was unrequited.\n\nNiobe is a figure in Greek and Roman mythology who suffered great loss when all her children were killed by Apollo and Artemis as punishment for her hubris. Her story is often used to illustrate the dangers of excessive pride and the inevitability of fate.\n\nSo, among the options provided, Flora is indeed the Roman goddess associated with flowers."
