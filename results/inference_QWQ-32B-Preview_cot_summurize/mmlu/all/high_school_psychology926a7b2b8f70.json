This approach allows researchers to track changes and developments in participants as they age or over time, providing insights into how certain traits, behaviors, or conditions evolve.\n\nIn contrast:\n\nA. Cross-sectional research involves studying different subjects or variables at a single point in time. It compares different age groups or cohorts simultaneously but does not follow the same individuals over time.\n\nB. Cross-cultural research compares behaviors, traits, or conditions across different cultural or social groups. While it can provide insights into how culture influences development, it does not necessarily involve longitudinal tracking.\n\nC. In-cohort sequential research is not a standard term in developmental research. It might be a misinterpretation or a typo. Sequential research could refer to studies that follow a sequence of steps or phases, but it's not specifically defined in the context provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. longitudinal research."
