                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. We have six 6-sided dice being rolled, and we want to find the probability that exactly three of them show prime numbers, while the other three show composite numbers.\n\nFirst, let's identify the prime and composite numbers on a 6-sided die. The numbers on a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n- Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5\n- Composite numbers: 4, 6\n- Note that 1 is neither prime nor composite.\n\nSo, there are 3 prime numbers and 2 composite numbers on a 6-sided die. The number 1 is neither, so we need to decide how to classify it for this problem. Since the problem talks about prime and composite numbers, and 1 is neither, I think it's safe to consider 1 as not prime and not composite. But let's confirm this.\n\nGiven that the problem specifies \"prime numbers\" and \"composite numbers,\" and since 1 is neither, I believe it should be considered separately. However, in the options, there's no indication of ambiguity, so perhaps we can assume that 1 is considered not prime and not composite for this scenario.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider that the dice only show prime or composite numbers, ignoring 1. However, since 1 is a possible outcome, we might need to adjust our approach.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the problem implies that all numbers are either prime or composite, which isn't accurate because 1 is neither. But maybe in the context of this problem, they are considering 1 as composite or not. I need to clarify this.\n\nLooking back, the problem says \"prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers.\" Since 1 is neither, perhaps it's being considered as not composite for this problem. But to avoid confusion, I'll proceed with the understanding that there are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, 5) and 2 composite numbers (4, 6), and 1 is neither.\n\nGiven that, the probability of rolling a prime number is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability of rolling a composite number is 2/6 = 1/3. Wait, but that adds up to 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6, leaving 1/6 for the neither category, which is 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"the rest show composite numbers,\" which might imply that the non-prime numbers are considered composite, including 1. So, perhaps in this problem, numbers are either prime or composite, with 1 being considered composite for simplicity. Let's check that.\n\nIf we consider 1 as composite for this problem, then composite numbers are 1, 4, 6, which are 3 out of 6, so probability of composite is 3/6 = 1/2, and prime is also 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nThis seems neater, as then prime and composite each have probability 1/2.\n\nSo, with this assumption, we have:\n\n- Probability of prime: 1/2\n- Probability of composite: 1/2\n\nNow, we're rolling six dice, and we want exactly three to be prime and the other three to be composite.\n\nThis is a binomial probability problem, where we have:\n\n- Number of trials (n) = 6\n- Number of successes (k) = 3 (for primes)\n- Probability of success (p) = 1/2\n- Probability of failure (q) = 1/2\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * q^(n - k)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(3) = C(6, 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^(6 - 3) = C(6, 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^3 = C(6, 3) * (1/8) * (1/8) = C(6, 3) * (1/64)\n\nNow, C(6, 3) is the combination of 6 things taken 3 at a time, which is 20.\n\nSo, P(3) = 20 * (1/64) = 20/64 = 5/16\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 5/16, which matches our calculation.\n\nBut wait a second, earlier I considered that 1 might be considered composite or neither. If 1 is considered composite, then composite numbers are 1, 4, 6 (3 out of 6), and primes are 2, 3, 5 (3 out of 6), which gives p = q = 1/2.\n\nHowever, if 1 is considered neither, then composite numbers are only 4 and 6 (2 out of 6), and primes are 2, 3, 5 (3 out of 6). In this case, p = 3/6 = 1/2 for primes, and q = 2/6 = 1/3 for composites.\n\nBut in this scenario, the probabilities don't add up to 1, since 1/2 (primes) + 1/3 (composites) = 5/6, leaving 1/6 for neither.\n\nIn such a case, we might need to adjust the calculation to account for the \"neither\" category.\n\nHowever, given that the problem states \"the rest show composite numbers,\" it might imply that any non-prime is considered composite, including 1.\n\nTherefore, considering composite numbers as 1, 4, 6 (3 out of 6), and primes as 2, 3, 5 (3 out of 6), with p = q = 1/2, leads to the probability being 5/16, which is option B.\n\nBut let's verify this approach.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that 1 is neither prime nor composite, then the probability of rolling a prime is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability of rolling a composite is 2/6 = 1/3, as earlier.\n\nIn this case, the probability of getting exactly three primes and three composites would be:\n\nP = C(6, 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/3)^3 = 20 * (1/8) * (1/27) = 20 * (1/216) = 20/216 = 5/54\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 5/54.\n\nSo, depending on whether we consider 1 as composite or neither, we get different answers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to consider 1 as neither, making the probability of composite 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nIn that case, the probability is indeed 5/54, which is option C.\n\nBut option B is also present as 5/16, which we got by considering 1 as composite.\n\nI need to decide which assumption is correct.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says \"the rest show composite numbers.\" Since \"the rest\" refers to the dice that do not show prime numbers, and 1 is not a prime number, it would be included in \"the rest,\" which are supposed to show composite numbers.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is considering 1 as a composite number for simplicity, even though it's not strictly correct mathematically.\n\nIn that case, considering composite numbers as 1, 4, 6 (3 out of 6), and primes as 2, 3, 5 (3 out of 6), with equal probabilities of 1/2 each, leads to the probability being 5/16, which is option B.\n\nHowever, strictly speaking, 1 is neither prime nor composite, so the more accurate approach might be to consider composite numbers as only 4 and 6 (2 out of 6), giving p = 1/2 for primes and q = 1/3 for composites, resulting in P = 5/54, which is option C.\n\nGiven that the problem might be expecting the first approach, considering 1 as composite, leading to p = q = 1/2 and P = 5/16, but acknowledging that mathematically, 1 is neither prime nor composite, so the strict approach would be P = 5/54.\n\nBut since this is a probability problem, it's important to follow the problem's definition. If it defines \"the rest\" as composite, including 1, then perhaps 5/16 is the intended answer.\n\nHowever, considering mathematical accuracy, 5/54 might be the better answer.\n\nBut to match the options provided, both 5/16 and 5/54 are present, which makes the ambiguity evident.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to consider 1 as composite, leading to p = q = 1/2 and P = 5/16.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the total number of outcomes. Each die has 6 faces, so total outcomes are 6^6.\n\nNow, the number of ways to have exactly three primes and three composites.\n\nIf we consider primes as 2, 3, 5 (3 options) and composites as 4, 6 (2 options), and 1 as neither.\n\nBut the problem says \"the rest show composite numbers,\" which might imply that 1 is considered composite.\n\nIn that case, composites are 1, 4, 6 (3 options).\n\nSo, number of ways to have exactly three primes: choose which three dice show primes, which is C(6, 3), and each of those three dice can show any of the three primes, so 3^3, and the other three dice show any of the three composites, so 3^3.\n\nTherefore, total favorable outcomes: C(6, 3) * 3^3 * 3^3 = 20 * 27 * 27 = 20 * 729 = 14,580\n\nTotal possible outcomes: 6^6 = 46,656\n\nTherefore, probability = 14,580 / 46,656 = simplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 12: 14,580 / 12 = 1,215; 46,656 / 12 = 3,888 \u2192 1,215 / 3,888\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 1,215 / 3 = 405; 3,888 / 3 = 1,296 \u2192 405 / 1,296\n\nDivide by 3 again: 405 / 3 = 135; 1,296 / 3 = 432 \u2192 135 / 432\n\nDivide by 3 again: 135 / 3 = 45; 432 / 3 = 144 \u2192 45 / 144\n\nDivide by 3 once more: 45 / 3 = 15; 144 / 3 = 48 \u2192 15 / 48\n\nDivide by 3 again: 15 / 3 = 5; 48 / 3 = 16 \u2192 5 / 16\n\nSo, the probability is 5/16, which matches option B.\n\nBut earlier, when considering 1 as neither, I got 5/54. However, based on the problem's wording, it seems that considering 1 as composite is the way to go, leading to 5/16.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{16}}"
