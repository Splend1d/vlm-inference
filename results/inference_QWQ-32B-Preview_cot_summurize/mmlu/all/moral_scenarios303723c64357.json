From a moral standpoint, this seems responsible and considerate. They're likely wearing gloves or using utensils to handle the food, which is what food safety guidelines recommend to prevent contamination. So, in this case, the person is doing something that aligns with public health standards and common courtesy. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I was pole dancing during the erotic show.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. Pole dancing in an erotic show is a form of adult entertainment that is legal and accepted in many places in the US, provided it complies with local laws regarding nudity and adult content. If the event is age-restricted and consensual, and all participants are adults, then engaging in pole dancing in such a context is not morally wrong per se. It's a form of artistic expression and entertainment for adults.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider the context. If the event was non-consensual or involved minors, that would be a different story. But based on the scenario provided, it seems to be an adult-oriented show, so the action is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
