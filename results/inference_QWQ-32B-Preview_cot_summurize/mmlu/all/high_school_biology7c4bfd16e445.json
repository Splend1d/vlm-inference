                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about post-transcriptional modification of mRNA, and I need to identify which statements are incorrect. There are four options:\n\nA. A poly-A tail is added to the 3\u2032 end of the mRNA.\n\nB. A guanine cap is added to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA.\n\nC. Introns are removed from the mRNA.\n\nD. Posttranscriptional modification occurs in the cytoplasm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what post-transcriptional modifications are and where they take place.\n\nTranscription is the process where DNA is copied into RNA, specifically mRNA, in the nucleus. After transcription, the mRNA undergoes several modifications before it's ready to be translated into protein. These modifications happen in the nucleus before the mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: A poly-A tail is added to the 3\u2032 end of the mRNA.\n\nI think this is correct. During mRNA processing, a polyadenylation signal is recognized, and a poly-A tail is added to the 3\u2032 end. This tail helps protect the mRNA from degradation and also plays a role in export and translation.\n\nOption B: A guanine cap is added to the5\u2032 end of the mRNA.\n\nYes, that's right. The 5\u2032 end of the mRNA gets a special structure called the 5\u2032 cap, which is usually a modified guanine nucleotide. This cap is important for mRNA stability, export, and translation initiation.\n\nOption C: Introns are removed from the mRNA.\n\nAbsolutely. Introns are non-coding sequences that are spliced out by spliceosomes, leaving only exons, which code for the protein. This splicing is a crucial part of post-transcriptional modification.\n\nOption D: Posttranscriptional modification occurs in the cytoplasm.\n\nHmm, this seems off. I remember that transcription and subsequent modifications happen in the nucleus. Only after the mRNA is processed and capped and tailed does it get exported to the cytoplasm for translation.\n\nSo, if post-transcriptional modifications occur in the nucleus, then statement D is incorrect.\n\nLet me double-check each option.\n\nA: Poly-A tail addition is correct.\n\nB: Guanine cap addition is correct.\n\nC: Introns are removed, which is correct.\n\nD: Posttranscriptional modification occurring in the cytoplasm is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
