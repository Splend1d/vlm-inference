                    "text": "Let's dive into these options one by one to figure out which statement about cellular respiration is correct.\n\nOption A says: \"Most CO2 produced during cellular respiration is released from glycolysis.\" Hmm, I think glycolysis is the first step of cellular respiration, and it happens in the cytoplasm. It breaks down glucose into pyruvate, but I don't recall CO2 being a direct product of glycolysis. Actually, I think CO2 is released in the citric acid cycle, which comes after glycolysis. So, maybe this statement is incorrect.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"Protons are pumped through ATP synthase by active transport.\" Now, I know that during cellular respiration, there's a process called chemiosmosis where protons are pumped across the mitochondrial membrane to create a proton gradient. This gradient then drives the synthesis of ATP by ATP synthase. But I'm not sure if protons are pumped through ATP synthase itself or if they flow through it to generate ATP. Also, active transport usually involves pumping molecules against their concentration gradient using energy, like ATP. Here, the proton pumping is powered by the energy released from electron transport, not directly by ATP. So, this statement might be a bit misleading.\n\nOption C states: \"The final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain is NAD+.\" I remember that NAD+ is an electron carrier that picks up electrons and hydrogen ions in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, forming NADH. Then, NADH donates these electrons to the electron transport chain. But the final electron acceptor in the chain is actually oxygen, which combines with electrons and protons to form water. So, NAD+ isn't the final acceptor; it's more of an intermediate carrier. Therefore, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nLastly, option D: \"ATP is formed because an endergonic reaction is coupled with an exergonic reaction.\" This sounds familiar. In biology, often endergonic reactions (those that require energy) are coupled with exergonic reactions (those that release energy) to make them proceed. In the context of ATP synthesis, I think the exergonic process is the flow of protons down their gradient through ATP synthase, and this energy is used to drive the endergonic formation of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. So, this seems like a correct description of how ATP is synthesized in cellular respiration.\n\nLet me double-check though. Glycolysis does produce some ATP, but it's through substrate-level phosphorylation, which is a bit different. But in the context of oxidative phosphorylation, which is the main ATP-producing process in cellular respiration, it's indeed the coupling of an exergonic proton flow with the endergonic ATP synthesis.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think option D is the correct statement about cellular respiration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
