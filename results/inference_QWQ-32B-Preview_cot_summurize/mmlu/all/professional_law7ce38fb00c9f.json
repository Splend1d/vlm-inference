The day that the defendant was to drive back to college, his roommate asked him if he would deliver a package to one of their classmates. The defendant agreed, and the roommate gave him a small package, which the defendant placed in his glove compartment. While driving back to school, the defendant was stopped for speeding. When the state trooper asked the defendant for his license and registration, he reached into the glove compartment. As he did, the package that his roommate had given him fell onto the floor. When it hit the floor, the box broke open and a plastic envelope containing a white substance slid out. Seeing that the substance appeared to be cocaine, the state trooper arrested the defendant for possession of illegal narcotics under a state statute making it a felony to willfully possess a controlled substance. The package did, in fact, contain cocaine. If the defendant is later brought to trial for this charge, his best defense is that\n\nA. the defendant didn't know what was in the package.\nB. the roommate didn't tell him he was carrying illegal narcotics.\nC. the package didn't belong to him.\nD. the cocaine was illegally seized.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the best defense for this defendant in his trial for possession of illegal narcotics. Let's recap the situation: The defendant was asked by his roommate to deliver a package to a classmate while he was driving back to college. He agreed and put the package in his glove compartment. During a traffic stop for speeding, the package fell and broke open, revealing a plastic envelope containing what appeared to be cocaine, which turned out to be actual cocaine.\n\nNow, the charge is possession of illegal narcotics under a state statute that makes it a felony to willfully possess a controlled substance. So, the key elements here are possession and willfulness.\n\nOption A says \"the defendant didn't know what was in the package.\" This seems relevant because if he didn't know it was cocaine, then he didn't willfully possess it. Willful possession implies that he knew what he was possessing and intended to have it in his control.\n\nOption B is \"the roommate didn't tell him he was carrying illegal narcotics.\" This is similar to option A. If the roommate didn't inform him about the contents, then the defendant wouldn't have known he was carrying illegal substances.\n\nOption C is \"the package didn't belong to him.\" But in the scenario, he accepted the package from his roommate and placed it in his own glove compartment. So, even if it wasn't his package, by carrying it in his vehicle, he had possession of it.\n\nOption D is \"the cocaine was illegally seized.\" This might be referring to the legality of the search during the traffic stop. However, the stop was for speeding, which is a valid reason for the trooper to pull him over. When the package fell while the defendant was reaching for his license and registration, it might be considered in plain view, which can be legally seized without a warrant.\n\nConsidering these points, options A and B both relate to the defendant's lack of knowledge about the contents of the package. Option C seems weaker because possession doesn't necessarily require ownership. Option D might not hold up because the seizure seems lawful given the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the defendant's best defense would be that he didn't know what was in the package and that his roommate didn't inform him about the illegal contents. This would challenge the element of willfulness in the possession charge.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. The defendant didn't know what was in the package.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
