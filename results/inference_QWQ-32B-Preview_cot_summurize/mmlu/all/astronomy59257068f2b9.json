                    "text": "To determine the correct formula for the second cosmic velocity, also known as the escape velocity, we need to understand the physics behind it. Escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for an object to escape the gravitational influence of a celestial body without further propulsion.\n\nThe formula for escape velocity is derived from the conservation of energy principle. At the surface of the celestial body, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) of the object must be zero for it to just escape the gravitational field.\n\nThe kinetic energy (KE) of the object is given by:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy (PE) at the surface of the celestial body is:\n\n\\[ PE = -\\frac{GMm}{R} \\]\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the celestial body, and R is its radius.\n\nFor the object to escape, the total mechanical energy must be zero:\n\n\\[ KE + PE = 0 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for KE and PE:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R} = 0 \\]\n\nWe can solve for v:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{GMm}{R} \\]\n\n\\[ v^2 = \\frac{2GM}{R} \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct formula for the escape velocity is:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} \\]\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}} \\)\n\nB. \\( v = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}} \\)\n\nC. \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} \\)\n\nD. \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{2R}} \\)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\nIt's worth noting that option A is the formula for the first cosmic velocity, which is the speed required for a object to maintain a low orbit around the celestial body. The second cosmic velocity is indeed \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) times the first cosmic velocity.\n\nIn summary, the escape velocity is given by \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} \\), making option C the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
