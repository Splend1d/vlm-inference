I remember that bilingualism has some benefits, but I'm not sure about all the options here.\n\nOption A says that cognitive development is delayed. I don't think that's right. In fact, I've heard that learning another language can be good for the brain.\n\nOption B mentions better articulation. Hmm, maybe. But I'm not sure if that's a direct result of being bilingual.\n\nOption C says that native language proficiency doesn't affect the rate of acquiring the second language. I feel like how well you know your first language might influence learning a second one, so this seems\u53ef\u7591.\n\nOption D talks about increased cognitive flexibility. I've read about this before. Bilingual kids seem to be better at switching between tasks or thinking flexibly.\n\nLet me think again. I know that some studies show that bilingual children can have advantages in certain cognitive skills. Maybe option D is the right answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should look back at some of the research I've read. I recall that bilingualism can lead to better executive function, which includes cognitive flexibility. That would make sense.\n\nOption A about delayed cognitive development seems opposite to what I've heard. Most research suggests that bilingualism can have positive effects on cognition.\n\nOption B about better articulation isn't something I've come across specifically. Maybe it's not the main benefit.\n\nOption C saying that native language proficiency has no effect on second language acquisition also seems off. I think the stronger your first language is, the easier it might be to learn a second language, especially if they're related.\n\nSo, based on what I remember, option D seems the most accurate. Bilingual children often exhibit increased cognitive flexibility.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I should consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Cognitive development delayed. This doesn't align with the positive views on bilingualism I've encountered.\n\nOption B: Better articulation. While bilingual children might have certain advantages, better articulation isn't a primary benefit I've heard about.\n\nOption C: Native language proficiency has no effect. This seems contrary to what I believe; native language skills should help in learning a second language.\n\nOption D: Increased cognitive flexibility. This seems consistent with research I've seen on bilingualism and cognitive benefits.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. They have increased cognitive flexibility.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
