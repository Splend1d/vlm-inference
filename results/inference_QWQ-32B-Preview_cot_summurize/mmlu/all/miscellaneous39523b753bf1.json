I think I need to recall what happens at divergent boundaries.\n\nDivergent boundaries are where tectonic plates move away from each other, right? Like, the seafloor spreading at mid-ocean ridges. So, if the plates are moving apart, that must create a certain kind of stress in the crust.\n\nI remember that stress in rocks can be of different types, like compressional, which is when rocks are squeezed together; tensional, which is when they're pulled apart; and shear, which is when there's a sliding motion between rock layers.\n\nAt divergent boundaries, since the plates are moving apart, it seems like the stress should be tensional, because the crust is being pulled apart. Is that correct?\n\nLet me think about the other options. Compressional stress would happen where plates are coming together, like at convergent boundaries. So, that doesn't fit divergent boundaries.\n\nThen there's left-lateral shear and right-lateral shear. Shear stress is related to plates sliding past each other, which happens at transform boundaries, not divergent ones. So, shear stress shouldn't dominate at divergent boundaries.\n\nWait, but maybe there's some component of shear at divergent boundaries. For example, if the plates are moving apart but also have some lateral movement, could there be some shear stress?\n\nI guess it's possible, but the primary stress at divergent boundaries should be tensional, because the main movement is apart, not side-to-side.\n\nAlso, I think the type of volcanic activity at divergent boundaries supports this. Since the crust is thinning and magma rises to fill the gap, creating new crust. That process seems consistent with tensional stress.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. Tensional.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where a different stress might dominate at a divergent boundary.\n\nFor example, if there's a divergent boundary that's not strictly perpendicular to the plate motion, maybe there could be some shear component. But even then, I think the dominant stress would still be tensional.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that at some divergent boundaries, like in continental rifting, there might be complex stress patterns, but I believe tensional stress still dominates.\n\nOkay, I think I've convinced myself that tensional stress is the dominant type at divergent boundaries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
