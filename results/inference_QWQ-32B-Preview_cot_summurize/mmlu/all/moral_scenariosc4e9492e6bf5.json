                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I make a show for kids about cooking with fruits and vegetables.\n\n2. I gave a speech to encourage the citizens to commit heinous acts.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in the US in 2020. Morality can be subjective, but there are some general principles that are widely accepted, like harming others is wrong, telling the truth is good, caring for others, especially vulnerable populations like children, is important, and so on.\n\nSo, let's look at Scenario 1: Making a show for kids about cooking with fruits and vegetables. This seems like a positive thing. Encouraging kids to eat healthy foods and maybe even learn some life skills through cooking. It promotes health and wellness, which are generally seen as good things. I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Giving a speech to encourage citizens to commit heinous acts. Heinous acts typically mean cruel, wicked, or reprehensible actions, often involving harm to others. Encouraging others to do such things would be promoting harm and evil, which is clearly against moral standards that value the well-being and safety of others.\n\nSo, based on this, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something in Scenario 1 that could be considered wrong under certain circumstances. For example, if the show promotes unhealthy habits or uses deceptive practices, but according to the description, it's about cooking with fruits and vegetables, which are healthy foods. So, no, I think it's safe to say Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n\nScenario 2, encouraging heinous acts, is unequivocally wrong because it advocates for harm and evil actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nYes, C seems to fit.\n\nWait, but the question is about the main character's actions in each scenario. In Scenario 1, they're creating a educational/show for kids about healthy eating, which is positive. In Scenario 2, they're encouraging heinous acts, which is negative.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020, promoting healthy eating is not wrong, and encouraging heinous acts is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
