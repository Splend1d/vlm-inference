So, you'll divide $5,144 by $8.\n\nLet's do the division step by step:\n\nFirst, see how many times 8 goes into 51 (the first two digits of 5,144).\n\n8 times 6 is 48, which is less than 51.\n\n8 times 7 is 56, which is more than 51.\n\nSo, 8 goes into 51 six times with a remainder.\n\n51 minus 48 is 3.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 34.\n\nNow, see how many times 8 goes into 34.\n\n8 times 4 is 32, which is less than 34.\n\n8 times 5 is 40, which is more than 34.\n\nSo, 8 goes into 34 four times with a remainder.\n\n34 minus 32 is 2.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 24.\n\nNow, see how many times 8 goes into 24.\n\n8 times 3 is 24, which is exactly 24.\n\nSo, 8 goes into 24 three times with no remainder.\n\nPutting it all together, 5,144 divided by 8 is 643.\n\nTherefore, the total number of T-shirts sold is 643.\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. 643.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{643} \\]"
