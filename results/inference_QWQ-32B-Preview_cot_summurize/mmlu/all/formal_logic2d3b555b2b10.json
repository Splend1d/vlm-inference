The symbols are: c for Cathy, l for Leo, and Txy means \"x is taller than y.\" I need to choose the correct way to write this statement using these symbols.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. First, the statement is \"Leo is taller than Cathy.\" So, in this context, Leo is the one who is taller, and Cathy is the one who is shorter.\n\nNow, looking at the predicate Txy, which means \"x is taller than y.\" So, in this predicate, x is the taller one, and y is the shorter one.\n\nSo, in the statement \"Leo is taller than Cathy,\" Leo is x, and Cathy is y.\n\nGiven that, I need to plug in l for Leo and c for Cathy into the predicate Txy.\n\nSo, it should be Tlc, where l is x and c is y.\n\nLet me check the options:\n\nA. Tlc\n\nB. Tcl\n\nC. lTc\n\nD. cTl\n\nSo, option A is Tlc, which matches what I thought.\n\nOption B is Tcl, which would mean \"Cathy is taller than Leo,\" because c is x and l is y. But that's the opposite of what the statement says.\n\nOption C is lTc, which doesn't follow the format of the predicate Txy. It seems like it's trying to say \"l T c,\" but in predicate logic, we usually write it as Tlc.\n\nOption D is cTl, which again doesn't follow the standard format and would likely be interpreted as \"c T l,\" but again, not standard.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct choice should be A. Tlc.\n\nBut let me double-check. The predicate Txy means \"x is taller than y.\" So, Tlc would mean \"l is taller than c,\" which translates to \"Leo is taller than Cathy,\" which matches the original statement.\n\nOption B, Tcl, would mean \"Cathy is taller than Leo,\" which is not what the statement says.\n\nOptions C and D seem to be misplacements of the symbols and the predicate.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is A. Tlc.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
