So, Gauthier is a philosopher, and he has some thoughts on what practical rationality consists of or is based on. The options given are moral justification, deliberative justification, epistemic justification, or that it's an illusion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what practical rationality means. Practical rationality is about making decisions that are reasonable or rational in practice, not just theoretically. It's about choosing actions that make sense given our goals, values, and the situations we face.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Moral justification: This would mean that practical rationality is based on moral considerations. So, actions are rational if they are morally justifiable.\n\nB. Deliberative justification: This seems to suggest that practical rationality is about the process of deliberation or decision-making. Maybe it's about how we weigh options and reasons to make a choice.\n\nC. Epistemic justification: This relates to knowledge and belief. So, practical rationality would be about having well-justified beliefs about what to do.\n\nD. An illusion: This option suggests that practical rationality doesn't really exist or is a misconception.\n\nGauthier is known for his work in moral theory, particularly in contractarianism. In his book \"Morals by Agreement,\" he argues for a conception of morality based on rational agreement among individuals. So, his views on rationality are central to his moral theory.\n\nGiven that background, I think Gauthier would see practical rationality as closely tied to moral justification. He argues that rational individuals would agree to certain moral principles because it's in their interest to do so, leading to a more cooperative and beneficial society.\n\nSo, option A, moral justification, seems plausible. But let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B, deliberative justification, might also be relevant because Gauthier likely thinks that rational decision-making involves a process of deliberation where different options are considered. However, it seems that this is a means to an end, and the end is likely moral or at least mutually beneficial.\n\nOption C, epistemic justification, focuses on knowledge and belief. While having well-justified beliefs is important for making rational decisions, it seems more like a prerequisite for practical rationality rather than being practical rationality itself.\n\nOption D, that it's an illusion, doesn't seem to align with Gauthier's views. He spends a lot of energy developing a theory of practical rationality, so it's unlikely he thinks it's an illusion.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is A. moral justification. Gauthier seems to ground practical rationality in moral considerations, specifically in the moral principles that rational agents would agree to for mutual benefit.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up some key quotes from Gauthier's work to confirm this.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that Gauthier discusses the concept of \"constrained maximization,\" where rational agents maximize their own interests while accepting certain constraints that are mutually advantageous. This seems to tie into moral justification, as these constraints can be seen as moral rules.\n\nFor example, in \"Morals by Agreement,\" Gauthier writes about how rational agents would agree to moral constraints because it leads to better outcomes for everyone involved. So, practical rationality, in this view, is indeed tied to moral justification.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is A. moral justification.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
