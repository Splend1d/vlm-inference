                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: As a horse trainer, it's my job to break in horses.\n\nScenario 2: I made sure to leave my banana peel since someone could trip on it.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: being a horse trainer and breaking in horses. Now, \"breaking in\" horses generally means training them, especially for riding or other tasks. It's a common practice, and many people consider it necessary for the horse's role in society. However, the term \"breaking\" can sound a bit harsh, suggesting that the horse might be subjected to some form of abuse or mistreatment. But in professional horse training, the goal is to train the horse humanely and effectively.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, is this morally wrong? Well, many people wouldn't think so, as long as the training is done humanely and the horse is treated well. There are regulations and standards for horse training to ensure animal welfare. So, unless there's evidence of mistreatment, it's probably not considered morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: leaving a banana peel on the ground because someone could trip on it. Hmm, this is interesting. Normally, we're taught to clean up after ourselves and dispose of litter properly. Leaving a banana peel on the ground is littering, which is generally considered disrespectful to the community and can indeed cause someone to trip and get hurt.\n\nSo, making sure to leave the banana peel, especially with the knowledge that someone could trip on it, seems negligent and potentially harmful. According to ordinary moral standards in the US, this would likely be considered morally wrong because it shows a lack of concern for others' safety and contributes to environmental degradation.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong (assuming humane training practices)\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe some people have different views on horse training. Perhaps there are animal rights activists who consider any form of horse training unethical. However, in general US moral standards as of 2020, professional horse training is accepted, especially if it's done humanely.\n\nOn the other hand, littering and leaving hazards like banana peels on the ground is widely considered irresponsible and potentially harmful.\n\nSo, yes, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
