                    "text": "Let's see. The question is about who gets hurt by inflation among different groups of people. Inflation is when the general price level of goods and services is rising, and the purchasing power of money is falling. So, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nOption I is borrowers at fixed interest rates. Now, if you're borrowing money at a fixed interest rate, and inflation goes up, what happens? Well, the money you're borrowing is worth less over time because of inflation. So, in real terms, you're paying back less than you borrowed, because the dollars you're paying back are worth less. That sounds like a good deal for the borrower, right? So, actually, borrowers at fixed interest rates might benefit from inflation because the real value of their debt decreases.\n\nOption II is individuals on fixed incomes. These are people who receive a set amount of money regularly, maybe like retirees on a pension or people with fixed salaries that don't adjust for inflation. When inflation rises, the cost of living goes up, but their income stays the same. So, they can buy less with the same amount of money. That means their purchasing power decreases, which hurts them. So, yes, individuals on fixed incomes are hurt by inflation.\n\nOption III is those with savings earning fixed interest rates. If you have savings in a bank account that pays a fixed interest rate, and inflation rises above that rate, the real value of your savings decreases. For example, if your savings account pays 2% interest, but inflation is 3%, the real value of your savings is decreasing by 1% per year. So, over time, you can buy less with your savings. That definitely hurts savers who are earning fixed interest rates that don't keep up with inflation.\n\nOption IV is restaurant owners. This one is a bit more nuanced. Inflation affects restaurant owners in several ways. On one hand, their costs might go up because the prices of ingredients, utilities, and other supplies increase. That would hurt their profit margins. On the other hand, if they can pass those cost increases onto customers by raising menu prices, they might be able to maintain their profitability. However, if they can't raise prices enough or if customers cut back on dining out due to higher prices, then they would be hurt by inflation. So, it's possible that restaurant owners are hurt by inflation, but it's not as straightforward as the other options.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it asks which of these groups are hurt by inflation. Based on my analysis:\n\n- Borrowers at fixed interest rates (I) might actually benefit from inflation.\n\n- Individuals on fixed incomes (II) are definitely hurt by inflation.\n\n- Those with savings earning fixed interest rates (III) are hurt by inflation if the interest rate doesn't keep up with inflation.\n\n- Restaurant owners (IV) might be hurt by inflation, but it's not as direct or certain as for II and III.\n\nSo, the best answer seems to be B. II and III only. But let's double-check. Option D is II, III, and IV only. However, since restaurant owners' situation is more uncertain, I think B is a safer choice.\n\nWait, but maybe restaurant owners are more likely to be hurt by inflation because of rising costs. In that case, D might be acceptable. But I think the question is looking for those who are directly and clearly hurt by inflation, which would be II and III.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. II and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
