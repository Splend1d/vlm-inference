                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of joint tenancy and how it interacts with a quitclaim deed.\n\nFirst, let's recall that joint tenancy is a type of co-ownership where two or more people own a property together, each having an equal undivided interest in the entire property. Importantly, joint tenancy comes with the right of survivorship, meaning that if one owner dies, their interest automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s).\n\nIn this scenario, the sister and brother own the ranch as joint tenants. This means they each have an undivided one-half interest in the property, and the right of survivorship applies.\n\nNow, the sister transfers her interest by quitclaim deed to her friend without the brother's knowledge. A quitclaim deed is a type of deed that transfers any interest the grantor has in the property without making any warranties or guarantees about the quality or extent of that interest.\n\nGiven that the sister and brother are joint tenants, the sister only has an undivided one-half interest in the property. When she quitclaims her interest to her friend, she is transferring whatever interest she has, which is that undivided one-half.\n\nHowever, in joint tenancy, for a transfer to be effective in severing the joint tenancy, all joint tenants must agree to the transfer or the transfer must be to a new tenant in common. In this case, the sister transferred her interest without the brother's knowledge, which likely means the brother did not consent to severing the joint tenancy.\n\nTherefore, the transfer may not sever the joint tenancy, and the brother still holds his undivided one-half interest with the right of survivorship. The friend would receive the sister's interest, but it's unclear whether this transfer severs the joint tenancy or not.\n\nBut in many jurisdictions, a quitclaim deed from one joint tenant to a third party can sever the joint tenancy, converting it into a tenancy in common. In that case, the friend would hold an undivided one-half interest in the property without the right of survivorship.\n\nHowever, without severing the joint tenancy, the friend might not have any interest at all, depending on the specific laws of the jurisdiction.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. No interest.\n\nB. An undivided one-half interest with right of survivorship.\n\nC. An undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.\n\nD. A lien against the entire property.\n\nOption B seems incorrect because the right of survivorship typically applies only among joint tenants, and the friend is a third party.\n\nOption D is unlikely because a quitclaim deed does not create a lien; it transfers ownership interest.\n\nOption C could be possible if the joint tenancy is severed, and the friend becomes a tenant in common with the brother.\n\nOption A could also be possible if the transfer does not sever the joint tenancy, and the brother retains the entire property upon the sister's death due to the right of survivorship.\n\nConsidering that the sister transferred her interest without the brother's knowledge, and likely without severing the joint tenancy, it's possible that the friend has no interest, especially if the joint tenancy is not severed.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is A. No interest.\n\nHowever, this can vary based on specific state laws, so it's essential to consider the relevant property laws in the jurisdiction where the ranch is located.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
