                    "text": "To determine the amount that should be capitalized as software cost in Pipp Co.'s December 31 year 2 balance sheet, we need to understand the criteria for capitalizing software development costs according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nUnder GAAP, costs incurred in the research and development of software are generally expensed as incurred. However, once technological feasibility has been established, certain costs can be capitalized. Technological feasibility is typically established when all planning, designing, coding, and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications within an acceptable cost and time frame have been completed.\n\nIn this problem, the costs are broken down as follows:\n\n1. Completion of detailed program design: $10,000\n2. Costs incurred for coding and testing to establish technological feasibility: $15,000\n3. Other coding and testing costs incurred after establishment of technological feasibility: $44,000\n\nFirst, we need to identify the point at which technological feasibility is established. The costs incurred for coding and testing to establish technological feasibility are $15,000. This suggests that technological feasibility is established after these coding and testing activities are completed.\n\nTherefore, the costs that can be capitalized are the costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established, which is $44,000.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that under GAAP, capitalized software costs also include certain costs incurred to make the product ready for its intended use, such as additional coding and testing costs after technological feasibility.\n\nBut in this specific scenario, the only costs incurred after establishing technological feasibility are the \"other coding and testing costs\" of $44,000.\n\nTherefore, the amount that should be capitalized as software cost is $44,000.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $44,000\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
