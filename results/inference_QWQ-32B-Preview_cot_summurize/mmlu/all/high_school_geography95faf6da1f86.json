                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what this large node of office and commercial land use outside the central city is called, especially since it has more jobs than residents. The options are suburb, primate city, town, or edge city. I think I need to understand what each of these terms means to pick the right one.\n\nFirst, let's consider \"suburb.\" Suburbs are typically residential areas located outside the city center, often characterized by lower density and single-family homes. They are usually satellite communities that are part of a larger metropolitan area. So, suburbs are more residential, whereas the description mentions more jobs than residents, which seems to indicate a different type of development.\n\nNext, \"primate city\" refers to the largest city in a country, which is significantly larger and more influential than the other cities in that country. This term is about the size and importance of a city within its national context, not about its land use or location relative to a central city. So, this doesn't seem to fit the description provided.\n\nThen, there's \"town.\" A town is generally a smaller populated area, often larger than a village but smaller than a city. Towns can have a variety of land uses, including residential, commercial, and industrial, but the term doesn't specifically denote a particular concentration of offices or commercial land use outside a central city.\n\nFinally, \"edge city\" seems interesting. I've heard this term before, but I'm not entirely sure what it means. From what I recall, edge cities are large centers of office and commercial development located outside the traditional central business district of a city. They often have more jobs than residents, as people commute there for work from surrounding areas.\n\nLet me see if I can find more information about edge cities. According to my research, the term \"edge city\" was coined by Joel Garreau in his 1991 book \"Edge City: Life on the New Frontier.\" He defined edge cities as places where office space has mushroomed, creating a new kind of urban center beyond the older, denser parts of metropolitan areas. These places have significant concentrations of employment and commercial activity but may lack the traditional characteristics of a city center, such as a dense, mixed-use core.\n\nGiven this definition, edge cities seem to match the description in the question: large nodes of office and commercial land use outside the central city with more jobs than residents.\n\nComparing this to suburbs, which are more residential in nature, and primate cities, which are about the largest city in a country, and towns, which are smaller populated areas, edge cities appear to be the most appropriate term for the scenario described.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. edge city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
