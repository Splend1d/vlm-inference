                    "text": "The Durbin-Watson statistic is a test statistic used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression analysis. The statistic ranges from 0 to 4, with values around 2 indicating no autocorrelation. Values significantly lower than 2 suggest positive autocorrelation, while values significantly higher than 2 suggest negative autocorrelation.\n\nThe Durbin-Watson statistic (d) is related to the first-order autocorrelation coefficient (\u03c1) of the residuals by the following formula:\n\nd \u2248 2(1 - \u03c1)\n\nGiven that the Durbin-Watson statistic is close to zero, we can set up the equation:\n\n0 \u2248 2(1 - \u03c1)\n\nSolving for \u03c1:\n\n0 \u2248 2 - 2\u03c1\n2\u03c1 \u2248 2\n\u03c1 \u2248 1\n\nTherefore, if the Durbin-Watson statistic is close to zero, the first-order autocorrelation coefficient is close to plus one, indicating strong positive autocorrelation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Close to plus one\n"
