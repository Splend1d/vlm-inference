                    "text": "Let's see. I bought 100 shares in XYZ Corporation online, and my broker charged me $29.95. Now, I need to figure out how this affects GDP.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what GDP is. GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period. It's a measure of a country's economic activity.\n\nSo, when I buy shares in a company, am I producing something? Well, buying shares is more about investing in a company, giving them capital to grow and produce goods or services. But in terms of GDP, is this transaction directly increasing it?\n\nLet me think about the options:\n\nA. This will increase the investment component of GDP and therefore overall GDP.\n\nHmm, investment in GDP usually refers to businesses investing in capital goods, inventories, or residential construction. Buying shares is more about financial investment, so I'm not sure if this counts directly as investment in GDP.\n\nB. This has no effect on GDP.\n\nMaybe this is the case. Since buying shares is just transferring ownership of a piece of the company, it doesn't directly create new production or services.\n\nC. This will increase GDP by $29.95.\n\nThe broker's fee is a service, so maybe that counts towards GDP. But I need to confirm if financial services are included in GDP calculations.\n\nD. This will increase GDP by the cost of the shares minus $29.95.\n\nThis seems complicated. If the shares cost, say, $10 each, so $1,000 total, and the broker charges $29.95, is the net effect on GDP $1,000 minus $29.95?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the purchase of the shares itself. When you buy shares, you're essentially buying ownership in a company. The company may use that capital to invest in new projects, hire more workers, etc., which could eventually lead to increased production and thus higher GDP. But in the immediate transaction, is there a direct impact?\n\nI recall that in national income accounting, the purchase of shares is considered a financial transaction and doesn't directly affect GDP because GDP measures production, not financial transactions.\n\nHowever, the broker's fee is a service provided, and services are part of GDP. So, the $29.95 that the broker charges is for their service in facilitating the share purchase, and that service is produced in the economy.\n\nTherefore, the broker's fee would be included in GDP as a service.\n\nSo, option C says this will increase GDP by $29.95. That seems plausible.\n\nBut let me think about option A again. If the investment in the company leads to future production, does that affect GDP now?\n\nWell, the investment by buying shares could enable the company to invest and produce more in the future, but in the current period, the act of buying shares doesn't directly increase current production. So, perhaps option A is not the best answer.\n\nOption B says this has no effect on GDP. But since the broker's fee is a service, and services are part of GDP, this can't be correct.\n\nOption D suggests that GDP increases by the cost of the shares minus the broker's fee. But the cost of the shares is just the price people are willing to pay for ownership in the company; it's not directly related to current production.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at it differently. When you buy shares, you're essentially exchanging money for ownership, but no new production is happening at that moment. However, the broker's service of facilitating that transaction is a service provided in the economy, so its value should be included in GDP.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that GDP increases by $29.95, which is the value of the broker's service.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any other impact on GDP from this transaction?\n\nWell, if the company uses the money from share sales to invest in new capital or increase production, that could lead to higher GDP in the future, but not immediately.\n\nAlso, if the shares were being sold by another investor, then the company might not receive any new capital from this transaction; it's just a transfer between investors.\n\nTherefore, the only direct impact on current GDP from this transaction is the broker's fee, which is a service.\n\nSo, I think option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
