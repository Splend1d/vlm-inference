So, first, I need to recall what exceptions there are to the assignability of contractual rights.\n\nI know that not all contractual rights can be assigned freely. There are certain situations where assigning a right isn't allowed. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk.\" Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. Does continuing the obligor's duty or risk prevent an assignment? I think usually, when you assign a right, the obligor still has the same duties and risks. So, maybe this isn't an exception. Maybe it's actually allowed.\n\nOption B: \"An assignment not allowed by law.\" This seems straightforward. If the law says you can't assign a particular right, then of course, that's an exception. So, this is probably an exception to the general rule.\n\nOption C: \"An assignment of future rights from future contracts.\" Assigning future rights is a bit tricky. I think generally, you can assign future rights, but maybe there are limitations. I need to remember if future rights are assignable or not.\n\nOption D: \"An assignment that substantially changes the obligor's duty or risk.\" This sounds familiar. I believe that if assigning a right substantially changes the obligor's duties or increases their risk, then the assignment might not be allowed. So, this seems like an exception.\n\nAlright, let's eliminate options that are likely exceptions.\n\nOption B is definitely an exception because if the law doesn't allow assignment, then it's an exception.\n\nOption D also seems like an exception because substantially changing the obligor's duty or risk would likely make the assignment invalid.\n\nOption C, assigning future rights, might be allowed in some cases, but perhaps not always. I'm not entirely sure about this one.\n\nOption A says that continuing the obligor's duty or risk isn't an exception. But wait, if assigning a right continues the obligor's duty or risk, is that a problem? I think not necessarily. The obligor still has the same duties and risks, so maybe this isn't an exception.\n\nComparing all the options, it seems that option A is different from the others. Options B, C, and D are all exceptions to the general rule, whereas option A describes a situation that might not be an exception.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk is not an exception to the general rule of assignability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
