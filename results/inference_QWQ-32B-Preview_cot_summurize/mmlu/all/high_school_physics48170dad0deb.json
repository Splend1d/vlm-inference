                    "text": "Let's see. We have two containers, one with hydrogen gas and the other with nitrogen gas, both at thermal equilibrium with the room. We need to compare their properties and see which statement is correct.\n\nFirst, let's recall that at thermal equilibrium, both gases are at the same temperature as the room. So, their temperatures are equal.\n\nOption A says that the average kinetic energy of hydrogen gas is greater than that of nitrogen gas. But according to the kinetic theory of gases, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules depends only on temperature, not on the type of gas. So, if both gases are at the same temperature, their average kinetic energies should be the same. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B claims that the average force exerted on the container by hydrogen gas is greater than that by nitrogen gas. The force exerted by a gas on its container is related to its pressure. So, this seems to be about comparing pressures. But again, according to the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, if both containers are at the same temperature and volume, and assuming they have the same number of moles (since they are identical containers), their pressures should be the same. However, hydrogen and nitrogen have different molar masses, but at the same temperature and pressure, their behaviors should be similar. Wait, but perhaps the number of molecules is different. Hmm.\n\nOption C says that the density of hydrogen gas is less than that of nitrogen gas. Density is mass per unit volume. Since hydrogen has a lower molar mass than nitrogen (H2 is approximately 2 g/mol, N2 is approximately 28 g/mol), for the same number of moles in the same volume, hydrogen would have a lower mass, and thus lower density. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption D suggests that the pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container. Well, if the containers are identical and both are at the same temperature, then according to the ideal gas law, if they have the same number of moles, their pressures should be the same. But if the number of moles is different, their pressures would differ. However, the problem says the containers are identical and allowed to come to thermal equilibrium with the room, but it doesn't specify whether they have the same number of moles or not. So, without that information, we can't definitively compare their pressures.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"two identical containers,\" but it doesn't specify whether they contain the same number of molecules or not. Maybe they have different amounts of gas. If that's the case, then indeed, without knowing the number of molecules, we can't compare the pressures.\n\nHowever, considering that they are both filled with gas and set on the lab table, perhaps it's implied that they have the same number of moles or are at the same pressure. But I don't want to assume that.\n\nLet me go back to option C. It seems straightforward that hydrogen has a lower density than nitrogen because of its lower molar mass. So, unless there's something I'm missing, option C seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the different masses affect other properties.\n\nLet me think about the average speed of the molecules. According to the kinetic theory, the root mean square speed (vrms) is given by vrms = sqrt(3RT/M), where M is the molar mass. So, hydrogen, having a lower molar mass, would have a higher vrms than nitrogen. Does that affect any of the options?\n\nOption A was about average kinetic energy, which, as I recall, is (3/2)kT per molecule, so it depends only on temperature, not on mass. So, at the same temperature, average kinetic energies are equal.\n\nOption B is about the average force exerted on the container. Force is related to pressure, which is related to the momentum transfer per unit area per unit time. The momentum transfer depends on the mass and speed of the molecules. Since hydrogen molecules are lighter but move faster, and nitrogen molecules are heavier but move slower, it's not immediately clear which one exerts a greater force.\n\nBut according to the ideal gas law, pressure is proportional to the temperature and the number of moles per volume, P = nRT/V. So, if both containers have the same temperature and volume, and assuming they have the same number of moles, their pressures should be equal. But again, the problem doesn't specify the number of moles or molecules.\n\nOption D points out that without knowing the number of molecules, pressures can't be compared. That seems reasonable.\n\nBut option C is about density, which is mass per volume. Since hydrogen has a lower molar mass, for the same number of moles in the same volume, it would have lower density. So, unless the number of moles is different, which isn't specified, it's reasonable to assume that the density of hydrogen is less than that of nitrogen.\n\nPerhaps the key here is to recognize that the problem states \"two identical containers\" but doesn't specify whether they contain the same number of molecules or not. If they do contain the same number of molecules, then hydrogen would have lower density due to its lower molar mass.\n\nAlternatively, if they have the same mass of gas, then the number of moles would be different, with hydrogen having more moles for the same mass. But the problem doesn't specify.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the only safe statement is option C, that the density of hydrogen is less than that of nitrogen, assuming they have the same number of moles.\n\nAlternatively, if they have the same mass, then hydrogen would have more moles, which could affect the pressure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look back at the options.\n\nOption A is incorrect because average kinetic energy depends only on temperature.\n\nOption B is about force, which relates to pressure, and without knowing the number of molecules, we can't compare pressures.\n\nOption C seems correct based on molar masses.\n\nOption D is a valid point; without knowing the number of molecules, pressures can't be compared.\n\nSo, among these, option C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
