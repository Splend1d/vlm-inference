                    "text": "I'm trying to understand why perceptual or vernacular regions are so hard to pin down. The question gives me four options, and I need to pick the one that best explains their difficulty in identification. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst off, what are perceptual or vernacular regions? These are areas that people think of as having a certain character or identity, but they don't have official boundaries. For example, someone might consider the \"South\" in the United States to be a vernacular region, even though there's no precise line where the South ends and another region begins.\n\nOption A says that boundaries are constantly being redrawn. Hmm, that sounds more like political regions where borders change due to wars, treaties, or other political events. But perceptual regions aren't officially bounded, so their \"boundaries\" are more about people's perceptions. Maybe perceptions can change over time, but I'm not sure if \"redrawing boundaries\" is the best way to describe it.\n\nOption B mentions that physical features like rivers are constantly shifting. While it's true that natural features can change over time, perceptual regions aren't necessarily defined by physical geography alone. People might associate certain areas with particular characteristics that aren't strictly based on physical features. So, this might be a factor, but maybe not the main reason for their difficulty in identification.\n\nOption C states that defining criteria are subjective and differ among researchers. This seems promising. Since perceptual regions are based on people's thoughts and feelings about an area, what defines them can vary widely from person to person. One researcher might consider certain characteristics essential to defining a region, while another might focus on different aspects. This subjectivity makes it hard to come up with a universal definition or boundary for these regions.\n\nOption D talks about antecedent boundaries being drawn before humans were located in the regions. Antecedent boundaries are those established without considering the current population distribution, often based on natural features or historical claims. While this might be relevant to political or formal regions, it doesn't directly relate to perceptual regions, which are more about people's mental maps and perceptions.\n\nComparing all these options, option C seems to hit the nail on the head. The difficulty in identifying perceptual or vernacular regions stems from the fact that the criteria used to define them are subjective and can vary among different people and researchers. There's no objective, universally accepted way to delineate these regions because they rely on individual perceptions and interpretations.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. Defining criteria are subjective and differ among researchers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
