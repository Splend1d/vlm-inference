The concepts of \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" are central to this theory. In the context of exposure to erotica, social learning theory would suggest that individuals may learn certain behaviors or attitudes by observing them in sexual materials and then imitating those behaviors or attitudes in their own lives.\n\nTo break it down further:\n\n- **Modelling**: This refers to the process where an individual observes and replicates another's behavior. In the case of erotica, viewers might observe sexual behaviors or attitudes presented in the material and consider adopting similar behaviors or attitudes.\n\n- **Imitation**: This is the act of copying observed behaviors. If someone is exposed to sexual behaviors in erotica, they might imitate those behaviors in their own sexual interactions.\n\nLet's briefly consider why the other options are not the best fits:\n\n- **A. Sociobiology**: This is a field that examines how evolutionary principles such as mutation, adaptation, and phylogenetic history contribute to behavior. While it might touch on sexual behavior, it doesn't specifically use terms like \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" in the way social learning theory does.\n\n- **B. Psychoanalytic theory**: Developed by Sigmund Freud, this theory focuses on the unconscious mind and the process of psychosexual development. It doesn't primarily use the concepts of modelling and imitation to explain the effects of exposure to erotica.\n\n- **C. Script theory**: This theory, related to social psychology, suggests that people have mental scripts for social situations, which guide their behavior. While it involves cognition and behavior, it doesn't specifically emphasize modelling and imitation in the same way that social learning theory does.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is D. social learning theory."
