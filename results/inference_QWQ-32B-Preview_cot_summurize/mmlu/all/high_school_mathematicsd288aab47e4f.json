The magnitude, denoted as ||v||, is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. So for a vector v = (x, y, z), the magnitude is:\n\n||v|| = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\n\nIn this case, v = (5, 0, 7), so:\n\n||v|| = sqrt(5\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + 7\u00b2) = sqrt(25 + 0 + 49) = sqrt(74)\n\nNow, sqrt(74) is approximately 8.6023, which rounds to 8.6.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 8.6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
