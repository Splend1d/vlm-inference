                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements about AdaBoost one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"In AdaBoost, weights of the misclassified examples go up by the same multiplicative factor.\"\n\nAdaBoost, which stands for Adaptive Boosting, is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers to form a strong classifier. It does this by iteratively adjusting the weights of the training instances based on the performance of the current weak classifier.\n\nHere's how it works in a nutshell:\n\n1. Initially, all training examples are given equal weights.\n2. In each iteration, a weak classifier is trained on the weighted training data.\n3. The performance of this weak classifier is evaluated by computing its error rate on the training data.\n4. Based on this error rate, a weight (or say, importance) is assigned to this weak classifier.\n5. The weights of the training instances are then adjusted: instances that were misclassified by the current weak classifier have their weights increased, while the weights of correctly classified instances are decreased.\n6. This process is repeated for a predefined number of iterations or until the error rate is acceptable.\n\nNow, focusing on Statement 1: It says that the weights of misclassified examples go up by the same multiplicative factor. Is this accurate?\n\nIn AdaBoost, the weight update for each instance is indeed multiplicative, but the factor by which the weights are adjusted depends on the error rate of the current weak classifier. Specifically, the weight update factor is determined by the error rate of the weak classifier in that iteration.\n\nThe update formula for the weights is as follows:\n\n\\[ D_{t+1}(i) = \\frac{ D_t(i) \\exp(-\\alpha_t y_i h_t(x_i)) }{ Z_t } \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( D_t(i) \\) is the weight of the i-th instance at iteration t.\n- \\( \\alpha_t \\) is the weight or say, importance, of the t-th weak classifier.\n- \\( y_i \\) is the true class label of the i-th instance.\n- \\( h_t(x_i) \\) is the prediction of the t-th weak classifier for the i-th instance.\n- \\( Z_t \\) is a normalization factor to ensure that the updated weights sum up to 1.\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n- If the instance is correctly classified (\\( y_i h_t(x_i) = 1 \\)), the exponent becomes \\( -\\alpha_t \\), leading to a decrease in weight.\n- If the instance is misclassified (\\( y_i h_t(x_i) = -1 \\)), the exponent becomes \\( \\alpha_t \\), leading to an increase in weight.\n\nSo, the multiplicative factor is indeed dependent on \\( \\alpha_t \\), which in turn depends on the error rate of the weak classifier in that iteration.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is essentially correct, as misclassified examples do have their weights increased by a multiplicative factor, and this factor is the same for all misclassified examples in a given iteration.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"In AdaBoost, the weighted training error \\( e_t \\) of the t-th weak classifier on training data with weights \\( D_t \\) tends to increase as a function of t.\"\n\nThis statement is about how the weighted training error of each weak classifier changes as the algorithm progresses through iterations.\n\nRecall that in AdaBoost, the weights of the training instances are adjusted after each weak classifier is trained. Misclassified instances have their weights increased, making them more important for the next weak classifier to get right.\n\nGiven this mechanism, one might intuitively think that as the algorithm progresses, the weak classifiers would find it harder to correctly classify the instances, leading to an increase in the weighted training error over time.\n\nHowever, this is not the case. In reality, the weighted training error \\( e_t \\) tends to decrease or stay the same, not increase, as the algorithm progresses.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- AdaBoost assigns higher weights to misclassified instances, forcing subsequent weak classifiers to focus more on getting these hard instances correct.\n- As a result, weak classifiers in later iterations are likely to perform better on these previously misclassified instances, leading to a reduction in the weighted training error.\n\nIn fact, one of the key properties of AdaBoost is that it monotonically decreases the exponential loss function, which is related to the weighted training error.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false. The weighted training error \\( e_t \\) does not tend to increase as a function of t; instead, it tends to decrease or stay the same.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Statement 1 is True.\n- Statement 2 is False.\n\nSo, the correct choice is:\n\nC. True, False\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
