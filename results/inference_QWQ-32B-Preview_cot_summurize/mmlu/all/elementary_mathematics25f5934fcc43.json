I need to find the smallest number that both 4 and 10 can divide into without leaving a remainder.\n\nFirst, I remember that the least common multiple, or LCM, of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. So, for 4 and 10, I need to find the smallest number that both can divide evenly.\n\nOne way to find the LCM is to list the multiples of each number and see where they overlap.\n\nLet's list the multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, and so on.\n\nNow, multiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and so on.\n\nLooking at both lists, the common multiples are 20, 40, 60, etc. The smallest one is 20.\n\nWait a minute, but 14 is one of the options, and it's smaller than 20. Is 14 a multiple of both 4 and 10? Let's check.\n\nDoes 4 divide into 14? 14 divided by 4 is 3.5, which is not a whole number, so 14 is not a multiple of 4. So, 14 can't be the LCM of 4 and 10.\n\nOkay, so 20 is the smallest number that both 4 and 10 divide into without a remainder. So, the answer should be 20, which is option B.\n\nBut let me double-check just to be sure. Another way to find the LCM is to use the formula involving the greatest common divisor (GCD). The formula is LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).\n\nFirst, find the GCD of 4 and 10. The GCD is the largest number that divides both 4 and 10.\n\nFactors of 4: 1, 2, 4\n\nFactors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10\n\nThe greatest common divisor is 2.\n\nNow, plug into the formula: LCM(4, 10) = (4 * 10) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20.\n\nOkay, that confirms it. The LCM is 20.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's look at the other options.\n\nC. 40: 40 is a multiple of both 4 and 10, but it's not the least common multiple since 20 is smaller.\n\nD. 60: Same thing, 60 is a multiple of both, but again, 20 is smaller.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
