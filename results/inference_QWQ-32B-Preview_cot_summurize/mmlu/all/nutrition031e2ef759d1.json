Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor: Intrinsic factor is a protein secreted by the stomach that is essential for the absorption of vitamin B12. As people age, the production of intrinsic factor may decrease, leading to impaired absorption of vitamin B12.\n\nB. Atrophic gastritis: This is a condition where the stomach lining thins and becomes inflamed, which can lead to a reduction in the production of stomach acid and intrinsic factor. This, in turn, affects the absorption of vitamin B12.\n\nC. Helicobacter pylori infection: H. pylori is a bacterium that can infect the stomach and cause gastritis. This infection can lead to chronic inflammation and damage to the stomach lining, which may impair the production of intrinsic factor and affect vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nTherefore, all these factors can contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults. It's important for older individuals to have their vitamin B12 levels monitored and to consider supplementation if necessary."
