                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the enforceability of offers for selling widgets. We need to figure out which of these offers isn't enforceable if the seller changes their mind before the buyer accepts. So, we're looking for a situation where the seller can revoke their offer even if they've said it'll be open for a certain period.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the basic principles of contract law regarding offers and acceptance. Generally, an offer can be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance, as long as the revocation is communicated to the offeree. However, there are exceptions to this rule, especially in the context of merchants and firm offers.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: A merchant tells the buyer in writing that they will sell the widget for $35,000 and that the offer will be irrevocable for ten days.\n\nHere, the merchant is making a written offer that is irrevocable for ten days. In contract law, particularly under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs transactions between merchants, there is a provision for firm offers. UCC \u00a72-205 allows a merchant to make a firm offer that cannot be revoked for a specified period, but there are conditions.\n\nFor a firm offer to be enforceable, it must be in writing and signed by the offeror, and it can't be revoked for the time period specified, up to three months. So, in this case, if the offer is in writing and signed, and specifies that it's irrevocable for ten days, then generally, this offer should be enforceable, and the seller can't change their mind within those ten days.\n\nOption B: A merchant writes the buyer offering to sell the widget for $35,000.\n\nThis is a straightforward written offer without any mention of it being irrevocable for a certain period. In this scenario, the offer can be revoked by the seller at any time before acceptance, as long as the revocation is communicated to the buyer. So, if the seller changes their mind, they can revoke the offer before the buyer accepts it.\n\nOption C: A merchant telegraphs the buyer offering to sell the widget for $35,000 and promises to hold the offer open for ten days.\n\nThis is similar to option A, but instead of telling the buyer in writing, the merchant is telegraphing the offer. Telegraphing was a common method of communication in the past, and it's essentially a written communication. So, if the merchant is making a written offer via telegram and promising to hold it open for ten days, this might also fall under the firm offer rule, assuming it's in writing and signed.\n\nHowever, the key difference here might be the method of communication. But since it's still a written offer, it should be similar to option A. Under UCC \u00a72-205, the crucial factors are that the offer is in writing, signed by the offeror, and states that it will be held open for a specific period.\n\nOption D: A merchant writes the buyer offering to sell the widget for $35,000 and stating that the offer will be irrevocable for ten days if the buyer will pay $1.00. The buyer pays.\n\nIn this case, the merchant is making a written offer that is irrevocable for ten days, but only if the buyer pays $1.00. The buyer has paid the $1.00. This seems like the merchant is seeking consideration to keep the offer open. In contract law, for an option contract to be enforceable, there usually needs to be consideration from the offeree to keep the offer open.\n\nSo, if the buyer has paid $1.00 as consideration to keep the offer open for ten days, this should make the offer irrevocable for that period. The seller cannot change their mind within those ten days.\n\nNow, considering all these options, we need to identify which one is not enforceable if the seller changes their mind before acceptance.\n\nOption A seems enforceable because it's a written, irrevocable offer for ten days.\n\nOption B is not irrevocable; the seller can revoke it at any time before acceptance.\n\nOption C is similar to Option A, likely enforceable as a firm offer.\n\nOption D is an option contract supported by consideration, so it should be enforceable.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the offer that is not enforceable if the seller changes their mind before acceptance.\n\nOption B allows the seller to revoke the offer before acceptance, so that seems like the one that's not enforceable if the seller changes their mind.\n\nOptions A, C, and D have elements that make them irrevocable for a certain period, meaning the seller can't change their mind during that time.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Option B.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Option A, if it's a merchant making a written, signed offer that's irrevocable for ten days, under UCC \u00a72-205, it should be enforceable.\n\nIn Option C, even though it's telegraphed, it's still a written offer promising to hold it open for ten days, which should be similar to Option A.\n\nIn Option D, the buyer has paid consideration to keep the offer open, so it should be enforceable.\n\nOnly in Option B is there no provision for the offer to be irrevocable, so the seller can revoke it at any time before acceptance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
