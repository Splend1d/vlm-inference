So, in the context of what makes a relationship last, commitment (option B) is a key component. Commitment involves the decision to maintain an intimate relationship and working to sustain it. It's about making a long-term commitment to the relationship and being willing to work through challenges together. So, according to Sternberg, commitment is essential for a relationship to last over time."
