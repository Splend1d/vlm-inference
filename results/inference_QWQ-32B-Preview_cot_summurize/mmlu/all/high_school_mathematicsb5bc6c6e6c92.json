                    "text": "Let's see. I have a series where the first term is 2, and each next term is -2 times the one before it. I need to find the 5th term.\n\nSo, starting with the first term:\n\n1st term: 2\n\nNow, to get the second term, I multiply the first term by -2:\n\n2nd term: 2 * (-2) = -4\n\nFor the third term, I multiply the second term by -2:\n\n3rd term: -4 * (-2) = 8\n\nFourth term: 8 * (-2) = -16\n\nAnd finally, the fifth term: -16 * (-2) = 32\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\n1st: 2\n\n2nd: 2 * (-2) = -4\n\n3rd: -4 * (-2) = 8\n\n4th: 8 * (-2) = -16\n\n5th: -16 * (-2) = 32\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the 5th term should be 32.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to look at this. This is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. Here, the common ratio is -2.\n\nThe general formula for the nth term of a geometric series is:\n\nnth term = first term * (common ratio)^(n-1)\n\nSo, for the 5th term:\n\n5th term = 2 * (-2)^(5-1) = 2 * (-2)^4\n\nNow, (-2)^4 = 16, because (-2) * (-2) = 4, then 4 * (-2) = -8, then -8 * (-2) = 16.\n\nSo, 2 * 16 = 32.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. -16\n\nB. 32\n\nC. -32\n\nD. 64\n\n32 is option B.\n\nWait, but I remember that negative times negative is positive, so let's verify again.\n\n1st: 2\n\n2nd: 2 * (-2) = -4\n\n3rd: -4 * (-2) = 8\n\n4th: 8 * (-2) = -16\n\n5th: -16 * (-2) = 32\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the powers:\n\n(-2)^1 = -2\n\n(-2)^2 = 4\n\n(-2)^3 = -8\n\n(-2)^4 = 16\n\nSo, 2 * 16 = 32.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake in the question or the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the first term as term 0, but normally, in sequences, the first term is term 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"each subsequent term is -2 multiplied by the preceding term\" is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"each subsequent term is \u22122 multiplied by the preceding term\".\n\nSo, an_n = -2 * a_{n-1}\n\nWith a1 = 2\n\nThen:\n\na2 = -2 * a1 = -2 * 2 = -4\n\na3 = -2 * a2 = -2 * (-4) = 8\n\na4 = -2 * a3 = -2 * 8 = -16\n\na5 = -2 * a4 = -2 * (-16) = 32\n\nYes, definitely 32.\n\nBut let's think about the possibility of a different interpretation.\n\nSuppose someone thinks that \"multiplied by the preceding term\" means multiplying two terms together, but that doesn't make sense because the formula specifies \"-2 multiplied by the preceding term\", which is clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where every odd term is positive and every even term is negative, or vice versa.\n\nFrom the calculations:\n\n1st: 2 (positive)\n\n2nd: -4 (negative)\n\n3rd: 8 (positive)\n\n4th: -16 (negative)\n\n5th: 32 (positive)\n\nSo, odd terms are positive, even terms are negative.\n\nTherefore, 5th term should be positive, which is 32.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 32 is B.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a misprint in the question or the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the first term is not multiplied by -2, but only subsequent terms are, meaning the first term is 2, second term is -2*2 = -4, and so on, which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question means that each term is the previous term multiplied by -2, including the first term.\n\nWait, no, it says the first term is 2, and each subsequent term is -2 multiplied by the preceding term.\n\nSo, the first term is 2, and then each next term is -2 times the previous one.\n\nSo, a1 = 2\n\na2 = -2 * a1 = -4\n\na3 = -2 * a2 = 8\n\na4 = -2 * a3 = -16\n\na5 = -2 * a4 = 32\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about a different type of series, but it specifies it's a geometric series with a common ratio of -2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nLet me re-calculate:\n\nStart with 2.\n\nMultiply by -2: 2 * -2 = -4\n\nMultiply by -2: -4 * -2 = 8\n\nMultiply by -2: 8 * -2 = -16\n\nMultiply by -2: -16 * -2 = 32\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about absolute values, but no, the signs are important here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is misread, and it says something different, but based on what's written, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where every term alternates in sign, which is true, given the multiplication by -2.\n\nBut according to the calculations, the 5th term should be 32.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 32 is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in one of the steps.\n\nLet me check again:\n\na1 = 2\n\na2 = -2 * 2 = -4\n\na3 = -2 * (-4) = 8\n\na4 = -2 * 8 = -16\n\na5 = -2 * (-16) = 32\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about a different series or has different starting points, but based on what's provided, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the term numbering, but typically, the first term is term 1, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the series is defined differently, but according to the problem, it's a geometric series with first term 2 and common ratio -2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nGiven that, I would conclude that the 5th term is 32, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
