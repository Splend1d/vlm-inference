                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* statistics, which are both used to test for autocorrelation in time series data. Autocorrelation is when a time series is linearly related to its own lagged values, and these tests help us determine if such relationships exist beyond a certain lag.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these statistics represents and how they differ, especially in terms of their properties in small and large samples. The Box-Pierce Q statistic is an older test, and the Ljung-Box Q* is a modified version that aims to improve upon some of the limitations of the original Box-Pierce test.\n\nOption A says: \"Asymptotically, the values of the two test statistics will be equal.\" Asymptotically means as the sample size approaches infinity. Both Q and Q* are asymptotically equivalent, meaning that as the sample size grows larger and larger, the values of Q and Q* will converge and become essentially the same. So, this statement seems correct.\n\nOption B claims: \"The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*.\" This sounds\u53ef\u7591 because, generally, the Ljung-Box Q* is designed to have better small-sample properties compared to the Box-Pierce Q. The modification in Q* is intended to make it more accurate in smaller samples. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nOption C states: \"The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples.\" An over-sized test means that the actual rejection rate is higher than the nominal significance level. For example, if you set your significance level at 5%, but the test rejects the null hypothesis 10% of the time when it's true, it's over-sized. It's known that the Box-Pierce Q test can be over-sized in small samples, which is one of the reasons the Ljung-Box Q* was developed. So, this statement is correct.\n\nOption D says: \"As the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients.\" This is an important point about hypothesis testing in general. With very large sample sizes, even tiny deviations from the null hypothesis can become statistically significant. So, if there is any autocorrelation, no matter how small, the test will eventually reject the null hypothesis as the sample size increases. However, if the null hypothesis is truly true (i.e., there is no autocorrelation), the tests should not reject it, even with large samples. So, this statement is a bit misleading. It's true that with large samples, very small effects can be detected, but if there is no autocorrelation, the tests should not reject the null hypothesis more often than the significance level suggests.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B seems to be the incorrect statement, as it contradicts the general understanding that the Ljung-Box Q* has better small-sample properties compared to the Box-Pierce Q.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
