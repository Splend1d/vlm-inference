Vegans, who do not consume any animal products, may have a higher risk of Vitamin B12 deficiency if they do not supplement their diet appropriately. This can be particularly concerning for infants born to vegan mothers, as Vitamin B12 is essential for proper brain development and function. Therefore, it's important for vegan mothers to ensure they are getting adequate Vitamin B12, either through fortified foods or supplements, to support both their own health and that of their infants."
