It states that if \\( p \\) is a prime number, and \\( a \\) is an integer not divisible by \\( p \\), then \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\). In this problem, we need to find the remainder when \\( 3^{47} \\) is divided by 23.\n\nFirst, let's confirm that 23 is a prime number. Indeed, 23 is prime since it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Also, 3 is not divisible by 23, so Fermat's Little Theorem applies here.\n\nAccording to Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n\\[\n3^{22} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to express \\( 3^{47} \\) in terms of \\( 3^{22} \\), since we know that \\( 3^{22} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23} \\).\n\nFirst, let's find how many times 22 fits into 47:\n\n\\[\n47 = 2 \\times 22 + 3\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n3^{47} = 3^{2 \\times 22 + 3} = (3^{22})^2 \\times 3^3\n\\]\n\nUsing Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n\\[\n(3^{22})^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n3^{47} \\equiv 1 \\times 3^3 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( 3^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n3^3 = 27\n\\]\n\nFinally, find the remainder when 27 is divided by 23:\n\n\\[\n27 \\div 23 = 1 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n27 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{23}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the remainder when \\( 3^{47} \\) is divided by 23 is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
