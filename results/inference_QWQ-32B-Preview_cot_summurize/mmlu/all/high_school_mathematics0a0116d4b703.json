I need to find the greatest possible quotient from any two distinct members of the set \\(\\left\\{\\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{2}, 5, 10\\right\\}\\). Basically, I need to maximize \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are different numbers from this set.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a quotient is. It's just the result of dividing one number by another. So, I need to pick two different numbers from the set, divide one by the other, and find which combination gives me the largest result.\n\nTo maximize \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\), I should probably pick the largest possible \\(x\\) and the smallest possible \\(y\\). That way, their ratio will be as large as possible.\n\nLooking at the set: \\(\\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{2}, 5, 10\\).\n\nLet me list them in ascending order to see clearly:\n\n\\(\\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\\)\n\n\\(5\\)\n\n\\(10\\)\n\nSo, the smallest number is \\(\\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\\), and the largest is \\(10\\).\n\nIf I choose \\(x = 10\\) and \\(y = 0.4\\), then \\(\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{10}{0.4} = 25\\).\n\nWait a minute, is 25 one of the options? Let me check the choices:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. 10\n\nC. 20\n\nD. 25\n\nYes, 25 is option D.\n\nBut I should double-check if there's a larger quotient possible with other combinations.\n\nLet's try \\(x = 10\\) and \\(y = 0.5\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{10}{0.5} = 20\\), which is less than 25.\n\nNext, \\(x = 10\\) and \\(y = 5\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{10}{5} = 2\\), even smaller.\n\nNow, \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 0.4\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{5}{0.4} = 12.5\\), which is less than 25.\n\n\\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 0.5\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{5}{0.5} = 10\\), still less than 25.\n\n\\(x = 0.5\\) and \\(y = 0.4\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{0.5}{0.4} = 1.25\\), way less.\n\nAnd so on. It seems that the largest quotient is indeed 25.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider all possible pairs:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{10}{0.4} = 25\\)\n\n2. \\(\\frac{10}{0.5} = 20\\)\n\n3. \\(\\frac{10}{5} = 2\\)\n\n4. \\(\\frac{5}{0.4} = 12.5\\)\n\n5. \\(\\frac{5}{0.5} = 10\\)\n\n6. \\(\\frac{5}{10} = 0.5\\)\n\n7. \\(\\frac{0.5}{0.4} = 1.25\\)\n\n8. \\(\\frac{0.5}{10} = 0.05\\)\n\n9. \\(\\frac{0.4}{10} = 0.04\\)\n\n10. \\(\\frac{0.4}{5} = 0.08\\)\n\nFrom all these, the maximum is indeed 25.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
