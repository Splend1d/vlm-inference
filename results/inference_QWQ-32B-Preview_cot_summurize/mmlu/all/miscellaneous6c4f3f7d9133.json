I remember that concurrent powers are powers that both the federal government and the state governments possess and can exercise. So, I need to think about which of these options both levels of government can do.\n\nOption A is \"The printing and coining of money.\" I think this is mainly a federal power. The U.S. Treasury is in charge of printing money, right? I don't think states have the power to print their own money. So, maybe this isn't a concurrent power.\n\nOption B is \"The power to declare war.\" That seems like a federal power. The Constitution gives Congress the authority to declare war. I don't think states can declare war. So, probably not a concurrent power.\n\nOption C is \"The process of naturalization.\" Naturalization is when immigrants become citizens, right? I believe that's handled at the federal level because citizenship is a national issue. So, maybe not a concurrent power.\n\nOption D is \"The levying of taxes.\" Hmm, this one interests me. I know that both the federal government and state governments can levy taxes. The federal government has income taxes, and states also have their own income taxes, sales taxes, and other types of taxes. So, it seems like both levels of government can do this.\n\nLet me double-check. If concurrent powers are those that both federal and state governments share, then levying taxes fits that description. Both can impose taxes to fund their operations and services.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me quickly recall some other examples of concurrent powers. I think establishing courts is another one. Both federal and state governments have court systems. Also, enforcing laws and borrowing money are concurrent powers.\n\nBut in this list, the only option that clearly represents a power shared by both federal and state governments is \"The levying of taxes.\"\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. The levying of taxes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
