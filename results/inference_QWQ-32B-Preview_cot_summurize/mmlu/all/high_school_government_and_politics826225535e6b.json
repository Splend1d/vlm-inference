The options are about different aspects of law and policy, and the question is asking about the purpose of the exclusionary rule. Let me see.\n\nOption A mentions \"separate but equal\" facilities for racial segregation. I know that \"separate but equal\" was a legal doctrine that was used to justify racial segregation, but I don't think that has anything to do with the exclusionary rule. The exclusionary rule sounds more related to criminal procedure and evidence in court.\n\nOption B talks about allowing private organizations to restrict their memberships. That seems like it might be related to freedom of association or something, but again, not directly connected to the exclusionary rule as far as I can tell.\n\nOption C says it's about limiting the government's ability to use illegally obtained evidence. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think the exclusionary rule has something to do with evidence that is obtained illegally not being admissible in court. So, this might be the correct answer.\n\nOption D mentions denying control of interstate commerce to the states. That seems related to federalism and the division of powers between the federal and state governments, particularly regarding commerce. But I don't see how that connects to the exclusionary rule.\n\nLet me think more about option C. The exclusionary rule is a legal principle that prohibits the use of evidence collected or analyzed in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights. It's meant to deter law enforcement from conducting illegal searches and seizures by ensuring that such actions do not yield any tangible benefits in court. So, it does limit the government's ability to use illegally obtained evidence.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and D seem to be about different legal principles or doctrines that aren't directly related to evidence admissibility in criminal trials.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: to limit the government's ability to use illegally obtained evidence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
