                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have Alice, who owned Greyacre in fee simple. That means she had complete ownership of the property with no limitations on her interest.\n\nThen, Alice sold the property to Barbara and gave her a deed, but Barbara didn't record it. So, Barbara now has the deed, but it's not on public record.\n\nThree years later, Alice sells the same property to Charlene, who immediately records her deed. So now, both Barbara and Charlene claim ownership of the property.\n\nThe jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system. Okay, so I need to understand what that means.\n\nA race-notice statute is a type of recording statute that aims to protect both the recorders of deeds and subsequent purchasers who act in good faith without notice of prior unrecorded instruments.\n\nIn a race-notice jurisdiction, if there are two or more parties claiming interest in the same property, the one who records first gets priority, provided they had no notice of any prior unrecorded deeds.\n\nAdditionally, a tract index system is a method of recording deeds that organizes records by the property's description rather than by the names of the parties. This system makes it easier to see who has an interest in a particular piece of property.\n\nNow, let's see what options we have:\n\nA. Alice, since her ownership was first in time and she was of record.\n\nB. Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara.\n\nC. Barbara, because she was the first to convey her deed.\n\nD. Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.\n\nLet's evaluate each option.\n\nOption A: Alice owned the property first, but she sold it to Barbara and then to Charlene. So, technically, her ownership was terminated when she sold it to Barbara, assuming Barbara's deed is valid.\n\nBut, since Barbara didn't record her deed, and Charlene recorded her deed later, perhaps Alice's deed to Charlene is what's on record.\n\nWait, but Charlene recorded her deed immediately after receiving it from Alice. So, Charlene's deed should be on record.\n\nBut Barbara had the deed first,\u53ea\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\uff0c\u5df4bara\u7684deed\u662f\u6700\u65e9\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\n\nOption B: Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara.\n\nThis suggests that Charlene knew about Barbara's deed when she bought from Alice. If that's the case, then Charlene wouldn't have priority because she had notice of the prior unrecorded deed.\n\nBut the question is, did Charlene have notice of Barbara's deed?\n\nIn a race-notice jurisdiction, if a subsequent purchaser records first but had notice of a prior unrecorded deed, the prior unrecorded deed holder gets priority.\n\nOption C: Barbara, because she was the first to convey her deed.\n\nWait, but Barbara didn't record her deed; she just conveyed it from Alice. So, I think this option is misworded. Maybe it's \"first to convey her deed\" meaning first to get the deed from Alice.\n\nBut in race-notice jurisdictions, recording is key.\n\nOption D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.\n\nThis seems plausible because in race-notice jurisdictions, the first to record gets priority, provided they had no notice of prior deeds.\n\nSo, in this case, Charlene recorded her deed immediately after receiving it from Alice, and Barbara never recorded her deed.\n\nBut, there's a catch. Did Charlene have notice of Barbara's deed?\n\nIf Charlene had notice of Barbara's deed, then even though she recorded first, Barbara would have priority because Charlene had notice of Barbara's prior unrecorded deed.\n\nBut the question is, did Charlene have notice?\n\nThe problem states that the jurisdiction has a tract index system, which should show all recorded deeds related to the property.\n\nSince Barbara didn't record her deed, Charlene, when she recorded her deed, should not have had notice of Barbara's deed, right?\n\nWait, but perhaps there is constructive notice.\n\nIn a race-notice jurisdiction with a tract index system, a subsequent purchaser like Charlene is expected to check the public records to see if there are any prior deeds or claims on the property.\n\nSince Barbara didn't record her deed, Charlene, by checking the public records, wouldn't have seen Barbara's deed.\n\nTherefore, Charlene would have no notice of Barbara's deed, and since she recorded first, she should have priority.\n\nBut, the question is, is there any way Charlene could be deemed to have notice of Barbara's deed?\n\nMaybe if Barbara was in possession of the property, Charlene would have inquiry notice.\n\nWait, the problem says Barbara moved into the only residence on the land.\n\nSo, Barbara is in possession of the property.\n\nIn that case, Charlene, as a subsequent purchaser, should have inquired about Barbara's possession.\n\nIf she knew Barbara was living there, she should have investigated and found out about Barbara's deed.\n\nTherefore, Charlene would have constructive notice of Barbara's interest in the property.\n\nSo, even though Barbara didn't record her deed, Charlene's actual knowledge of Barbara's possession would put her on notice of Barbara's claim.\n\nTherefore, in a race-notice jurisdiction, if a subsequent purchaser has notice of a prior unrecorded deed, the prior unrecorded deed holder gets priority.\n\nSo, in this case, Barbara would have priority over Charlene.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option B: Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara.\n\nWait, but option C says Barbara, because she was the first to convey her deed.\n\nMaybe that's also correct, but option B specifies the reason, which is more accurate.\n\nOption D is attractive because Charlene recorded first, but in this case, since Charlene had notice of Barbara's deed, Barbara should have priority.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Alice sold the property to Barbara first, and even though Barbara didn't record, Charlene had notice of Barbara's possession.\n\nSo, the likely outcome would be for Barbara to have title to the property.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
