                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the origin of Lassa and Ebola viruses in West Africa. The options are humans, primates, fruit bats, and pigs. I need to choose the correct source of these viruses.\n\nFirst, I know that both Lassa and Ebola are zoonotic viruses, meaning they are transmitted from animals to humans. So, it's unlikely that their origin is humans themselves. That rules out option A.\n\nNext, I think about primates. I've heard that some viruses come from primates, like HIV, which is believed to have originated from chimpanzees. So, maybe Ebola comes from primates. But what about Lassa virus?\n\nLassa virus is associated with multimammate rats, but I don't see rats in the options. Maybe it's not primates. Wait, perhaps fruit bats are the source.\n\nI recall that fruit bats are considered reservoirs for Ebola virus. There have been studies indicating that fruit bats can carry the Ebola virus without getting sick themselves. So, maybe fruit bats are the origin for Ebola.\n\nAs for Lassa virus, I'm not sure. I know that Lassa virus is carried by multimammate rats, but perhaps there's a connection to fruit bats as well. Or maybe pigs are involved in Lassa virus transmission.\n\nWait, pigs are more associated with Nipah virus, which is another zoonotic virus, but I don't think pigs are involved in Lassa or Ebola virus transmission in West Africa.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the origin is fruit bats for both viruses. I've read that fruit bats are considered natural hosts for Ebola virus. As for Lassa, it's mainly associated with rats, but perhaps fruit bats could be a source as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that both viruses originate from different animals. But the question seems to be asking for a single origin among the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the primary reservoir or origin of both viruses, and fruit bats are implicated in both.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. Lassa virus is primarily associated with multimammate rats, but maybe fruit bats could also be a source for Lassa virus.\n\nI need to check some facts here. Lassa virus is known to be carried by the multimammate rat (Mastomys species), which is a rodent. These rats live in close proximity to human settlements in West Africa and can contaminate food and living areas, leading to human infections.\n\nOn the other hand, Ebola virus has been linked to fruit bats, particularly species like Eidolon helvum and Rousettus aegyptiacus, which are found in West Africa. These bats can carry the virus without showing symptoms and can transmit it to other animals or humans through direct contact or consumption of contaminated materials.\n\nSo, for Ebola virus, fruit bats seem to be a likely origin or reservoir. For Lassa virus, the reservoir is the multimammate rat. But since rats aren't an option here, and considering that fruit bats might have some role in Lassa virus transmission, perhaps fruit bats are the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to link both viruses to a single origin among the given choices, and fruit bats are the most plausible option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps primates are involved in Ebola virus transmission, as there have been outbreaks in primate populations in Africa. However, primates are not the original reservoir; they are also victims of the virus, like humans.\n\nPigs are more related to Nipah virus and perhaps other viruses, but not prominently associated with Lassa or Ebola in West Africa.\n\nTherefore, considering all this, I would go with option C, fruit bats, as the origin for these viruses in West Africa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
