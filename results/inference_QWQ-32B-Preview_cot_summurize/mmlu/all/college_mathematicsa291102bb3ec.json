This theorem states that every finite Abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order, and this decomposition is unique up to the order of the factors.\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 72.\n\n\\[ 72 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\]\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem, the number of distinct Abelian groups of order 72 is equal to the product of the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization.\n\nA partition of a positive integer n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers, where the order of the summands doesn't matter.\n\nLet's find the partitions for the exponents in the prime factorization of 72.\n\nFor the exponent of 2, which is 3:\n\nPartitions of 3:\n\n1. 3\n2. 2 + 1\n3. 1 + 1 + 1\n\nSo, there are 3 partitions for the exponent of 2.\n\nFor the exponent of 3, which is 2:\n\nPartitions of 2:\n\n1. 2\n2. 1 + 1\n\nSo, there are 2 partitions for the exponent of 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct Abelian groups of order 72 is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\]\n\nTo verify, let's list all possible Abelian groups of order 72 up to isomorphism.\n\n1. \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{2^3} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{3^2} = \\mathbb{Z}_8 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_9 \\)\n\n2. \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{2^2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{3^2} = \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_9 \\)\n\n3. \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{3^2} = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_9 \\)\n\n4. \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{2^3} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 = \\mathbb{Z}_8 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\)\n\n5. \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{2^2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 = \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\)\n\n6. \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\)\n\nThus, there are indeed 6 distinct Abelian groups of order 72 up to isomorphism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]\n\n**Concept Check**\n\n- **Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups**: Every finite Abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n- **Partitions of Exponents**: The number of ways to partition the exponents in the prime factorization determines the number of distinct Abelian groups.\n- **Isomorphism Classes**: Ensuring that the listed groups are distinct up to isomorphism by considering different combinations of cyclic group orders.\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid**\n\n- Incorrect prime factorization of the group order.\n- Miscounting the number of partitions for the exponents.\n- Forgetting to take the product of the number of partitions for each prime exponent.\n\n**Additional Insights**\n\n- The partitions correspond to the possible exponents in the cyclic group factors.\n- Understanding that different partitions lead to non-isomorphic groups is crucial.\n- This method generalizes to any finite Abelian group by considering its prime factorization.\n\n**Practice Problem**\n\nHow many structurally distinct Abelian groups have order 48?\n\n**Solution**\n\nFirst, find the prime factorization of 48:\n\n\\[ 48 = 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\]\n\nNow, find the number of partitions for each exponent:\n\n- Partitions of 4 (for \\(2^4\\)):\n\n1. 4\n2. 3 + 1\n3. 2 + 2\n4. 2 + 1 + 1\n5. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nSo, there are 5 partitions for the exponent of 2.\n\n- Partitions of 1 (for \\(3^1\\)):\n\n1. 1\n\nSo, there is 1 partition for the exponent of 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct Abelian groups of order 48 is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 1 = 5 \\]\n\nThus, there are 5 structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 48.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
