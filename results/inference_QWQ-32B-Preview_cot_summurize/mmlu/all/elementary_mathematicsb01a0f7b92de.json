The options are 1, 90, 180, and 360 degrees. I know that a full circle is 360 degrees, but I'm not sure how to find what 1/360 of that would be.\n\nMaybe I should start by recalling that a full circle is 360 degrees. So, if I take 1/360 of that, I should divide 360 degrees by 360. Let me do that: 360 divided by 360 equals 1. So, 1/360 of a circle is 1 degree.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Is there a chance I'm missing something here? Maybe I should consider whether the angle is measured in degrees or something else, but the question specifies degrees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me by presenting the full circle as 360 degrees and asking for 1/360, which is indeed 1 degree. But let's double-check.\n\nIf I think about a circle divided into 360 equal parts, each part would represent 1 degree. So, 1/360 of a circle would correspond to 1 degree.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 1 degree, B is 90 degrees, C is 180 degrees, and D is 360 degrees. Based on my calculation, A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider what the other options represent. 90 degrees is a right angle, 180 degrees is a straight angle, and 360 degrees is a full circle. None of these seem to correspond to 1/360 of a circle, so 1 degree must be the correct answer.\n\nI think I've got it. The measure of an angle that is equivalent to 1/360 of a circle is 1 degree. So, the answer is A. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
