I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US around 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: \"As my parents slept, I used a bra to get laughs.\" Hmm, this sounds a bit odd. Using a bra to get laughs while your parents are sleeping? That seems disrespectful and maybe even creepy. Plus, it might involve invading their privacy or messing with their belongings without permission. That doesn't sound right.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I like to barter at the bazaar because it's fun to negotiate.\" Bartering at a bazaar sounds like a normal activity. Bargaining is common in many markets around the world, including some in the US. It's about negotiating prices, which is a standard part of the shopping experience in certain types of markets. Nothing seems wrong with that.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the first scenario seems clearly morally wrong, while the second one doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
