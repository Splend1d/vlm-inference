                    "text": "So I've got this question about phosphorus-31 NMR spectroscopy involving sodium phosphate. It says that in the spectrum, there's only a single line, and it gives the chemical shifts for dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4-) and hydrogen phosphate (HPO4^2-). The chemical shifts are 3.42 ppm for H2PO4- and 5.82 ppm for HPO4^2-. The question is asking for the chemical shift when the pH of the solution equals the pKa of H2PO4-.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that in NMR spectroscopy, the chemical shift reflects the electronic environment around the nucleus. In this case, it's phosphorus-31, and the chemical shift differences are due to the different numbers of protons attached to the phosphate groups.\n\nGiven that there's only a single line in the spectrum, it suggests that at the pH where the measurement was taken, only one species is present, or the chemical shifts of the two species overlap due to some condition. But the question is asking for the chemical shift at a specific pH, which is equal to the pKa of H2PO4-.\n\nI remember that pKa is the pH at which the concentrations of an acid and its conjugate base are equal. So, for H2PO4-, its pKa is the pH at which [H2PO4-] equals [HPO4^2-].\n\nGiven that, at pH = pKa, the concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- should be equal.\n\nNow, in NMR, the signal intensity is proportional to the concentration of the resonating nuclei. So, if both species are present in equal concentrations, their signals should add up. But the problem says there's only a single line, which might mean that at this particular pH, the chemical shifts of both species coincide or that they are averaging to a single chemical shift.\n\nWait, but the chemical shifts are given as 3.42 ppm and 5.82 ppm for the two species, respectively. So, unless there's some cancellation or overlapping due to coupling, which isn't mentioned, I'd expect to see two separate peaks at these chemical shifts if both species are present.\n\nHowever, the problem states that there's only a single line seen in the spectrum. This suggests that perhaps at pH equal to pKa, the chemical shifts of the two species coincide, leading to a single peak.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because the chemical shifts are different. Alternatively, maybe there's a magnetic equivalence or some other effect causing the peaks to overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is implying that at pH equal to pKa, the chemical shift is the weighted average of the chemical shifts of the two species, weighted by their concentrations.\n\nGiven that at pH = pKa, [H2PO4-] = [HPO4^2-], so their concentrations are equal. Therefore, the overall chemical shift should be the average of the two given chemical shifts.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nChemical shift = (3.42 ppm + 5.82 ppm) / 2 = 9.24 ppm / 2 = 4.62 ppm.\n\nWait, but that's one of the options: D. 4.62 ppm.\n\nBut let me think again. Is it really a simple average?\n\nI recall that in NMR, when there are multiple species in solution, each with their own chemical shifts, and their populations are different, the overall chemical shift of the mixture is the weighted average of the chemical shifts, weighted by the mole fractions of each species.\n\nIn this case, at pH = pKa, the concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- are equal, so their mole fractions are both 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the overall chemical shift should be:\n\nChemical shift = (0.5 * 3.42 ppm) + (0.5 * 5.82 ppm) = (1.71 + 2.91) ppm = 4.62 ppm.\n\nThat matches option D.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any other factor that could influence this.\n\nIs there any coupling between the two species that could affect the chemical shift? The problem doesn't mention any J-coupling, so I'll assume that the peaks are uncoupled.\n\nAlso, phosphorus-31 NMR is less sensitive to proton coupling compared to carbon-13 or hydrogen NMR, especially in aqueous solution where relaxation times might be affected.\n\nAdditionally, sodium phosphate in solution would dissociate into Na+ and PO4^3-, but phosphate can exist in different protonation states, hence H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\nGiven that, and considering that at pH = pKa, the concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- are equal, their NMR signals should average to the midpoint between their chemical shifts.\n\nTherefore, 4.62 ppm seems correct.\n\nBut wait, option C is 4.33 ppm. Is there a possibility that I'm miscalculating?\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n3.42 + 5.82 = 9.24\n\n9.24 / 2 = 4.62 ppm.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the chemical shift to be the centroid of the two peaks, which again would be the average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a difference in the number of protons or some other factor affecting the chemical shift.\n\nWait, phosphorus-31 chemical shifts can be influenced by the number of protons attached, but in this case, both species have different numbers of protons, which is why their chemical shifts are different.\n\nBut since we're dealing with equal concentrations, averaging seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chemical shift is not simply the average, but there's a formula that takes into account the chemical shifts and the pKa.\n\nI recall that in proton NMR, for acidic protons, the chemical shift can be pH-dependent, and there are equations to calculate the chemical shift as a function of pH.\n\nBut for phosphorus-31, I'm not sure if such a relationship exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chemical shift varies with pH in a way that at pH = pKa, it's at the midpoint between the two chemical shifts.\n\nGiven that, again, 4.62 ppm would make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more precise way to calculate this using the NMR chemical shift tensors or other advanced concepts, but I don't think that's expected at this level.\n\nGiven that, I think D. 4.62 ppm is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the chemical shift at pH = pKa.\n\nFor example, if there is J-coupling between the phosphorus and protons, it could split the peaks, but the problem states that there's only a single line, so perhaps any coupling is being averaged or is not significant in this case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the chemical shift is pH-dependent in a way that at pH = pKa, there's a specific shift that's different from the average.\n\nBut without more information, I think averaging is the best approach.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the chemical shift when pH equals pKa is 4.62 ppm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.62 \\text{ ppm}} \\]"
