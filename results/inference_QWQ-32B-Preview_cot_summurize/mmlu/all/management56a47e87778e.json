                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about McGregor's Theory X. So, McGregor had two theories about how managers view their employees: Theory X and Theory Y. Theory X is more traditional and assumes that employees are inherently lazy and dislike work, while Theory Y assumes that employees are self-motivated and enjoy work.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Workers enjoy responsibility.\n\nThis sounds like something Theory Y would suggest, right? Theory Y assumes that people are willing to take on responsibility and exercise self-direction.\n\nB. Workers view physical and mental effort as a natural part of work.\n\nAgain, this seems aligned with Theory Y, which posits that people find fulfillment in their work and are motivated intrinsically.\n\nC. Workers like to show initiative.\n\nOnce more, this fits with Theory Y, which assumes that people are creative and willing to solve problems on their own.\n\nD. Workers like to be directed.\n\nHmm, this seems different. Theory X assumes that employees prefer to be told what to do, avoid responsibility, and need to be controlled or threatened with punishment to achieve goals.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option D is the one that aligns with Theory X. Let me double-check.\n\nTheory X assumptions include:\n\n1. Average workers inherently dislike work and will avoid it if possible.\n\n2. Because of this, most people must be coerced, controlled, directed, or threatened with punishment to achieve organizational goals.\n\n3. The average person prefers to be directed, wishes to avoid responsibility, has relatively little ambition, and wants security above all else.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Workers enjoy responsibility. \u2013 This contradicts Theory X, which says workers avoid responsibility.\n\nB. Workers view physical and mental effort as a natural part of work. \u2013 Theory X assumes workers try to avoid effort.\n\nC. Workers like to show initiative. \u2013 Again, Theory X assumes workers avoid initiative and prefer to be directed.\n\nD. Workers like to be directed. \u2013 This matches Theory X's assumption that workers prefer direction and avoid responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Workers like to be directed.\n\nIt's important to understand the context behind these theories. Theory X was more prevalent in the early 20th century when management was more authoritarian, and there was a belief that workers needed strict supervision to be productive. Theory Y, on the other hand, emerged later and aligns more with modern management practices that emphasize employee empowerment and autonomy.\n\nSo, in summary, option D is the feature of McGregor's Theory X because it reflects the assumption that workers prefer to be directed and avoid responsibility, which is central to Theory X.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
