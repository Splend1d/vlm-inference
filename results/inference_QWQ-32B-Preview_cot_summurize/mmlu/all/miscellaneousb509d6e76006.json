It is a semiconductor material that allows for the creation of transistors, which are the building blocks of integrated circuits. The properties of silicon make it ideal for this purpose, as it can be doped with other elements to control its electrical conductivity.\n\nWhile the other options listed\u2014sodium, aluminum, and silver\u2014are elements, they are not primarily used in the composition of computer microchips. Sodium is a highly reactive alkali metal, aluminum is a lightweight metal used in various applications including packaging and construction, and silver is a precious metal known for its conductivity but is not typically used in microchip manufacturing due to cost and other properties.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Silicon."
