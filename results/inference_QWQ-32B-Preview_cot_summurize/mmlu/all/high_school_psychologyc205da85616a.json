                    "text": "I think the answer is D. in-group bias. Prejudice often comes from favoring our own group and looking down on others, which sounds a lot like in-group bias. But let me make sure I understand this properly.\n\nSo, in-group bias is when people give preferential treatment to others who are part of their in-group, which is a group they identify with, and they show negativity or discrimination towards out-group members. This seems directly related to prejudice, which is unfair feelings or attitudes towards people based on their group membership.\n\nNow, let's look at the other options to be sure.\n\nA. Individualism is more about valuing personal independence and self-reliance. It's a cultural value that doesn't directly explain prejudice.\n\nB. Collectivism is the opposite, focusing on group harmony and interdependence. While it's about group dynamics, it doesn't specifically explain prejudice.\n\nC. Self-serving bias is when people attribute their successes to internal factors and failures to external factors, to protect their ego. It's about how individuals perceive their own actions and outcomes, not about attitudes towards others based on group membership.\n\nSo, compared to these options, in-group bias seems to be the principle that best explains prejudice. It directly deals with favoritism towards one's own group and negativity towards others, which are key components of prejudice.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are other social psychological principles that could also explain prejudice. For example, social identity theory suggests that people derive part of their identity from the groups they belong to, and this can lead to in-group favoritism and out-group discrimination. So, in a way, social identity theory underpins in-group bias.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the best explanation among the given options, and social identity theory isn't listed, in-group bias seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nLet me also think about stereotypes and how they relate to prejudice. Stereotypes are oversimplified beliefs about groups, and prejudice often involves stereotyping. But stereotypes are more about beliefs, while prejudice involves attitudes and feelings. In-group bias includes both preferential treatment of in-group members and negative treatment of out-group members, which aligns well with prejudice.\n\nAnother concept is discrimination, which is the behavior towards others based on prejudice. But again, prejudice is more about attitudes, and in-group bias explains why people might have negative attitudes towards out-group members.\n\nI think I've considered enough. In-group bias seems to be the social psychological principle that best explains prejudice among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
