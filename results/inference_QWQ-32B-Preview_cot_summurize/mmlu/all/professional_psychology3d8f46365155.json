                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this psychology question about instrumental responses and punishment. So, the question is: \"When subjected to moderate punishment, an instrumental response of moderate strength will...?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. be eliminated\n\nB. be strengthened\n\nC. be suppressed\n\nD. remain unchanged\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what an instrumental response is. I think it's another term for operant behavior, which means it's a behavior that operates on the environment and has consequences. So, instrumental responses are actions that have some effect on the world around us.\n\nNow, punishment is a concept in operant conditioning that is used to decrease the likelihood of a behavior occurring again. So, if someone does something and then something unpleasant happens as a result, they're less likely to do it again.\n\nThe question specifies \"moderate punishment\" and \"moderate strength\" of the response. So, it's not extreme in either case.\n\nLet me think about this. If a behavior is of moderate strength, it means it's not extremely likely or unlikely to occur. And if it's subjected to moderate punishment, it's not a super strong negative consequence, but it's still unpleasant enough to have an effect.\n\nSo, what would happen in this scenario?\n\nOption A says \"be eliminated.\" Eliminated means the behavior completely stops happening. But since it's moderate punishment and the response is of moderate strength, I don't think it would be completely eliminated. Maybe reduced, but not entirely gone.\n\nOption B says \"be strengthened.\" That seems counterintuitive. Punishment is meant to decrease behavior, not increase it. So, unless there's some strange reaction, I don't think this would happen.\n\nOption C says \"be suppressed.\" Suppressed means that the behavior is reduced or held back. That sounds plausible. Moderate punishment might suppress the instrumental response, making it less likely to occur.\n\nOption D says \"remain unchanged.\" If punishment is applied, even if it's moderate, it should have some effect on the behavior. So, I don't think it would remain completely unchanged.\n\nHmm, between C and A, suppressed versus eliminated, I think suppressed is more accurate for moderate punishment and moderate strength response. Eliminated seems too absolute.\n\nLet me consider another angle. In real life, if someone does something moderately annoying and gets a moderate reprimand, they might do it less often, but maybe not stop entirely. So, suppressed makes sense.\n\nAlso, in psychology, punishment can have varying degrees of effectiveness depending on the severity of the punishment and the strength of the behavior.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. be suppressed.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll look up a quick definition.\n\nOkay, according to my psychology textbook, punishment is a consequence that decreases the probability of a behavior recurring. It can be positive punishment, which is adding an aversive stimulus, or negative punishment, which is removing a desirable stimulus.\n\nIn this case, moderate punishment would likely lead to a reduction in the behavior, but not necessarily complete elimination, especially if the response was only of moderate strength to begin with.\n\nTherefore, suppressed seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
