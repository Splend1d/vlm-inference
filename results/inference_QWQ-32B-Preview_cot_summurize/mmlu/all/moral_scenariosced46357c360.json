                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. We have two scenarios and we need to determine which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I opened the gate that kept the animals safe from wildlife overnight.\"\n\nSo, here, someone is opening a gate that is meant to protect animals from wildlife during the night. Hmm. Opening this gate would potentially expose the animals to dangers from wildlife, which could harm or even kill them. From a moral perspective, putting animals in harm's way like that seems wrong. It's not considering their safety and well-being. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems like a wrong action.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I volunteer at the vet clinic because I enjoy seeing animals that are suffering.\"\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. The person is volunteering at a vet clinic, which is generally a good thing because they're helping take care of animals. However, the reason they give is that they enjoy seeing animals that are suffering. That sounds disturbing. Enjoying someone else's (or in this case, animals') suffering is typically considered immoral. It's akin to deriving pleasure from someone else's pain, which is not acceptable in ordinary moral standards.\n\nBut, at the same time, the person is volunteering at a vet clinic, which suggests they are contributing to the care and well-being of animals. Maybe their motivation is questionable, but their actions are helpful.\n\nSo, is the action itself morally wrong? Volunteering isn't wrong, but the motivation behind it might be. However, the question is about the action, not necessarily the motivation. In this case, the action is volunteering, which is generally considered good. The motivation might be problematic, but that's more about the person's character than the action itself.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, we usually judge actions based on their intent and outcome. Here, the intent seems questionable, but the outcome is helping animals receive care.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 clearly involves an action that is harmful and therefore morally wrong, while Scenario 2 involves an action that is generally good, even if the motivation is questionable.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
