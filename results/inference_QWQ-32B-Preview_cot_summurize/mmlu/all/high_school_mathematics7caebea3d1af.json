                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a right triangle with legs of lengths 6 and \\( b \\), and a hypotenuse of length \\( c \\). The perimeter of the triangle is 18. We need to find the value of \\( c \\).\n\nFirst, since it's a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, we have:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = 6^2 + b^2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = 36 + b^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all its sides, which is 18. So:\n\n\\[\n6 + b + c = 18\n\\]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for \\( b + c \\):\n\n\\[\nb + c = 12\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( c^2 = 36 + b^2 \\)\n\n2. \\( b + c = 12 \\)\n\nI need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \\( b \\) and \\( c \\). Let's solve the second equation for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nb = 12 - c\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( b \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = 36 + (12 - c)^2\n\\]\n\nLet's expand the right side:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = 36 + (144 - 24c + c^2)\n\\]\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = 36 + 144 - 24c + c^2\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = 180 - 24c + c^2\n\\]\n\nHmm, I see that \\( c^2 \\) appears on both sides of the equation. If I subtract \\( c^2 \\) from both sides, I get:\n\n\\[\n0 = 180 - 24c\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\n24c = 180\n\\]\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{180}{24} = 7.5\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, 7.5 isn't one of the options provided. Let's check my work to see where I might have gone wrong.\n\nStarting again with the two equations:\n\n1. \\( c^2 = 36 + b^2 \\)\n\n2. \\( b + c = 12 \\)\n\nSolving the second equation for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nb = 12 - c\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = 36 + (12 - c)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding the squared term:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = 36 + 144 - 24c + c^2\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( c^2 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0 = 180 - 24c\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\n24c = 180\n\\]\n\n\\[\nc = 7.5\n\\]\n\nBut 7.5 isn't among the options: 18, 15/2, 8, 6. Wait, 15/2 is 7.5, so maybe the answer is B. \\(\\frac{15}{2}\\).\n\nLet me verify if \\( c = 7.5 \\) makes sense in the context of the triangle.\n\nGiven \\( c = 7.5 \\), then \\( b = 12 - 7.5 = 4.5 \\).\n\nNow, check the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = 36 + b^2 \\rightarrow 7.5^2 = 36 + 4.5^2 \\rightarrow 56.25 = 36 + 20.25 \\rightarrow 56.25 = 56.25\n\\]\n\nIt checks out. Also, the perimeter is \\( 6 + 4.5 + 7.5 = 18 \\), which matches the given perimeter.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be \\( c = 7.5 \\), which is option B. \\(\\frac{15}{2}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{2}} \\]"
