Increases in capital\n\nC. Increases in the interest rate\n\nD. Expenditures on research and development\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these options means for the economy.\n\nStarting with A, spending on education and training: Generally, this is considered good for the economy because it improves the skills and knowledge of the workforce. A more skilled workforce can be more productive, innovate better, and adapt to new technologies. So, this should promote growth, not deter it.\n\nOption B, increases in capital: Capital refers to the assets used in production, like machinery, buildings, etc. More capital usually means more capacity to produce goods and services, which should also foster economic growth.\n\nOption C, increases in the interest rate: Interest rates affect borrowing costs. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for both businesses and consumers. For businesses, this could mean higher costs for loans to invest in new projects or expand operations. For consumers, higher interest rates could reduce spending on big ticket items like homes and cars. Both of these could slow down economic activity and potentially deter growth.\n\nOption D, expenditures on research and development: R&D is crucial for innovation and developing new products and technologies. This can lead to new industries, better efficiency, and overall economic growth.\n\nSo, comparing all these, options A, B, and D seem to be positive for economic growth, while option C could have a dampening effect.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Sometimes, higher interest rates are set by central banks to control inflation, which, if left unchecked, could also deter growth. So, in that context, raising interest rates might be a necessary measure to sustain long-term growth by preventing inflation from getting out of hand.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the most likely deterrent to growth, and among these options, increases in the interest rate (option C) is directly related to higher costs of borrowing, which can\u6291\u5236 investment and consumption, thereby potentially slowing down economic growth.\n\nSpending on education and training, increases in capital, and expenditures on R&D are all typically seen as investments that boost economic growth in the short, medium, and long term.\n\nTherefore, the most likely deterrent to growth among these options would be C. Increases in the interest rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
