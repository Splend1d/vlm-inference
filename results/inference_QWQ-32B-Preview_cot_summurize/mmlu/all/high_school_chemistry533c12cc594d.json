                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about potassium-40 in K2SO4. I need to figure out how many protons, neutrons, and electrons it has.\n\nFirst, I know that potassium (K) has an atomic number of 19. That means every potassium atom has 19 protons in its nucleus. So, regardless of the isotope, the number of protons is always 19 for potassium.\n\nNow, the question is about potassium-40, which is an isotope of potassium. The number 40 refers to the mass number, which is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. So, if the mass number is 40 and there are 19 protons, I can find the number of neutrons by subtracting the number of protons from the mass number.\n\nNeutrons = mass number - protons\nNeutrons = 40 - 19 = 21\n\nSo, potassium-40 has 21 neutrons.\n\nNext, I need to determine the number of electrons. Potassium is a metal and typically forms a +1 ion by losing one electron. But in this case, it's part of K2SO4, which is potassium sulfate. In K2SO4, potassium ions are K+ ions, meaning each potassium atom has lost one electron.\n\nTherefore, the number of electrons in a potassium ion in K2SO4 is:\n\nElectrons = protons - charge\nSince it's K+, the charge is +1, so:\n\nElectrons = 19 - 1 = 18\n\nWait a minute, but the question is about potassium-40 in K2SO4. Is it asking about the potassium ion or the neutral atom? In K2SO4, potassium exists as K+ ions, so it should be the ion with 18 electrons.\n\nBut let's double-check. Potassium has atomic number 19, so neutral potassium has 19 electrons. When it forms K+, it loses one electron, having 18 electrons.\n\nHowever, the options provided have different numbers of electrons:\n\nA. 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons\n\nB. 20 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons\n\nC. 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons\n\nD. 19 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons\n\nOption A has 18 electrons, which would correspond to K+, which is likely in K2SO4.\n\nOption B has 20 neutrons, which doesn't match our calculation of 21 neutrons for potassium-40.\n\nOption C has 21 neutrons and 19 protons, which is correct for potassium-40, but it says 19 electrons, which would suggest a neutral atom.\n\nOption D has 19 neutrons, which is incorrect, and 19 electrons, suggesting a neutral atom.\n\nGiven that in K2SO4, potassium exists as K+ ions with 18 electrons, option A seems correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the question is considering potassium-40 in its neutral form, not necessarily as an ion in a compound. However, since it's specified that it's part of K2SO4, it's reasonable to assume it's in the ionic form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is only about the potassium-40 atom, regardless of its chemical environment. If that's the case, then a neutral potassium-40 atom would have 19 electrons.\n\nBut the question specifies \"when it is part of K2SO4,\" which suggests it's in the ionic compound, so it should be K+ with 18 electrons.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none directly state that it's the ion. Option A has 18 electrons, which would match K+, but the question might be considering the atomic composition regardless of its ionization state.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Perhaps the question is only about the nucleus, considering protons and neutrons, and the electron count is irrelevant or assumed to be neutral.\n\nBut let's look again. The question asks for protons, neutrons, and electrons. So, it's expecting all three.\n\nGiven that, and considering potassium-40 is a radioactive isotope, but its radioactivity doesn't directly affect its electron count in a chemical compound.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial reasoning: in K2SO4, potassium is K+, with 18 electrons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\n21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons, which is option A.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other aspect I might be missing.\n\nPotassium-40 can undergo radioactive decay, but in its stable state, its electron configuration should follow that of a regular potassium atom, except when ionized.\n\nMoreover, in a compound like K2SO4, it's reasonable to assume it's in the form of K+.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
