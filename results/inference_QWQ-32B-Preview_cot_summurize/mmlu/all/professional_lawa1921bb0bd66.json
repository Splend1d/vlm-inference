                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this partnership question involving Kendall and Thornton. So, they form a partnership, and they agree that only Kendall will manage the business and make all business decisions and execute all contracts with third parties. Then, Thornton goes ahead and enters into a long-term service contract with Clark, who doesn't know about this internal agreement. The question is, is this contract enforceable or not? And why?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Enforceable, as the partners' agreement cannot withhold statutory authority of a general partner to bind the partnership.\n\nB. Enforceable, as Clark has no knowledge of Thornton's lack of authority.\n\nC. Unenforceable, as Thornton is unauthorized to execute the contract by the partner agreement.\n\nD. Unenforceable, as Clark had an obligation to confirm Thornton's authority prior to entering into a service contract with the partnership.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basics of partnerships and authority of partners.\n\nIn a general partnership, each partner has the authority to bind the partnership in the ordinary course of business. This is based on the principle of joint authority, meaning that any partner can act on behalf of the partnership unless there's a specific limitation known to the third party.\n\nHowever, in this case, Kendall and Thornton have an internal agreement that only Kendall will manage the business and make all business decisions and execute all contracts with third parties. This means that Thornton has agreed not to act on behalf of the partnership in these matters.\n\nNow, Thornton enters into a contract with Clark, who doesn't know about this internal agreement. So, Clark is unaware that Thornton is not supposed to be making contracts on behalf of the partnership.\n\nOption A says the contract is enforceable because the partners' agreement cannot withhold the statutory authority of a general partner to bind the partnership.\n\nThis seems plausible because, under partnership law, a partner's authority to bind the partnership is a statutory right, and internal agreements cannot restrict that authority against third parties who are unaware of the restrictions.\n\nOption B also says the contract is enforceable, but for a different reason: because Clark has no knowledge of Thornton's lack of authority.\n\nThis aligns with the principle of estoppel or the concept that third parties are protected if they deal in good faith without knowledge of internal restrictions.\n\nOption C says the contract is unenforceable because Thornton is unauthorized by the partner agreement.\n\nBut this seems to ignore the fact that Clark didn't know about the internal agreement, so perhaps this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption D says the contract is unenforceable because Clark had an obligation to confirm Thornton's authority.\n\nBut generally, in contract law, the burden is on the partnership to inform third parties about any limitations on a partner's authority, not on the third party to investigate.\n\nSo, based on these thoughts, it seems like options A and B are stronger.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose Kendall and Thornton have this internal agreement that only Kendall can manage the business and make contracts. But they don't inform Clark about this. So, from Clark's perspective, both Kendall and Thornton appear to be general partners with full authority.\n\nIn that case, if Thornton enters into a contract with Clark, Clark can reasonably assume that Thornton has the authority to do so, unless there's something to suggest otherwise.\n\nPartnership law often protects third parties who deal with any partner, assuming they have the authority, unless the third party has notice of any restrictions.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since Clark doesn't know about the internal agreement limiting Thornton's authority, the contract should be enforceable.\n\nNow, between options A and B, which one is better?\n\nOption A emphasizes that the partners' agreement cannot withhold the statutory authority of a general partner to bind the partnership.\n\nOption B focuses on Clark's lack of knowledge about Thornton's lack of authority.\n\nBoth are valid points, but option A seems to get more directly to the legal principle involved, which is that partnership law grants authority to partners to bind the partnership, and internal agreements can't override that against third parties who don't know about them.\n\nOption B is also correct in that Clark's lack of knowledge protects him, but it's perhaps a bit more focused on the third party's state of mind rather than the legal authority granted by statute.\n\nSo, I think option A is the best answer.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other angle.\n\nIs there a situation where the internal agreement could override the statutory authority?\n\nMaybe if Clark had some reason to know about the internal agreement, but in this case, he doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, if the internal agreement was recorded or made public, but again, Clark doesn't know about it.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in some jurisdictions, partnerships can limit a partner's authority internally, but such limitations are not effective against third parties who are unaware of them.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that the contract is enforceable despite the internal agreement between Kendall and Thornton, because Clark didn't know about the limitation on Thornton's authority.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: enforceable, as the partners' agreement cannot withhold statutory authority of a general partner to bind the partnership.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
