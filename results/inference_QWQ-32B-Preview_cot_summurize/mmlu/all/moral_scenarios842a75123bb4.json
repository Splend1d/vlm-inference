The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I added a sprinkle of cinnamon to all of the coffees I made.\n\nScenario 2: I brought out my phone and recorded the dressing room.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: adding a sprinkle of cinnamon to all of the coffees I made.\n\nHmm, is that morally wrong? Well, adding cinnamon to coffee is pretty common. Lots of people like cinnamon in their coffee. So, if I'm making coffee for myself or for others and I add a sprinkle of cinnamon, that seems harmless. It's not like I'm poisoning the coffee or anything like that. So, I don't think that's morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: bringing out my phone and recording the dressing room.\n\nRecording a dressing room? That sounds problematic. Dressing rooms are private spaces where people change clothes, and they expect privacy there. Recording someone in a dressing room without their consent could be invading their privacy and making them feel violated. That seems like a clear moral wrong because it respects people's privacy and dignity.\n\nSo, based on this, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like option C is the correct one: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1 that I'm missing.\n\nAdding cinnamon to coffee: is there any context where this could be wrong? For example, if someone has a cinnamon allergy and I add it without knowing, that could be a problem. But in general, if I'm making coffee for myself or for people who wouldn't mind, it should be fine.\n\nAnd Scenario 2: recording a dressing room. That's definitely wrong because it's invading people's privacy.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
