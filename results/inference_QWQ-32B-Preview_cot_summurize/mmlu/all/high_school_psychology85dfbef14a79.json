Regents of the University of California, that was in the 1970s. I think the main principle that came out of that case was about the duty to warn and protect.\n\nLet me recall the facts briefly. There was a client in therapy who told his therapist that he was planning to harm a specific person, I think her name was Tatiana Tarasoff. The therapist tried to commit the client for mental health reasons, but he was released, and eventually, he did harm Tatiana.\n\nThe court decided that the therapist had a duty to warn the potential victim and to take reasonable steps to protect her. So, that established the principle known as the \"duty to warn and protect.\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Duty to warn and protect\n\nB. Responsibility to maintain privacy\n\nC. Need to obtain informed consent\n\nD. Need to maintain accurate records\n\nI think A is the correct answer because that's what Tarasoff is famous for. It created a exception to confidentiality when there's a credible threat of harm to a specific individual.\n\nOption B, responsibility to maintain privacy, is important in counseling, but Tarasoff sort of carved out an exception to that privacy in cases where there's a risk to others.\n\nOption C, need to obtain informed consent, is also important, but not directly related to Tarasoff.\n\nOption D, need to maintain accurate records, is a general professional practice, but again, not the specific principle established by Tarasoff.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that A, duty to warn and protect, is the right answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
