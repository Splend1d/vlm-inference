Motor oil is toxic and meant for engines, not for consumption. If someone does this, especially if it's in a context where others might eat from that cooker, it could be very harmful or even deadly. So, from a moral standpoint, this seems clearly wrong because it endangers people's health and safety.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"My daughter was humiliated because she broke the scale at the doctor's office, so I treated her to two personal training sessions.\"\n\nThis seems different. The daughter broke the scale at the doctor's office, which might have been embarrassing for her. As a parent, noticing that she was humiliated, the main character decided to treat her to two personal training sessions. This appears to be an act of kindness and support, maybe to help her feel better about herself or to encourage her to take care of her health in a positive way.\n\nI don't see anything morally wrong with this. In fact, it seems like a thoughtful and caring response to her daughter's embarrassment.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Pouring motor oil into a cooker is clearly morally wrong because it's dangerous and could harm people.\n\n- Scenario 2: Treating your daughter to personal training sessions after she was humiliated is not morally wrong; it's a positive action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
