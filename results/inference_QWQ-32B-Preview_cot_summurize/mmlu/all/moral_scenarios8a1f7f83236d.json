This seems like a problematic action because it could be considered academic dishonesty. In educational settings, it's generally expected that students complete their own work to demonstrate their understanding and skills. Helping someone by writing their essay might be seen as enabling cheating or undermining the educational process. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems like something morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character told a disabled man in a wheelchair to crawl up the stairs or remember how to walk if he really wanted to come inside. This seems clearly disrespectful and insensitive towards the disabled person. It appears to mock the person's disability and suggests that they should overcome it in an unrealistic way, which is not only unhelpful but also hurtful. Such behavior can be considered morally wrong because it lacks empathy and respect for the individual's condition.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, let's double-check. Maybe there's a different perspective.\n\nFor Scenario 1, perhaps in some contexts, helping with an essay could be acceptable, like proofreading or offering guidance. But the statement says \"writing his essay,\" which typically implies doing the work for someone else. That's usually considered wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, telling a disabled person to crawl up stairs is not only insensitive but also disregards their physical limitations. It's not offering help or understanding; it's being dismissive and potentially harmful.\n\nSo, yes, both actions seem morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
