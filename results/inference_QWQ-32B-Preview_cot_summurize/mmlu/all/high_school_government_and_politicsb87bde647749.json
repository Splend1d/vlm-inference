So, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is \"Grant reprieves and pardons.\" I think I've heard that the president has the power to pardon people or give them reprieves, which means postponing punishment or something like that. I'm not entirely sure, but I think this is something the president can do on their own, without asking Congress.\n\nOption B is \"Appoint Supreme Court justices.\" Hmm, appointing Supreme Court justices\u2014that seems important. I think the president can nominate someone for the Supreme Court, but I believe Congress has to approve it through confirmation hearings. So, probably, the president can't just appoint someone without Congress saying it's okay.\n\nOption C is \"Negotiate and ratify treaties.\" Negotiating treaties, that's when the president talks to other countries and makes agreements. But I think ratifying treaties requires Congress to approve them. So, maybe the president can negotiate, but not ratify without Congress.\n\nOption D is \"Declare war.\" I know that declaring war is a big deal. From what I remember, only Congress has the power to declare war. The president can ask for it, but it's Congress that actually declares it.\n\nSo, looking back, option A seems like the one where the president can act without Congress. Let me make sure. Pardons and reprieves\u2014are there any limits to that? I think the president can pardon people for federal crimes, but maybe not for state crimes. And there might be some exceptions or something, but generally, it's within the president's power to grant pardons without Congress's approval.\n\nOption B, appointing Supreme Court justices, definitely requires congressional approval. They have to confirm the nominee. So, that's not the right answer.\n\nOption C, negotiating and ratifying treaties. The president can negotiate treaties, but ratification requires the Senate's consent. So, again, that needs congressional approval.\n\nOption D, declaring war, is something that Congress has the authority to do, not the president. The president is the commander-in-chief, but declaring war is Congress's role.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: Grant reprieves and pardons. That's something the president can do without needing Congress's approval.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
