                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out what would happen in this ejectment action brought by the resident against the state. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's this resident who owns a large tract of virgin forest and conveys it \"to the people of the state in fee simple, provided that if any portion of said tract shall ever be used or developed for any commercial purpose or otherwise converted from its natural state (with exception for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes), then the grantor or his successors in interest may reenter as of the grantor's former estate.\"\n\nOkay, so this is a conveyance to \"the people of the state,\" and under state law, such conveyances vest title in the state as a legal entity, with custody over the property residing in the director of environmental resources.\n\nThen, the director grants a logging company the privilege to cut timber on a remote portion of the tract, along with incidental easements of way. This section is to be used for developing a state recreational area. The logging company clears the timber and sells it for $10,000.\n\nWhen the resident learns about this, he notifies the director to stop further exploitation and files an ejectment action to recover the tract.\n\nNow, I need to decide which of the four options is correct:\n\nA. The resident would succeed because the logging company's selling of the timber would entitle the resident to re-enter and terminate the grant to the state.\n\nB. The resident would succeed because the logging company's selling of the timber would constitute an automatic termination of the state's fee interest.\n\nC. The resident would not succeed because the director approved the clearing of the timber in order to develop the area for recreational purposes.\n\nD. The resident would not succeed because the reservation of the resident's right to terminate would be violative of the rule against perpetuities.\n\nAlright, let's analyze this.\n\nFirst, the conveyance is to the state in fee simple, but with a condition: if any portion is used for commercial purposes or converted from its natural state (except for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes), the grantor can re-enter.\n\nSo, the state has the fee simple, but there's a condition subsequent attached. If the condition is breached, the grantor has the right to re-enter.\n\nNow, the director, who has custody over the property, grants a logging company the right to cut timber and sell it, and this is for developing a recreational area.\n\nSo, is cutting and selling timber a commercial purpose? Selling the timber for $10,000 seems like a commercial activity. However, it's for developing a recreational area, which is excepted in the condition.\n\nSo, maybe the recreational purpose exception applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sale is just a means to finance the recreational development.\n\nBut the resident argues that this is a breach of the condition and wants to terminate the grant.\n\nIn option A, it says the resident would succeed because the selling of timber entitles re-entry and termination. Option B says it constitutes automatic termination.\n\nOption C says the resident wouldn't succeed because it's for recreational development. Option D says the termination right is invalid due to the rule against perpetuities.\n\nI need to think about the condition and whether the logging and sale constitute a commercial use that violates the condition.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if the exception for recreational purposes covers this activity.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if the right of re-entry is enforceable or if it's restricted by some rule, like the rule against perpetuities.\n\nLet me first look at the condition: \"provided that if any portion of said tract shall ever be used or developed for any commercial purpose or otherwise converted from its natural state (with exception for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes)...\"\n\nSo, the primary prohibition is against commercial use or conversion from natural state, except for certain purposes.\n\nNow, the director approved clearing timber for recreational development. Is clearing timber and selling it a commercial purpose?\n\nWell, selling the timber is certainly a commercial activity, but it's done to fund the recreational development.\n\nIs the sale itself a commercial purpose, or is it incidental to the recreational development?\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Perhaps the court would look at the primary purpose of the activity.\n\nIf the primary purpose is to develop a recreational area, and selling the timber is just a means to finance that development, maybe it doesn't violate the condition.\n\nOn the other hand, if the primary purpose is to sell the timber for profit, that would be a commercial purpose.\n\nIn this case, it seems like the primary purpose is to develop the recreational area, and selling the timber is a way to offset costs.\n\nSo, perhaps it doesn't violate the condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is breached because selling the timber is a commercial activity, regardless of the purpose.\n\nBut the exception for recreational purposes might cover this.\n\nI need to consider the intent of the condition. It seems like the grantor wants to preserve the natural state of the tract, except for certain allowed uses like recreation.\n\nIf the state is developing a recreational area, which is excepted, perhaps the condition isn't breached.\n\nMoreover, the director, who has custody over such properties, approved the activity. So, perhaps the state is acting within its rights.\n\nNow, regarding the right of re-entry: if the condition is breached, the grantor can re-enter.\n\nBut if the condition isn't breached, then there's no right to re-enter.\n\nSo, if the recreational exception applies, then the condition isn't breached, and the resident can't re-enter.\n\nAlternatively, if the sale of timber is considered a commercial purpose outside the recreational exception, then the condition is breached, and the resident can re-enter.\n\nI also need to consider the rule against perpetuities, which might render the condition unenforceable if it's too indefinite.\n\nBut I'll address that later.\n\nLet me consider the nature of the activity.\n\nDeveloping a recreational area might require some alterations to the natural state, including clearing timber.\n\nIf the primary purpose is recreational development, and the sale of timber is incidental, perhaps it doesn't violate the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps selling the timber is a separate commercial activity that isn't covered by the recreational exception.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look at it differently.\n\nIs the use or development of the tract for commercial purposes?\n\nHere, the tract is being developed for recreational purposes, which is excepted.\n\nBut the sale of timber is a separate commercial activity.\n\nIs the sale of timber a use or development of the tract for commercial purposes?\n\nPerhaps it is, because it's exploiting the resources of the tract for profit.\n\nOn the other hand, if the profit is being used for the recreational development, maybe it's justified.\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sale of timber is a conversion from the natural state for commercial purposes, which violates the condition.\n\nBut the exception is for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.\n\nIs there any overlap here?\n\nMaybe the key is to determine whether the sale of timber is for a commercial purpose or for the recreational development.\n\nIf it's for the recreational development, perhaps it's allowed.\n\nBut selling the timber seems like a commercial activity.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nPerhaps option C is correct: the resident would not succeed because the director approved the clearing of the timber for recreational development.\n\nAlternatively, option A might be correct if the sale of timber is considered a commercial purpose that violates the condition, thus entitling the resident to re-enter.\n\nOption B says it constitutes automatic termination, but in the scenario, the right is to re-enter, not automatic termination.\n\nOption D suggests the termination right is invalid due to the rule against perpetuities, but I need to consider if that applies here.\n\nThe rule against perpetuities invalidates interests that are uncertain to vest within a certain period.\n\nHere, the condition is attached to the grant, and the right of re-entry is contingent on the condition being breached.\n\nIs this violative of the rule against perpetuities?\n\nProbably not, as the condition is reasonably certain and isn't indefinite.\n\nSo, option D is less likely.\n\nGoing back, between options A and C, I need to decide whether the sale of timber violates the condition.\n\nIf it does, then the resident can re-enter, and option A is correct.\n\nIf it doesn't, then option C is correct.\n\nConsidering that the primary purpose is recreational development, and the sale of timber is incidental to fund that development, perhaps it doesn't violate the condition.\n\nTherefore, option C would be the correct answer: the resident would not succeed because the director approved the clearing of the timber for recreational development.\n\nAlternatively, if the court views the sale of timber as a commercial purpose separate from the recreational development, then option A would be correct.\n\nI think the better argument is that the recreational exception covers the activity, especially since the director approved it for recreational development.\n\nTherefore, the resident wouldn't succeed in the ejectment action.\n\nSo, option C seems most appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
