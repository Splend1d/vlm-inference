The options are:\n\nA. Does not support self-efficacy for change\n\nB. Empathy through reflective listening\n\nC. Roll with resistance\n\nD. Avoid direct confrontation\n\nFirst, I need to recall what motivational interviewing is all about. I remember it's a client-centered counseling style used to help people resolve ambivalence and make changes in their behavior. It was developed by William R. Miller and Stephen Rollnick. The main goal is to enhance intrinsic motivation and commitment to change.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Does not support self-efficacy for change\n\nI think self-efficacy is important in motivational interviewing because it's about believing in one's ability to change. So, if something doesn't support self-efficacy, that might not be aligned with motivational interviewing principles.\n\nB. Empathy through reflective listening\n\nThis sounds like a key component. Reflective listening is a way to show understanding and empathy, which are crucial in building a therapeutic relationship and helping the client feel heard and valued.\n\nC. Roll with resistance\n\nI recall that in motivational interviewing, the approach is to avoid arguing or confronting the client's resistance directly. Instead, the therapist should accept the client's feelings and opinions, even if they differ from their own. This is often referred to as \"rolling with resistance.\"\n\nD. Avoid direct confrontation\n\nThis seems similar to \"roll with resistance.\" In motivational interviewing, direct confrontation is generally avoided because it can raise defensiveness and undermine the therapeutic relationship.\n\nSo, considering these points, the principle that is not used in motivational interviewing would be option A: Does not support self-efficacy for change. Because motivational interviewing actually aims to support and enhance self-efficacy for change, not undermine it.\n\nTo confirm, I can think about the core principles of motivational interviewing:\n\n1. Express empathy: Which aligns with option B.\n\n2. Develop discrepancy: Helping the client see the difference between their current behavior and their goals or values.\n\n3. Avoid argumentation: Aligns with option D.\n\n4. Roll with resistance: Aligns with option C.\n\n5. Support self-efficacy: This is indeed a key principle, so option A would be contrary to this principle.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Does not support self-efficacy for change.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
