                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this law problem. It's about adverse possession, and there's a woman who owns a farm and a man who took possession of it. The statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years, and the woman is trying to eject the man after 2010.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what adverse possession is. Adverse possession is when someone occupies someone else's land without permission and meets certain legal requirements, which can eventually allow them to claim legal title to the property.\n\nThe key elements of adverse possession usually include:\n\n1. Open and notorious possession: The possessor must use the property in a way that is visible and obvious, so the owner should know or should have known about the possession.\n\n2. Hostile possession: The possessor must occupy the land without the owner's permission.\n\n3. Continuous possession for the statutory period: The possessor must have possessed the land continuously for the entire required period, which in this case is 20 years.\n\nNow, let's look at the timeline:\n\n- Woman owns the farm in fee simple.\n\n- She left the farm in 1986 to move to the city.\n\n- Man took possession in 1987 and stayed until 1997.\n\n- In 1997, he left to care for his sick mother for one year (1997-1998).\n\n- In 1998, he returned and continued possession until 2010.\n\n- During his absence in 1997-1998, his nephew agreed to live on the farm and take care of it.\n\n- In 2010, the woman brings an ejectment action.\n\nSo, the total time from 1987 to 2010 is 23 years. But there's a break in possession from 1997 to 1998 when the man was away.\n\nI need to consider whether this break in possession affects the continuity required for adverse possession.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, a temporary absence doesn't necessarily break the continuity if the possessor intends to return and actually does return within a reasonable time.\n\nAlso, the fact that the man's nephew was on the property during his absence might be relevant. If there's privity between the man and his nephew, meaning they have a close relationship or legal connection, perhaps the nephew's possession can be attributed to the uncle.\n\nOption D mentions privity between the man and his nephew, which might help in fulfilling the statutory period.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. The woman was the rightful owner and thus entitled to possess the farm.\n\nThis could be correct if the man didn't meet the requirements for adverse possession, especially if the break in possession was too long to maintain continuity.\n\nB. The woman was entitled to possession because the man's intermittent possession was insufficient to make him an adverse possessor.\n\nThis seems similar to option A, focusing on the continuity of possession.\n\nC. The man was entitled to possession because his possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile as required for the statutory period.\n\nThis would be correct if the man's possession met all the requirements, including continuity despite the one-year absence.\n\nD. The man was entitled to possession because of the privity between the man and his nephew, which aided him in fulfilling the required statutory period.\n\nThis option suggests that the nephew's possession can be tacked onto the uncle's possession, perhaps allowing the uncle to count the time the nephew was on the property as part of his own possession.\n\nI need to think about how the one-year absence affects the continuity.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, temporary absences don't break the continuity if the possessor intends to return and does return within a reasonable time. Since the man returned the following year, it might be considered a temporary absence.\n\nAdditionally, having his nephew occupy the property during his absence might show that he still had an interest in the property and intended to maintain possession.\n\nOption D mentions privity, which could mean that the nephew's possession is attributed to the uncle, allowing the uncle to continue accumulating time toward the statutory period.\n\nI need to consider whether the nephew's possession can be counted as part of the uncle's possession.\n\nIf the nephew was occupying the property with the uncle's permission and as his representative, perhaps the time the nephew was there can be added to the uncle's possession time.\n\nAlternatively, if the nephew was occupying the property adversely himself, it might be a different situation.\n\nBut in this case, the nephew agreed to live on the farm and take care of it during the uncle's absence, suggesting that he was acting on behalf of the uncle.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that the nephew's possession can be considered as part of the uncle's possession.\n\nIf that's the case, then the uncle's possession was continuous from 1987 to 2010, totaling 23 years, which exceeds the 20-year statutory period.\n\nTherefore, the man might be entitled to possession.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether the one-year absence breaks the continuity, even if the nephew was on the property.\n\nSome jurisdictions require possession to be continuous without any breaks, while others allow for minor interruptions.\n\nGiven that the man was absent for only one year and returned the following year, and had his nephew occupying the property in his absence, it's possible that the continuity was not broken.\n\nTherefore, option C might be correct.\n\nOption D also seems plausible because of the privity between the uncle and nephew.\n\nBut I need to decide which one the court would most likely hold.\n\nPerhaps both C and D are correct, but I have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court would consider that the one-year absence breaks the continuity, in which case options A and B would be more likely.\n\nBut considering that the nephew was on the property during that time, perhaps the court would view the possession as continuous.\n\nI think the answer is D: the man was entitled to possession because of the privity between the man and his nephew, which aided him in fulfilling the required statutory period.\n\nThis option acknowledges that the nephew's possession can be attributed to the uncle, maintaining the continuity required for adverse possession.\n\nTherefore, the man would be entitled to possession.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
