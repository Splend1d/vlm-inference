                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, the client has an estate that says, \"To A on condition that if drugs are ever used on the premises, B shall have the right to reenter and retake the premises.\" We need to figure out which statement is NOT true about this kind of estate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what kind of estate this is. It sounds like it's a type of conditional estate, where there are conditions attached to the ownership. In property law, there are two main types of conditional estates: fee simple determinable and fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nA fee simple determinable is an estate that automatically terminates when a specified condition is breached. The title reverts back to the grantor without any action needed from them.\n\nOn the other hand, a fee simple subject to condition subsequent is an estate where the grantor has the right to reclaim the property upon breach of a condition, but it doesn't happen automatically. The grantor must take some action, like initiating a legal proceeding, to reclaim the property.\n\nIn this case, the estate says that \"if drugs are ever used on the premises, B shall have the right to reenter and retake the premises.\" This sounds like B has the right to reclaim the property upon breach of the condition, but it requires B to take action. So, this seems like a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. It is a fee simple determinable, and title ends automatically if drugs are used.\n\nB. It is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, which requires a reentry first before title can end.\n\nC. Estate does not revert automatically.\n\nD. Grantor must exercise right of reentry.\n\nFirst, option A says it's a fee simple determinable with automatic termination. But based on the description, it seems more like a condition subsequent where B has to take action. So, this might not be true.\n\nOption B says it's a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, which requires reentry first before title can end. This aligns with my understanding, so this seems true.\n\nOption C says the estate does not revert automatically. Again, since it's a condition subsequent, the estate doesn't revert automatically; action is required. So, this seems true.\n\nOption D says the grantor must exercise the right of reentry. In this case, B is the grantor or the party with the right to reenter. So, yes, B must exercise that right to reclaim the property.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true is option A, because it incorrectly identifies the estate as a fee simple determinable with automatic termination, whereas it's actually a fee simple subject to condition subsequent requiring action by B.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should think about the differences again. In a fee simple determinable, the estate automatically ends when the condition is breached, and the title reverts to the grantor without any action needed. In a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the grantor has the right to reclaim the property upon breach, but must take action to do so.\n\nIn this scenario, the language says \"B shall have the right to reenter and retake the premises,\" which indicates that B needs to take action to reclaim the property, suggesting it's a condition subsequent.\n\nAlso, option C says the estate does not revert automatically, which matches with a condition subsequent.\n\nOption D says the grantor must exercise the right of reentry, which again fits with a condition subsequent.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is option A, as it mischaracterizes the estate as a fee simple determinable with automatic termination.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]\n\n"
