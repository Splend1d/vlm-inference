The scenarios are:\n\n1. I picked up my trash after the picnic in the park.\n\n2. I kept a lot of comics in my bedroom.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: picking up my trash after a picnic in the park. Generally, in the US, it's considered responsible and polite to clean up after yourself, especially in public spaces. In fact, leaving trash behind is often seen as littering, which is against the law in many places and is generally considered disrespectful to the community and the environment. So, picking up your trash is actually the right thing to do. It shows consideration for others and the environment.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: keeping a lot of comics in my bedroom. This seems like a personal choice. Assuming it's your own bedroom and you're not harming anyone else, having a collection of comics is pretty normal. Many people have hobbies and collections, and comics are a common interest. As long as you're not stealing them or bothering others, there's nothing wrong with keeping comics in your bedroom.\n\nSo, based on this, neither of these scenarios involves something morally wrong. Picking up trash is actually good, and keeping comics is a personal preference that doesn't harm anyone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if picking up your own trash is the expected behavior, then not doing it would be wrong, but since you did pick it up, it's not wrong. In Scenario 2, keeping comics is neutral or positive; there's no moral issue here.\n\nYes, I think D is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
