It's about identifying which act wasn't designed to regulate the wealth and power of industrialists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The options are:\n\nA. Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890)\n\nB. Interstate Commerce Act (1887)\n\nC. Federal Trade Commission Act (1914)\n\nD. Newlands Reclamation Act (1902)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these acts was about and whether they were aimed at regulating industrialists' power and wealth.\n\nStarting with A, the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890. I know that this act was one of the first federal steps to limit monopolistic practices. It outlawed monopolistic business practices and trusts that restrained trade. So, this was definitely aimed at regulating the power of big businesses and industrialists who were forming trusts to control markets.\n\nNext, B, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. This act established the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which was the first federal regulatory agency. It was primarily aimed at regulating railroads, setting maximum rates, and ensuring fair practices. Since railroads were a major industry at the time, controlled by powerful industrialists, this act was also aimed at regulating their practices and preventing abuses of their power.\n\nOption C, the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. This act created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is responsible for preventing anti-competitive business practices and protecting consumers. It's another regulatory measure aimed at controlling the power of large corporations and promoting fair competition.\n\nNow, D, the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902. This one sounds different from the others. I think this act was about federal irrigation projects to promote settlement in the western United States. It provided for the reclamation of arid lands through irrigation projects funded by the sale of public lands. I don't recall it being directly related to regulating industrialists' power or wealth.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, A, B, and C are all acts that were designed to regulate and control the practices of large businesses and industrialists, preventing monopolies and ensuring fair competition. On the other hand, the Newlands Reclamation Act seems to be more about public land management and development, rather than regulating industrialists.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Newlands Reclamation Act (1902), as it was not designed to empower the government to regulate the increasing wealth and power of industrialists in that period.\n\nTo double-check, let's think about the context. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was growing concern about the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few industrialists and trusts. This led to the passage of various regulatory measures like the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, and later the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Newlands Reclamation Act, while also a product of this era, had a different focus related to public land development and settlement.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
