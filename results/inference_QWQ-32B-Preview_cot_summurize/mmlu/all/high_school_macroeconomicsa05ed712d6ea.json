According to this view, the Federal Reserve (the FED) should aim for a steady and predictable growth rate in the money supply, rather than engaging in active monetary policy to manage economic fluctuations.\n\nOption A suggests that the FED should actively conduct monetary policy, which contradicts the monetarist preference for a rule-based approach with a constant money supply growth rate.\n\nOption B states that changes in the money supply do not have significant effects, which directly opposes the monetarist belief in the importance of the money supply in influencing the economy.\n\nOption C proposes that fiscal policy is the preferred method for shifting the aggregate demand curve. However, monetarists generally favor monetary policy over fiscal policy, arguing that monetary policy is more effective and less subject to political influences.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: the FED should allow the money supply to grow at a constant rate. This aligns with the monetarist principle of a steady monetary growth rule to maintain price stability and promote economic growth."
