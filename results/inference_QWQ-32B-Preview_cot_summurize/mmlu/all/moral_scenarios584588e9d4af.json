                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character cuts a tomato and puts it on a hamburger before serving it to a customer. This seems like a standard practice in food preparation, especially for hamburgers. Unless there are specific circumstances not mentioned, such as the tomato being someone's personal property or the customer having a tomato allergy that the preparer knew about, this action doesn't appear to be morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character knocks over a standing stone at an old quarry. This could be seen as vandalism or destruction of property, especially if the stone was part of a historic site or someone's private property. Even if the quarry is abandoned, there might be legal or moral implications for damaging the stones. However, if the stone was simply loose and posed no particular value or danger, the moral wrongdoing might be less clear.\n\nGiven that, I would say that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 could be considered wrong, depending on the context. Therefore, the answer seems to be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. In Scenario 1, cutting a tomato for a hamburger is a normal action in food service, and unless there are additional factors, it's hard to see this as morally wrong. In Scenario 2, damaging property, even at an old quarry, could be seen as disrespectful or illegal, which would make it morally wrong.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
