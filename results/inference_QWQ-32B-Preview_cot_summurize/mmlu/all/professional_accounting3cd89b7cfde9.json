                    "text": "So I've got this question here about investments and discount rates, and I need to find the value of the investment. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, there's an investment that generates income growing at 5% per year forever. That sounds like a perpetuity with growing payments. The market discount rate is 15%, and the next payout is $10. I need to find the value of this investment.\n\nI recall that for a growing perpetuity, the formula to find its present value is:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{C}{r - g} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( PV \\) is the present value of the investment.\n\n- \\( C \\) is the amount of the next payment.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the discount rate.\n\n- \\( g \\) is the growth rate of the payments.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- \\( C = \\$10 \\)\n\n- \\( r = 15\\% = 0.15 \\)\n\n- \\( g = 5\\% = 0.05 \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10}{0.15 - 0.05} = \\frac{10}{0.10} = \\$100 \\]\n\nSo, the value of the investment should be \\$100.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\$1\n\nB. \\$500\n\nC. \\$100\n\nD. \\$200\n\nOption C, \\$100, matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The formula for a growing perpetuity is indeed \\( PV = \\frac{C}{r - g} \\), and the values seem correctly plugged in. The discount rate is higher than the growth rate, which is a requirement for this formula to work, since \\( r > g \\) ensures that the denominator is positive and the series converges.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each future payment is growing by 5% annually, but discounted back at 15% annually. So the present value should be the next payment divided by the difference between the discount rate and the growth rate.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. The question says the \"next payout is \\$10,\" which should be the first cash flow, \\( C \\), in the formula. And the growth is 5% perpetually, with a 15% discount rate.\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, I think the correct answer is \\$100, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nThis type of problem involves the concept of a growing perpetuity, where cash flows grow at a constant rate forever. The formula to calculate the present value of a growing perpetuity is:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{C}{r - g} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( PV \\) is the present value.\n\n- \\( C \\) is the amount of the next payment.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the discount rate.\n\n- \\( g \\) is the constant growth rate of the payments.\n\nIn this scenario, with \\( C = \\$10 \\), \\( r = 15\\% \\), and \\( g = 5\\% \\), plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10}{0.15 - 0.05} = \\frac{10}{0.10} = \\$100 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the investment is \\$100."
