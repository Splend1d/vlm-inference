Let's break it down.\n\nFirst off, what is multifactor authentication? It's a security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity for a login or other transaction. Basically, it's like having multiple layers of security to make sure it's really you trying to access something.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Each employee for a company is issued a USB device that contains a unique token code. To log into a company computer, an employee must insert the USB device into the computer and provide a correct password.\n\nB. After logging into an account from a new device, a user must enter a code that is sent via email to the email address on file with the account.\n\nC. In order to log into an account, a user must provide both a password and a fingerprint that is captured using the user\u2019s device.\n\nD. When a user enters an incorrect password more than two times in a row, the user is locked out of the account for 24 hours.\n\nSo, I need to identify which one of these isn't multifactor authentication.\n\nLet's look at option A. Here, the employee needs to insert a USB device with a unique token code and also provide a correct password. So, that's two factors: something you have (the USB device) and something you know (the password). That sounds like multifactor authentication.\n\nOption B: After logging in from a new device, the user must enter a code sent to their email. This is like a secondary verification step. So, initially, they probably entered a password, and then they need to enter this code from their email. That's something you know (password) and something you have (access to the email account), which is also multifactor authentication.\n\nOption C: Here, the user needs to provide both a password and a fingerprint. That's something you know (password) and something you are (fingerprint). Again, that's multifactor authentication.\n\nNow, option D: When a user enters an incorrect password more than two times in a row, the user is locked out for 24 hours. This is more about account lockout as a security measure to prevent brute-force attacks, not about multifactor authentication. Multifactor is about requiring multiple forms of identification, not about locking the account after failed attempts.\n\nSo, it seems like option D is not an example of multifactor authentication.\n\nTo double-check, let's make sure I understand each option correctly.\n\nOption A: USB device (something you have) + password (something you know) = multifactor.\n\nOption B: Password (something you know) + email code (something you have) = multifactor.\n\nOption C: Password (something you know) + fingerprint (something you are) = multifactor.\n\nOption D: Account lockout after multiple failed password attempts = not multifactor.\n\nYes, option D is about preventing unauthorized access through lockout, not about requiring multiple forms of authentication.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
