                    "text": "So I've got this question here about an electrically neutral iron atom. It says the nucleus contains 26 protons, and I need to figure out how many electrons the iron atom has. The options are 52, 26, 24, or none.\n\nFirst off, I know that in an atom, the protons are positively charged and located in the nucleus, while the electrons are negatively charged and orbit the nucleus. For an atom to be electrically neutral, the number of positive charges (protons) should balance out the number of negative charges (electrons). So, the number of electrons should equal the number of protons.\n\nGiven that the nucleus has 26 protons, that means there should be 26 electrons to make the atom electrically neutral. So, option B seems like the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, I recall that the atomic number of an element corresponds to the number of protons in its nucleus, which also determines the number of electrons in a neutral atom. Iron is element number 26 on the periodic table, so it has 26 protons and, in its neutral state, 26 electrons.\n\nOption A is 52, which is twice the number of protons. Maybe that's trying to trick me into thinking about the atomic mass or something, but no, for neutrality, it's just about equal numbers of protons and electrons.\n\nOption C is 24, which is less than the number of protons, so that would make the atom have a net positive charge, but the question specifies that it's electrically neutral.\n\nOption D is \"none,\" which would make the atom have a complete positive charge equal to 26 times the proton charge, which doesn't make sense for a neutral atom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B, 26 electrons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
