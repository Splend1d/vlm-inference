The university contacted a coach who had a strong reputation as a person who cottld \"turn around\" a program and produce winning teams. The university offered the coach an annual salary of $250,000 to coach its basketball team, but the coach declined the offer, hoping to find another institution that would pay him a higher salary. Thereafter, a wealthy booster, who was interested in enhancing the university's basketball program, contacted the coach and told him that if he would sign a coaching contract with the university, the booster would pay him $50,000 a year as an unpublished supplement to his salary. Furthermore, the booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university athletic fund every time the basketball team won a game under the coach's tutelage. The coach thereupon signed a three-year contract as the head basketball coach at the university at an annual salary of $250,000. During the coach's first year as coach, the university basketball team compiled a record of 18 wins and 12 losses. The booster, however, refused to pay anything to either the coach or the university athletic fund. Assume that the agreement between the coach and the booster does not violate any rule of the university or of any intercollegiate athletic association. The university brought suit against the booster to recover $90,000 for breach of his promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. Is it likely that the university will prevail in this contract action?\n\nA. Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.\nB. Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.\nC. No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy.\nD. No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, we have a university that hired a new head basketball coach after some losing seasons. They offered him $250,000 a year, but he initially declined, hoping for a higher salary from another institution. Then, a wealthy booster steps in, promising to pay the coach an extra $50,000 a year and contribute $5,000 to the university's athletic fund for every game the team wins under the coach's leadership. Based on this, the coach agrees to sign a three-year contract with the university.\n\nIn the first year, the team wins 18 games, so according to the booster's promise, he should contribute $5,000 for each win, totaling $90,000 to the athletic fund. However, the booster refuses to pay. The university sues the booster to recover this $90,000, claiming breach of his promise.\n\nNow, the question is whether the university is likely to prevail in this contract action. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.\n\nB. Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.\n\nC. No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy.\n\nD. No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: Is the university an intended third-party beneficiary?\n\nIn contract law, a third-party beneficiary is someone who, although not a party to the contract, is intended to receive a benefit from it. For the university to be an intended beneficiary, the booster must have intended to benefit the university when making the promise to the coach.\n\nHere, the booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university's athletic fund for each win. This suggests that the booster did intend to benefit the university directly, not just the coach. So, it seems plausible that the university is an intended third-party beneficiary.\n\nHowever, we need to consider whether the coach and the booster intended for the university to have the right to enforce the promise. Sometimes, a beneficiary is intended to receive a benefit, but the parties do not intend to give the beneficiary the right to sue if the promise isn't kept.\n\nIn this case, the booster's promise was directly to the coach, and the benefit to the university was conditional on the team's performance. It might be arguable whether the university was intended to have the right to enforce the promise.\n\nMoving on to option B: Did the university detrimentally rely on the booster's promise by hiring the coach?\n\nThe university hired the coach after the booster's intervention, but the booster's promise was made to the coach, not directly to the university. The university's decision to hire the coach might have been influenced by the booster's support, but legally, detrimental reliance typically requires that the party relying on the promise suffers a detriment based on that reliance.\n\nIn this scenario, the university is seeking to enforce the booster's promise to the athletic fund, not a promise made directly to them. So, it's unclear whether the university can claim detrimental reliance in this context.\n\nOption C suggests that the booster's promise is void as against public policy.\n\nThis would require that the promise is illegal or against some public interest. The scenario mentions that the agreement does not violate any university or intercollegiate athletic association rules. Therefore, it's unlikely that the promise is void as against public policy.\n\nOption D states that the booster's promise was made to the coach, not to the university, and therefore was not a charitable subscription.\n\nThis seems accurate. The booster made a promise to the coach, conditioning payments on the team's performance. The contribution to the athletic fund was contingent on the team's wins, which were under the coach's leadership. So, the promise was essentially to the coach, with a conditional benefit to the university.\n\nIn contract law, a promise to make a gift or contribution to a charity is generally not enforceable unless there is consideration or it fits into a specific exception, like a charitable subscription.\n\nA charitable subscription is a promise to make a contribution to a charity, often in exchange for certain benefits or as part of a campaign. However, in this case, the promise is conditional on the team's performance, which complicates things.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that the university may not have a strong claim to enforce the booster's promise. The promise was made to the coach, and while the university may have been an intended beneficiary, it's not clear that they have the right to enforce the promise.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely D: No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.\n\nThis aligns with the principles of third-party beneficiaries and the enforceability of promises in contract law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
