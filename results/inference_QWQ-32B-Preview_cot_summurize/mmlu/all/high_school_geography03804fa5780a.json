So, I need to think about which of these options best describes the situation in Quebec.\n\nFirst, irredentism is when a country claims that another territory should belong to it because of shared ethnicity or history. I'm not sure if Quebec is claiming any other territories, so maybe that's not it.\n\nSecession is when a group tries to withdraw from a larger political entity to form their own independent state. Hmm, Quebec has had referendums about separating from Canada, so that seems relevant.\n\nEthnonationalism is about a group seeking political power or independence based on shared ethnicity or culture. Quebec has a strong French-speaking identity, which is different from the rest of English-dominated Canada, so this also seems applicable.\n\nBeing a colony would mean that Quebec is under the political control of another country. But Quebec is a province within Canada, so that doesn't seem right.\n\nSo, between secession and ethnonationalism, which one is stronger? Quebec's push for independence is largely based on its distinct culture and language, which are French, as opposed to English in the rest of Canada. So, there's definitely an ethnonationalist aspect to it.\n\nBut at the same time, the referendums were specifically about seceding from Canada to become an independent country. So, secession seems like a direct action towards independence.\n\nMaybe both are relevant, but if I have to choose one, perhaps secession is the most straightforward description of the situation.\n\nWait, but ethnonationalism is a driving force behind the secessionist movement. So, perhaps ethnonationalism is the underlying situation, and secession is one possible outcome.\n\nBut the question is asking for the situation that Quebec is a strong example of. If it's about the current status or the ongoing issue, then maybe secession is the most accurate, since it's about the attempt to leave Canada.\n\nOn the other hand, ethnonationalism might be more about the identity and cultural aspects, which are certainly present in Quebec, but the question might be focusing on the political aspect.\n\nI think secession best captures the political struggle Quebec has been through, with the referendums and the debate about independence.\n\nSo, I'll go with B. Secession.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
