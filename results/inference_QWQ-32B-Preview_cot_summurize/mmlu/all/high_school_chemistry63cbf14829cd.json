                    "text": "So I've got this question here about molecular geometries. It says: \"Which of the following geometries corresponds to a substance that has five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair of electrons?\" And then it gives options: A. Tetrahedron, B. Square planar, C. Octahedron, D. Square pyramid.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall some basics about molecular geometry. I know that the shape of a molecule is determined by the arrangement of electron pairs around the central atom, including both bonding pairs and nonbonding pairs. There's something called the VSEPR theory, which stands for Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory. This theory helps predict the geometry based on minimizing repulsion between electron pairs.\n\nSo, in this case, the substance has five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair of electrons. That means there are five bonding pairs and one lone pair around the central atom.\n\nLet me think about the total number of electron pairs around the central atom. Electron pairs include both bonding pairs and lone pairs. So, if there are five sigma bonds, that means five bonding pairs, plus one lone pair, that's a total of six electron pairs around the central atom.\n\nNow, according to VSEPR theory, the electron pair geometry for six electron pairs is octahedral. That's because in an octahedral arrangement, there are six positions around the central atom, each occupied by an electron pair.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the molecular geometry, not the electron pair geometry. The electron pair geometry considers all electron pairs, whereas the molecular geometry only considers the positions of the atoms, not the lone pairs.\n\nSo, with six electron pairs arranged octahedrally, but one of them is a lone pair, the molecular geometry would be different.\n\nLet me visualize this. In an octahedral arrangement, there are six positions: up, down, left, right, front, and back. If one of these is a lone pair, say, the top position, then the five bonding pairs would be in the other five positions.\n\nSo, the molecular geometry would have five atoms around the central atom, with one lone pair.\n\nNow, I need to think about what shape that would correspond to. If it's five atoms arranged around a central atom with one lone pair, it's not a regular octahedron because that would require six atoms.\n\nWait, an octahedron has six vertices, but in this case, one vertex is occupied by a lone pair, so only five atoms are present.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is octahedron, which probably refers to the electron pair geometry, not the molecular geometry.\n\nThe molecular geometry, with five atoms and one lone pair, doesn't match any of the standard names directly. Let's consider the options given:\n\nA. Tetrahedron: That's for four bonding pairs, or four atoms around the central atom. Doesn't fit here.\n\nB. Square planar: That's for four bonding pairs in a plane, shaped like a square. Again, only four atoms.\n\nC. Octahedron: That's for six bonding pairs, or six atoms around the central atom.\n\nD. Square pyramid: That sounds interesting. A square base and one apex.\n\nWait, maybe the five atoms are arranged in a square base with one atom above, forming a square pyramid.\n\nLet me think about that. In an octahedron, there are six vertices. If one vertex is occupied by a lone pair, then the five atoms would form a square base and one atom above, which sounds like a square pyramid.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the molecular geometry would be a square pyramid.\n\nBut let me double-check. In an octahedral arrangement, removing one vertex (the lone pair) leaves five atoms positioned in a square pyramid shape.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the positions in an octahedron. If the central atom has six electron pairs arranged octahedrally, and one of them is a lone pair, then the five bonding pairs would occupy five of the six positions.\n\nIf the lone pair is in the axial position, then the five atoms would form a square base with one atom above, making a square pyramid.\n\nAlternatively, if the lone pair is in the equatorial position, the shape might look different, but in VSEPR theory, lone pairs prefer equatorial positions to minimize repulsion.\n\nWait, no. In an octahedron, all equatorial positions are equivalent to the axial positions in terms of energy, but lone pairs prefer equatorial positions to minimize repulsion with other electron pairs.\n\nBut in this case, it might not matter because the molecular geometry is determined by the positions of the atoms, not the lone pairs.\n\nSo, regardless of whether the lone pair is axial or equatorial, the five atoms would still form a square pyramid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to arrange five atoms around a central atom with one lone pair.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe using the steric number, which is the number of sigma bonds plus the number of lone pairs.\n\nIn this case, steric number = 5 (sigma bonds) + 1 (lone pair) = 6.\n\nFor a steric number of 6, the electron pair geometry is octahedral.\n\nThe molecular geometry, with one lone pair, would be a distorted octahedron, but among the options, square pyramid seems to be the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a pentagonal pyramid, but that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, for five atoms around a central atom, it could be a trigonal bipyramid, but that's for five electron pairs, not six.\n\nWait, no, trigonal bipyramid is for five electron pairs: three equatorial and two axial.\n\nBut in this case, we have six electron pairs, with one being a lone pair.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing things.\n\nLet me try to think differently. If there are six electron pairs around the central atom, arranged octahedrally, and one of them is a lone pair, then the molecular geometry is determined by the positions of the five bonding pairs.\n\nIn an octahedron, removing one vertex (the lone pair) leaves five positions for the atoms.\n\nThese five positions can be visualized as a square base with one atom above, forming a square pyramid.\n\nTherefore, the molecular geometry is a square pyramid.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. Square pyramid matches this description.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Square pyramid.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any other option could make sense.\n\nOption A, tetrahedron, is for four bonding pairs, which doesn't match here.\n\nOption B, square planar, is typically for four bonding pairs in a plane, which again doesn't fit.\n\nOption C, octahedron, is for six bonding pairs, but here one is a lone pair, so it's not an octahedral molecular geometry.\n\nTherefore, the only suitable option is D. Square pyramid.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
