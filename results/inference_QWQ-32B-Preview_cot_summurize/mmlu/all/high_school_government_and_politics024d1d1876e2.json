                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option correctly identifies a significant difference between the Senate and the House of Representatives. I know that both are parts of the United States Congress, but they have some key differences in their structures and powers.\n\nOption A says that only the House has the power to issue subpoenas. I think both the Senate and the House have the power to issue subpoenas; it's part of their oversight responsibilities. So, I don't think that's correct.\n\nOption B claims that only the Senate may introduce revenue bills. Wait, I recall that actually, according to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C states that states are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population. Hmm, I think I have this backwards. Isn't it that in the Senate, each state has two representatives, so it's equal representation, regardless of population? And in the House, representation is based on population, so it's proportional. So, this option seems to have it backward.\n\nOption D says that the Senate allows unlimited debate, while the House does not. I think this is related to the concept of a filibuster, which I believe is associated with the Senate. In the House, there are rules that limit debate time. So, this seems plausible.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check some of these points. Let's start with how members are apportioned in each chamber.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, representation is based on each state's population. States with more people have more representatives, up to a maximum of four representatives per state. Wait, no, there's no maximum of four; it's based on population, and some states have many more representatives. For example, California has over 50 representatives.\n\nIn the Senate, each state has two senators, regardless of population. So, California has the same number of senators as Wyoming, for example.\n\nSo, considering that, option C is incorrect because it's the opposite: states are equally represented in the Senate, not the House.\n\nOption A is probably wrong because both chambers have the authority to issue subpoenas as part of their investigative powers.\n\nOption B is definitely incorrect because the Constitution specifies that all revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nThat leaves option D, which seems correct. I know that in the Senate, there's a procedure called the filibuster, which allows for unlimited debate unless there's a cloture vote to end it. In the House, there are stricter rules that limit debate time to ensure that business can proceed efficiently.\n\nSo, it seems that the significant difference highlighted in option D is accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
