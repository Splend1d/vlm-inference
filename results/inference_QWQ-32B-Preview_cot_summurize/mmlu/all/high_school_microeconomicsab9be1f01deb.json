                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about wage differentials. So, wage differentials refer to the differences in wages that various workers earn. These differences can be due to a multitude of factors. The question is asking which of the options provided is NOT a source of these wage differentials.\n\nOption A says \"Differences in human capital stock.\" Human capital refers to the skills, education, and experience that workers have. It's widely accepted that more educated and experienced workers tend to earn higher wages because they can produce more or perform higher-skilled tasks. So, differences in human capital definitely contribute to wage differentials. Therefore, this seems like a valid source, meaning it's likely not the answer we're looking for.\n\nOption B mentions \"Racial or gender discrimination.\" Discrimination in the workplace can lead to unequal pay for equal work, which directly affects wage differentials. If certain groups are paid less due to bias rather than their productivity or skills, that's a significant source of wage disparities. So, this is also a recognized factor in wage differentials.\n\nOption C is \"Immobility of workers.\" This refers to the difficulty workers have in moving to areas with better job opportunities or higher wages. For example, if someone lives in an area with high unemployment and can't move to a place with more jobs due to family ties, lack of resources, or other reasons, they might have to accept lower wages. Similarly, if certain jobs require specific skills that are hard to acquire, workers might be immobile in terms of switching to those higher-paying jobs. Thus, immobility can indeed lead to wage differentials.\n\nOption D says \"Decrease in the birth rate.\" Now, a decrease in birth rate would likely lead to a change in the overall population and the labor force over time. A lower birth rate could mean a smaller workforce in the future, which might affect supply and demand for labor. However, I'm not sure how directly a decrease in birth rate causes current wage differentials between workers. It seems more related to long-term labor market trends rather than immediate differences in wages among current workers.\n\nComparing all these options, A, B, and C are all directly related to factors that create differences in wages among workers. Option D, while it may have implications for the labor market, doesn't seem to be a direct source of current wage differentials. Therefore, I believe the answer is D. Decrease in the birth rate.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's think about this a bit more. Could a decrease in birth rate affect wage differentials? In the long run, yes. If birth rates decrease, the labor supply might decrease, potentially leading to higher wages for workers in sectors with labor shortages. However, this is a general effect on wage levels, not necessarily on differentials between workers. Wage differentials are about the differences in wages among workers, not the overall level of wages.\n\nMoreover, a decrease in birth rate might affect the composition of the workforce, with potentially older workers staying longer in the workforce. This could influence the demand for certain skills or the need for retirement planning, but again, it's not directly a source of differences in wages among current workers.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C are all factors that can create disparities in wages right now, based on individuals' characteristics and circumstances.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D. Decrease in the birth rate is NOT a source of wage differentials.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
