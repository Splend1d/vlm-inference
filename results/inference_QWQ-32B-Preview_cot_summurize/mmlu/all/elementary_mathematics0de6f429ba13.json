                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a number that, when rounded to the nearest hundred, becomes 500. We need to figure out which of the given options couldn't have been the original number before rounding.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how rounding to the nearest hundred works. When rounding to the nearest hundred, we look at the tens digit of the number. If the tens digit is 5 or greater, we round up to the next hundred. If it's less than 5, we round down to the current hundred.\n\nGiven that the rounded number is 500, the original number must have been closer to 500 than to 400 or 600. So, it should be at least 450 (since 450 is exactly halfway between 400 and 500, and rounding rules typically round up in that case) and less than 550 (since 550 is exactly halfway between 500 and 600, and would round up to 600).\n\nWait a minute, but I think I should double-check the exact range. Let's consider that numbers from 450 to 499.999... would round up to 500, and numbers from 500 to 549.999... would also be considered as rounding to 500. But actually, numbers from 500 to 549.999... would round down to 500, since they're closer to 500 than to 600. So, the range should be from 450 to 549 inclusive.\n\nLet me confirm this. If a number is 450, it's exactly halfway between 400 and 500, and by standard rounding rules, it rounds up to 500. Numbers from 451 to 499 are clearly closer to 500 than to 400, so they round to 500. Numbers from 500 to 549 are closer to 500 than to 600, so they also round to 500. At 550, it's exactly halfway between 500 and 600, and according to standard rounding, it would round up to 600.\n\nTherefore, the original number must have been between 450 and 549 inclusive to round to 500.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. 458\n\nB. 463\n\nC. 547\n\nD. 559\n\nLet's check each one:\n\nA. 458 - This is within 450 and 549, so it could round to 500.\n\nB. 463 - Also within 450 and 549, so it could round to 500.\n\nC. 547 - Still within 450 and 549, so it could round to 500.\n\nD. 559 - This is greater than 550, so it's outside the range. According to our earlier reasoning, 559 is closer to 600 than to 500, so it should round to 600, not 500.\n\nTherefore, the number that could not have been the original number before rounding to the nearest hundred is 559.\n\nWait, but the question says \"which number could not be the number before it was rounded to the nearest hundred?\" So, which one couldn't have been the original number if it rounds to 500.\n\nBased on our analysis, 559 is outside the range that rounds to 500; it should round to 600. So, it couldn't have been the original number if the rounded result is 500.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly verify the other options:\n\n- 458: rounding up to 500 makes sense.\n\n- 463: definitely rounds to 500.\n\n- 547: rounds to 500.\n\n- 559: rounds to 600.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 559.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
