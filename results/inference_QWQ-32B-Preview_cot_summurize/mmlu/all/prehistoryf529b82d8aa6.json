This classification is based on the morphological similarities between the Peking Man fossils and other Homo erectus specimens found in different parts of the world.\n\nHomo erectus is an extinct species of hominin that lived from about 1.9 million to 143,000 years ago. They are characterized by their robust build, prominent brow ridges, and a brain size larger than that of earlier hominins but smaller than that of modern humans. Homo erectus is considered to be the first hominin to have spread beyond Africa, with fossils found in Asia and Europe.\n\nThe Peking Man site, located in Zhoukoudian, near Beijing, China, is one of the most important paleoanthropological sites in the world. The first fossils were discovered in the 1920s, and over the years, numerous specimens have been unearthed, including skulls, teeth, and skeletal remains. These fossils provided crucial evidence for the understanding of human evolution and the migration of hominins out of Africa.\n\nInitially, the Peking Man fossils were classified as a separate species, Sinanthropus pekinensis, but later research and comparative anatomy led to their reclassification as Homo erectus pekinensis, a subspecies of Homo erectus.\n\nHomo sapiens, on the other hand, is the species to which modern humans belong. Homo sapiens evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago and gradually replaced other hominin species, including Homo erectus, as they spread across the globe.\n\nHomo habilis is considered one of the earliest members of the genus Homo, living about 2.8 to 1.5 million years ago. They are known for their small brain size and the earliest evidence of tool use.\n\nHomo floresiensis, often referred to as \"hobbits,\" is a species discovered on the island of Flores in Indonesia. They are remarkable for their small stature and brain size, and their existence has been dated to as recently as 12,000 years ago. However, their classification is still a subject of debate among scientists.\n\nIn summary, the Peking Man fossils are classified as Homo erectus due to their anatomical features and the timeline of their existence, which aligns with the characteristics and chronology of Homo erectus."
