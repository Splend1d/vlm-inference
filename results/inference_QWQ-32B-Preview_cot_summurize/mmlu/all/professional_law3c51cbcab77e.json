                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a state building a baseball stadium and issuing bonds to finance it. There's a lot going on here, so let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the state built a stadium and issued bonds to pay for it. The bond agreement says that for the first five years, at least $2 from each admission charge would go towards repaying the bond debt. If that wasn't enough, then for the next five years, at least $1 from each admission charge would be used to make up the difference.\n\nNow, three years into the operation, the legislature passes a bill completely banning baseball because four players were killed in playing mishaps. The question is whether this statute is probably constitutional or not, and why.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Constitutional, because it's a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.\n\nB. Constitutional, because of the clear and present danger of baseball playing in the state.\n\nC. Unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\n\nD. Unconstitutional, because it violates the due process rights of the baseball team owners.\n\nOkay, so we need to think about the state's power to regulate for the public good versus the rights of contract holders and property owners.\n\nFirst, what is the state's police power? It's the power to regulate for the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of its citizens. Banning baseball because of player deaths could be seen as an exercise of that power to protect public safety.\n\nBut is banning baseball really necessary for public safety? Four player deaths sound tragic, but is baseball inherently dangerous to the point where it needs to be banned entirely? Maybe the state is overreacting, but legally, does that make the ban unconstitutional?\n\nOption A says it's constitutional because it's a justifiable exercise of police power. That could be plausible if the court agrees that the danger is significant enough.\n\nOption B says it's constitutional because of the clear and present danger of baseball. \"Clear and present danger\" is a term often used in free speech cases to determine when speech can be restricted. But here, it's about activities, not speech. So maybe this option is a bit misapplied.\n\nOption C says it's unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract. The bond agreement has provisions about using admission charges to repay the bonds. If baseball is banned, the stadium can't be used for baseball games, so there would be no admission charges, right? That could mean the state can't fulfill its bond repayment obligations as planned.\n\nBut does banning baseball directly impair the bondholders' contract? The bond agreement is between the state and the bondholders, with conditions on how admission charges are used. If the state can't collect admission charges because baseball is banned, it might default on the bonds, but does that make the ban itself unconstitutional?\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe the bondholders could argue that the ban impairs their contract because it prevents the state from fulfilling its promise to use admission charges for bond repayment.\n\nOption D says it's unconstitutional because it violates the due process rights of the baseball team owners. Due process requires that laws don't arbitrarily deprive people of life, liberty, or property.\n\nBanning baseball would likely deprive team owners of their ability to use the stadium for baseball games, which is a significant loss. But is it an arbitrary deprivation? If the ban is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest, like public safety, then it might be upheld.\n\nHowever, if the ban is overly broad or not reasonably related to the safety concern, it could be seen as violating due process.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think option C is the most compelling. The ban on baseball impairs the bondholders' contract because it prevents the state from collecting admission charges, which are essential for repaying the bonds as per the agreement.\n\nThe state entered into a contract with the bondholders, promising to use admission charges in a certain way for bond repayment. By banning baseball, the state is effectively preventing the collection of those admission charges, thus impairing its ability to fulfill its contractual obligations.\n\nContract clauses that impair the obligation of contracts are generally subject to judicial scrutiny under the Contract Clause of the Constitution. If the impairment is substantial and not justified by a compelling state interest, it could be invalidated.\n\nIn this case, while public safety is a legitimate state interest, one might argue that banning baseball entirely is not a proportional response to the risk presented by four player deaths. Perhaps there are less drastic measures, like improving safety regulations, that could address the issue without completely prohibiting the sport.\n\nTherefore, the ban could be seen as an unconstitutional impairment of the bondholders' contract.\n\nOption D, regarding due process, is also plausible, but I think option C is stronger in this context because it directly relates to the state's contractual obligations.\n\nSo, my answer is C. Unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
