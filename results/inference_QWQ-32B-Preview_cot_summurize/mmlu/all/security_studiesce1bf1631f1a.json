                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about realism and humanitarian intervention. I need to identify which statement isn't part of the realist argument against humanitarian interventions. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Armed force should only ever be used in the national interest, and that humanitarian intervention is therefore imprudent.\" This sounds like a classic realist position. Realists believe that states act in their own self-interest, and national interest is paramount. They would argue that humanitarian intervention doesn't serve national interest, so it's not wise or prudent. So, this seems consistent with realist thought.\n\nOption B: \"Foreign intervention reduces the proportion of wars that end in outright victory; it leaves behind an unstable peace that is likely to reignite.\" This also aligns with realist views. Realists often argue that intervention can make situations worse, leading to prolonged conflicts or unstable peace, which might lead to more violence down the line. So, this seems like a realist assertion.\n\nOption C: \"Foreign intervention tends to prolong wars; it is inappropriate and does not work.\" Again, this is in line with realist perspectives. They often criticize intervention for making conflicts longer and more complicated, suggesting that non-intervention is better for maintaining international order.\n\nOption D: \"Humanitarian intervention prioritizes the human as the referent object of security, undermining the state-centric approach of realism.\" This statement is different. It's pointing out that humanitarian intervention focuses on protecting individuals rather than states, which contrasts with realism's focus on state security. While this is an accurate description of the difference between humanitarian intervention and realism, it's not an assertion against humanitarian intervention. Instead, it's more of an observation about the shift in referent objects from states to humans.\n\nSo, considering the above, option D seems to be the one that isn't an assertion made in the realist case against humanitarian intervention. It's more of an acknowledgment of the difference in approach rather than an argument against intervention.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Options A, B, and C present arguments against humanitarian intervention from a realist perspective.\n\n- Option D describes the difference in focus between humanitarian intervention and realism without arguing against intervention.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
