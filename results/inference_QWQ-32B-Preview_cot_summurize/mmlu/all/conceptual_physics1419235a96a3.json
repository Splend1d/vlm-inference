                    "text": "At very high speeds, according to the theory of relativity, an object appears to an observer at rest to be shorter in the direction of travel. This phenomenon is known as length contraction. So, the correct answer is A. Shorter in the direction of travel.\n\nTo elaborate, when an object is moving at speeds close to the speed of light, its length in the direction of motion is observed to be shorter from the perspective of a stationary observer. This effect is not just an optical illusion but a real relativistic effect predicted by Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\nOption B, \"shrunken in all directions,\" is incorrect because length contraction only affects the dimension of the object that is parallel to its motion. The dimensions perpendicular to the direction of motion remain unchanged.\n\nOption C, \"shorter in the direction perpendicular to travel,\" is also incorrect for the same reason. Perpendicular dimensions do not experience contraction.\n\nOption D, \"longer in all directions,\" is contrary to the principles of special relativity, which predicts contraction, not expansion, in the direction of motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A."
