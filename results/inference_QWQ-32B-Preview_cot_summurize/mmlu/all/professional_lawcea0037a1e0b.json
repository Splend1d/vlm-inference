                    "text": "This is a tricky legal question, and I need to think carefully about the principles involved here. So, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a patient with a broken leg in a wheelchair, being pushed through automatic doors by a nurse. The doors close on the patient's foot, causing injury, and when the nurse tries to pull the wheelchair back, the doors close tighter, injuring the patient further.\n\nThe patient is suing the hospital for improper maintenance of the doors, but hasn't provided any evidence of specific conduct or neglect by the hospital that would have caused the doors to malfunction.\n\nThe hospital is moving for summary judgment, which means they're asking the court to decide the case in their favor without going to trial, because there's no genuine dispute over the material facts.\n\nNow, the question is whether the court should grant this motion. The options are:\n\nA. No, because a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors.\n\nB. No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.\n\nC. Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.\n\nD. Yes, because the nurse's action was a superseding cause of the injury.\n\nLet's look at each option.\n\nOption A says no to summary judgment because a jury could find a latent defect in the doors. A latent defect is one that's not obvious and can't be easily detected upon inspection. In product liability cases, manufacturers can be liable for latent defects, but here, it's about the maintenance of the doors by the hospital.\n\nHowever, the patient hasn't produced any evidence of specific conduct or neglect by the hospital regarding the doors. So, without evidence of improper maintenance leading to a defect, it's hard to argue that there's a genuine dispute over whether there was a latent defect. Therefore, option A might not be strong.\n\nOption B mentions res ipsa loquitur, which is a legal doctrine that allows a jury to infer negligence from the mere occurrence of an accident, under certain conditions. These conditions typically include:\n\n1. The accident is one that doesn't normally occur without someone's negligence.\n\n2. The defendant had control over the instrumentality that caused the accident.\n\n3. The plaintiff didn't contribute to the accident.\n\nIn this case, the accident is the automatic doors closing on the patient's foot. Automatic doors are designed to sense objects and not close on them, so perhaps it's unusual for them to close on someone's foot unless there's a malfunction or improper maintenance.\n\nThe hospital likely had control over the doors, and assuming the patient didn't contribute to the accident, res ipsa loquitur might apply. This could allow a jury to infer negligence even without specific evidence of improper maintenance.\n\nHowever, the hospital might argue that the nurse's action in pulling the wheelchair back was an intervening cause that breaks the chain of negligence. But that's a separate issue.\n\nOption C states that proof of an accident alone doesn't establish negligence. That's generally true; accidents can happen for various reasons, not necessarily due to negligence. However, in cases where res ipsa loquitur applies, the accident itself can be sufficient to infer negligence.\n\nGiven that, option C might not hold up if res ipsa loquitur is applicable here.\n\nOption D suggests that the nurse's action was a superseding cause of the injury. A superseding cause is an independent event that intervenes between the defendant's negligence and the plaintiff's injury, relieving the defendant of liability.\n\nIn this scenario, the nurse's attempt to pull the wheelchair back did cause further injury, but was that an independent, unforeseeable event? Or was it a predictable response to the initial accident?\n\nGiven that the nurse was trying to help the patient and likely didn't intend to cause more harm, it might be argued that her action was a foreseeable response to the initial malfunction of the doors.\n\nTherefore, it might not qualify as a superseding cause that relieves the hospital of liability.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems the most compelling. A jury could indeed find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur, inferring negligence from the accident itself, given the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the court should not grant the hospital's motion for summary judgment, as there are issues of fact that need to be determined by a jury.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
