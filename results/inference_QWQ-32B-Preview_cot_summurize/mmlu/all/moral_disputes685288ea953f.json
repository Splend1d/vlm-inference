                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Lee and George's argument regarding embryos and personhood. The question is:\n\n\"In response to the argument that embryos are not persons because they do not exercise higher mental capacities, Lee and George argue that\n\nA. embryos actually do exercise higher mental capacities.\n\nB. it doesn't make sense to say that a person exercises higher mental capacities.\n\nC. the argument is sound, but its validity fails due to a common logical fallacy.\n\nD. to have killed a human embryo that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you.\"\n\nOkay, so first, I need to grasp what the original argument is. It seems that some people argue that embryos aren't persons because they don't exercise higher mental capacities. So, the basis for personhood here is the exercise of higher mental functions like self-awareness, rational thought, etc.\n\nNow, Lee and George are responding to this argument. I need to figure out which of these options best represents their position.\n\nOption A says that embryos actually do exercise higher mental capacities. Hmm, I know that embryos, especially in early stages, don't show the same level of mental activity as, say, an adult or even a child. So, this seems unlikely. Maybe they're arguing that embryos have the potential to develop these capacities, but that's not exactly the same as exercising them.\n\nOption B says that it doesn't make sense to say that a person exercises higher mental capacities. This seems vague. Are they arguing that the concept of exercising higher mental capacities is flawed or unclear? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that directly responds to the original argument.\n\nOption C says that the argument is sound, but its validity fails due to a common logical fallacy. Wait, if the argument is sound, that means it's valid and its premises are true, so the conclusion must be true. But then it says that its validity fails, which contradicts the idea of being sound. There's something fishy here. Maybe there's a typo or misstatement.\n\nOption D says that killing a human embryo that developed into you would be the same as killing you. This seems to be appealing to the idea of personal identity over time. Essentially, that the embryo is you at an earlier stage, so harming it would be harming you.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nFirst, the original argument is: Embryos are not persons because they don't exercise higher mental capacities.\n\nLee and George are responding to this.\n\nIf I were them, I might argue that personhood shouldn't be based solely on the exercise of higher mental capacities, but on some other essential feature, like being a human organism with a certain developmental potential.\n\nAlternatively, they might argue that the embryo has the intrinsic dignity or value of a person, independent of its current mental capacities.\n\nOption A seems unlikely because it's factually incorrect to say that embryos exercise higher mental capacities.\n\nOption B seems unclear and doesn't directly address the original argument.\n\nOption C is confusing because a sound argument is, by definition, valid with true premises, so its conclusion would be true. Saying that its validity fails contradicts the notion of being sound.\n\nOption D seems to be making a different point, about the continuity of personal identity from embryo to adult.\n\nPerhaps Lee and George are arguing that the embryo is a valuable human life from the moment of conception, and that to kill it is to deprive it of its future personhood and development.\n\nAlternatively, they might be arguing that the capacity for higher mental functions is present in the embryo's genetic code and developmental potential, even if not currently exercised.\n\nWait, maybe option D is closest to their argument. If an embryo is killed, and it was destined to develop into a particular person, then killing the embryo is equivalent to killing that person at any later stage.\n\nThis seems similar to the \"future-like-ours\" argument, where the embryo has a future of experiences and developments that are valuable, and depriving it of that future is morally equivalent to depriving a developed person of their future.\n\nSo, perhaps Lee and George are arguing that the embryo is a person in potency, and that its potential personhood grants it the same moral status as an actual person.\n\nAlternatively, they might be arguing from the perspective of natural law or essentialism, where the embryo has intrinsic value as a human being, regardless of its developmental stage.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D seems to capture this idea: that killing the embryo is equivalent to killing the person it would have become.\n\nOption C, about the argument being sound but validity failing, doesn't make much sense logically, so I can probably rule that out.\n\nOption B is too vague and doesn't directly address the issue.\n\nOption A is factually incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most plausible answer.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D: to have killed a human embryo that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
