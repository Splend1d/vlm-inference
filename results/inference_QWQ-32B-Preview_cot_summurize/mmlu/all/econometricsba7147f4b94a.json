                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about goodness of fit statistics. It says: \"Which one of the following is examined by looking at a goodness of fit statistic?\" And then there are four options:\n\nA. How well the population regression function fits the data\n\nB. How well the sample regression function fits the population regression function\n\nC. How well the sample regression function fits the data\n\nD. How well the population regression function fits the sample regression function.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand what a goodness of fit statistic is. From what I recall, a goodness of fit statistic is a measure that tells us how well a statistical model fits a set of observations. In other words, it assesses how closely the model's predictions match the actual data.\n\nNow, let's break down each option:\n\nOption A says: \"How well the population regression function fits the data.\"\n\nWait a minute, the population regression function is the true relationship between the variables in the entire population. In practice, we don't know this function because we only have a sample of the population. So, assessing how well the population regression function fits the data wouldn't make much sense because we don't know what the population regression function is. We're trying to estimate it using our sample.\n\nOption B says: \"How well the sample regression function fits the population regression function.\"\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. The sample regression function is what we estimate from our sample data, and the population regression function is the true relationship we're trying to estimate. But again, since we don't know the population regression function, it's hard to directly assess how well the sample regression function fits it.\n\nOption C says: \"How well the sample regression function fits the data.\"\n\nThis sounds more plausible. The sample regression function is our model based on the sample data, and we can certainly measure how well this model fits the data points we have. That seems like something a goodness of fit statistic would do.\n\nOption D says: \"How well the population regression function fits the sample regression function.\"\n\nThis seems similar to option B but reversed. Again, since we don't know the population regression function, it's not straightforward to assess how well it fits the sample regression function.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to make the most sense. We can calculate statistics like R-squared, which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. This tells us how well the sample regression function fits the data.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. In regression analysis, the goodness of fit is indeed about how well our model, based on the sample data, fits the observed data points. We use metrics like the sum of squared residuals, R-squared, adjusted R-squared, etc., to assess this fit.\n\nSo, in essence, we're evaluating how well the sample regression function captures the patterns in the data. We're not directly comparing it to the population regression function because that's unknown.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option C: How well the sample regression function fits the data.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might not be correct.\n\nOption A is about the population regression function fitting the data. But since we don't know the population regression function, we can't directly assess its fit to the data. Instead, we infer it through the sample regression function.\n\nOption B is about the sample regression function fitting the population regression function. While this might sound similar to what we want, it's not quite right because we're working with the sample data, and our goal is to have the sample regression function be a good estimate of the population regression function. However, since we don't know the population function, we can't directly measure this fit.\n\nOption D is essentially the reverse of option B and suffers from the same issue.\n\nHence, option C remains the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
