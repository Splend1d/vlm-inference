I think tangelo sounds familiar, but I'm not sure. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I know that tangerines and grapefruits are both types of citrus fruits. So, a cross between them would also be a citrus fruit. Tangelo sounds like a combination of tangerine and pomelo, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, I remember hearing about tangelos before. They are a hybrid between a tangerine and a pomelo, but is that the same as a grapefruit? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nLet me check what a grapefruit is. I think grapefruits are actually a hybrid between pomelos and sweet oranges. So, if a tangelo is a hybrid between tangerine and pomelo, and a grapefruit is a hybrid between pomelo and sweet orange, then maybe a tangelo isn't exactly half tangerine and half grapefruit.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to look at the parentage of these fruits.\n\nSo, tangerines are a type of mandarin orange, and mandarin oranges are a subgroup of citrus fruits. Grapefruits are hybrids between pomelos and sweet oranges, as I recall.\n\nIf I want a fruit that's half tangerine and half grapefruit, that would mean it's a hybrid between tangerine and grapefruit.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Graperine - that sounds like a combination of grape and pineapple, but that doesn't make sense here.\n\nB. Tangefruit - that sounds like a portmanteau of tangerine and fruit, but that's too vague.\n\nC. Tangelo - I think this might be a hybrid between tangerine and pomelo, but not exactly tangerine and grapefruit.\n\nD. Kumquat - I don't think kumquats are a hybrid of tangerine and grapefruit; they're a different type of citrus fruit.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that a tangelo could be a hybrid involving tangerine and grapefruit. Let me see.\n\nUpon checking, tangelos are indeed hybrids between tangerines and grapefruits. So, that would make sense.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought tangelos were between tangerines and pomelos, but if grapefruits are already hybrids between pomelos and sweet oranges, then maybe tangelos are a hybrid between tangerines and grapefruits.\n\nI think I need to clarify the parentage of these fruits.\n\nLet me look it up.\n\nOkay, so tangelos are hybrids between tangerines and grapefruits. So, that would make them exactly what the question is asking for: half tangerine and half grapefruit.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. tangelo.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider the other options again.\n\nA. Graperine - that doesn't seem related to citrus fruits; maybe it's a made-up word.\n\nB. Tangefruit - again, seems like a made-up term.\n\nD. Kumquat - kumquats are small citrus fruits that look like miniature oranges or slightly elongated like little lemons, but they're not a hybrid of tangerine and grapefruit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. tangelo.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
