                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the correct term for working practices that involve flexibility in time, space, and tasks. The options are dynamic, fluid, flexible, and modern. I think \"flexible\" might be the best choice because it directly relates to adaptability in various aspects of work. But let's see.\n\nFirst, \"dynamic\" suggests energetic and active, which might not specifically capture the flexibility in time, space, and tasks. It's more about energy and movement, but not necessarily about adaptability in work practices.\n\nNext, \"fluid\" implies smooth and unconstrained movement, which could relate to the flexibility in work patterns. It suggests that work can flow easily across different times and spaces, which sounds relevant.\n\n\"Flexible\" is probably the most straightforward option. It directly means able to adjust or adapt, which aligns well with the description of working practices that involve temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity.\n\nLastly, \"modern\" suggests contemporary or up-to-date, but it doesn't necessarily imply flexibility in work practices. Many modern practices could be rigid as well.\n\nComparing these, while \"fluid\" and \"flexible\" both seem applicable, \"flexible\" might be more precise because it explicitly denotes the ability to adjust to different conditions, which is what the question is describing.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the context in which these terms are used. In business or workplace settings, \"flexible working practices\" is a commonly used phrase to describe arrangements that allow employees to have more control over their work schedules and locations.\n\nOn the other hand, \"fluid working practices\" could also be used, especially in contexts where the work environment is constantly changing, and employees need to adapt to new situations quickly.\n\n\"Dynamic\" might be used to describe a workplace that is energetic and always changing, but again, it doesn't necessarily convey the flexibility in work patterns.\n\n\"Modern\" is too broad and doesn't specifically address the flexibility aspect.\n\nAfter thinking about it, I believe \"flexible\" is the most appropriate term here because it directly relates to the adaptability in time, space, and tasks, which is what the question is referring to.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
