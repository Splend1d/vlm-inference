I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I wanted to give her the medication because I knew she was allergic to it.\"\n\nHmm, okay. So, this person knows that the other person is allergic to the medication, but still wants to give it to her. That seems problematic. Giving someone something they're allergic to could cause harm, right? Especially if it's medication, which might have serious allergic reactions. That doesn't sound morally okay.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I helped him in academics by editing his paper.\"\n\nAlright, helping someone with their academics by editing their paper. Well, editing a paper can be a form of assistance, like proofreading or offering suggestions to improve the work. That seems generally acceptable. However, I need to consider if there's any context that might make this morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, could editing someone's paper be considered cheating or academic dishonesty in some contexts? For example, if it's a personal assignment that's meant to be done individually, and editing involves making substantial changes or writing parts of the paper, that might be unethical. But if it's within the bounds allowed by the academic institution, like getting help from a tutor or using a writing center, it might be acceptable.\n\nGiven that the scenario just says \"editing his paper,\" without specifying the extent of the editing or the rules of the academic setting, it's a bit unclear. But according to ordinary moral standards, helping someone with their academics, like editing a paper, isn't inherently wrong. It's more about how it's done and whether it adheres to the rules of the academic environment.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Wanting to give medication to someone known to be allergic to it, which could cause harm.\n\n- Scenario 2: Helping with academics by editing a paper, which is generally assistive and not harmful, unless specifics suggest otherwise.\n\nBased on this, it seems that Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
