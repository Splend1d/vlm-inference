                    "text": "I'm trying to recall the correct range for peak flow meter readings to be considered consistent. I remember it's something about the difference between the three readings being within a certain limit, but I'm not sure about the exact number. Let's see, the options are 10, 20, 100, or 30 liters per minute of each other.\n\nFirst, I know that peak flow meters are used to measure how fast you can blow air out of your lungs, which is an indication of how well your lungs are functioning, especially for people with asthma or other respiratory conditions. The idea is to get three readings in a row and make sure they are pretty close to each other, indicating consistency in your lung function at that moment.\n\nI think the acceptable difference between the readings is relatively small, maybe around 10 or 20 liters per minute. Let me think about this. If it were 100 liters per minute, that seems way too high because peak flow values themselves aren't that high for most people. Average peak flow for adults is around 400-600 liters per minute, so having a difference of 100 between three readings would be significant and probably not desirable.\n\nOn the other hand, 10 liters per minute seems very precise. I'm not sure if such a small difference is required. Maybe it's 20 liters per minute. I seem to recall that the variability between readings should be minimal, perhaps around 20 liters per minute or less.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look back at some respiratory science notes. I remember that when recording peak flow, it's important to follow certain steps to ensure accuracy. You need to stand up, take a deep breath, and blow as hard and fast as you can into the meter. Then repeat this three times and record the highest reading.\n\nBut regarding the consistency between the three readings, I think there's a guideline on how much variation is acceptable. I believe it's recommended that the three readings should be within 5% of each other, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nLet me try to calculate what 5% would be for an average peak flow of, say, 500 liters per minute. 5% of 500 is 25 liters per minute. So, if the readings are within 25 liters per minute of each other, that might be acceptable. But looking at the options, 20 liters per minute is closest to that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard difference allowed, regardless of the actual peak flow value. For example, readings should be within 20 liters per minute of each other.\n\nI think option B, 20 liters per minute, makes the most sense. It's a reasonable margin of error for manual measurements like this, and it ensures that the readings are consistent without being too strict.\n\nLet me consider the other options quickly. Option A is 10 liters per minute, which seems too tight, as human performance can vary slightly even in controlled conditions. Option C, 100 liters per minute, is probably too lenient and might not ensure accurate readings. Option D, 30 liters per minute, is closer to 20, but I think 20 is more standard.\n\nI recall that in some clinical settings, a variation of more than 20 liters per minute between readings may indicate that the technique needs to be improved or that there is variability in lung function at that time.\n\nAdditionally, I think it's important to note that peak flow meters are not always the most precise instruments, and individual efforts can vary slightly. Therefore, having a difference of up to 20 liters per minute allows for some natural variation without questioning the validity of the readings.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the correct answer is B. 20 liters per minute of each other.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
