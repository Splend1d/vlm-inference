Under a written contract, the plastic surgeon agreed to surgically remove the growth for $1,000. As the actress subsequently recalled, just before signing the agreement the parties orally agreed that if any additional medical procedures were required during surgery, they would be included in the $1,000 fee. The plastic surgeon, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. As agreed, the surgery was performed on an outpatient basis at the plastic surgeon's office. She applied a localized anesthesia that enabled the actress to remain conscious during surgery. While the operation was being performed, the plastic surgeon noticed another growth on the actress's neck. As the plastic surgeon subsequently recalled, she informed the actress about the growth and recommended that it be removed as well. According to the plastic surgeon's account, the actress orally agreed to have the growth removed for an additional $500. The actress has no recollection of any such oral agreement. The plastic surgeon performed both removal procedures satisfactorily. Following the surgery, the actress paid the plastic surgeon $1,000, but refused to pay any additional money for the removal of the second growth. After unsuccessfully attempting to collect the $500, the plastic surgeon brought suit against the actress to recover the additional fee. At trial, the plastic surgeon objected to the introduction of testimony regarding any oral agreement made before the written contract was signed. By the same token, the actress objected to the introduction of testimony concerning any oral agreement made during surgery. Will the plastic surgeon be entitled to recover the additional $500 if both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed?\n\nA. No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule.\nB. No, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the plastic surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.\nC.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this legal scenario. There's an actress who went to a plastic surgeon to remove a growth on her cheek. They had a written contract for that procedure, costing $1,000. But before signing, the actress says they agreed orally that any additional procedures during surgery would be included in that $1,000. The plastic surgeon doesn't remember that.\n\nThen, during the surgery, the surgeon spots another growth on the actress's neck and tells her about it, recommending its removal for an additional $500. The surgeon says the actress agreed orally to this, but the actress doesn't recall it. After the surgery, the actress pays the $1,000 but refuses to pay the extra $500. The surgeon sues to get that extra amount.\n\nAt trial, both sides object to certain testimony about oral agreements. The question is, if both pieces of parol evidence are admitted and believed, will the surgeon get the extra $500?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule.\n\nB. No, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the plastic surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.\n\nC. Yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.\n\nD. Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what parol evidence is. Parol evidence is oral or written statements made outside of a written contract. Generally, the parol evidence rule prevents the introduction of such evidence to contradict or vary the terms of a written contract, unless certain exceptions apply.\n\nIn this case, there are two oral agreements in question: one before the written contract was signed, and one during the surgery.\n\nThe actress is saying that before signing, they agreed that any additional procedures would be included in the $1,000. The surgeon doesn't recall that. Then, during surgery, the surgeon says the actress agreed to pay an extra $500 for removing the neck growth, but the actress doesn't recall that.\n\nIf both of these oral agreements are admitted and believed, it seems like there's a conflict. The first oral agreement suggests that additional procedures are included in the $1,000, while the second oral agreement suggests that the actress agreed to pay extra for the neck growth removal.\n\nOption A mentions the \"knock-out rule,\" which I think refers to the situation where conflicting oral agreements make neither enforceable. If both oral agreements are considered, and they contradict each other, maybe neither can be enforced, which would mean the surgeon couldn't collect the extra $500.\n\nOption B says no, because the surgeon was performing a legal duty already owed to the actress. But I'm not sure about that. They had a contract for the cheek growth, but the neck growth is separate. Maybe the surgeon had a duty to inform about the neck growth, but not necessarily to remove it without additional agreement.\n\nOption C says yes, because the oral modification was fair and equitable given unforeseen circumstances. If the surgeon and actress agreed during surgery to add the procedure for extra pay, and it was fair under the circumstances, maybe the modification is enforceable.\n\nOption D says yes, because otherwise the actress would be unjustly enriched. If she gets the neck growth removed without paying extra, she's getting something for nothing, which might be unjust.\n\nI need to think about which of these makes the most sense.\n\nFirst, regarding parol evidence, it's generally not allowed to contradict a written contract, but there are exceptions, such as integration clauses, ambiguity, or fraud. But in this case, it's about oral modifications or agreements surrounding the written contract.\n\nIf both oral agreements are admitted and believed, it seems like the court would have to decide which one to enforce. If the first oral agreement that additional procedures are included in $1,000 is believed, then the surgeon shouldn't get extra money. If the second oral agreement during surgery to pay extra is believed, then the surgeon should get the extra $500.\n\nBut since they contradict each other, maybe neither can be enforced, leading to option A.\n\nHowever, option D talks about unjust enrichment. If the surgeon performed the extra procedure and the actress benefited from it without paying extra, that might be unjust.\n\nBut then again, the actress might argue that she already paid for it under the original contract, based on the first oral agreement.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the court would look at industry standards, the circumstances, and the fairness of the situation.\n\nOption C mentions that the oral modification was fair and equitable given unforeseen circumstances. In surgery, discovering an additional issue that can be addressed at the same time might be considered unforeseen, so maybe modifying the agreement during surgery could be acceptable.\n\nBut the problem is that the actress doesn't recall agreeing to pay extra. If the court believes the surgeon's testimony that the actress agreed, then maybe the modification is enforceable.\n\nAlternatively, if the court believes the actress that she doesn't recall agreeing, maybe the modification isn't enforceable.\n\nBut the question says to assume that both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed. So, the court believes both oral agreements happened as stated by each party.\n\nIn that case, there's a direct contradiction: one says additional procedures are included in $1,000, the other says the actress agreed to pay extra $500 for the neck growth removal.\n\nUnder the knock-out rule, when two conflicting oral agreements are presented, neither can be enforced because their mutual exclusivity casts doubt on both. So, in that case, the surgeon wouldn't be able to collect the extra $500.\n\nBut option D suggests that the actress would be unjustly enriched if she doesn't pay the extra $500, and that injustice can only be avoided by enforcing her oral promise.\n\nHowever, if the court believes that the actress didn't agree to pay extra, then enforcing the oral agreement would be unfair to her.\n\nAlternatively, if the court believes the surgeon that the actress agreed to pay extra, then not enforcing it would unjustly enrich the actress.\n\nBut since both oral agreements are admitted and believed, it's a conflicting situation.\n\nMaybe the answer is A, that the surgeon won't be entitled to the extra $500 because of the knock-out rule.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to consider the written contract itself.\n\nThe written contract is for removal of the cheek growth for $1,000. Oral agreements are generally not enforceable if they contradict a written contract, unless there are exceptional circumstances.\n\nIn this case, the first oral agreement would contradict the written contract by adding a term that additional procedures are included in $1,000. The second oral agreement would modify the written contract to include an extra $500 for the neck growth.\n\nIf both oral agreements are admitted and believed, it creates confusion about what was actually agreed upon.\n\nPerhaps the written contract stands as is, and neither oral agreement is enforceable due to the conflict, meaning the surgeon only gets the $1,000 for the cheek growth, and nothing extra for the neck growth.\n\nBut then, that might be unjust to the surgeon, who performed an additional procedure.\n\nOn the other hand, if the surgeon is allowed to collect extra for the neck growth, it might be unfair to the actress if she didn't agree to it.\n\nThis seems like a situation where the parol evidence rule would prevent the introduction of the oral agreements to modify the written contract, unless there's clear evidence of a mutual agreement to modify.\n\nBut the question assumes that both oral agreements are admitted and believed, so perhaps the court would have to find a way to resolve the conflict.\n\nMaybe the court would consider the circumstances surrounding the surgery. Since the neck growth was discovered during the surgery, and the surgeon recommended its removal at that time, it might be reasonable to expect that the actress agreed to the additional procedure for extra pay.\n\nHowever, the actress doesn't recall agreeing to pay extra, which contradicts the surgeon's testimony.\n\nIn such a case, perhaps the court would look for other evidence to support the oral modification, like witnesses, documentation, or subsequent conduct.\n\nBut in the scenario presented, there doesn't seem to be any other evidence besides the conflicting testimonies.\n\nTherefore, it might come down to the credibility of the witnesses. If the court believes the surgeon that the actress agreed to pay extra, then the oral modification could be enforced, allowing the surgeon to collect the extra $500.\n\nAlternatively, if the court believes the actress that she didn't agree to pay extra, then the oral modification wouldn't be enforceable, and the surgeon wouldn't get the extra money.\n\nBut the question says to assume that both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed. So, the court believes both that the actress said additional procedures are included in $1,000 before the surgery and that the surgeon says the actress agreed to pay extra during surgery.\n\nIn that case, the court is faced with conflicting agreements, and perhaps the knock-out rule would apply, making neither oral agreement enforceable. Therefore, the surgeon would only be entitled to the $1,000 agreed upon in writing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court would consider the actress's lack of recollection of the second oral agreement as evidence that she didn't agree to it, even if the surgeon testifies that she did.\n\nBut the question says that both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed, so the court accepts that both oral agreements were made as stated.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the court would find that the second oral agreement overrides the first one, especially since it was made at the time of surgery, when the need for the additional procedure was discovered.\n\nTherefore, the surgeon could collect the extra $500.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with the knock-out rule, where conflicting oral agreements make neither enforceable.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe I should look at the legal principles involved.\n\nFirst, the parol evidence rule generally prevents oral modifications to written contracts, especially if the written contract is intended as a final expression of the agreement (a fully integrated contract).\n\nHowever, if both parties agree to modify the contract orally, and there's sufficient consideration, the modification could be enforceable.\n\nIn this case, the written contract is for the cheek growth removal for $1,000.\n\nThe first oral agreement, before signing, is that additional procedures are included in the $1,000.\n\nThe second oral agreement, during surgery, is that the actress agrees to pay an extra $500 for the neck growth removal.\n\nIf both of these oral agreements are admitted and believed, it creates a conflict: one says additional procedures are included in $1,000, and the other says she agreed to pay extra for the neck growth.\n\nIn contract law, when there are conflicting terms in modifications, the later agreement usually controls.\n\nSince the second oral agreement was made during surgery, after the first one, it might supersede the earlier agreement.\n\nTherefore, the surgeon could argue that the actress agreed to pay extra for the neck growth removal, and thus should pay the additional $500.\n\nAlternatively, the actress could argue that she didn't recall making that agreement, and that the earlier agreement should stand, meaning that the additional procedure is included in the original $1,000.\n\nIf the court believes both testimonies, it's a problematic situation.\n\nPerhaps the court would consider the actress's state during the surgery. If she was under localized anesthesia but conscious, she might have been in a vulnerable position, and the surgeon might have taken advantage of that to get her to agree to pay extra.\n\nOn the other hand, if the actress was competent and capable of making decisions at that time, and the surgeon properly informed her of the need for the additional procedure and the extra cost, then perhaps the oral modification is enforceable.\n\nBut since the actress doesn't recall the agreement, it's possible that she was not in a position to give informed consent at that moment.\n\nIn medical procedures, informed consent is crucial. If the actress was under the effects of anesthesia or otherwise impaired, she might not have been able to give valid consent to the additional procedure or to paying extra.\n\nTherefore, even if the surgeon testifies that the actress agreed, if the actress didn't recall it, the court might find that the consent was not properly given, and thus the oral modification is not enforceable.\n\nIn that case, the surgeon would only be entitled to the original $1,000.\n\nAlternatively, if the court finds that the actress was competent and did agree to pay extra, then the surgeon could collect the additional $500.\n\nBut given that the actress doesn't recall the agreement, and considering the circumstances of being under anesthesia, the court might side with the actress.\n\nTherefore, the surgeon wouldn't be entitled to the extra $500.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule.\n\nB. No, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the plastic surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.\n\nC. Yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.\n\nD. Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.\n\nOption A seems plausible, given the conflicting oral agreements.\n\nOption B is unclear to me. It says the surgeon performed a legal duty already owed to the actress that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute. I'm not sure what this means in this context. Maybe it's suggesting that the surgeon had a duty to remove the neck growth as part of the original contract, but that doesn't seem right, since the original contract was only for the cheek growth.\n\nOption C suggests that the oral modification was fair and equitable given unforeseen circumstances. This could apply, as the neck growth was discovered during surgery, which might not have been anticipated when the original contract was signed.\n\nOption D argues for enforcing the oral promise to prevent unjust enrichment. If the actress gets the neck growth removed without paying extra, she's getting an additional service for free, which might be unjust.\n\nConsidering all this, perhaps the answer is C or D.\n\nBut earlier in my analysis, I thought that due to the conflicting oral agreements, neither would be enforceable, leading to option A.\n\nHowever, if the court believes that the second oral agreement was made and was fair under the circumstances, then maybe the surgeon can collect the extra $500.\n\nAlternatively, if the court considers that the actress was possibly not in a position to give valid consent due to the anesthesia, then the second oral agreement might not be enforceable, leading to option A.\n\nThis is quite complex. Maybe I should consider the principle of unjust enrichment.\n\nIf the surgeon performed the additional procedure and the actress benefited from it without paying extra, that could be considered unjust enrichment.\n\nHowever, if the original contract included a term that additional procedures are covered in the $1,000, then the actress isn't being enriched unjustly.\n\nBut since there are conflicting oral agreements, and assuming that neither is enforceable due to the knock-out rule, the written contract stands as is.\n\nTherefore, the surgeon only gets the $1,000 for the cheek growth removal, and doesn't get extra for the neck growth.\n\nIn that case, the actress might be unjustly enriched, but there's nothing the surgeon can do about it, because the oral modification isn't enforceable.\n\nAlternatively, if the court believes that the second oral agreement is valid and enforceable, then the surgeon can collect the extra $500.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is D: yes, the surgeon can recover the additional $500 because otherwise the actress would be unjustly enriched.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that due to the conflicting oral agreements, neither would be enforceable, leading to option A.\n\nI'm getting confused again.\n\nMaybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nIf both oral agreements are admitted and believed, and they directly contradict each other, it creates uncertainty about what the actual agreement was.\n\nIn such cases, courts often refuse to enforce either oral agreement, relying on the written contract alone.\n\nTherefore, the surgeon would only be entitled to the $1,000 specified in the written contract.\n\nHowever, that would result in the actress being unjustly enriched, as she received an additional service without paying for it.\n\nOn the other hand, if the court enforces the second oral agreement, the surgeon gets the extra $500, but it might be unfair to the actress if she didn't actually agree to it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is A: no, the surgeon won't be entitled to the extra $500 because of the knock-out rule.\n\nBut then, considering unjust enrichment, maybe the court would find a way to allow the surgeon to collect the extra fee anyway, to prevent injustice.\n\nThis is complicated, and I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is A, but I can see arguments for D as well.\n\nI think I need to look up more about the knock-out rule and unjust enrichment in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a principle in contract law that allows for oral modifications in certain circumstances, even if there's a written contract.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, oral modifications to written contracts are enforceable if there's new consideration and the modification is clear and definite.\n\nIn this case, the second oral agreement during surgery could be seen as a modification with new consideration ($500 for the neck growth removal).\n\nHowever, given that there's a conflicting earlier oral agreement, it complicates matters.\n\nPerhaps the court would look at which oral agreement is more persuasive or credible.\n\nBut the question assumes that both are admitted and believed, so perhaps the court would have to find another way to resolve the conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the written contract controls, and neither oral agreement is enforceable, leading to the surgeon only getting the $1,000.\n\nBut then, the actress would be unjustly enriched.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court would enforce the second oral agreement to prevent unjust enrichment, even though there are conflicting oral agreements.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule.\n\nB. No, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the plastic surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.\n\nC. Yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.\n\nD. Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.\n\nI think option B is unlikely, as the surgeon didn't have a pre-existing legal duty to remove the neck growth under the original contract.\n\nOption C seems plausible, as the oral modification was made in response to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nOption D also makes sense from the perspective of unjust enrichment.\n\nHowever, considering the conflicting oral agreements, perhaps option A is correct: the surgeon won't be entitled to the extra $500 because of the knock-out rule.\n\nBut then, unjust enrichment comes into play.\n\nMaybe there's a way to reconcile both.\n\nPerhaps the"
