                    "text": "To determine which of the options is an n-type semiconductor, let's first understand what an n-type semiconductor is.\n\nA semiconductor is a material that has electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator. Semiconductors can be intrinsic (pure) or extrinsic (doped). Extrinsic semiconductors are created by adding impurities to intrinsic semiconductors to increase their conductivity.\n\nThere are two types of extrinsic semiconductors:\n\n1. **n-type semiconductors**: These are created by doping the intrinsic semiconductor with pentavalent impurities (elements from group 15 of the periodic table, like phosphorus, arsenic, etc.). These impurities have five valence electrons, whereas the semiconductor (like silicon or germanium) has four. When doped, the fifth electron of the impurity atom becomes a free electron in the conduction band, increasing the number of electrons available for conduction.\n\n2. **p-type semiconductors**: These are created by doping the intrinsic semiconductor with trivalent impurities (elements from group 13, like boron, aluminum, etc.). These impurities have three valence electrons, which leads to the creation of holes in the valence band when doped, increasing the number of holes available for conduction.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. **Silicon**: Silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor in its pure form. However, it can be doped to create either n-type or p-type semiconductors. Without any doping specified, silicon alone is not specifically an n-type semiconductor.\n\nB. **Diamond**: Diamond is typically an insulator, not a semiconductor. Its band gap is very wide, around 5.5 eV, which means it does not conduct electricity under normal conditions.\n\nC. **Silicon carbide**: Silicon carbide is a wide-bandgap semiconductor. In its pure form, it is an intrinsic semiconductor. Like silicon, it can be doped to create n-type or p-type semiconductors, but without specifying doping, it is not specifically n-type.\n\nD. **Arsenic-doped silicon**: Arsenic is a pentavalent element (from group 15). When doped into silicon, it donates its extra electron to the conduction band, making it an n-type semiconductor.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is D. Arsenic-doped silicon, as it is specifically an n-type semiconductor due to the doping with arsenic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
