Dispersed alluvial fan soil\n\nB. Heavy-textured soil, like silty clay\n\nC. Light-textured soil, like loamy sand\n\nD. Region of low humidity\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"moderate and frequent irrigation\" means. I think it means providing a reasonable amount of water quite often to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Corn needs a lot of water, especially during certain growth stages, so irrigation is important.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Dispersed alluvial fan soil: Alluvial soils are deposited by rivers and streams, and they can vary in texture from sandy to clayey. An alluvial fan is where these soils spread out at the base of a mountain. I'm not entirely sure about \"dispersed\" in this context, but generally, alluvial soils can be quite fertile and may have good drainage.\n\nB. Heavy-textured soil, such as silty clay: Heavy soils like silty clay have small particles that stick together, which means they hold water well but may not drain quickly. This could lead to waterlogging if irrigation is too frequent.\n\nC. Light-textured soil, such as loamy sand: Light soils like loamy sand have larger particles, which allow water to drain through quickly. This means they don't hold moisture for long, so they might need more frequent irrigation to keep the corn roots moist.\n\nD. Region of low humidity: This isn't a soil type; it's a climatic condition. Low humidity can affect evaporation rates, but it doesn't specify anything about the soil.\n\nConsidering that corn needs consistent moisture, but also good drainage to avoid root rot, I think light-textured soils like loamy sand would benefit from frequent irrigation because they drain quickly and can dry out fast.\n\nHeavy soils, like silty clay, might not need as frequent irrigation because they hold water longer. However, if irrigated too frequently, they could become waterlogged, which is bad for the plants.\n\nAlluvial fan soils could be variable, but if they are well-draining, they might also benefit from moderate irrigation.\n\nOption D is about humidity, which affects evapotranspiration, but it doesn't directly relate to soil type.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C, light-textured soil like loamy sand, because it would require more frequent irrigation to maintain moisture due to its rapid drainage properties.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
