The options are Realism, Idealism, Liberalism, or None of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories emphasizes in the context of international relations.\n\nStarting with Realism: I remember that Realism is a theory that views the international system as anarchic and states as the main actors competing for power and security. It's all about survival and self-help, where each state looks out for its own interests. So, in Realism, states are indeed the primary actors.\n\nNext, Idealism: I think Idealism is more about the role of moral values and international cooperation in shaping world politics. Idealists believe that international institutions and laws can help create a more peaceful and cooperative world. So, while states are important, Idealism also considers other actors and moral considerations.\n\nThen, Liberalism: This seems similar to Idealism, but perhaps more focused on the interdependence of states and the role of international organizations, economic ties, and democratic peace. Liberalism argues that cooperation and interdependence can reduce conflict between states.\n\nSo, comparing these, Realism clearly places states as the primary actors, focusing on their pursuit of power and security in an anarchic international system.\n\nIdealism and Liberalism both consider states important but also emphasize other factors like morality, international institutions, and interdependence.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Realism.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if \"None of the above\" could be the answer. Given that Realism does consider states as the primary actors, \"None of the above\" doesn't seem correct.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Realism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
