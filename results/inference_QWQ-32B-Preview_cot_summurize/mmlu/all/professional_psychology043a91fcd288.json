                    "text": "I'm going to consider each option carefully to decide the best course of action in this situation.\n\nOption A is to give Mrs. Lopez the specific advice she has requested. However, as a therapist, I have a duty of confidentiality to Leticia. Discussing her therapy details or providing specific advice without her consent could breach that trust. Moreover, I don't know the full context of Leticia's issues, so giving advice might not be appropriate.\n\nOption B is to tell Mrs. Lopez to ask Leticia what she can do to help her. This seems like a straightforward approach, but it might not be helpful if Leticia doesn't know what she needs or is reluctant to discuss her feelings with her mother.\n\nOption C is to tell Mrs. Lopez that it would be best if I discussed this matter with Leticia. This seems like a more appropriate step because it involves including Leticia in the conversation, respecting her privacy, and allowing her to be part of the decision-making process regarding her therapy.\n\nOption D is to suggest that Mrs. Lopez accompany Leticia to her next therapy session. While family involvement can sometimes be beneficial, it's important to consider Leticia's comfort level with this. It might not be suitable if Leticia prefers to keep her therapy sessions private or if her issues are personal in nature.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to be the most appropriate course of action. It respects Leticia's privacy, maintains confidentiality, and involves her in the discussion about her own therapy. This approach also allows for open communication between Leticia and her mother, potentially strengthening their relationship while addressing Leticia's needs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
