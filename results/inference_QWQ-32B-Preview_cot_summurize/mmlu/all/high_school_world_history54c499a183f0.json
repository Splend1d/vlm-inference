Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

Trade contacts from the north across the Sahara.\n\nC. Berber armies that conquered the former kingdom of Ghana.\n\nD. Pressure from Christian Ethiopia causing the king of Mali to seek Muslim allies.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the historical context of Mali and how Islam arrived there.\n\nMali was a West African kingdom that rose to prominence in the 13th and 14th centuries. It was located south of the Sahara Desert, and its capital was Timbuktu, which became a major center of learning and culture in the Islamic world.\n\nIslam spread to West Africa through various routes, but one of the most significant was through trade across the Sahara Desert. Caravans traveled between North Africa and West Africa, exchanging goods like salt, gold, and slaves, and also ideas and religion.\n\nSo, option B mentions trade contacts from the north across the Sahara, which aligns with this historical narrative. Traders from North Africa, many of whom were Muslim, brought Islam to the region through their interactions with local populations.\n\nOption A suggests Muslim missionaries from Southern Africa. However, Southern Africa was not a major center for the spread of Islam during that period. Islam was more established in North Africa and spread southward through trade routes.\n\nOption C mentions Berber armies conquering the former kingdom of Ghana. While it's true that Berber armies played a role in the region, specifically in the conquest of the Ghana Empire, which preceded Mali, the spread of Islam was more gradual and linked to trade and commerce rather than military conquest.\n\nOption D refers to pressure from Christian Ethiopia causing the king of Mali to seek Muslim allies. While there were interactions between Christian Ethiopia and Muslim states in Africa, this doesn't seem to be the primary reason for the spread of Islam in Mali. Mali's adoption of Islam was more a result of internal conversion and external trade influences.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems to be the most accurate explanation for the spread of Islam to the lands of the kingdom of Mali.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
