                    "text": "So I've got this question here about regression analysis. It says that the R-squared value, R-sq, is 98.1%. And I need to figure out which statements are true based on that. There are three statements:\n\nI. There is a strong positive linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\n\nII. There is a strong negative linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\n\nIII. About 98% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable.\n\nAnd then there are options A through D to choose which of these statements are true.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what R-squared represents in regression analysis. I know that R-squared, or the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. So, in simpler terms, it tells us how well the regression line fits the data.\n\nGiven that R-squared is 98.1%, which is very close to 100%, it suggests that a large proportion of the variance in the response variable is predictable from the explanatory variable. So, statement III says that about 98% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable. That seems to directly match the interpretation of R-squared. So, I think statement III is true.\n\nNow, regarding statements I and II, they are about the direction of the linear relationship: one is positive, and the other is negative. But R-squared doesn't tell us about the direction of the relationship; it only tells us about the strength of the linear relationship. To know whether the relationship is positive or negative, we need to look at the sign of the correlation coefficient, often denoted as \"r,\" or the sign of the slope in the regression equation.\n\nSince the question only provides R-squared and doesn't give any information about the sign of the correlation coefficient or the slope, I can't determine whether the relationship is positive or negative. Therefore, I can't say for sure whether statement I or II is true based solely on the R-squared value.\n\nWait a minute, but option C says \"I or II (but not both) and III.\" This seems plausible because either there is a strong positive linear relationship or a strong negative linear relationship, but not both at the same time. And since R-squared is high, indicating a strong linear relationship, either I or II could be true, but we don't know which one without additional information. And III is definitely true based on the R-squared value.\n\nLet me consider option A: \"I and III only.\" This would imply that there is a strong positive linear relationship and that about 98% of the variation is explained by the regression. But without knowing the sign of the correlation, I can't confirm that statement I is true.\n\nOption B says \"I or II only.\" But this would exclude statement III, which I believe is true. So, I don't think B is correct.\n\nOption D is \"II and III only.\" Similar to option A, this would assume that the relationship is negative, but again, without knowing the sign, I can't confirm that.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to make the most sense because it acknowledges that either I or II could be true, depending on the sign of the correlation, but not both, and that III is definitely true.\n\nTo double-check, I recall that R-squared is the square of the correlation coefficient r. So, if r is 0.99, its square would be about 0.9801, which matches the given R-squared of 98.1%. Similarly, if r is -0.99, its square would still be 0.9801. So, whether r is positive or negative, R-squared remains the same. That's why we can't determine the direction of the relationship from R-squared alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C: I or II (but not both) and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
