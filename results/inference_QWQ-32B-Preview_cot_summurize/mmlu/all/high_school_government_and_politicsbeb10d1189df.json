When the Supreme Court shows a willingness to change public policy and alter judicial precedent, it's often described as being activist because it's taking an active role in shaping laws and policies, sometimes beyond its traditional role. Judicial restraint, on the other hand, is when the Court avoids making such changes and sticks closely to existing precedents and interpretations. Due process is about ensuring fair treatment through the judicial system, and ex post facto lawmaking refers to laws that retroactively change the legal consequences of actions that were committed before the enactment of the law. So, based on the description, judicial activism seems to fit best."
