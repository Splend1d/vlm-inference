                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Ibn Battuta, who was traveling in China around 1332-1346 C.E. He's describing his experiences and observations in Hangzhou, which seems to be a pretty significant city. Let's see what he has to say and how it relates to the period between 600 C.E. and 1450 C.E.\n\nFirst off, he calls the Chinese \"infidels\" because they worship images and burn their dead like Hindus. He also mentions that the King of China is a Tartar and a descendant of Genghis Khan. This suggests that there was some awareness of different religious practices and ethnic backgrounds among rulers. It also implies that there was some communication or interaction between different parts of the world, since Ibn Battuta is from North Africa and is traveling in China.\n\nHe talks about towns for Muslims in all Chinese provinces, with cells, colleges, and mosques, and that they are made much of by the Kings of China. This indicates that Muslims had a presence in China and were perhaps influential or at least respected by the Chinese rulers. It also suggests that there was some level of religious tolerance or coexistence.\n\nIn Hangzhou, he was met by the judge and elders of Islamism, and there are numerous Muslims residing there. The city is divided into six districts, each surrounded by a wall, with different functions. The second division is where Jews, Christians, and sun-worshipping Turks reside, and it's considered the most beautiful city with well-disposed streets and wealthy great men.\n\nFrom this passage, it seems like there was a diverse population in Hangzhou, including different religious groups like Muslims, Jews, Christians, and others. The presence of these groups suggests some level of interaction and exchange between different civilizations.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Long-distance contact between civilizations stagnated.\n\nB. New religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs.\n\nC. The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia.\n\nD. Technological developments spread across trade routes.\n\nLet's evaluate each one based on the passage.\n\nOption A says that long-distance contact between civilizations stagnated. But the passage shows that there was interaction between China and other parts of the world, as evidenced by the presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and others in Hangzhou. Ibn Battuta himself is traveling from North Africa to China, which indicates that long-distance travel and contact were happening during this period. So, this option doesn't seem directly supported by the passage.\n\nOption B suggests that new religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs. The passage mentions that the Chinese are infidels because of their religious practices, and that there are Muslims, Jews, Christians, and others in Hangzhou. However, it doesn't indicate any overturning of prior religious beliefs. It seems more like a coexistence of different religions. So, this option isn't directly supported by the passage.\n\nOption C states that the empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia. Ibn Battuta mentions that the King of China is a Tartar and a descendant of Genghis Khan. The Mongols, who were steppe nomads, did establish an empire that spanned across Eurasia and facilitated trade along the Silk Road. This could suggest that their empire united trade links across the region. However, the passage doesn't explicitly state this; it's more about the presence of different religious groups in China.\n\nOption D says that technological developments spread across trade routes. While this is a plausible conclusion for the period, the passage doesn't provide any information about technological developments or their spread. It's focused more on the religious and cultural aspects of the society.\n\nConsidering these points, the conclusion that is most directly supported by the passage is Option C: The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia. This is because the mention of the King of China being a Tartar and a descendant of Genghis Khan hints at the influence of the Mongol Empire, which is known for uniting trade links across Eurasia.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the passage primarily discusses the religious diversity in China and the interactions between different groups, rather than directly stating anything about trade links. But among the given options, C seems to be the most directly supported by the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
