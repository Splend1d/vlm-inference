So, I'll go through each choice and see how it might affect the economy.\n\nOption A is \"more rapid consumption of natural resources.\" Now, natural resources are important for production, but consuming them too quickly can lead to depletion. That might not be sustainable in the long run. So, while it might give a short-term boost, it's probably not the best choice for strong,\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u3002\n\nOption B is \"higher adult illiteracy rates.\" Illiteracy is a big problem because it affects the skill level of the workforce. If adults can't read or write, it's harder for them to get good jobs and contribute to the economy. So, higher illiteracy rates would likely hinder economic growth rather than help it.\n\nOption C is \"a falling stock of capital goods.\" Capital goods are things like machinery and equipment that businesses use to produce other goods and services. If the stock of these items is falling, that means businesses have less to work with, which could slow down production and, in turn, economic growth.\n\nOption D is \"investment tax credits.\" These are incentives that governments give to encourage businesses to invest in new equipment or projects. Investment is key to growth because it can lead to increased productivity and the development of new technologies. So, this seems like it would support stronger economic growth.\n\nComparing all these options, it looks like option D, investment tax credits, is the most likely to produce stronger economic growth over time. The other options either have negative impacts or aren't sustainable in the long run.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
