                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's a contract between a widget manufacturer and a buyer for 500 widgets, shipped C.O.D., which means cash on delivery. The manufacturer delivered 490 widgets, which the buyer accepted and paid for. Now, the buyer is suing for breach of contract. We need to figure out what's most likely to happen.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what breach of contract means. It's when one party doesn't fulfill their obligations as per the agreement. In this case, the manufacturer was supposed to deliver 500 widgets but only delivered 490. So, did they breach the contract?\n\nWell, yes, technically, they didn't deliver the full amount. But is this a material breach? A material breach is one that substantially affects the value or performance of the contract. Here, only 10 widgets were short, which is 2% of the total order. Is that significant enough to constitute a material breach?\n\nI think it depends on the context. If these widgets are standardized and easily obtainable, maybe not. But if they're special order or hard to find, maybe yes. The question doesn't specify, so I'll assume they're standard widgets.\n\nNow, the buyer accepted and paid for the 490 widgets. Does that mean they accepted the performance as it was? Acceptance usually implies satisfaction, right? So, if they accepted and paid, maybe they can't now claim breach of contract.\n\nBut wait, they're still suing. So, perhaps there's more to it. Maybe the buyer needed all 500 widgets for a specific project, and 490 aren't sufficient. That could make the breach material.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Not recover, because under the circumstances, the manufacturer substantially performed.\n\nSubstantial performance means that the performer has done almost everything required by the contract, and only minor details are lacking. In this case, delivering 490 out of 500 widgets might be considered substantial performance, especially if the shortfall isn't material.\n\nB. Not recover, because the buyer accepted delivery of the 490 widgets.\n\nAcceptance of the performance can be seen as waiving the right to claim breach of contract. If the buyer accepted and paid for what was delivered, they might be estopped from claiming breach.\n\nC. Recover, because the manufacturer failed to perform his contractual obligation.\n\nThis is true; the manufacturer didn't deliver all 500 widgets. But does that necessarily mean the buyer can recover damages? Maybe not, if the failure is minor.\n\nD. Recover, because the manufacturer's failure to deliver the additional widgets resulted in a material breach.\n\nThis seems similar to C, but it emphasizes that the breach is material. If the breach is material, then the buyer can likely recover damages.\n\nI think the key here is to determine whether the manufacturer's failure to deliver 10 widgets constitutes a material breach.\n\nIn contract law, a material breach allows the non-breaching party to cancel the contract and sue for damages. A minor breach might only allow for damages proportional to the breach.\n\nGiven that only 10 out of 500 widgets weren't delivered, that's 2%. In many contracts, such a small shortfall might be considered a minor breach, especially if the buyer accepted and paid for the delivered widgets.\n\nHowever, if the buyer can prove that this shortfall caused significant loss or inconvenience, it could be material.\n\nBut in the absence of such specifics, I think the most likely scenario is that this is a minor breach, and the buyer has already accepted the performance by taking and paying for the 490 widgets.\n\nTherefore, options A and B seem more plausible than C and D.\n\nBetween A and B, A mentions substantial performance, which seems applicable here, as 490 out of 500 is pretty close.\n\nOption B focuses on the acceptance of the delivered widgets.\n\nI think both A and B could be correct, but perhaps A is slightly more accurate because it refers to the manufacturer's performance being substantial.\n\nSo, I would go with A: not recover, because under the circumstances, the manufacturer substantially performed.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the manufacturer substantially performed, and the buyer accepted the performance, then it's unlikely the buyer can recover for the small shortfall.\n\nMoreover, the buyer paid for the 490 widgets, which further suggests acceptance of the performance as it was.\n\nTherefore, the buyer will most likely not recover.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A}} \\]"
