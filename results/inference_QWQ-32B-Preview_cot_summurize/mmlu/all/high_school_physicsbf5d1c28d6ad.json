                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this projectile motion problem. The question is: at what angle to the horizontal should an ideal projectile be launched so that its horizontal displacement (the range) is equal to its maximum vertical displacement?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. \\(\\sin^{-1}(1/g)\\)\n\nB. \\(\\cos^{-1}(1/g)\\)\n\nC. 45\u00b0\n\nD. \\(\\tan^{-1}4\\)\n\nFirst, I need to recall the equations for the range and the maximum height of a projectile.\n\nFor a projectile launched with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal, the range \\(R\\) is given by:\n\n\\[R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g}\\]\n\nAnd the maximum height \\(H\\) is:\n\n\\[H = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{2g}\\]\n\nBut in this problem, it's not about range equaling maximum height; it's about range equaling the maximum vertical displacement. I think maximum vertical displacement is the same as maximum height, so \\(H\\).\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Vertical displacement maximum would be when the projectile reaches its peak, which is indeed the maximum height. So, \\(R = H\\).\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n\\[\\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{2g}\\]\n\nI can cancel \\(v_0^2\\) and \\(g\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\\sin(2\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin^2(\\theta)}{2}\\]\n\nHmm, I know that \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta)\\), so substituting that in:\n\n\\[2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin^2(\\theta)}{2}\\]\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n\\[4 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin^2(\\theta)\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) (assuming \\(\\sin(\\theta) \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[4 \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta)\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\):\n\n\\[4 = \\tan(\\theta)\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\tan(\\theta) = 4\\), which means \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(4)\\).\n\nLooking back at the options, D is \\(\\tan^{-1}4\\), which matches my answer.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if maximum vertical displacement is indeed the maximum height. In projectile motion, the maximum vertical displacement is reached at the apex of the trajectory, which is the maximum height. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlso, I assumed that the projectile is launched on a flat surface, so the range is the horizontal distance from the launch point to the landing point.\n\nIs there any other consideration I should make? Like air resistance or something, but the problem says \"ideal projectile,\" so no air resistance, and we can ignore effects like spin.\n\nMoreover, the problem doesn't specify the initial velocity, but since it cancels out in the equation, that's fine.\n\nI think my reasoning is solid, and the answer should be D, \\(\\tan^{-1}4\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\tan^{-1}4} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
