I need to choose the one that best defines what a block grant is.\n\nFirst, I should remember what a block grant is. From what I recall, a block grant is a type of funding that the federal government gives to state or local governments. It's meant to support a broad category of programs or services, and it usually comes with fewer restrictions than other types of grants.\n\nOption A says: \"Money provided to individuals to fund research projects.\" Hmm, that sounds more like a grant that might go directly to researchers, maybe from a foundation or a government agency, but it's not specifically about block grants. Block grants are typically given to governments, not individuals.\n\nOption B: \"Funds with few restrictions that are provided to state or local governments for general purpose use.\" This seems pretty close to what I remember about block grants. They give flexibility to the recipient governments to use the funds as they see fit within a general area.\n\nOption C: \"Funds distributed among states according to a set formula.\" This could be related to block grants, as often the amount each state receives is determined by a formula, but this description is a bit too general. It doesn't specify the purpose or the flexibility in use.\n\nOption D: \"Money that can only be used for a specific purpose.\" This sounds more like a categorical grant, where the federal government dictates exactly how the funds should be used. Block grants are known for having more general guidelines.\n\nComparing these options, Option B seems to best describe a block grant because it mentions funds with few restrictions given to state or local governments for general purpose use. It captures both the flexibility and the recipient of the funds.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should think about why the other options aren't as good. Option A is about individuals and research, which isn't related to block grants. Option C is about distribution based on a formula, but it doesn't specify the flexibility in use that characterizes block grants. Option D is the opposite of a block grant, as it refers to funds with specific purposes.\n\nSo, I think Option B is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
