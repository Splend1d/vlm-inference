                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which Democrat lost to Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential elections. The options are Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale, Gary Hart, and Jimmy Carter.\n\nFirst, I know that Ronald Reagan was the Republican president during the 1980s. He was re-elected in 1984, so I need to find out who his Democratic opponent was that year.\n\nI think Michael Dukakis ran against George H.W. Bush in 1988, not in 1984. So that might not be the right one.\n\nWalter Mondale, I seem to recall, ran against Reagan in 1984. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nGary Hart was prominent around that time, but I don't think he ran against Reagan in 1984.\n\nJimmy Carter was the Democratic president before Reagan, but he didn't run against Reagan in 1984. He actually ran again in 1980 but lost to Reagan that year.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I should eliminate the options I'm fairly sure about.\n\nMichael Dukakis, as I recall, was the Democratic nominee in 1988, not 1984. So that probably rules out option A.\n\nJimmy Carter, after losing to Reagan in 1980, didn't run again in 1984. He tried in some primaries but didn't get the nomination. So option D is likely not the answer.\n\nGary Hart was rising in the Democratic party around that time, but I don't think he was the nominee in 1984. So option C might be incorrect.\n\nThat leaves Walter Mondale. I believe he did run against Reagan in 1984. I think he was the Democratic nominee that year.\n\nTo confirm, let me recall some history. In 1980, Jimmy Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan. Then, in 1984, Reagan was running for re-election. The Democratic party had a primary process, and Walter Mondale, who was the vice president under Carter, ended up being the nominee.\n\nMondale chose Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate, which was a big deal because she was the first woman on a major party's national ticket.\n\nThe 1984 election was a landslide victory for Reagan. Mondale only won his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that the correct answer is B. Walter Mondale.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check the other options.\n\nMichael Dukakis, as I thought, was the Democratic nominee in 1988, where he lost to George H.W. Bush.\n\nGary Hart was a candidate in the 1984 Democratic primaries but didn't win the nomination. He ran again in 1988 but dropped out due to a scandal.\n\nJimmy Carter, as mentioned, lost to Reagan in 1980 and didn't seek the presidency again in 1984, although he did consider it and even entered a few primaries.\n\nTherefore, the Democrat who lost to Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential elections was indeed Walter Mondale.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
