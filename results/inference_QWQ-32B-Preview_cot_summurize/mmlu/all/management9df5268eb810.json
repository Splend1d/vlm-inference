Each stage represents a different phase that groups go through as they develop and work together.\n\nSo, the question is asking about reaching consensus as a group, and it's asking which term Tuckman uses for that. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Storming - I think storming is the stage where conflicts arise, and group members express their opinions and ideas, which can lead to disagreements. It's kind of a turbulent phase where the group is figuring out their roles and how to work together.\n\nB. Performing - This sounds like the stage where the group is functioning smoothly and effectively. They've established their norms and processes, and they're able to work together efficiently to achieve their goals.\n\nC. Forming - This is probably the initial stage where the group is just coming together. Members are getting to know each other, understanding the group's purpose, and starting to form relationships.\n\nD. Norming - Hmm, norming seems like it could be related to establishing norms and standards within the group. That might be when the group agrees on how they'll operate, make decisions, and handle conflicts.\n\nReaching consensus sounds a lot like agreeing on how the group will function and what behaviors are expected. That seems most closely related to norming.\n\nLet me double-check. In the norming stage, the group works on establishing rules, roles, and expectations. They build trust and resolve conflicts, which leads to a more cohesive group. Consensus would be a key part of this stage as the group agrees on these norms.\n\nPerforming, on the other hand, is when the group is fully functional and working effectively, having already reached consensus in the norming stage.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D. Norming.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
