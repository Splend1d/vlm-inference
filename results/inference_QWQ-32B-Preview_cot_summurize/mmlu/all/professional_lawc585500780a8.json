                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a bunch of property transactions, and I need to figure out what the dancer should do in terms of a title search. There are multiple conveyances and recordings involved, and I need to make sure I understand the chain of title properly.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, on February 1st, a retiree conveys his farm to an artist, and the artist records this conveyance. So, at this point, the artist has title to the property, and it's recorded.\n\nNext, on February 2nd, the artist conveys the property to a bartender, but the bartender doesn't record her deed. So, the bartender now has title, but it's not recorded yet.\n\nThen, on February 4th, the artist executes another identical conveyance of the farm to a caterer. The caterer gives the artist a check for $100,000 and records the conveyance, even though he knows about the previous conveyance to the bartender. So now, the caterer has recorded his deed, but the bartender's deed is still not recorded.\n\nAfter that, the bartender records her deed on February 6th.\n\nThen, the caterer conveys his interest in the farm to a dancer for $115,000, and the dancer records the deed on February 5th.\n\nNow, the dancer is conducting a title search to verify the chain of title. The question is, which indices should he look into?\n\nLet's recall that in recording statutes, like the Race-Notice statute, the first party to record a deed is the one who gets priority, provided they are without notice of prior unrecorded interests.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Grantor Index under the caterer's name to ascertain if the caterer acquired title.\n\nB. Grantee Index under the caterer's name only.\n\nC. Grantee Index under the caterer's name, then the Grantor Index under the caterer's name, and then in the Grantee Index again, this time under the artist's name to discover if he acquired title.\n\nD. Grantee Index under the bartender's name, then to the Grantor Index, also under the bartender's name to find out if she made any prior conveyances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these indices shows:\n\n- Grantee Index: This lists deeds where the person is the recipient of title.\n\n- Grantor Index: This lists deeds where the person is the giver of title.\n\nSo, if the dancer wants to verify his own title, he should look in the Grantee Index under his own name to confirm that his deed is recorded. But since the question is about pursuing the investigation to understand the chain of title, perhaps he needs to look beyond his own deed.\n\nOption A suggests looking in the Grantor Index under the caterer's name to see if the caterer acquired title. Wait, the caterer is the one who conveyed the property to the dancer, so looking in the Grantor Index under the caterer's name would show that the caterer conveyed the property to the dancer. But to see if the caterer acquired title, the dancer might need to look in the Grantee Index under the caterer's name to see if the caterer received the property from someone else.\n\nOption B suggests looking only in the Grantee Index under the caterer's name. This would show if the caterer received the property from someone else, which is relevant.\n\nOption C is more comprehensive: Grantee Index under the caterer's name to see who conveyed the property to the caterer, then Grantor Index under the caterer's name to see if he conveyed it to anyone else, and then Grantee Index under the artist's name to see if the artist acquired title.\n\nOption D suggests looking in the Grantee Index under the bartender's name and then the Grantor Index under the bartender's name.\n\nGiven that the dancer purchased the property from the caterer, his primary concern is to verify that the caterer had the right to convey the property to him. So, he needs to ensure that the caterer acquired title properly.\n\nTherefore, starting with the Grantee Index under the caterer's name would make sense, to see from whom the caterer received the property.\n\nFrom there, he might want to check the Grantor Index under that person's name to see if they had the right to convey the property to the caterer.\n\nIn this case, the caterer acquired the property from the artist, so looking in the Grantee Index under the caterer's name should show the deed from the artist to the caterer.\n\nThen, to verify the artist's title, the dancer might look in the Grantee Index under the artist's name to see where the artist acquired the property.\n\nThe artist acquired it from the retiree on February 1st, which was recorded.\n\nBut there are complications because the artist also conveyed the property to the bartender on February 2nd, but the bartender didn't record until February 6th, and the caterer recorded his deed on February 4th, even though he had knowledge of the bartender's conveyance.\n\nThe dancer purchased from the caterer on February 5th and recorded on February 5th.\n\nGiven that recordings are date-stamped, and assuming the recording office is accurate, the sequence of recordings would be:\n\n- February 1: Retiree to artist (recorded)\n\n- February 4: Artist to caterer (recorded)\n\n- February 5: Caterer to dancer (recorded)\n\n- February 6: Artist to bartender (recorded)\n\nNow, under a Race-Notice statute, the first to record has priority, provided they have no notice of prior unrecorded interests.\n\nThe caterer had actual knowledge of the conveyance to the bartender, so even though he recorded first, his interest might be subordinate to the bartender's if the bartender records later.\n\nHowever, the dancer purchased from the caterer on February 5th, recording on the same day, without notice of the bartender's conveyance.\n\nSo, the dancer is a subsequent purchaser without notice.\n\nIn this scenario, the bartender recorded on February 6th.\n\nUnder Race-Notice, since the dancer recorded before the bartender, and had no notice of the bartender's interest, the dancer should have priority over the bartender.\n\nBut to be thorough, the dancer should check the chain of title to ensure there are no prior unrecorded interests.\n\nTherefore, looking in the Grantee Index under his own name to confirm his deed, then looking in the Grantor Index under the caterer's name to see if he conveyed to anyone else after the dancer, and then looking in the Grantee Index under the caterer's name to see where he acquired the property from, which would be the artist.\n\nThen, looking in the Grantor Index under the artist's name to see if he conveyed the property to anyone else.\n\nThis would help the dancer understand if there are any conflicting interests.\n\nOption C seems to align with this approach: Grantee under caterer, then Grantor under caterer, then Grantee under artist.\n\nOption D focuses on the bartender, which might not be the immediate concern for the dancer, unless there's specific notice or suspicion about the bartender's interest.\n\nGiven that, Option C appears to be the most appropriate course of action for the dancer's title search.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
