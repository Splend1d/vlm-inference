The expression given is:\n\n(9x^9 + 7x^8 + 4x^7) + (x^11 + x^9 + 2x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8)\n\nFirst, I need to remove the parentheses and combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same power of x.\n\nSo, let's write down all the terms together:\n\n9x^9 + 7x^8 + 4x^7 + x^11 + x^9 + 2x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\n\nNow, I should group the like terms together. Let's list them by their powers of x:\n\n- x^11: there's only one term with x^11, which is x^11.\n\n- x^9: there are two terms with x^9, which are 9x^9 and x^9.\n\n- x^8: there's only one term with x^8, which is 7x^8.\n\n- x^7: there are two terms with x^7, which are 4x^7 and 2x^7.\n\n- x^3: there's only one term with x^3, which is 3x^3.\n\n- x: there's only one term with x, which is 5x.\n\n- Constant term: there's only one constant term, which is 8.\n\nNow, let's add the coefficients of the like terms:\n\n- x^11: 1x^11 = x^11\n\n- x^9: 9x^9 + x^9 = (9 + 1)x^9 = 10x^9\n\n- x^8: 7x^8 = 7x^8\n\n- x^7: 4x^7 + 2x^7 = (4 + 2)x^7 = 6x^7\n\n- x^3: 3x^3 = 3x^3\n\n- x: 5x = 5x\n\n- Constant term: 8 = 8\n\nNow, let's put all these terms together in decreasing order of their degrees:\n\nx^11 + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\nx^11 + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. x^{11} + 2x^9 + 2x^8\n\nB. x^{11} - 6x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\n\nC. x^11 + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 3x^3 + 5x + 8\n\nD. x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\n\nOption D matches our simplified expression.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8} \\]"
