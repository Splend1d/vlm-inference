                    "text": "Let's think about this problem step by step. So, we have a solid melting, and we need to determine the expected entropy and enthalpy changes from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what entropy and enthalpy represent. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, and enthalpy is a measure of the total heat content of a system.\n\nWhen a solid melts, it turns into a liquid. Generally, liquids are more disordered than solids because the particles in a liquid can move around more freely compared to those in a solid, which are more rigidly structured.\n\nSo, considering entropy, since the liquid state is more disordered than the solid state, the entropy should increase during melting. That means the entropy change (\u0394S) should be positive.\n\nNow, what about enthalpy? Melting a solid typically requires an input of heat, meaning that the system absorbs heat from its surroundings. In terms of enthalpy, which is the heat content, this would mean that the enthalpy of the system increases. Therefore, the enthalpy change (\u0394H) should also be positive.\n\nLet me double-check this. Melting is an endothermic process, which means it absorbs heat. So, \u0394H is positive. And since the system becomes more disordered, \u0394S is positive.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change\n\nB. negative entropy change and a negative enthalpy change\n\nC. negative entropy change and positive enthalpy change\n\nD. negative enthalpy change and positive entropy change\n\nBased on my reasoning, option A seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption B: negative entropy change and negative enthalpy change. This would suggest that melting decreases disorder and releases heat, which contradicts what we know about melting.\n\nOption C: negative entropy change and positive enthalpy change. This suggests that melting decreases disorder but absorbs heat. Again, this doesn't align with our understanding of melting.\n\nOption D: negative enthalpy change and positive entropy change. This would mean that melting releases heat and increases disorder. While it's true that disorder increases, melting actually absorbs heat, so enthalpy change should be positive, not negative.\n\nTherefore, the only logically consistent option is A: positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change.\n\nI think that makes sense. Of course, in some specific cases, there might be exceptions, but in general, for most solids melting into liquids, this should hold true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
