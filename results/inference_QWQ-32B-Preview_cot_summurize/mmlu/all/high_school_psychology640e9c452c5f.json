Now, we need to figure out which theory best explains this change in her perception of happiness.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Relative deprivation: This theory suggests that people feel deprived when they compare themselves to others who have more or better circumstances. So, if Tamika sees people who have less than her, she might feel better about her own situation because she's comparing herself to them.\n\nB. Adaptation-level: This theory proposes that people have a baseline level of happiness or satisfaction, and they adapt to changes in their circumstances, but over time, they return to that baseline. So, if Tamika had a bad day and felt unhappy, but then something positive happens, she might feel better temporarily, but eventually, she'd go back to her usual level of happiness.\n\nC. Yerkes-Dodson arousal: This is about the relationship between arousal and performance. It suggests that there's an optimal level of arousal for peak performance, and too little or too much arousal can impair performance. This seems unrelated to Tamika's situation.\n\nD. Diathesis-stress: This theory is about how genetic and environmental factors interact to influence whether someone develops a mental disorder. It doesn't seem directly relevant to Tamika's change in perception about her happiness.\n\nOkay, so between A and B, which one makes more sense here?\n\nRelative deprivation seems plausible because Tamika is comparing her situation to that of the homeless people she's serving, and realizing that she has more, which makes her feel happier.\n\nAdaptation-level might suggest that she'll eventually return to her usual level of happiness, but the scenario focuses on her current increased happiness after the volunteer experience.\n\nGiven that, relative deprivation seems more directly applicable because it explicitly deals with comparisons to others, which seems to be the key factor in Tamika's change of heart.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is A. Relative deprivation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
