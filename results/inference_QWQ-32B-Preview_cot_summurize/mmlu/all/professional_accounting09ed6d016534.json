                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules for members of an issuer\u2019s audit committee. The question is: \"According to the SEC, members of an issuer\u2019s audit committee may not...\" and then it gives four options. I need to figure out which one of these options is something that audit committee members are prohibited from doing according to the SEC.\n\nFirst, I should understand what an audit committee is. It's a part of the board of directors that oversees the financial reporting process, the audit of the financial statements, and the company's internal control system. The SEC has rules in place to ensure that audit committees are independent and effective in their oversight role.\n\nOption A says: \"Establish procedures for employees to anonymously report fraud.\" Hmm, that seems like something an audit committee should be doing. In fact, I think they are required to establish such procedures to encourage whistleblowing and to help detect any fraud or misconduct within the company. So, I don't think they may not do this; I think they are required to do it.\n\nOption B says: \"Be responsible for the compensation of any registered public accounting firm employed by the registrant to provide an audit report.\" Let's break this down. The audit committee is responsible for hiring and compensating the external auditors, right? That makes sense because they need to ensure that the auditors are independent and that there are no conflicts of interest. So, being responsible for the compensation of the auditors is likely within their purview. Therefore, I don't think this is something they may not do; it's probably something they are supposed to do.\n\nOption C says: \"Accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the registrant for services other than as a member of the board.\" This one sounds interesting. It's talking about whether audit committee members can accept fees for services beyond their board membership. Well, audit committee members need to be independent, and accepting additional compensation from the company could potentially compromise their independence. So, maybe the SEC has rules prohibiting audit committee members from accepting such fees.\n\nOption D says: \"Engage independent counsel as deemed necessary to carry out their duties.\" This seems like something an audit committee should be able to do. If they need legal advice to fulfill their responsibilities, it makes sense that they can hire independent counsel. So, I don't think this is something they may not do; it's probably something they are allowed and perhaps even encouraged to do.\n\nBased on this initial thoughts, option C seems like the most plausible answer. But I should double-check to make sure.\n\nLet me look up some SEC rules regarding audit committees. According to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which is enforced by the SEC, there are specific requirements for audit committees. For instance, section 301 of Sarbanes-Oxley sets forth the requirements for audit committees, including their responsibilities and the qualifications of their members.\n\nOne key aspect is the independence of audit committee members. The SEC has rules that require audit committee members to be independent directors, meaning they cannot have any relationship with the company that would impair their judgment. This includes not accepting any compensation from the company other than their board fees.\n\nSo, option C aligns with this requirement. Audit committee members should not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the registrant beyond their board membership fees, as this could compromise their independence.\n\nLet me verify options A, B, and D to confirm.\n\nOption A: Establishing procedures for employees to anonymously report fraud is actually a requirement for audit committees. According to SEC rules, audit committees are required to establish procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the issuer regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, and the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.\n\nSo, not only may they establish such procedures, but they are required to do so.\n\nOption B: Being responsible for the compensation of the external auditors is also a standard responsibility of the audit committee. The audit committee is responsible for selecting, compensating, and overseeing the work of the independent auditors. This ensures that the auditors are independent and that there are no conflicts of interest.\n\nOption D: Engaging independent counsel is something that audit committees often do when necessary to fulfill their duties, especially in matters involving legal compliance or investigations. The SEC would likely support the audit committee's ability to engage independent counsel as needed.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, only option C represents something that audit committee members may not do, according to SEC rules, due to independence requirements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
