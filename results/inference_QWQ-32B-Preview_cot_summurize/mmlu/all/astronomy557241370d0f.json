                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the second most common element in the solar system is. The options are iron, hydrogen, methane, and helium. I think I need to recall some basic facts about the composition of the solar system.\n\nFirst, I know that the solar system is made up mostly of stars and planets, and that the Sun is the largest object in it. I remember that the Sun is a star and it's made mostly of hydrogen and helium. In fact, hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, so it's probably the most common in the solar system too.\n\nSo, if hydrogen is the most common, what's the second most common? I think helium is next. I recall that after hydrogen, helium is the second most abundant element in the universe, produced during the Big Bang. So, probably, in the solar system, helium would be the second most common element.\n\nLet me check the options again. A is iron, which is common in planets with cores, like Earth, but probably not as abundant as helium throughout the entire solar system. B is hydrogen, which I think is the most abundant, so that's probably not the answer. C is methane, which is a compound, not an element, so that can't be right. D is helium, which I think is the second most common.\n\nWait a minute, methane is not an element; it's a molecule made of carbon and hydrogen. So, option C is incorrect because it's not an element.\n\nBetween iron and helium, I think helium is more abundant in the solar system. Iron is common in planets, but helium is abundant in the Sun and in gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nSo, my answer is D, helium.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
