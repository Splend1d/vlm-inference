                    "text": "Let's see. So, we're talking about using both expansionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy at the same time. I need to figure out what happens when both of these are used together.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each policy does individually.\n\nExpansionary fiscal policy means that the government increases spending and/or cuts taxes. This is done to stimulate the economy, increase aggregate demand, and boost economic activity.\n\nExpansionary monetary policy, on the other hand, involves the central bank increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates, and making credit more available. This is also aimed at stimulating the economy by making borrowing cheaper and encouraging investment and consumption.\n\nSo, when both of these are used together, it should have a significant impact on the economy.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Unemployment will increase.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right. Both expansionary fiscal and monetary policies are designed to boost economic activity, which should lead to job creation and lower unemployment, not higher.\n\nB. Real GDP will decrease.\n\nAgain, this seems counterintuitive. Expansionary policies are meant to increase economic output, which would mean real GDP should rise, not decrease.\n\nC. Interest rates will remain relatively constant.\n\nNow, this is interesting. Normally, expansionary monetary policy lowers interest rates, while expansionary fiscal policy can increase them, because the government is borrowing more, which can lead to higher interest rates.\n\nSo, when both are used together, the effects on interest rates might offset each other, leading to relatively constant interest rates.\n\nD. Inflation will decrease dramatically.\n\nThis also doesn't seem right. Both expansionary fiscal and monetary policies can lead to increased inflation, because they increase the money supply and aggregate demand. So, using both together would likely lead to higher inflation, not a decrease.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about this more carefully.\n\nLet's consider the effects step by step.\n\nFirst, expansionary fiscal policy: government spends more or cuts taxes, which increases aggregate demand. This can lead to higher real GDP and lower unemployment, but also potentially higher inflation.\n\nSecond, expansionary monetary policy: central bank increases money supply, lowers interest rates, which also increases aggregate demand, leading to similar effects: higher real GDP, lower unemployment, and higher inflation.\n\nSo, combined, they should have a magnified effect on increasing real GDP and decreasing unemployment, but also increasing inflation.\n\nBut option C says interest rates will remain relatively constant. Is that possible?\n\nWell, as I thought earlier, expansionary fiscal policy can lead to higher interest rates because the government is borrowing more, which increases the demand for loanable funds. At the same time, expansionary monetary policy increases the supply of money, which tends to lower interest rates.\n\nSo, these two effects might offset each other, resulting in interest rates staying relatively constant.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps, if both policies are used together, the increase in aggregate demand could be so strong that it leads to higher real GDP and lower unemployment, without necessarily causing higher inflation if the economy has a lot of slack.\n\nBut that might be stretching it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the combination of both policies could lead to hyperinflation, but that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, option D says inflation will decrease dramatically, which is the opposite of what I'd expect.\n\nSo, perhaps in some models, if you have both policies expanding, it could lead to a situation where the economy grows faster, increasing production capacity, and actually decreasing inflation, but that seems unlikely in the short run.\n\nI think the most plausible answer is C: interest rates will remain relatively constant, because the opposing effects of fiscal and monetary policy on interest rates cancel each other out.\n\nLet me see if there's any other factor I'm missing.\n\nMaybe the impact on unemployment and GDP is stronger than the interest rate effects, but the question is specifically about which of these statements is true.\n\nGiven that A and B are contrary to what I expect from expansionary policies, and D is also contrary, I think C is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret this.\n\nPerhaps, if both policies are used together, they could lead to such a strong stimulus that the economy reaches full capacity quickly, and after that, any further increases in demand would just lead to inflation without boosting GDP, but that's not directly related to interest rates.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the IS-LM model.\n\nIn the IS-LM model, expansionary fiscal policy shifts the IS curve to the right, leading to higher interest rates and higher income. Expansionary monetary policy shifts the LM curve to the right, leading to lower interest rates and higher income.\n\nSo, when both are used together, the effects on income are additive, leading to a higher level of income, while the effects on interest rates offset each other, leading to relatively constant interest rates.\n\nThat seems consistent with option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some versions of the model, the interest rate effect doesn't completely offset, but in general, it's possible that interest rates remain relatively constant.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: interest rates will remain relatively constant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
