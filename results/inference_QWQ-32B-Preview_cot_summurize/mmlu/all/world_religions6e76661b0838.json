                    "text": "I'm going to take a shot at this question about the Oral Torah. So, the Oral Torah is like the oral tradition of Jewish teachings that complement the written Torah. It's not literally written in the Torah texts themselves but was passed down through generations by word of mouth.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the written form of the Oral Torah. That means at some point, this oral tradition was compiled and written down. I need to recall which of these options\u2014Mishnah, Midrash, Tanakh, or Pentateuch\u2014is the one that represents the written version of the Oral Torah.\n\nLet me think about the Mishnah first. I remember that the Mishnah is a central text in Rabbinic Judaism, and it was compiled by Rabbi Judah the Prince around 200 CE. It's basically a code of Jewish law and customs, and it's considered the first major written redaction of the Oral Torah. So, that sounds promising.\n\nNext, Midrash. Midrash is a genre of rabbinic literature containing interpretations and stories that expound on the Hebrew Bible. It's more about explanations and homilies rather than a codification of laws. So, while it's part of the Oral Torah, it seems more like a collection of interpretations rather than the core written form of the Oral Torah.\n\nThen there's Tanakh, which is the Hebrew Bible, composed of the Torah (Pentateuch), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings). This is the written Torah, not the oral one. So, that can't be the answer.\n\nLastly, the Pentateuch, which is the first five books of the Tanakh: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Again, this is the written Torah, not the oral traditions.\n\nSo, comparing these options, the Mishnah seems to be the most accurate answer. It's the written compilation of the Oral Torah, specifically focusing on the legal and ritual aspects of Jewish life.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's another text that could fit this description. For example, the Talmud is another major text that includes the Mishnah and the Gemara, which are rabbinic commentaries on the Mishnah. However, the Talmud is not listed as an option here.\n\nAlso, the Midrash, as I thought earlier, is more about interpretations and stories, so it's not the primary written form of the Oral Torah.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is A. Mishnah.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
