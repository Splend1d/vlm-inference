He's planning to create a Book class with various attributes like author, title, and whether it's on the shelf or not. Also, he's thinking of having operations for getting and setting these attributes. Then there's another class called LibraryList which will handle an array of Book objects and have methods to list all books, add a book, remove a book, and search for a book.\n\nNow, the programmer intends to work on the Book class first and then move on to the LibraryList class. The question is, what programming approach is he using by doing this? The options are:\n\nA. top-down development\n\nB. bottom-up development\n\nC. procedural abstraction\n\nD. information hiding\n\nHmm, let's see what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, top-down development. I think this is where you start with a high-level view of the system and break it down into smaller parts step by step. So, you start with the big picture and work your way down to the details.\n\nBottom-up development, on the other hand, is when you start with the basic components and build up to the higher-level systems. So, you start with the foundations and build upwards.\n\nProcedural abstraction is about defining procedures or functions that perform specific tasks, and you can call them without knowing the details of how they work inside.\n\nInformation hiding is a principle where you hide the internal details of a component and only expose a minimal interface for interaction.\n\nIn this scenario, the programmer is starting with the Book class, which seems like a basic building block, and then moving on to the LibraryList class, which will use multiple Book objects. So, it looks like he's building up from the\u57fa\u7840 components to higher-level structures.\n\nThat sounds a lot like bottom-up development, where you start with the basics and build upwards.\n\nBut wait, top-down development is about starting with the high-level design and breaking it down into smaller parts. In this case, maybe the high-level design is the library system, and breaking it down into Book and LibraryList classes.\n\nBut the programmer is choosing to implement the Book class first, which is a lower-level component, before moving on to LibraryList, which is higher-level.\n\nSo, is this bottom-up because he's starting with the smaller parts and building up, or top-down because he's designing from the top and implementing the lower-level parts first?\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nLet me think differently. In top-down development, you might design the overall system architecture first, including how different components interact, and then delve into the details of each component.\n\nIn bottom-up development, you might start by implementing the most basic components and then gradually combine them to build more complex systems.\n\nIn this scenario, the programmer is focusing on implementing the Book class first, which is a fundamental component, and then moving on to LibraryList, which depends on Book.\n\nThis seems consistent with bottom-up development, where you build from the ground up.\n\nProcedural abstraction doesn't seem directly relevant here, as it's more about defining procedures, which is a different concept.\n\nInformation hiding is about encapsulation, which might be a principle applied within the Book and LibraryList classes, but it doesn't describe the order in which the classes are implemented.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. bottom-up development.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider what top-down development would look like in this context.\n\nIf the programmer were doing top-down development, he might start by implementing the LibraryList class first, defining how it interacts with Book objects, and then later implement the details of the Book class.\n\nBut in this case, he's doing the opposite: implementing the Book class first, and then the LibraryList class.\n\nSo, yes, starting with the smaller, more fundamental component before moving to higher-level components is characteristic of bottom-up development.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. bottom-up development.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
