Let's see what he's saying here.\n\nHe mentions that for one society to achieve global hegemony, it would need to greatly increase its productivity. This boost in productivity had to happen before the scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions that shaped the post-quantum-leap world. So, it's like he's talking about a society that managed to make a big leap forward in productivity earlier than others, and this was crucial for achieving global dominance.\n\nHe also says that this increase in productivity could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. And he specifically points to Western Europe as doing this through brutality, guns, and geographical and ecological luck.\n\nOkay, so he's talking about Western Europe achieving global hegemony by exploiting other continents. The time period is 1450 to 1750 C.E., which covers the Age of Exploration and early colonial period.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India.\n\nB. The beginning of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nC. The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans.\n\nD. The increasing development of seafaring technologies.\n\nFirst, option A: direct trade links between Western Europe and India. This did happen during this period, with the Portuguese establishing trade routes around Africa to India. But is this what Crosby is responding to? He's talking about exploiting whole continents, not just establishing trade links. So, maybe not the primary focus here.\n\nOption B: the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Well, the Industrial Revolution really picked up steam in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, which is after the period mentioned (1750 C.E.). So, perhaps he's referring to the groundwork that led to the Industrial Revolution, but it's not the central development of 1450-1750.\n\nOption C: the colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans. This fits perfectly with what Crosby is saying. Western Europeans did colonize the Americas during this period, exploiting their resources and populations to boost their own productivity and power.\n\nOption D: the increasing development of seafaring technologies. This is certainly a key part of the Age of Exploration, which allowed Western Europeans to reach and exploit other continents. But again, Crosby seems to be focusing on the exploitation of these continents rather than the technological developments that enabled it.\n\nSo, considering Crosby's emphasis on exploiting whole continents for resources and human assets, it seems most directly related to the colonization of the Americas. Therefore, I think the answer is C.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any reason to think it might be another option?\n\nOption A, trade links with India, is important, but it's more about trade than full-scale colonization and exploitation of entire continents.\n\nOption B, the Industrial Revolution, comes later, so it might be a result of the developments Crosby is discussing, but not the development itself within the specified period.\n\nOption D, seafaring technologies, is certainly crucial for the Age of Exploration, but again, it's the exploitation of the lands reached by these technologies that Crosby seems to be emphasizing.\n\nTherefore, colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans seems to be the most fitting answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
