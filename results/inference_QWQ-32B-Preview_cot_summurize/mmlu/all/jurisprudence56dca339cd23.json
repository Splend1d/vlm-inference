                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Cicero's idea of natural law, and he says that \"true law is right reason in agreement with Nature.\" Okay, so reason is really important here. Now, the question is asking why reason is a key element in his conception of natural law, and it gives a few options.\n\nOption A says, \"It is a sin for humans not to apply reason.\" Hmm, that sounds like maybe he thinks using reason is morally obligatory or something. But I'm not sure if that directly relates to the basis of natural law.\n\nOption B says, \"The principles of natural law are discoverable by reason.\" That seems plausible. If natural law is based on right reason in agreement with nature, then maybe it's through reason that we can uncover these natural laws.\n\nOption C says, \"Natural law does not apply without good reason.\" This one is a bit confusing. Does it mean that natural law only applies if there's a good reason behind it? I'm not sure about that.\n\nOption D says, \"The law of nature is the basis of all positive law.\" Well, that seems related but maybe not directly answering why reason is a key element.\n\nLet me think about this again. Cicero says that true law is right reason in agreement with nature. So, it seems like he's placing a lot of weight on reason being aligned with nature. Maybe natural law is what reason tells us is in accordance with nature.\n\nOption B mentions that the principles of natural law are discoverable by reason. That makes sense because if natural law is based on right reason, then we should be able to use our reasoning abilities to understand what those laws are.\n\nOption A says it's a sin not to apply reason. Maybe Cicero thought that, but I'm not sure if that's directly related to the basis of natural law. Perhaps he thought using reason was important, but I need to see how it connects to the concept of natural law.\n\nOption C says natural law doesn't apply without good reason. I'm not sure what that means exactly. Does it mean that natural law only applies if there's a justified or rational basis for it? That seems a bit circular.\n\nOption D says that the law of nature is the basis of all positive law. Well, that might be true, but it doesn't specifically explain why reason is a key element in Cicero's conception.\n\nI think Option B is the best answer because it directly connects reason to the discovery of natural law principles. If natural law is based on right reason in agreement with nature, then it follows that we use our reasoning abilities to understand what those natural laws are.\n\nLet me see if there's more to this. Maybe I should look up some quotes from Cicero to confirm.\n\nOkay, Cicero said, \"True law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting; it summons to duty by its commands, and averts from wrongdoing by its prohibitions... It is a sin to try to alter this law, nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal any part of it, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. We cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people, and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it. And there will not be different laws at Rome and at Athens, or different laws now and in the future, but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all times, and there will be one master and ruler, that is, God, over us all, for he is the author of this law, its promulgator, and its enforcing judge. Whoever is disobedient is fleeing from himself and denying his human nature, and by reason of this very fact he will suffer the worst penalties.\"\n\nFrom this, it's clear that natural law is universal, unchangeable, and comes from God. It's also evident that Cicero believes that we don't need external expounders or interpreters; we can understand it through ourselves. This reinforces the idea that reason is the tool we use to grasp these natural laws.\n\nSo, Option B seems to be the most accurate because it highlights that natural law principles are discoverable by reason. Cicero believed that by using our rational faculties, we can understand the natural law that is inherent and universal.\n\nOption A might be related in that Cicero perhaps thought it was wrong not to use reason, but I don't think that's the core of his natural law conception.\n\nOption C is unclear to me. It seems to suggest that natural law isn't applicable without a good reason, which doesn't align with Cicero's view that natural law is universal and unchangeable.\n\nOption D is probably true in the sense that natural law should inform positive law, but it doesn't specifically address why reason is a key element in Cicero's thought.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is Option B: \"The principles of natural law are discoverable by reason.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
