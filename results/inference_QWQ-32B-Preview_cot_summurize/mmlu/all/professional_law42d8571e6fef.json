So, here's what happened:\n\n- There's a landlord who owns a two-story house and leases it fully furnished to a tenant for 10 years.\n\n- Two years into this lease, the tenant subleases the house to his cousin.\n\n- Then, the cousin doesn't pay the rent, so the landlord wants to sue the cousin to get the past due rent.\n\nThe question is, will the landlord be able to recover the past rent from the cousin? And we have four options to choose from, each talking about something called \"privity of estate\" and \"privity of contract.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"privity of estate\" and \"privity of contract\" mean.\n\nPrivity of contract is when there's a direct agreement or contract between two parties. Privity of estate is when there's a relationship through ownership or occupancy of the same property.\n\nIn this case, the landlord leased the house to the tenant for 10 years. So, there's a lease agreement between the landlord and the tenant\u2014that's privity of contract. The tenant then subleases the house to his cousin. So, now there's another lease agreement between the tenant and the cousin.\n\nBut the landlord didn't directly enter into any agreement with the cousin; it's through the tenant.\n\nNow, the cousin defaults on the rental payments. The landlord wants to sue the cousin to recover the past due rent.\n\nOption A says the landlord will recover because privity of estate exists between the landlord and the sublessee.\n\nOption B says the landlord will recover because there's privity of contract between the landlord and the sublessee.\n\nOption C says the landlord will recover because there's both privity of estate and privity of contract between the landlord and the sublessee.\n\nOption D says the landlord will not recover because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and the sublessee.\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nLet me think about privity of estate first. Privity of estate occurs when two parties have an interest in the same estate or property, especially if their interests are successive, like landlord and tenant.\n\nIn this case, the landlord has an interest in the property through the original lease to the tenant. The tenant then subleases to the cousin, so the cousin also has an interest in the property, but through the tenant, not directly through the landlord.\n\nSo, is there privity of estate between the landlord and the cousin? I think not directly. The privity of estate is between the landlord and the tenant, and between the tenant and the cousin.\n\nSimilarly, privity of contract is directly between the parties that signed the contract. The landlord has a contract with the tenant, and the tenant has a contract with the cousin. But there's no direct contract between the landlord and the cousin.\n\nSo, typically, in law, privity of contract and privity of estate are necessary to enforce contractual rights.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the landlord doesn't have direct privity of contract or privity of estate with the cousin.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the landlord cannot sue the cousin directly for the rent.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's an exception or something I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between all parties.\n\nThe landlord leased the property to the tenant for 10 years. The tenant then subleased it to the cousin.\n\nSo, the tenant is still the primary lessee to the landlord, right? Meaning, even if the tenant subleases to someone else, the tenant is still responsible for the rent to the landlord.\n\nSo, if the cousin doesn't pay the tenant, the tenant is still on the hook to pay the landlord.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the landlord should sue the tenant for the rent, not the cousin.\n\nBut the question is, can the landlord sue the cousin directly?\n\nI think generally, no, because there's no privity of contract or privity of estate between the landlord and the cousin.\n\nSo, option D seems correct: the landlord will not recover because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and the sublessee.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way around this.\n\nIs there any legal doctrine that allows a landlord to go after a sublessee directly?\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe something about piercing the veil or agency, but that seems stretchy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if the sublease was assigned back to the landlord or something like that.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems like the landlord doesn't have a direct relationship with the cousin.\n\nTherefore, the landlord can't sue the cousin directly for rent.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: not recover, because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and sublessee.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any way the landlord could recover from the cousin.\n\nPerhaps if the sublease was with the landlord's consent and the landlord accepted payments from the cousin, there might be some implied relationship.\n\nBut in this case, it doesn't mention anything like that.\n\nIt just says the tenant subleases to the cousin, and the cousin defaults on rental payments.\n\nSo, no indication of the landlord's involvement in the sublease beyond perhaps giving consent, which is standard.\n\nTherefore, sticking with option D seems appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
