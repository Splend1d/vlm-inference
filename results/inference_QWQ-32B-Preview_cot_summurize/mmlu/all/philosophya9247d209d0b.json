Rule-utilitarianism based on the actual rules of society.\n\nC. Rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules.\n\nD. Kant\u2019s ethics.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these terms means.\n\nAct-utilitarianism is a theory that suggests that the rightness of an action is determined by whether it maximizes utility in that specific instance. So, for each action, you assess whether it brings about the greatest happiness for the greatest number.\n\nRule-utilitarianism, on the other hand, proposes that actions are right if they conform to rules that, when generally followed, produce the greatest utility. There are different versions of rule-utilitarianism, depending on what rules are considered.\n\nOption B specifies rule-utilitarianism based on the actual rules of society. This would mean that the rules in question are those that are already in place in a society.\n\nOption C is rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules. This suggests that the rules are not necessarily the ones currently in society but rather the ones that would, if followed, lead to the greatest overall utility.\n\nKant\u2019s ethics, in contrast, is deontological, focusing on duties and rules that are universally applicable, regardless of the consequences.\n\nNow, regarding John Stuart Mill, he is well-known for his version of utilitarianism. From what I remember, Mill endorses a form of utilitarianism that considers the consequences of actions in terms of happiness and suffering.\n\nI think Mill is often associated with act-utilitarianism because he emphasizes the principle of utility applied directly to individual actions. However, some interpretations suggest that Mill also considers rules and general principles.\n\nI should look back at some of Mill's writings to confirm. In \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill discusses the role of rules in guiding conduct, but he ultimately seems to ground the rightness of actions in their consequences.\n\nBrandt, in his work, distinguishes between act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism. He argues that rule-utilitarianism is more defensible because it takes into account the difficulties of applying act-utilitarianism in real-life situations.\n\nGiven that, if Brandt is comparing Mill's view to these options, I need to see which one aligns best with Mill's position.\n\nMill seems to advocate for a form of utilitarianism where the moral rightness of an action is determined by its contribution to overall happiness. However, he also recognizes the importance of rules and habits in guiding moral behavior.\n\nIn \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill writes about the need for secondary principles that are generally useful for promoting utility, but he emphasizes that in exceptional cases, these rules can be overridden if adherence to them would not maximize utility.\n\nThis sounds a bit like rule-utilitarianism, where rules are followed because they usually lead to good outcomes, but can be departed from in specific instances where breaking the rule would result in better consequences.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about Brandt's view on Mill's position.\n\nI recall that Brandt argues for rule-utilitarianism, suggesting that we should follow rules that, if generally obeyed, would lead to better consequences than if we acted on a case-by-case basis.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Brandt sees Mill's view as akin to rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules.\n\nOption C specifies \"ideal moral rules.\" This would suggest that the rules in question are not necessarily the current rules of society but rather the rules that would, if followed, lead to the best overall consequences.\n\nComparatively, option B is based on actual rules of society, which might not necessarily be the most utility-producing rules.\n\nTherefore, if Brandt is interpreting Mill as advocating for rules that are based on what would ideally promote the greatest happiness, then option C would be the best choice.\n\nAlternatively, if Brandt sees Mill as more of an act-utilitarian, then option A would be more appropriate.\n\nBut considering Mill's discussion of the importance of rules and the impracticality of always calculating the consequences of every action, it seems that Brandt might align Mill more with rule-utilitarianism.\n\nFurthermore, Mill himself discusses the need for moral rules that are exceptions to, but generally in line with, the principle of utility.\n\nTherefore, I think the most accurate answer is C: a rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules.\n\nThis suggests that Mill endorses a system where moral rules are derived from what would ideally promote the greatest happiness, even if those rules aren't perfectly aligned with existing social rules.\n\nOption D, Kant\u2019s ethics, is clearly different from Mill's utilitarianism, so that can be ruled out.\n\nIn conclusion, according to Brandt, John Stuart Mill\u2019s view most closely resembles a rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
