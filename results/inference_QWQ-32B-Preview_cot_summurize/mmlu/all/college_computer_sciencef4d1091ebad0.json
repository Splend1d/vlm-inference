                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about interrupts, and I need to choose the correct statement from the options given. Interrupts are a fundamental concept in computer architecture, and they play a crucial role in how computers handle various events and operations.\n\nOption A says: \"They are generated when memory cycles are 'stolen'.\" I'm not entirely sure what is meant by \"memory cycles are stolen.\" Maybe it's referring to direct memory access (DMA), where peripheral devices access memory directly without involving the CPU. In DMA, the CPU's access to memory is temporarily suspended, which could be perceived as memory cycles being \"stolen.\" Interrupts are indeed related to DMA operations because when a DMA transfer is complete, an interrupt is generated to notify the CPU. So, perhaps there's some truth to this option.\n\nOption B states: \"They are used in place of data channels.\" I need to recall what data channels are. In older computer systems, data channels were specialized hardware that managed data transfer between main memory and I/O devices. Interrupts, on the other hand, are a way for the CPU to be notified that an event has occurred and to temporarily stop its current task to handle the interrupt. It seems like interrupts and data channels serve different purposes. Interrupts can be used in conjunction with data channels, but they aren't typically used as a replacement. So, this option might not be accurate.\n\nOption C says: \"They can indicate completion of an I/O operation.\" This sounds familiar. One of the primary uses of interrupts is to signal the completion of I/O operations. For example, when data is ready to be read from a disk or when data has been successfully written, an interrupt is generated to inform the CPU so that it can take appropriate action, such as updating buffers or moving on to the next task. This seems like a correct statement about interrupts.\n\nOption D states: \"They cannot be generated by arithmetic operations.\" I need to think about whether arithmetic operations can generate interrupts. In many computer systems, certain arithmetic operations can lead to exceptions or traps, which are handled similarly to interrupts. For instance, division by zero is an arithmetic operation that typically causes an interrupt to handle the error condition. Therefore, it seems that arithmetic operations can indeed generate interrupts, which would make this statement false.\n\nConsidering all the options, it seems that option C is the most accurate statement about interrupts. Options A and D seem less precise, and option B appears to be incorrect. However, to be thorough, let's revisit option A.\n\nUpon further reflection, \"memory cycles being stolen\" likely refers to DMA operations, as I initially thought. In DMA, the CPU is indeed temporarily denied access to the memory bus while the DMA controller transfers data directly to or from memory. After the transfer is complete, an interrupt is generated to notify the CPU. So, in that sense, interrupts are generated following such \"stolen\" memory cycles. Therefore, option A could also be considered correct.\n\nBut comparing options A and C, option C is more directly and universally true about interrupts. While option A is specific to DMA operations, which is one context where interrupts are used, option C encompasses a broader range of I/O operations that can generate interrupts, not just those involving DMA.\n\nMoreover, considering that arithmetic operations can generate interrupts, as in option D, it's clear that interrupts have multiple sources, including I/O completion and arithmetic exceptions.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and comprehensive statement from the given options is option C: \"They can indicate completion of an I/O operation.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
