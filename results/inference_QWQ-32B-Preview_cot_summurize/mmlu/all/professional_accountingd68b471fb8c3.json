                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about how the city of Cobb should report its two trust funds, trust fund A and trust fund B. The options are related to how these funds are classified in financial reporting, specifically whether they are permanent or special revenue funds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between permanent funds and special revenue funds.\n\nPermanent funds are those in which both the principal and income are intended to be kept intact. The principal is usually invested, and only the income or earnings from that principal can be used. These funds are typically used for specific purposes as determined by the governing body.\n\nSpecial revenue funds, on the other hand, are used to account for revenues that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specific purposes other than debt service or capital projects. Both the principal and income in these funds can be expended for their designated purposes.\n\nNow, looking at trust fund A: \"Only the earnings from trust fund A can be expended, and both the principal and interest from trust fund B can be expended.\"\n\nThis description of trust fund A sounds like a permanent fund because only the earnings (interest) can be spent, while the principal must be preserved.\n\nTrust fund B allows both the principal and interest to be expended. This sounds more like a special revenue fund since there are no restrictions on using the principal.\n\nSo, based on this understanding:\n\nTrust fund A: Permanent\n\nTrust fund B: Special revenue\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Permanent Permanent\n\nB. Permanent Special revenue\n\nC. Special revenue Permanent\n\nD. Special revenue Special revenue\n\nOption B matches our classification: Trust fund A as Permanent and Trust fund B as Special revenue.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIs there any chance that trust fund A could be a special revenue fund? Well, special revenue funds allow both principal and interest to be expended, but in this case, only the earnings from trust fund A can be expended. That aligns more with a permanent fund.\n\nSimilarly, trust fund B allows both principal and interest to be expended, which is consistent with a special revenue fund.\n\nAnother angle to consider: perhaps trust fund B is a permanent fund because it has both principal and interest expendable, but actually, in permanent funds, only the income is expendable. Wait, no, in permanent funds, the principal is to be kept intact, and only the income can be used. So trust fund B, which allows expenditure of both principal and interest, doesn't fit the permanent fund definition.\n\nTherefore, my initial thought seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe trust fund A is a permanent fund, and trust fund B is also a permanent fund, but with different expenditure rules. However, the question clearly states that only the earnings from trust fund A can be expended, and both principal and interest from trust fund B can be expended.\n\nGiven that, option A (both permanent) wouldn't make sense because trust fund B allows expenditure of the principal, which isn't allowed in permanent funds.\n\nOption C has trust fund A as special revenue and trust fund B as permanent, which is the opposite of what we think.\n\nOption D has both as special revenue, but trust fund A only allows expenditure of earnings, which is more in line with a permanent fund.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the correct classification: Trust fund A as permanent and trust fund B as special revenue.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
