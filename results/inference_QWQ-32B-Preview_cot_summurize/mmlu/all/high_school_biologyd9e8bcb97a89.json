                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Lysenko and his ideas on wheat. It says he thought that if he exposed winter wheat plants to colder temperatures, over time they would become more tolerant to cold. And it's asking which scientist's ideas his attempts most agree with. The options are Cuvier, Hutton, Lamarck, and Darwin.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who these scientists are and what they're known for.\n\nCuvier was a French naturalist and zoologist who is known for his work in comparative anatomy and the classification of animals. He's also associated with the concept of catastrophism in geology, which suggests that the Earth has been shaped by sudden, catastrophic events.\n\nHutton was a Scottish geologist who is often considered the father of modern geology. He proposed the theory of uniformitarianism, which suggests that the Earth's features are the result of gradual, ongoing processes rather than sudden catastrophes.\n\nLamarck was a French biologist who is best known for his theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, which suggests that organisms can pass on traits they've acquired during their lifetime to their offspring.\n\nDarwin, of course, is famous for his theory of evolution by natural selection. He proposed that species evolve over generations through the process of natural selection, where traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction are passed on to offspring.\n\nNow, Lysenko believed that by exposing wheat to colder temperatures, they would become more cold-tolerant. This sounds a lot like Lamarck's idea that organisms can acquire traits during their lifetime and pass them on to their offspring. In Lamarck's theory, if an organism develops a certain trait in response to its environment, that trait can be inherited by its offspring.\n\nIn contrast, Darwin's theory of natural selection doesn't involve the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Instead, it's based on the idea that there is variation within a population, and those individuals with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring.\n\nCuvier and Hutton don't seem directly related to this concept. Cuvier's catastrophism is about geological events, and Hutton's uniformitarianism is about gradual geological processes. Neither of these relates to the inheritance of acquired characteristics.\n\nSo, it seems like Lysenko's ideas align most closely with Lamarck's theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics.\n\nBut I should double-check. Lysenko's approach was to expose plants to colder temperatures, expecting that this would make them more cold-tolerant, and that this trait would be passed on to their offspring. This is precisely what Lamarck proposed: that organisms can adapt to their environment and pass those adaptations to their progeny.\n\nDarwin's theory, on the other hand, wouldn't support the idea that exposing plants to cold would directly cause them to become more cold-tolerant in a way that's inherited. Instead, Darwin would suggest that there might be variation in cold tolerance within the population, and those plants that are already more cold-tolerant would be more likely to survive and reproduce in colder conditions, leading to a gradual increase in cold tolerance over generations.\n\nBut Lysenko was specifically trying to induce changes in the plants by exposing them to cold, expecting those changes to be inherited, which is Lamarckian inheritance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Lamarck.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
