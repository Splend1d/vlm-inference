                    "text": "To determine which group of corporations qualifies as an affiliated group and may join in filing a consolidated federal income tax return, we need to understand the rules for forming an affiliated group under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nAn affiliated group consists of a parent corporation and its subsidiaries, where the parent owns more than 50% of the voting stock of each subsidiary. Additionally, all members of the group must be connected through a chain of ownership, meaning that each corporation in the group is connected to at least one other member through stock ownership.\n\nGiven the information:\n\n- Rigg is a calendar-year C corporation with only voting common stock outstanding.\n\n- Rigg owns 85% of Steele and 40% of Urco.\n\n- Steele owns 50% of Urco.\n\nLet's map out the ownership structure:\n\n1. Rigg owns 85% of Steele.\n\n2. Steele owns 50% of Urco.\n\n3. Rigg also owns 40% of Urco directly.\n\nFirst, we need to determine if there is a parent-subsidiary relationship that can form an affiliated group.\n\n- Rigg owns 85% of Steele, which is more than 50%, so Steele is a subsidiary of Rigg.\n\n- Steele owns 50% of Urco, which is less than 50%, so Urco is not a subsidiary of Steele.\n\nHowever, Rigg also owns 40% of Urco directly. So, Rigg's total ownership in Urco is:\n\n- Direct ownership: 40%\n\n- Indirect ownership through Steele: 85% of Steele's 50% ownership in Urco.\n\nIndirect ownership calculation:\n\n85% (Rigg's ownership in Steele) * 50% (Steele's ownership in Urco) = 42.5%\n\nTotal ownership of Urco by Rigg:\n\nDirect: 40% + Indirect: 42.5% = 82.5%\n\nSince Rigg owns 82.5% of Urco through direct and indirect ownership, which is more than 50%, Urco is also a subsidiary of Rigg.\n\nTherefore, both Steele and Urco are subsidiaries of Rigg, and they are connected through Rigg's ownership.\n\nThus, Rigg, Steele, and Urco form an affiliated group.\n\nHowever, we need to confirm if all members are connected through a chain of ownership.\n\n- Rigg owns Steele and Urco.\n\n- Steele owns part of Urco.\n\nThis forms a connected group.\n\nTherefore, the group consisting of Rigg, Steele, and Urco qualifies as an affiliated group and may file a consolidated federal income tax return.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Rigg and Urco.\n\nB. Urco and Steele.\n\nC. Rigg, Steele, and Urco.\n\nD. An affiliated group does not exist.\n\nOption C is the correct choice because it includes all members of the affiliated group.\n\nOption A (Rigg and Urco) is incomplete because Steele is also part of the group.\n\nOption B (Urco and Steele) is missing Rigg, the parent corporation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because an affiliated group does exist.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Rigg, Steele, and Urco.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
