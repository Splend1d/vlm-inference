                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about finding which speech aligns most closely with Woodrow Wilson's declaration from 1914. Wilson is talking about maintaining neutrality during a war, specifically mentioning that people in the U.S. should not take part directly or indirectly in the wars and should remain at peace with all belligerents. He emphasizes the importance of impartial neutrality.\n\nSo, I need to look at the options and see which one shares similar sentiments or ideas.\n\nOption A is Washington's Farewell Address. I remember that in his farewell address, George Washington warned against permanent alliances with foreign nations and advised the U.S. to maintain independence and neutrality in foreign affairs. That sounds pretty similar to what Wilson is saying here about neutrality and not taking sides in wars.\n\nOption B is George H. W. Bush's \"A Thousand Points of Light\" speech. I think that was about encouraging volunteerism and community service. That seems different from Wilson's focus on neutrality in war.\n\nOption C is Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. That's about unity and honoring those who fought and died in the Civil War. It's about preserving the nation and the government of the people, by the people, for the people. While it's about war, it's not about neutrality; it's about being engaged in a war to preserve the Union.\n\nOption D is Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"Day of Infamy\" speech. That's the speech he gave after the attack on Pearl Harbor, declaring war on Japan. It's about entering into war, not about maintaining neutrality.\n\nSo, comparing these, Washington's Farewell Address is the one that talks about neutrality and avoiding entanglement in foreign wars, which aligns with Wilson's declaration.\n\nMoreover, Wilson was known for his idealistic foreign policy, including his Fourteen Points and his advocacy for the League of Nations, but in 1914, when this declaration was made, the U.S. was indeed trying to maintain neutrality in World War I, which started that year.\n\nWashington's Farewell Address set a tone for U.S. foreign policy, emphasizing neutrality and avoiding perpetual alliances, which was a guiding principle for quite some time, including up to World War I.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A, Washington's Farewell Address.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
