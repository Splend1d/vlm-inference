Let's explore the options provided to determine the most accurate answer.\n\nOption A suggests that attachment begins in the hours immediately following birth. While it's true that newborns begin to recognize and prefer their primary caregivers soon after birth, the formation of a secure attachment is a process that unfolds over time. Newborns do show preferences for their mother's voice and scent, which can be observed shortly after birth, but full-fledged attachment is more complex.\n\nOption B proposes that attachment starts several weeks after birth. This is a more plausible timeframe because, during the first few weeks, infants begin to develop a stronger bond with their caregivers through repeated interactions, feeding, and comforting. Caregivers learn to read their baby's cues, and the baby starts to associate the caregiver with comfort and safety.\n\nOption C suggests that attachment begins several months after birth. While attachment continues to deepen and evolve over the first year and beyond, saying that it begins several months after birth might be too late. Research indicates that the foundations of attachment are laid down much earlier.\n\nOption D states that attachment starts when the child learns to speak. This seems unlikely because attachment is primarily an emotional bond that develops through non-verbal interactions. Children form attachments long before they acquire language skills.\n\nConsidering these points, option B\u2014several weeks after birth\u2014appears to be the most accurate answer. During this period, infants and caregivers engage in a dance of interaction that lays the groundwork for a secure attachment. However, it's essential to note that the process is ongoing and continues to develop and strengthen over time.\n\nTo further understand this, let's look at some key milestones in attachment development:\n\n- **Birth to 2 months:** Newborns show preferences for familiar faces and voices but do not yet have a differentiated attachment.\n\n- **2 to 7 months:** Babies begin to show preferences for primary caregivers and may become upset when the caregiver leaves but can often be comforted by others.\n\n- **7 to 24 months:** This is the period when secure attachment typically forms. Babies seek proximity to the caregiver for comfort and exploration, and they respond positively to the caregiver's presence.\n\n- **2 years and beyond:** Attachment continues to influence the child's social and emotional development, shaping their expectations of relationships and their ability to form connections with others.\n\nIn conclusion, while the seeds of attachment are planted immediately after birth, the actual formation of attachment begins several weeks into the infant's life as the bond between the caregiver and the infant deepens through consistent and responsive interactions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
