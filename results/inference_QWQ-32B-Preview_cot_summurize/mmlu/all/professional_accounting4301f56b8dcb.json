Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A: Cutoff bank statement for deposits recorded in the books but not by the bank. Hmm, this seems more related to cash and bank reconciliations. Unrecorded liabilities are about obligations that the company hasn't yet recorded in their books, so this might not be directly related.\n\nOption B: Details of accounts receivable confirmations that are classified as \"exceptions.\" Accounts receivable are assets, not liabilities. So, examining exceptions in accounts receivable might help verify the existence of receivables, but it doesn't directly relate to unrecorded liabilities.\n\nOption C: Files of purchase requisitions for items ordered just before the year-end. This could be relevant because if items were ordered before the year-end but not yet received or recorded, there might be a liability for those items. Purchases made but not yet recorded could lead to unrecorded liabilities, especially if they were received after the year-end.\n\nOption D: Receiving reports for items received before year-end but not yet recorded. This also seems relevant. If items were received before the year-end but not recorded, the company might have a liability for those items that was not recorded in the books.\n\nBetween options C and D, I think option D is more directly related to unrecorded liabilities because receiving reports indicate that items have been received, which would typically require the company to recognize a liability for those items if they haven't been paid for yet.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D: Receiving reports for items received before year-end but not yet recorded.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nd."
