So, it seems like some kind of verification or assurance service. Let me look at the options:\n\nA. Statements on Auditing Standards - I think these are more related to financial statement audits. Maybe not directly applicable here.\n\nB. Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements - Attestation engagements sound like when a practitioner provides assurance on non-financial information, like management's assertions. This might be the right one.\n\nC. Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services - This seems more related to review engagements of financial statements, not so much for non-financial assertions.\n\nD. Statements on Standards for Consulting Services - Consulting services are more about providing advice and recommendations, not about expressing an opinion on assertions.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is B. Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements. But let me make sure.\n\nAttestation engagements are where the practitioner provides assurance on an assertion made by someone else, like management. In this case, management is asserting that the warehouse is 150,000 square feet, and the practitioner is expressing an opinion on that assertion.\n\nStatements on Auditing Standards, option A, are indeed for auditing financial statements, which isn't directly relevant here.\n\nStatements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services, option C, deal with review engagements of financial statements, again not matching the scenario.\n\nStatements on Standards for Consulting Services, option D, are for when practitioners provide consulting services, which is different from providing assurance on an assertion.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the most appropriate source of professional guidance for this situation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nB\n"
