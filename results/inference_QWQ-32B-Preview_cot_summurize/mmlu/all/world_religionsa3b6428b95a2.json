                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which Buddhist thinker is particularly known for the theme of self-sacrifice. The options are Thich Nhat Hanh, The Dalai Lama, Daisetsu T. Suzuki, and Shaku Soyen. I'm not entirely sure about this, so I'll need to think carefully.\n\nFirst, I know that Thich Nhat Hanh is a Vietnamese monk who is famous for his teachings on mindfulness and peace. He's been very involved in peace activism, especially during the Vietnam War. His approach emphasizes compassion and nonviolent communication. While self-sacrifice might be implied in his activist work, it's not the central theme I associate with him.\n\nNext, The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism. He's known for his teachings on compassion, kindness, and his peaceful approach to dealing with the Chinese occupation of Tibet. He often talks about the importance of caring for others and sometimes refers to the idea of taking on others' suffering, which sounds a bit like self-sacrifice. But I'm not sure if that's his main theme.\n\nDaisetsu T. Suzuki was a Japanese scholar who played a crucial role in introducing Zen Buddhism to the Western world. He wrote extensively on Zen and its philosophy. While his work is profound, I don't immediately associate him with the theme of self-sacrifice. He's more known for explaining Zen concepts and practices.\n\nFinally, Shaku Soyen was a Japanese Zen priest who lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was a teacher to D.T. Suzuki and is known for his role in bringing Zen to the West. I don't know much about his specific teachings, but perhaps he emphasized self-sacrifice in his practice.\n\nLet me consider the concept of self-sacrifice in Buddhism more generally. In Mahayana Buddhism, there's the idea of the Bodhisattva, who delays their own enlightenment to help others achieve liberation. This seems like a form of self-sacrifice. So, maybe the answer is The Dalai Lama, as he's a high-ranking figure in Mahayana Buddhism.\n\nAlternatively, Thich Nhat Hanh is also influenced by Mahayana traditions, particularly Zen and Pure Land, so he might also emphasize self-sacrifice in his teachings.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that The Dalai Lama often talks about taking on others' suffering, a practice known as \"Tonglen\" in Tibetan Buddhism. This practice involves breathing in others' pain and suffering and breathing out peace and happiness. It's a form of self-sacrifice because you're willingly taking on negativity to alleviate others' suffering.\n\nAlso, The Dalai Lama himself has sacrificed a lot; he's exiled from his homeland, Tibet, and has dedicated his life to the well-being of others.\n\nComparatively, Thich Nhat Hanh is also known for his selfless work for peace, but again, his main themes are mindfulness and peace.\n\nD.T. Suzuki focused more on explaining Zen philosophy, and Shaku Soyen was more of a traditional Zen teacher.\n\nGiven this, I think The Dalai Lama is the Buddhist thinker most associated with the theme of self-sacrifice.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up some quotes or teachings from each of them to see who emphasizes self-sacrifice the most.\n\nStarting with The Dalai Lama, I remember he often talks about the importance of compassion and taking on others' suffering. In his book \"The Art of Happiness,\" he discusses how developing compassion can lead to true happiness, even in the face of personal sacrifice.\n\nThich Nhat Hanh, in his book \"Being Peace,\" talks about the interconnectedness of all beings and how practicing mindfulness can help us see that our happiness is tied to the happiness of others. While there's an element of self-sacrifice in that, it's more about harmony and peace.\n\nD.T. Suzuki's works are more about understanding Zen meditation and the nature of the mind. He doesn't seem to focus as much on self-sacrifice.\n\nShaku Soyen, being a Zen teacher, likely emphasized zazen and the direct experience of enlightenment, but again, not specifically self-sacrifice.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge and a bit of research, I would say that The Dalai Lama is the Buddhist thinker most closely associated with the theme of self-sacrifice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
