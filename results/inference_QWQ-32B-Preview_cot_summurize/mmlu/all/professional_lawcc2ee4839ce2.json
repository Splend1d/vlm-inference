                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a wealthy man who passed away in a car accident, and now there's a woman claiming to be his daughter. She's filing a claim against his estate, and her mom used to work as his secretary. At trial, her attorney wants to call the wealthy man's butler to testify about some things he allegedly said and common knowledge in the household.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's at stake here. The woman is trying to prove that she's the daughter of this wealthy man, which would likely give her some rights to his estate, especially if she's a legitimate heir. Now, the butler is being called to testify about two main things: first, that it was common knowledge in the household that the wealthy man and the woman's mother were having an affair, and second, that the wealthy man told the butler that the woman was his daughter shortly after her birth.\n\nThe attorney for the executor of the estate is objecting to this testimony. So, we need to figure out whether the court will sustain the objection or overrule it. The options provided suggest that this has to do with evidence rules, specifically hearsay and possibly a dead man's statute.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nOption A says the court will sustain the objection because the butler's testimony would be violative of the hearsay rule. Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, if the butler is testifying about something the wealthy man said outside of court, and it's being used to prove that the woman is his daughter, that could be hearsay.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule, so we need to see if this testimony fits into any exception.\n\nOption B suggests sustaining the objection because of a dead man's statute. Dead man's statutes vary by jurisdiction, but generally, they prevent certain parties from testifying about communications with a deceased person when the testimony is against the deceased's interests. The purpose is to prevent fraud or perjury since the deceased can't cross-examine or defend themselves.\n\nIn this case, the woman is claiming to be the daughter, and the butler is testifying about statements the wealthy man made regarding that. This could potentially be barred by a dead man's statute, as it's testimony about communications with the deceased regarding the claim against his estate.\n\nOption C says the court will overrule the objection because the butler's testimony is relevant to the ultimate issue in the case. Relevance is important, but even relevant evidence can be excluded if it doesn't meet other evidentiary requirements, like not being hearsay or not being barred by a statute.\n\nOption D suggests overruling the objection because the testimony qualifies under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule. The pedigree exception allows for certain statements about family relationships to be admitted as evidence, often statements made by family members about their own relationships.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, statements about one's own familial relationships can be admissible under the hearsay exception for statements of family history or pedigree.\n\nGiven these options, let's think about which one is most likely correct.\n\nFirst, regarding hearsay: the butler is testifying about something the wealthy man said outside of court, specifically that the woman is his daughter. If this testimony is being offered to prove that the woman is indeed the daughter, then it's being used to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which would make it hearsay.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule, and one of them is the pedigree exception, which allows for statements about family relationships to be admitted.\n\nOption D mentions this exception, so that could be a reason for the court to overrule the objection.\n\nBut we also have to consider the dead man's statute. If there's a dead man's statute in place, it might bar the butler from testifying about communications with the deceased regarding matters at issue in the litigation.\n\nThis could complicate things because even if the statement falls under a hearsay exception, the dead man's statute might still bar the testimony.\n\nGiven that, option B seems plausible as well.\n\nHowever, pedigree exceptions are often carved out in laws and rules precisely to allow for proof of family relationships, which are crucial in inheritance cases.\n\nSo, there might be an exception to the dead man's statute for such statements.\n\nAdditionally, the butler is also testifying about common knowledge in the household, which might be considered independent of the deceased's statements.\n\nBut to answer the question, we need to determine what the court is most likely to do upon objection.\n\nGiven that, I think the court would likely overrule the objection because the butler's testimony is relevant and falls under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might not be as strong.\n\nOption A suggests sustaining the objection based on hearsay, but as we've considered, there's an exception for pedigree statements.\n\nOption B mentions the dead man's statute, which could apply, but again, pedigree exceptions might override that in this context.\n\nOption C is broad and doesn't specify the reason for overruling the objection, whereas option D provides a specific reason related to evidence rules.\n\nHence, option D is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
