                    "text": "To determine which pair of substances can be used to make a buffer solution, we need to recall that a buffer solution typically consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid. Let's analyze each option step by step.\n\nOption A: NaCl and HCl\n\n- NaCl is sodium chloride, which is a salt that dissociates into Na+ and Cl- ions. Cl- is the conjugate base of a strong acid (HCl), so it doesn't affect the pH significantly.\n\n- HCl is a strong acid.\n\n- Together, they do not form a buffer because there's no weak acid-base pair.\n\nOption B: HC2H3O2 and KC2H3O2\n\n- HC2H3O2 is acetic acid, which is a weak acid.\n\n- KC2H3O2 is potassium acetate, which dissociates into K+ and C2H3O2- ions. C2H3O2- is the conjugate base of acetic acid.\n\n- This pair consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base, which is a classic buffer combination.\n\nOption C: NaBr and KBr\n\n- NaBr is sodium bromide, and KBr is potassium bromide. Both are salts of a strong base (NaOH, KOH) and a strong acid (HBr), so their ions do not affect the pH.\n\n- There is no weak acid or weak base here, so they cannot form a buffer.\n\nOption D: HIO3 and KClO3\n\n- HIO3 is iodic acid, which is a weak acid.\n\n- KClO3 is potassium chlorate, which dissociates into K+ and ClO3- ions. ClO3- is the conjugate base of HClO3, which is a strong acid.\n\n- Although HIO3 is a weak acid, its conjugate base is IO3-, not ClO3-. Therefore, this pair does not consist of a weak acid and its conjugate base.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct choice is Option B: HC2H3O2 and KC2H3O2, as they form a buffer solution by combining a weak acid with its conjugate base.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
