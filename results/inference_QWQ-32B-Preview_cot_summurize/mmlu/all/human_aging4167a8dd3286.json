The term \"social network\" generally refers to all the people who are connected to us through various relationships, such as friends, acquaintances, colleagues, and family members. It's like a web of connections that we have in our lives. So, it includes everyone we know, not just those who are closest to us or only family members. And while social networks can also include people we haven't met yet, especially in the context of online platforms, the core idea is about the connections we have with others we know. So, option A seems the most comprehensive and accurate."
