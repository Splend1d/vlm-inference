                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a collision between two particles. One has a mass of 2m and the other has a mass of m, and they're in a one-dimensional collision. The particle with mass m is at rest, and the one with mass 2m is moving towards it. After the collision, they stick together, which means it's a perfectly inelastic collision. I need to find out what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in this collision.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall the principles of conservation of momentum and energy in collisions. In any collision, momentum is always conserved, but kinetic energy is only conserved in elastic collisions. Since this is a perfectly inelastic collision, kinetic energy is not conserved, and some of it is lost, usually as heat or deformation energy.\n\nSo, let's set up the problem. Let's denote:\n\n- The mass of the first particle: \\( m_1 = 2m \\)\n\n- The mass of the second particle: \\( m_2 = m \\)\n\n- Initial velocity of the first particle: \\( u_1 \\)\n\n- Initial velocity of the second particle: \\( u_2 = 0 \\) (since it's at rest)\n\nAfter the collision, they stick together, so their final velocity is the same, let's call it \\( v \\).\n\nFirst, I'll apply the conservation of momentum:\n\n\\[ m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ 2m \\cdot u_1 + m \\cdot 0 = (2m + m) v \\]\n\n\\[ 2m u_1 = 3m v \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{2m u_1}{3m} = \\frac{2}{3} u_1 \\]\n\nSo, the final velocity after the collision is \\( \\frac{2}{3} u_1 \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the initial kinetic energy and the final kinetic energy, and then find the fraction of kinetic energy lost.\n\nInitial kinetic energy (\\( KE_{\\text{initial}} \\)):\n\nOnly the first particle is moving, so:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (2m) u_1^2 = m u_1^2 \\]\n\nFinal kinetic energy (\\( KE_{\\text{final}} \\)):\n\nBoth particles are moving together with velocity \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ KE_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (3m) \\left( \\frac{2}{3} u_1 \\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ KE_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{3}{2} m \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} u_1^2 = \\frac{3 \\times 4}{2 \\times 9} m u_1^2 = \\frac{12}{18} m u_1^2 = \\frac{2}{3} m u_1^2 \\]\n\nNow, the kinetic energy lost (\\( \\Delta KE \\)) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta KE = KE_{\\text{initial}} - KE_{\\text{final}} = m u_1^2 - \\frac{2}{3} m u_1^2 = \\frac{1}{3} m u_1^2 \\]\n\nTo find the fraction of the initial kinetic energy that is lost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Fraction lost} = \\frac{\\Delta KE}{KE_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} m u_1^2}{m u_1^2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nSo, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 1/4\n\nC. 1/3\n\nD. 1/2\n\nThe correct answer is C. 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that in some cases, the fraction lost might be different. Maybe I should double-check my calculations.\n\nLet me verify the conservation of momentum again:\n\n\\[ m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v \\]\n\n\\[ 2m \\cdot u_1 + m \\cdot 0 = 3m \\cdot v \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{2}{3} u_1 \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, initial kinetic energy:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2m \\cdot u_1^2 = m u_1^2 \\]\n\nFinal kinetic energy:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3m \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{3} u_1 \\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{2} m \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} u_1^2 = \\frac{12}{18} m u_1^2 = \\frac{2}{3} m u_1^2 \\]\n\nEnergy lost:\n\n\\[ \\Delta KE = m u_1^2 - \\frac{2}{3} m u_1^2 = \\frac{1}{3} m u_1^2 \\]\n\nFraction lost:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} m u_1^2}{m u_1^2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nIt seems consistent. Maybe I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of coefficient of restitution (e), but since it's a perfectly inelastic collision, e = 0, which is already accounted for by the fact that the objects stick together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of relative velocity, but in this case, since they stick together, the relative velocity after the collision is zero.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the ratio of final kinetic energy to initial kinetic energy.\n\n\\[ \\frac{KE_{\\text{final}}}{KE_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} m u_1^2}{m u_1^2} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nSo, the kinetic energy is reduced to \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of its initial value, meaning \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) is lost.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of velocity reduction.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy depends on \\( u_1^2 \\), and the final kinetic energy depends on \\( v^2 = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} u_1 \\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{9} u_1^2 \\).\n\nBut wait, in the final kinetic energy, it's \\( \\frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (3m) \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} u_1^2 = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} m u_1^2 = \\frac{12}{18} m u_1^2 = \\frac{2}{3} m u_1^2 \\), which again confirms the earlier result.\n\nI think this is solid. The fraction of initial kinetic energy lost is indeed \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), so the correct answer is C. 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
