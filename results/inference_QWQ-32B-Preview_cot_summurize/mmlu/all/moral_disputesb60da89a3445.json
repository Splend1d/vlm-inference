                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Aquinas's view on law. The question is: \"According to Aquinas, every law is ordained to...\" and then it gives four options: A. the truth. B. human perfection. C. the common good. D. individual happiness.\n\nI remember that Aquinas had some specific ideas about law and its purpose. I think he talked about different types of laws, like eternal law, natural law, human law, and divine law. But for this question, it's about law in general according to Aquinas.\n\nLet me think about what \"ordained to\" means. It probably means that every law is directed towards or aimed at something. So, what is that something according to Aquinas?\n\nOption A is \"the truth.\" Well, Aquinas certainly valued truth, but I'm not sure if he saw every law as ordained to the truth. Maybe in the sense that laws should be based on truth, but is that their primary purpose?\n\nOption B is \"human perfection.\" That sounds plausible. Aquinas was a theologian and philosopher who emphasized human flourishing and the ultimate end of human beings, which is union with God. Maybe he saw laws as ordained to help people achieve perfection, both morally and intellectually.\n\nOption C is \"the common good.\" This also seems likely. Aquinas lived in a time when the concept of the common good was important, and he was influenced by Aristotle, who emphasized the role of law in promoting the common good of the community.\n\nOption D is \"individual happiness.\" While happiness is important, Aquinas might see that as a personal goal, but perhaps not the primary purpose of law, which is more about the community.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look back at some of Aquinas's writings on law. In his Summa Theologica, he discusses law in great detail. Let's see what he says about the purpose of law.\n\nIn the Summa Theologica, I recall that Aquinas says that the purpose of law is to lead people to virtue and to the common good. So, both virtue and the common good are important aspects of law according to him.\n\nLooking back at the options, \"the common good\" is option C, and \"human perfection\" is option B. Virtue can be related to human perfection, as achieving virtue is part of becoming a better person.\n\nBut which one does Aquinas emphasize more? Or does he see them as interconnected?\n\nPerhaps both are correct, but I have to choose one.\n\nLet me think about the context in which Aquinas discusses law. He sees law as a guide for human actions, aiming to direct people towards their ultimate end, which is beatitude or happiness in union with God. In that sense, law is ordained to human perfection, as it helps people become virtuous and reach their highest potential.\n\nOn the other hand, since humans are social beings, their perfection is also linked to the common good of the community. So, promoting the common good is also a way of aiding individual perfection.\n\nBut if I had to choose one that is more fundamental according to Aquinas, I think it would be the common good. Because law is a social institution, it primarily serves the community, and individual perfection is achieved within that communal context.\n\nMoreover, Aquinas says that human law is a participation in natural law, which is directed towards the common good. So, perhaps the common good is the primary end of law.\n\nLet me check a specific quote from Aquinas to confirm this.\n\nIn the Summa Theologica, II-II, q. 90, a. 1, Aquinas states: \"Wherefore every human law has just so much of the nature of law, as it is derived from the law of nature. But if in any point it deflects from the law of nature, it is no longer a law but a perversion of law.\"\n\nBut that's more about the source of law rather than its purpose.\n\nLooking further, in II-II, q. 95, a. 2, he says: \"Therefore the purpose of human law is to lead men to virtue, not suddenly, but slowly: because man has to proceed gradually from imperfect to perfect virtue, even as from imperfect to perfect nature.\"\n\nSo here, he mentions that the purpose of human law is to lead men to virtue, which relates to human perfection.\n\nBut in q. 90, a. 2, he says: \"TIPUS RESPONSIonis, quia omne lex dirigetur ad bonum commune, secundum quod ordinatur ad debitum finem: sed lex quae non ordinatur ad bonum commune, sed magis ad utilitatem praesidentis, est perversio legis, according to the Philosopher (Polit. iii, 1).\"\n\nThis translates to: \"Indeed, every law is directed to the common good, insofar as it is ordered to the due end; but a law that is not ordered to the common good, but rather to the advantage of the ruler, is a perversion of law, as the Philosopher says (Politics iii, 1).\"\n\nSo, clearly, Aquinas holds that law is ordained to the common good.\n\nComparing this to human perfection, it seems that while law aims to lead people to virtue, which is part of human perfection, the primary end is the common good.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be option C, \"the common good.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider option A, \"the truth.\" While truth is important in Aquinas's philosophy, especially in the context of divine law, it doesn't seem to be the primary end of human law.\n\nOption D, \"individual happiness,\" might be a consequence of living under good laws, but again, Aquinas seems to emphasize the common good over individual happiness.\n\nOption B, \"human perfection,\" is closely related to the common good, but as seen in the quotes, Aquinas specifically states that law is ordained to the common good.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. the common good.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
