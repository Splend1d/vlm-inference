So, if someone says that a lack of evidence proves something, they're basically falling into this trap of assuming that absence of evidence is evidence of absence.\n\nLet me think about the other options to make sure.\n\nB. Double negative: That's more about language and logic, where using two negative statements can cancel each other out. For example, \"I don't have no money\" actually means \"I have money.\" But that doesn't seem related to the scenario described.\n\nC. Equivocation: This is when someone uses a word or phrase with multiple meanings in a way that causes confusion or a fallacy. For example, saying \"Feathers are light, and what's light cannot be dark, so feathers are not dark.\" Here, \"light\" has different meanings, and the argument is flawed because it switches between those meanings.\n\nD. Burden of proof: This is about who has the responsibility to provide evidence for a claim. Generally, the person making the claim has the burden of proof. So, if someone makes a claim and doesn't provide evidence, it's not acceptable to assume the claim is true just because there's no evidence against it.\n\nComparing all these, A. Appeal to ignorance seems the most fitting for the description \"a lack of evidence proves something.\" It's directly related to assuming something is true based on the lack of evidence against it, or false based on the lack of evidence for it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any other option could apply.\n\nCould burden of proof be a candidate? Well, burden of proof is about who should provide evidence, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a lack of evidence proves something. It's more about the responsibility to provide evidence.\n\nEquivocation doesn't seem to fit because it's about ambiguous language, not about evidence or lack thereof.\n\nDouble negative is about logic and language, as I mentioned earlier, and doesn't directly relate to evidence.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that A. Appeal to ignorance is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
