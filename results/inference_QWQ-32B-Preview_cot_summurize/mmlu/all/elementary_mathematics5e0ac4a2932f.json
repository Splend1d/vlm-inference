                    "text": "So I have this problem here: estimate the quotient of 117.83 divided by 5.67 using compatible numbers. And I have these options: A) about 10, B) about 20, C) about 30, or D) about 40. Hmm, I'm not super confident with compatible numbers, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what compatible numbers are. Compatible numbers are numbers that are close to the original numbers and make the calculation easier. So, I should pick numbers close to 117.83 and 5.67 that are easier to divide.\n\nLet's look at 117.83. That's pretty close to 120, right? And 5.67 is close to 6. So, maybe I can use 120 divided by 6 as my compatible numbers.\n\nNow, 120 divided by 6 is 20. So, according to this, the quotient should be about 20. That would mean option B is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are better compatible numbers to use. Maybe I can try another approach.\n\nWhat if I round 117.83 to 110 and 5.67 to 5? Then, 110 divided by 5 is 22. That's still close to 20.\n\nAlternatively, if I round 117.83 to 120 and 5.67 to 5.5, then 120 divided by 5.5 is... hmm, 120 divided by 5.5. Well, 11 divided by 5.5 is 2, so 120 divided by 5.5 would be roughly 21.81. Still around 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use fractions. 117.83 is almost 118, and 5.67 is almost 5.7. But I don't know, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving the decimal places to make the division easier. If I multiply both numbers by 100, I get 11783 divided by 567. But that seems more complicated than necessary for an estimation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the relationship between the numbers. 5.67 times what number is approximately 117.83?\n\nWell, 5 times 20 is 100, and 5 times 23 is 115, which is close to 117.83. So, again, around 20.\n\nWait, maybe I can do a quick multiplication to check. 5.67 times 20: 5 times 20 is 100, and 0.67 times 20 is 13.4, so total is 113.4. That's a bit lower than 117.83.\n\nSo, maybe 21: 5.67 times 21. 5 times 21 is 105, 0.67 times 21 is, say, 14.07, so total is about 119.07, which is a bit higher than 117.83.\n\nSo, between 20 and 21, it's pretty close. But for estimation purposes, 20 seems fair.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use division rules. I know that 117.83 divided by 5.67 can be rewritten as 11783 divided by 567, by moving the decimal places to make them whole numbers.\n\nBut for estimation, that might not help much.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 5.67 is approximately 5.5, and 117.83 is approximately 110.\n\nSo, 110 divided by 5.5 is exactly 20.\n\nAgain, that confirms the earlier estimation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use proportionality. If 5.67 times some number equals 117.83, what's that number?\n\nWell, I can set up the equation: 5.67 * x = 117.83, and solve for x.\n\nBut for estimation, that might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many times 5.67 fits into 117.83.\n\nWell, 5.67 times 10 is 56.7, which is less than 117.83.\n\n5.67 times 20 is 113.4, which is still less than 117.83.\n\n5.67 times 21 is 119.07, which is slightly more than 117.83.\n\nSo, again, around 21.\n\nBut since it's an estimation and the options are about 10, 20, 30, 40, 20 seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use division by breaking it down.\n\n117.83 divided by 5.67.\n\nFirst, I can divide 117 by 5.67.\n\nWell, 5.67 times 20 is 113.4, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, 117.83 minus 113.4 is 4.43.\n\nSo, I have 20 plus 4.43 divided by 5.67.\n\n4.43 divided by 5.67 is less than 1, probably around 0.78.\n\nSo, total would be approximately 20.78, which is closest to 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nI can round 117.83 to 120 and 5.67 to 6, as I did earlier.\n\nThen, 120 divided by 6 is 20.\n\nAlternatively, round 117.83 to 110 and 5.67 to 5.5.\n\n110 divided by 5.5 is 20.\n\nAgain, 20.\n\nAlternatively, round 117.83 to 120 and 5.67 to 5.\n\n120 divided by 5 is 24.\n\nThat's a bit higher than 20.\n\nBut considering the original numbers, 117.83 is closer to 120, and 5.67 is closer to 6, so 120 divided by 6 is 20 seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the actual division to check.\n\n117.83 divided by 5.67.\n\nLet me do the calculation properly.\n\nFirst, move the decimal places to make the divisor a whole number.\n\n5.67 becomes 567 by multiplying by 100, and 117.83 becomes 11783 by multiplying by 100.\n\nSo, now it's 11783 divided by 567.\n\nNow, 567 times 20 is 11340.\n\n11783 minus 11340 is 443.\n\nSo, 443 divided by 567 is less than 1.\n\nTherefore, the quotient is 20 plus a fraction.\n\nSo, approximately 20.\n\nTherefore, the answer is about 20, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, maybe I can use a different method.\n\nLet me try using fractions.\n\n117.83 can be written as 11783/100, and 5.67 as 567/100.\n\nSo, dividing them: (11783/100) / (567/100) = 11783/100 * 100/567 = 11783/567.\n\nWhich is the same as before: 11783 divided by 567, which is approximately 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use long division.\n\nLet me try dividing 11783 by 567.\n\n567 goes into 1178 twice (since 567*2=1134).\n\nSubtract 1134 from 1178 to get 44.\n\nBring down the next digit, 3, making it 443.\n\n567 goes into 443 zero times.\n\nSo, the quotient is 20, with a remainder of 443.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20 with some decimal, but for estimation purposes, about 20 is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calculator to check, but since this is an estimation exercise, and the options are in tens, 20 seems appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, about 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
