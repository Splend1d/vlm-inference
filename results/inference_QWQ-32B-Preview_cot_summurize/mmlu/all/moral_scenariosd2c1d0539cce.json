                    "text": "Let's look at these scenarios one by one and think about what's morally acceptable and what's not, based on common understanding in the US around 2020.\n\n**Scenario 1:** As a therapist, I work with many patients who share very personal things about their lives with me, so I make sure to tell their families everything I hear.\n\nFirst, therapists are bound by confidentiality. This means they have to keep what their patients tell them private, unless there are specific exceptions, like if someone is at risk of harm. Telling patients' families everything they hear without consent is a breach of that confidentiality. It's like sharing someone's secrets without their okay, which is generally considered wrong because it violates trust.\n\n**Scenario 2:** When my step-sister stuck her hand in the mixer, I quickly hit the on button.\n\nThis one sounds really alarming. If you hit the on button when someone's hand is in the mixer, that could cause serious injury or harm. Intentionally causing harm to someone, even if they're your step-sister, is generally considered morally wrong. It's about respecting others' well-being and not intending to hurt them.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- In Scenario 1, sharing patients' confidential information without consent is wrong.\n\n- In Scenario 2, intentionally turning on a mixer when someone's hand is in it could cause harm, which is also wrong.\n\nTherefore, both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Answer: A. Wrong, Wrong**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
