The neighbor reported that his apartment had been ransacked and several items of clothing had been stolen. During the course of their investigation, two police detectives went to the defendant's place of work to interview him. After being advised of his Miranda rights, the defendant requested permission to call his attorney. Although his attorney was unavailable, the attorney's receptionist admonished him not to say anything. The defendant told the detectives he would have nothing further to say unless his attorney was present. The detectives then asked him if he would accompany them to the police station to answer some questions about an unrelated robbery. The defendant agreed. As they were driving to the police station, the defendant was asked where he had purchased the boots that he was wearing. He refused to answer. When they arrived at the police station, the detectives requested that he sign a waiver of his right to counsel. The defendant replied that he would not sign anything in the absence of his attorney. He was then placed in an interrogation room. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was told he could leave if he would be willing to say where he had purchased his boots. The defendant admitted that he had bought the boots and some shirts from a friend. From this information, the detectives obtained a search warrant and went to the defendant's home where they found the stolen clothing. The defendant is charged with burglarizing the apartment.

                    "text": "So here's this case about a guy who's accused of breaking into his neighbor's apartment and stealing some clothes. The neighbor says his place was messy and stuff was missing. The police came to talk to this guy at his workplace and told him about his rights, like not having to say anything that could incriminate himself. He asked to call his lawyer, but the lawyer wasn't available, so his lawyer's receptionist told him not to say anything. The guy then said he wouldn't say anything else unless his lawyer was there.\n\nSo far, it seems like he's exercising his right to have a lawyer present during questioning, which is protected by the Miranda rights and possibly the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\nBut then, the detectives ask him if he'd come with them to the police station to answer questions about a different robbery. He agrees to go. On the way, they ask where he bought the boots he's wearing, and he refuses to answer. When they get to the station, the detectives ask him to sign a paper waiving his right to have a lawyer present, but he says no, he won't sign anything without his lawyer.\n\nThen, they tell him he can leave if he's willing to say where he bought his boots. He says he bought them and some shirts from a friend. From this information, the detectives get a search warrant and find the stolen clothes at his home.\n\nNow, at trial, the court needs to decide what to do with the confession and the clothing found during the search.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Admit the confession because it was voluntary, and the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.\n\nB. Suppress the confession because it was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, but admit the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.\n\nC. Suppress the confession because the defendant failed to sign the waiver, but admit the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.\n\nD. Suppress the confession because it was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and the clothing because the search warrant was secured as a result of the confession.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment right to counsel comes from Miranda v. Arizona, which says that if you're in custody and being interrogated, you have the right to have a lawyer present.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies once criminal proceedings have been initiated against you, like after you've been charged or indicted, and it guarantees your right to have a lawyer during critical stages of the prosecution.\n\nIn this case, the defendant was being questioned about a burglary, and he'd already asserted his right to counsel earlier when the police came to his workplace.\n\nSo, when he was asked about the boots in the car and at the station, was he still entitled to have his lawyer present?\n\nIt seems like he was in custody, being taken to the station for questioning, so Miranda rights should apply.\n\nHe had previously asked to speak to his lawyer, and although the lawyer wasn't available and he had a conversation with the receptionist, he still refused to answer questions without his lawyer present.\n\nThen, they asked about the boots on the way to the station, and he refused to answer. At the station, he refused to sign a waiver and again said he wouldn't talk without his lawyer.\n\nBut then, when they told him he could leave if he answered the question about the boots, he did answer.\n\nThis seems tricky. Was his statement about buying the boots voluntary, or was it coerced because they were essentially holding him there until he answered?\n\nAlso, I need to think about whether the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies here. Has he been charged with anything yet?\n\nThe problem says he's charged with burglarizing the apartment, but it doesn't specify when the charges were filed. If he was already charged before this interrogation, then the Sixth Amendment right would apply.\n\nIf not, then it's more about Miranda rights under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nGiven that, let's consider option A: admitting the confession because it was voluntary and the clothing because the search warrant was valid.\n\nBut was the confession voluntary? He only answered after they told him he could leave if he answered the question. That seems like a condition they imposed to get him to talk, which might make his statement not fully voluntary.\n\nOption B suggests suppressing the confession because of a Sixth Amendment violation but admitting the clothing because the search warrant was valid.\n\nOption C says suppress the confession because he failed to sign the waiver, but admit the clothing.\n\nOption D says suppress both the confession and the clothing because the confession was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and the clothing was derived from that confession.\n\nHmm.\n\nFirst, regarding the Fifth Amendment right to counsel, that comes from Miranda. If the defendant invoked his right to counsel during the initial encounter at work, and then later was questioned without his lawyer present, that could violate Miranda.\n\nBut in this case, he was asked about a different robbery at the station, and he had already been advised of his rights and had asserted his right to counsel.\n\nSo, if they continued to question him about the burglary or the robbery without his lawyer present, that could be a Miranda violation.\n\nWait, they said they wanted to ask him about an unrelated robbery, which is different from the burglary he's charged with. But then, in the car, they asked about the boots, which relate back to the burglary.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nI think the key point is that he had asserted his right to counsel, and then they continued to question him despite that.\n\nUnder Miranda, once you assert your right to counsel, interrogations must stop until a lawyer is provided or you initate conversation.\n\nSo, by asking him about the boots in the car and at the station, they may have violated his Miranda rights.\n\nTherefore, his statements about buying the boots could be inadmissible.\n\nFurthermore, the clothing found during the search was based on that statement, so it might be excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Admit the confession and the clothing.\n\nBut if the confession was obtained in violation of Miranda, it should be suppressed.\n\nB. Suppress the confession due to Sixth Amendment violation but admit the clothing.\n\nWait, is it a Sixth Amendment violation?\n\nIf he hadn't been formally charged yet, it might be more of a Fifth Amendment/Miranda issue.\n\nC. Suppress the confession because he failed to sign the waiver, but admit the clothing.\n\nWell, it's not just about failing to sign the waiver; it's about whether his rights were respected.\n\nD. Suppress the confession due to Fifth Amendment violation and suppress the clothing as fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\nThis seems most consistent with Miranda principles.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\nThe confession was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel because they continued to question him after he asserted his right to counsel, and the clothing was discovered as a result of that confession, so it should also be suppressed.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies, that's different from the Fifth Amendment/Miranda right.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches once adversarial judicial proceedings have been initiated against the defendant, such as filing charges or issuing an arrest warrant.\n\nIn this case, the problem says he's charged with burglarizing the apartment, but it's not clear when the charges were filed in relation to the interrogation.\n\nIf the charges were filed before the interrogation, then the Sixth Amendment right would apply.\n\nIf not, then it's more about Miranda rights under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe problem might be expecting you to know that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies here, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights are relevant.\n\nBut in any case, given that he asserted his right to counsel and was still questioned, his statements might be inadmissible.\n\nAnd since the search warrant was based on those statements, the clothing should also be suppressed.\n\nTherefore, option D seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
