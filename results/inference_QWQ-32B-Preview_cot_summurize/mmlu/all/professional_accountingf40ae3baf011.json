                    "text": "So I've got this question about bonds, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to figure it out. The question is: \"What is the price of a five-year bond (face value $100) that pays no coupons, if its yield is 4%?\" And there are options A. $100, B. $85, C. $82, D. $75.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a bond is. A bond is like an IOU that you buy from a government or a company. You give them money, and they promise to pay you back the face value at a certain time in the future, which is called the maturity date. Some bonds also pay periodic interest payments called coupons, but this one says it pays no coupons, so it's a zero-coupon bond.\n\nSo, a zero-coupon bond means I buy it at a discount from its face value, and then at maturity, I get the full face value. The yield is like the return on my investment. In this case, the yield is 4%.\n\nNow, I need to find out what price I should pay for this bond today so that when it matures in five years, and I get $100, my investment gives me a 4% yield.\n\nI think the formula for the price of a zero-coupon bond is:\n\nPrice = Face Value / (1 + Yield)^Number of Years\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nPrice = $100 / (1 + 0.04)^5\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 1 + 0.04 = 1.04\n\nThen, 1.04 to the power of 5. Let's see, 1.04^2 is 1.0816, times 1.04 is about 1.1249, times 1.04 is approximately 1.1699, times 1.04 again is around 1.2167.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. I think I made a mistake in calculating 1.04 to the power of 5.\n\nLet me try again:\n\n1.04^1 = 1.04\n\n1.04^2 = 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816\n\n1.04^3 = 1.0816 * 1.04 = 1.124864\n\n1.04^4 = 1.124864 * 1.04 \u2248 1.16985856\n\n1.04^5 = 1.16985856 * 1.04 \u2248 1.2166528528\n\nSo, (1 + Yield)^Number of Years = 1.2166528528\n\nNow, Price = $100 / 1.2166528528 \u2248 $82.19\n\nLooking at the options, C is $82, which is closest to $82.19.\n\nWait, but let's double-check my calculation because I might have made a mistake in the exponentiation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for present value:\n\nPV = FV / (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere PV is present value, FV is face value, r is the yield, and n is the number of years.\n\nSo, PV = $100 / (1 + 0.04)^5\n\nCalculating (1.04)^5 again:\n\n1.04^5 = 1.2166529024\n\nSo, PV = $100 / 1.2166529024 \u2248 $82.1927\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. $100\n\nB. $85\n\nC. $82\n\nD. $75\n\nOption C is $82, which is closest to $82.19.\n\nBut let's see if option C is exactly $82 or if there's a more precise option.\n\nWait, the options are discrete, so I have to choose among A, B, C, D.\n\nGiven that $82.19 is closest to $82, I think C is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider if there's any other factor I might be missing.\n\nSince it's a zero-coupon bond, there are no intermediate coupon payments; it's just a single payment at maturity.\n\nThe yield is the rate that equates the present value of the future cash flow to the bond's price.\n\nSo, yes, the formula I used is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the future value formula.\n\nFuture Value = Present Value * (1 + r)^n\n\nIn this case, Future Value is $100, r is 4%, n is 5 years.\n\nSo, $100 = PV * (1.04)^5\n\nSolving for PV: PV = $100 / (1.04)^5\n\nWhich is the same as what I did earlier.\n\nSo, I'm confident that $82.19 is the correct price, and thus, option C. $82 is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
