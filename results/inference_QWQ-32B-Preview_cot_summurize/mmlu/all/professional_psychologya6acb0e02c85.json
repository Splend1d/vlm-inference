                    "text": "Let's see which of these concepts matches the correct stage in Piaget's theory of cognitive development. I need to remember what each stage is about and what concepts are associated with them.\n\nFirst, there's the sensorimotor stage. That's from birth to about 2 years old, right? In this stage, kids learn through their senses and movements. They're figuring out cause and effect, like shaking a rattle makes a noise. Object permanence is a big thing here\u2014realizing that objects exist even when they can't see them. So, option D says object permanence is in the preoperational stage, but I think that's incorrect because object permanence is actually a sensorimotor concept.\n\nNext, the preoperational stage is from about 2 to 7 years old. Kids start using symbols, like words and images, and their imagination develops. But they're still pretty egocentric, meaning they have trouble seeing things from others' perspectives. So, option B says egocentrism is in the sensorimotor stage, but I think that's not right because egocentrism is more associated with the preoperational stage.\n\nThe concrete operational stage is from about 7 to 11 years old. Kids start thinking logically about concrete events. They understand concepts like conservation, where quantity doesn't change even if the shape does, like water in different glasses. Centration is about focusing on one aspect and ignoring others, which might happen in this stage, but I'm not sure if it's the best match.\n\nFinally, the formal operational stage is from age 11 and up. Teens and adults can think abstractly and hypothetically. They can consider possibilities and think about theories. Hypothetical-deductive reasoning is a key part of this stage, where they can test hypotheses and think through problems logically.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. Centration\u2014concrete operational stage: Centration might occur in this stage, but it's more prominently featured in earlier stages.\n\nB. Egocentrism\u2014sensorimotor stage: Actually, egocentrism is more associated with the preoperational stage.\n\nC. Hypothetical-deductive reasoning\u2014formal operational stage: This seems correct; it's a key feature of this stage.\n\nD. Object permanence\u2014preoperational stage: But object permanence is a sensorimotor concept.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the appropriately matched concept and stage according to Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
