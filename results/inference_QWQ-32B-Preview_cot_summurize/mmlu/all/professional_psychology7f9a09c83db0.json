                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which philosopher's ideas align most closely with the concept that there are three major life tasks: friendship, occupation, and love. The options are Perls, Berne, Rogers, and Adler. I need to recall what each of these thinkers is known for to determine the best match.\n\nFirst, let's consider Perls. He's associated with Gestalt therapy, which focuses on awareness and acceptance of the present moment, including one's thoughts, feelings, and sensations. It emphasizes personal responsibility and the integration of fragmented parts of the self. While important, it doesn't specifically outline three major life tasks.\n\nNext, Berne is known for creating transactional analysis, which is a social psychology and psychotherapy approach that analyzes people's interactions and communication patterns. It introduces concepts like Parent, Adult, and Child ego states and scripts. Again, while insightful, it doesn't directly address three specific life tasks.\n\nRogers is famous for his humanistic approach to psychology, particularly client-centered therapy. He emphasized empathy, unconditional positive regard, and congruence in therapeutic relationships. His focus is more on the individual's self-concept and personal growth rather than specific life tasks.\n\nFinally, Adler was a pioneer in individual psychology, which views people as unified whole beings who are more than just the sum of their parts. He emphasized social interest, community feeling, and the importance of childhood experiences in shaping one's lifestyle. Adler did discuss various life tasks, including those related to friendship, occupation, and love, as part of his holistic view of human development and social embeddedness.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Adler's philosophy is most consistent with the idea of three major life tasks: friendship, occupation, and love. His approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of these areas in a person's life and how they contribute to overall well-being and social functioning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
