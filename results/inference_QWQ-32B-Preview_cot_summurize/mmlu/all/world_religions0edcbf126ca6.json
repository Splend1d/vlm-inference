                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about when the Babylonian captivity, also known as the Exile, began. The options are 515 BCE, 535 BCE, 586 BCE, and 70 CE. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Babylonian captivity was. I know it had something to do with the Jewish people being taken away from their homeland by the Babylonians. I think it was a period when the Jews were exiled to Babylon, which is in modern-day Iraq.\n\nI remember that this event was a significant part of Jewish history and had long-term effects on the Jewish people and their culture. I think it's related to the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nNow, I need to pin down the date when this captivity began. Let's see what I can remember about the timeline of these events.\n\nI think the Babylonians, under King Nebuchadnezzar II, attacked Jerusalem and took many Jews captive in several waves. I believe the first wave was around 605 BCE, but I'm not sure if that's when the captivity officially began.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the destruction of the temple. I think the temple was destroyed in 586 BCE, and that might be when the captivity started. But I'm a bit confused because I've heard different dates mentioned.\n\nLet me think about the options provided:\n\nA. 515 BCE - I think this date is too late. I believe that's when the Second Temple was completed, after the Jews returned from exile.\n\nB. 535 BCE - This also seems late. I think the captivity ended around this time, not began.\n\nC. 586 BCE - This sounds familiar. I think this is when the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and the temple, leading to the exile.\n\nD. 70 CE - This is way too late. That's when the Romans destroyed the Second Temple, which was a different event.\n\nSo, based on what I'm recalling, 586 BCE seems to be the correct answer. But I should double-check to make sure.\n\nLet me try to recall some more details. I know that Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem multiple times. The first siege was in 605 BCE, after the Battle of Carchemish, where the Babylonians defeated the Egyptians. At that time, some Jews, including the prophet Daniel, were taken to Babylon.\n\nThen, in 597 BCE, there was another siege, and King Jehoiachin and thousands of Jews were taken to Babylon.\n\nFinally, in 586 BCE, after a revolt by King Zedekiah, the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem, including the temple, and took more Jews into exile.\n\nSo, while there were earlier deportations, the full-scale captivity and destruction of the temple occurred in 586 BCE.\n\nTherefore, the beginning of the Babylonian captivity should be dated to 586 BCE.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other dates again.\n\n515 BCE is when the Second Temple was completed, after the Jews returned from Babylon under the Persian Empire's rule, led by Cyrus the Great.\n\n535 BCE is not a standard date in this timeline, but it might be a misremembering of 539 BCE, when Babylon fell to the Persians, allowing the Jews to return.\n\n70 CE is the Roman destruction of the Second Temple, which was a entirely different historical event.\n\nSo, considering all this, 586 BCE is indeed the correct answer for when the Babylonian captivity began.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
