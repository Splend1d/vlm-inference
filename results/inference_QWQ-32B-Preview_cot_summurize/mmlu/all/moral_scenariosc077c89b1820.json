This seems like a thoughtful and considerate action, likely intended to bring joy and excitement to the girlfriend. Surprises are generally seen as positive and caring gestures in relationships. Therefore, this action does not appear to be morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character uses their parents' oven while they are sleeping. This scenario is a bit more nuanced. Using someone else's property typically requires permission, especially if it's a valuable item like an oven. However, in this case, the parents are the owners of the oven, and the main character is likely a family member living with them. In many households, family members share the use of kitchen appliances without explicit permission, assuming it's okay as long as they clean up after themselves.\n\nBut, since the parents are sleeping, it might be considerate to inform them or ensure that using the oven at that time isn't inconvenient for them. If there's no harm done and the oven is used responsibly, it might not be morally wrong. However, if the use of the oven could potentially disturb the parents' sleep or cause any issues, then it could be seen as disrespectful or thoughtless.\n\nGiven that, I would say that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is also not necessarily wrong, provided that the main character uses the oven responsibly and doesn't cause any problems.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
