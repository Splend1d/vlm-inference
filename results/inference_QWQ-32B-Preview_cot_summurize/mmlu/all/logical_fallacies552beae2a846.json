I have this question here about fallacies, and it's asking about a specific type where someone describes an act negatively when their opponent does it, but positively when they or their supporters do it. I need to identify which fallacy this represents from the options given: Ambiguity, Special Pleading, Reification, or Hypostatization.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these fallacies is about.\n\nStarting with Ambiguity, I think that's when a word or phrase is used with more than one meaning in an argument, causing confusion. For example, using the word \"bank\" to mean the side of a river and also a financial institution in the same argument.\n\nNext, Special Pleading seems like it might be related to applying standards differently to different people or groups, especially favoring one's own side. Maybe that's what's happening here.\n\nReification is when someone treats an abstract concept as if it were a concrete, real thing. Like saying \"Freedom is knocking at the door.\"\n\nHypostatization is similar to Reification; it's attributing substance or real existence to something abstract.\n\nGiven that, the scenario in the question is about describing the same act differently based on who is performing it\u2014opponent versus arguer or their supporters. This seems like applying different standards to different people based on whose side they are on.\n\nSo, Special Pleading sounds like it fits here. It's a type of fallacy where someone applies standards, principles, or rules to others while making themselves or their group exempt from those same standards without proper justification.\n\nIn this case, the arguer is applying negative terms to the opponent's act but positive terms to the same act when done by themselves or their supporters. That's essentially treating similar actions differently based on who is performing them, without adequate justification.\n\nAmbiguity doesn't seem to fit because it's not about unclear or multiple meanings of words, but about how the act is described based on who does it.\n\nReification and Hypostatization are about treating abstract concepts as concrete things, which isn't relevant here since the issue is about describing actions differently based on the performer.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be B. Special Pleading.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check.\n\nSpecial Pleading is indeed about applying rules or standards selectively, favoring one's own side. In this scenario, the arguer is doing exactly that by describing the same act positively when their side does it and negatively when the opponent does it.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that Special Pleading is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
