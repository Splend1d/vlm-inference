I remember that suicide is a significant public health issue, but I'm not sure about the exact percentage it accounts for in global deaths. Let's see, the options are 0.70%, 1.40%, 2.80%, and 5.60%. I think it's higher than 1%, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nI recall that in some countries, suicide rates have been rising, which is concerning. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), suicide was the second leading cause of death among young people aged 15-29 years old. But I'm not sure how that translates to the overall percentage of global deaths.\n\nLet me think about the total number of global deaths in 2017. I believe the world population was around 7.5 billion, and the annual death rate is roughly 7.5 to 8 million people per year. If suicide accounts for, say, 1% of those deaths, that would be 750,000 to 800,000 suicides per year.\n\nWait a minute, I think the WHO reports that approximately 800,000 people die by suicide each year. If that's the case, and if the total number of global deaths is around 56 million per year, then the percentage would be lower than I thought.\n\nLet me calculate that. If there are 800,000 suicides out of 56 million total deaths, that would be:\n\n(800,000 / 56,000,000) * 100% = (8 / 560) * 100% = (1 / 70) * 100% \u2248 1.43%\n\nSo, approximately 1.43% of global deaths are by suicide. Looking back at the options, B is 1.40%, which is closest to my calculation.\n\nBut I should verify the total number of global deaths in 2017. According to the WHO, in 2017, there were approximately 56 million deaths worldwide. So, if 800,000 of those were suicides, that would indeed be about 1.43%.\n\nI think option B, 1.40%, is the correct answer. It's possible that the exact number is slightly different, but 1.40% is the closest estimate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
