                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out what kind of estate or interest the brother has in this scenario. The deed is a bit complicated, so I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the grantor conveyed the apartment building to his son for life, and then to his uncle for life. But there are conditions involving the uncle moving to another state, and then the interest goes to the brother for the life of the uncle, and so on with heirs. It's a bit tangled, but I'll try to untangle it.\n\nSo, the basic structure is:\n\n1. Son for life.\n\n2. Then, uncle for life, but with a condition: if the uncle moves to another state, then to the brother for the life of the uncle.\n\n3. After that:\n\n- If the uncle doesn't move, to the heirs of the uncle.\n\n- If the uncle does move, to the heirs of the brother.\n\nWhew, that's a mouthful. Now, the question is about the brother's interest during the son's lifetime.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what interests are created by this deed.\n\n1. Son: Life estate.\n\n2. Uncle: Remainder for life, but conditional.\n\n3. Brother: Some interest that activates if the uncle moves to another state.\n\n4. Heirs: Depending on whether the uncle moves or not.\n\nNow, focusing on the brother's interest during the son's lifetime.\n\nLet's consider the rules of future interests.\n\n- A remainder is an interest that follows a life estate.\n\n- A vested remainder is a remainder that is certain to become possessory, while a contingent remainder is uncertain.\n\n- A pur autre vie is a type of remainder that is measured by someone else's life.\n\n- An executory interest is a future interest that cuts short or modifies a preceding estate.\n\nGiven that, let's see.\n\nAfter the son's life estate, the uncle has a life estate, but it's conditional on not moving to another state.\n\nIf the uncle moves, then the brother gets a life interest for the duration of the uncle's life.\n\nSo, the brother's interest is dependent on the uncle moving to another state.\n\nDuring the son's lifetime, what does the brother have?\n\nWell, the brother has a future interest that is contingent on the uncle moving to another state.\n\nSo, it's a contingent remainder.\n\nBut it's also pur autre vie because it's measured by the uncle's life.\n\nSo, maybe it's a contingent remainder pur autre vie.\n\nWait, but pur autre vie typically refers to a remainder that is measured by someone else's life.\n\nYes, that fits because the brother's interest is for the life of the uncle.\n\nBut it's contingent on the uncle moving to another state.\n\nSo, it's contingent on an event happening in the future.\n\nTherefore, it should be a contingent remainder pur autre vie.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Estate pur autre vie.\n\nB. Contingent remainder pur autre vie.\n\nC. Vested remainder pur autre vie.\n\nD. Shifting executory interest pur autre vie.\n\nAn estate pur autre vie is a type of fee simple estate measured by another's life, but here, the brother doesn't have a fee simple; he has a life interest contingent on the uncle moving.\n\nSo, A might not fit.\n\nB. Contingent remainder pur autre vie: This seems plausible.\n\nC. Vested remainder pur autre vie: But the brother's interest is contingent on the uncle moving, so it's not vested.\n\nD. Shifting executory interest pur autre vie: Shifting interests typically enlarge the grantor's estate, which doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nTherefore, B seems to be the best answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nDuring the son's lifetime, the brother has a contingent remainder pur autre vie, meaning that his interest is contingent on the uncle moving to another state, and if that happens, he gets a life interest measured by the uncle's life.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Contingent remainder pur autre vie.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
