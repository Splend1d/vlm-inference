These bonds are formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, resulting in the creation of a peptide bond and the release of a water molecule. This process is called dehydration synthesis.\n\nWhile hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds do play roles in the structure and stability of proteins, they are not the primary bonds that connect amino acids in the polypeptide chain. Glycosidic bonds, on the other hand, are found in carbohydrates, where they link monosaccharides together.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Peptide bonds.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Peptide Bonds:** These are amide bonds formed between the carboxyl carbon (C) of one amino acid and the amino nitrogen (N) of another, with the loss of a water molecule. Peptide bonds give rise to the primary structure of proteins.\n\n- **Hydrogen Bonds:** These are weaker interactions that occur between a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like oxygen or nitrogen) and another electronegative atom. In proteins, hydrogen bonds are crucial for maintaining secondary structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets, as well as tertiary and quaternary structures.\n\n- **Ionic Bonds:** These involve the attraction between oppositely charged ions. In proteins, ionic bonds can form between side chains of amino acids that have acidic or basic properties, contributing to the stability of the protein's three-dimensional structure.\n\n- **Glycosidic Bonds:** These are covalent bonds that link carbohydrates (sugars) together. They are formed between a hemiacetal or hemiketal group of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of another sugar, often with the elimination of a water molecule.\n\nUnderstanding these different types of bonds is essential in biochemistry, as they dictate the structure and function of biological molecules.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- Berg, J.
