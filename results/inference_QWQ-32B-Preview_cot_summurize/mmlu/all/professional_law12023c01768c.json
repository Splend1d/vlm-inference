                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about ex post facto laws. So, ex post facto laws are basically laws that change the legal consequences of actions that were committed before the enactment of the law. Now, the question is asking which statement about these laws is false. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"They make criminal an act that was innocent when committed.\" That sounds like a classic definition of an ex post facto law. It's retroactively making something illegal that was legal at the time it was done. So, this seems true.\n\nOption B: \"They prescribe greater punishment for an act than was prescribed when it was done.\" Again, this is another aspect of ex post facto laws. If you commit a crime and then later the punishment for that crime is increased, and you're subject to the harsher penalty even though you committed the crime before the change, that's ex post facto.\n\nOption C: \"They increase the evidence required to convict a person than when the act was done.\" Hmm, this one is a bit different. Normally, ex post facto laws are about making actions criminal retroactively or increasing punishments, but increasing the evidence required to convict sounds like it might be the opposite\u2014it's making it harder to convict someone for something they did in the past. So, this seems like it might be false.\n\nOption D: \"They alter criminal offenses or punishment in a substantially prejudicial manner for the purpose of punishing a person for some past activity.\" This is broad and seems to cover the general idea of ex post facto laws\u2014altering laws in a way that negatively affects people for things they did in the past.\n\nSo, comparing these, option C stands out because it suggests increasing the evidence required to convict, which would actually make it harder to punish someone for a past act, whereas ex post facto laws typically make it easier to punish past acts by changing the laws retroactively.\n\nTherefore, I think the false statement is option C. But let me double-check. Ex post facto laws are generally considered unconstitutional in many legal systems because they retroactively alter legal consequences, which is seen as unfair. So, making something illegal retroactively or increasing punishments retroactively is prohibited, but requiring more evidence to convict someone for a past act wouldn't typically be considered an ex post facto law; in fact, it might be seen as more protective of the individual.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that option C is the false statement about ex post facto laws.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
