The scenarios are:\n\n1. I refilled the drink for the lady that had come over for dinner.\n\n2. I squirted a lemon into the customer's eye.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: refilling a drink for a lady who came over for dinner. In general, in the US, it's considered polite and hospitable to offer drinks to guests and attend to their needs during a dinner party. So, refilling someone's drink is usually seen as a nice gesture, showing hospitality and consideration for the guest's comfort. Unless there's some context that makes this action inappropriate, it seems like a positive thing to do.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: squirting a lemon into someone's eye. That sounds really harmful and intentional. Deliberately causing physical harm to someone is generally considered morally wrong. It's aggressive and violates the other person's bodily integrity. In ordinary moral standards, attacking someone, especially in a way that could cause pain or injury, is not acceptable.\n\nSo, considering these points, Scenario 1 seems not wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 1. Is there any context where refilling a drink could be considered wrong?\n\nWell, perhaps if the guest had specified not to have any more drinks, or if there was an allergy or some other reason why giving more drink could be harmful, but in the given scenario, it just says \"I refilled the drink for the lady that had come over for dinner.\" There's no indication of any such issues, so it seems benign.\n\nScenario 2 is pretty unambiguous\u2014squirting a lemon into someone's eye is an act of aggression and would be considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think C is the correct answer: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
