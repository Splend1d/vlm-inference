Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to divide 30,000 by 10. Dividing by 10 means I'm making the number ten times smaller, right? So, 30,000 divided by 10 should be 3,000. Let me just confirm that: 10 times 3,000 is 30,000. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem says to divide that result by 10 again. So, I take 3,000 and divide it by 10. Again, dividing by 10 makes the number ten times smaller. So, 3,000 divided by 10 should be 300. Let's check: 10 times 300 is 3,000. Perfect, that seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 300 matches my answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should try another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to combine the two divisions into one. Dividing by 10 and then by 10 again is the same as dividing by 100. Because 10 times 10 is 100. So, if I divide 30,000 by 100, I should get the same result.\n\nLet's do that: 30,000 divided by 100. Well, 100 times 300 is 30,000. So again, I get 300. That matches my previous result, which is good.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of decimals. When you divide by 10, you move the decimal point one place to the left. So, 30,000 is 30,000.0. Moving the decimal one place to the left gives me 3,000.0. Dividing by 10 again moves the decimal another place to the left, resulting in 300.0. Again, that's 300.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same answer, which is 300. So, I'm confident that the correct choice is C. 300.\n\nBut just to cover all bases, let's quickly look at why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A is 3. That would be if I divided 30,000 by 10 three times, which would be dividing by 1,000. But the problem only says to divide by 10 twice, so that's too many divisions.\n\nOption B is 30. That's what I would get if I divided 30,000 by 1000. Again, that's one too many divisions by 10.\n\nOption D is 3,000. That's what I get after the first division by 10, but the problem says to divide by 10 again. So, that's not the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 300.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
