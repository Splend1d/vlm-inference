                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about fractional reserve banking. So, the question is: \"Having a fractional reserve banking system means that...\" and then there are four options. Let me read them again to make sure I get it.\n\nOption A says: \"no single loan can be larger than 20 percent of the bank\u2019s holdings.\" Hmm, that sounds like a rule about loan size relative to the bank's total assets, but I'm not sure if that's what fractional reserve banking is about.\n\nOption B: \"the central bank reserves the right to audit any bank at any time.\" This seems more like a regulatory practice rather than a definition of fractional reserve banking.\n\nOption C: \"the central bank holds a certain fraction of GDP on reserve at all times.\" Wait, GDP is the gross domestic product, right? I think this might be confusing reserves with economic indicators.\n\nOption D: \"a bank cannot lend out all of its deposits.\" Okay, this sounds familiar. In fractional reserve banking, banks keep only a fraction of deposits as reserves and lend out the rest. So, they can't lend out all of their deposits.\n\nLet me think about this. Fractional reserve banking is a system where banks keep only a portion of their deposits as required reserves and lend out the rest. This process creates money in the economy because the loans become deposits in other banks, which then also lend a portion of them, and so on.\n\nSo, option D seems to directly state that banks can't lend out all of their deposits, which aligns with the concept of keeping a fraction as reserves.\n\nOption A mentions a specific percentage, 20 percent, but I don't recall any specific percentage being universally set for fractional reserves. It varies by country and can be set by the central bank. So, this seems too vague or perhaps incorrect.\n\nOption B is about the central bank's auditing rights, which is probably important for regulation, but it doesn't define fractional reserve banking.\n\nOption C talks about the central bank holding a certain fraction of GDP on reserve. I think this might be confusing the reserve requirements with GDP. Reserve requirements are typically a percentage of deposits that banks must hold, not related to GDP.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D: a bank cannot lend out all of its deposits. This captures the essence of fractional reserve banking, where banks must hold a portion of deposits as reserves and can lend out the rest.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. What is the main characteristic of fractional reserve banking? It's that banks keep only a fraction of deposits as reserves and lend out the rest. This is what allows for money multiplication in the economy.\n\nSo, yes, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
