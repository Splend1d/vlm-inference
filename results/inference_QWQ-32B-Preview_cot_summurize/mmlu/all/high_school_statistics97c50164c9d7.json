                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about a medical research team testing for tumor reduction in patients using three different dosages of an experimental cancer drug. We need to figure out which statement is true regarding the variables in this study.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what explanatory and response variables are. An explanatory variable is the one that is manipulated by the researcher to observe its effect on the response variable. The response variable is the outcome that is measured in the experiment.\n\nIn this case, the explanatory variable is the dosage of the cancer drug because that's what the researchers are changing to see the effect on tumor reduction. The response variable is tumor reduction because that's what they're measuring to see how well the drug works.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. There are three explanatory variables and one response variable.\n\nThis suggests that there are three different explanatory variables, but in reality, there's only one explanatory variable: the dosage of the drug, which has three different levels.\n\nB. There is one explanatory variable with three levels of response.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. It says there is one explanatory variable, which is correct, but then it mentions three levels of response. Response levels would refer to the outcome, but actually, the explanatory variable has three levels (the three dosages), and the response variable is tumor reduction.\n\nC. Tumor reduction is the only explanatory variable, but there are three response variables corresponding to the different dosages.\n\nThis is incorrect because tumor reduction is the response variable, not the explanatory variable. The explanatory variable is the dosage, and there's only one response variable, which is tumor reduction.\n\nD. There are three levels of a single explanatory variable.\n\nThis makes sense. The explanatory variable is the dosage, and there are three different levels of this variable being tested.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, the correct answer should be D. There are three levels of a single explanatory variable.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider again:\n\n- Explanatory variable: dosage of the drug (with three levels: let's say low, medium, and high).\n\n- Response variable: tumor reduction (measured in some way, perhaps in percentage decrease).\n\nTherefore, option D accurately describes the situation.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
