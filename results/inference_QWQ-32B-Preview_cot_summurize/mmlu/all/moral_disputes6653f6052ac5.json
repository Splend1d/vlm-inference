                    "text": "I'm going to need to think about this one. The question is about Cohen's view on animals, and the options are that animals are moral agents, amoral, abstract reasoners, or all of the above. I don't remember Cohen's exact stance, but I think he's a philosopher who has written about ethics and animals.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a moral agent is. A moral agent is someone who can make moral decisions and is responsible for their actions. So, if animals are moral agents, that would mean they can make ethical choices and understand right from wrong.\n\nNext, amoral means not concerned with or bound by morality. So, if animals are amoral, they don't have moral considerations in their actions.\n\nAbstract reasoners are beings that can think about concepts and ideas that aren't concrete or physical. Humans are considered abstract reasoners because we can think about things like justice, love, and mathematics.\n\nNow, I need to think about what Cohen might say about animals in relation to these concepts.\n\nI think Cohen is a philosopher who argues that animals have moral status, but maybe not in the same way as humans. I recall that he might argue that animals are not moral agents because they don't have the capacity to understand moral rules or make moral decisions. But he still thinks they have moral consideration because they can feel pain and suffer.\n\nSo, if animals are not moral agents, that would eliminate option A. And probably, he wouldn't consider animals abstract reasoners, especially since many animals don't have the cognitive abilities to engage in complex abstract thinking. That might eliminate option C.\n\nOption B says animals are amoral. If animals aren't moral agents and aren't abstract reasoners, maybe they are amoral in the sense that their actions aren't guided by moral considerations.\n\nBut I also need to consider whether Cohen might think animals have some moral worth or if they are completely outside the moral community.\n\nI think Cohen is known for arguing that animals do have moral significance, particularly because they can suffer. So, perhaps he wouldn't say they are amoral in the sense of being outside moral consideration.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing Cohen with another philosopher, like Peter Singer or Tom Regan. I think Cohen is a different philosopher.\n\nLet me try to recall. Is there a philosopher named Cohen who wrote about animals?\n\nI think there's a philosopher named Carl Cohen who has written about animal rights, but I believe his views are different from Singer's or Regan's. I think Cohen is more on the side that animals don't have the same moral rights as humans because they lack certain capacities.\n\nSo, if Cohen argues that animals aren't moral agents and can't be part of the moral community in the same way as humans, then maybe he would say that animals are amoral.\n\nBut I need to be careful here because even if animals aren't moral agents, it doesn't necessarily mean they are amoral. Amoral could mean that their actions are neither moral nor immoral, which might be Cohen's view.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Cohen thinks that animals are capable of moral actions in some sense, but I doubt that.\n\nWait, perhaps Cohen would argue that animals can't be moral agents because they lack the rational capacity to understand moral rules.\n\nIn that case, animals would be amoral in the sense that they don't have moral agency.\n\nBut the question is, according to Cohen, are animals moral agents, amoral, abstract reasoners, or all of the above?\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B. amoral.\n\nBut let me check option D, all of the above. That seems unlikely because animals can't be both moral agents and amoral at the same time.\n\nSo, my best guess is B. amoral.\n\nBut I should double-check this because I don't want to get it wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Cohen has a different view. Perhaps he thinks that animals are abstract reasoners to some extent, but I doubt that.\n\nOr maybe he considers animals moral agents because they can make choices, but again, that doesn't seem right.\n\nI think B. amoral is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
