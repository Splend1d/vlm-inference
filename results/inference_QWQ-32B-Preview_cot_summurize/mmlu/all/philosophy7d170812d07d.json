                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about John Stuart Mill's views on justice and moral obligations. The question is:\n\n\"Mill claims that the distinction between justice and other moral obligations corresponds perfectly to the distinction between:\n\nA. perfect and imperfect obligations.\n\nB. positive and negative duties.\n\nC. strong and weak duties.\n\nD. absolute and relative obligations.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall Mill's thoughts on justice and how he differentiates it from other moral obligations. I remember that in his work \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill discusses justice as a particular type of moral requirement.\n\nLet me think about option A: perfect and imperfect obligations. I think this is a concept from Kant's moral philosophy, where perfect duties are those that are strictly universal and must always be followed, like not lying, while imperfect duties are more general guidelines, like helping others. But Mill was a utilitarian, so I'm not sure if he used this exact terminology.\n\nOption B: positive and negative duties. Positive duties are obligations to act in a certain way, like helping someone in need, while negative duties are obligations to refrain from certain actions, like not harming others. I think Mill might have discussed justice in terms of negative duties, like respecting people's rights, but I'm not sure if he equated justice perfectly with negative duties.\n\nOption C: strong and weak duties. This seems more like a general way of describing the intensity or importance of moral obligations. Maybe Mill thought that justice represents stronger moral duties compared to other moral obligations, but I don't recall him specifically categorizing duties in this way.\n\nOption D: absolute and relative obligations. Absolute obligations are those that hold regardless of circumstances, while relative obligations can vary depending on the situation. Perhaps Mill saw justice as consisting of absolute obligations, whereas other moral obligations are more relative.\n\nWait, maybe I should look back at what Mill actually says about justice. In \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill argues that justice is a name for certain moral requirements that are more pressing and override considerations of general utility in many cases.\n\nHe discusses that justice often involves the protection of individual rights, and that violating justice\u2014such as stealing or harming someone\u2014causes harm that is considered worse than merely acting immorally in other ways.\n\nI think Mill ties justice closely to the idea of rights and the prevention of harm. Now, considering the options again:\n\nA. Perfect and imperfect obligations\u2014this seems more Kantian, and while Mill may have been influenced by Kant, I don't think he adopted this distinction directly.\n\nB. Positive and negative duties\u2014Mill does discuss the role of not harming others as a central aspect of justice, which sounds like a negative duty. But justice also includes positive requirements, like enforcing laws and possibly even providing for the welfare of citizens, which would be positive duties.\n\nC. Strong and weak duties\u2014this seems plausible because justice might represent stronger moral obligations that are harder to override.\n\nD. Absolute and relative obligations\u2014Mill was a utilitarian, and while he believed in general utility as the foundation of morality, he also recognized that some moral rules are more exceptionless than others, particularly those related to justice.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's D. Absolute and relative obligations. Mill might see justice as consisting of absolute obligations that must be followed without exception, whereas other moral obligations can be balanced against each other based on utility.\n\nBut wait, I think Mill actually argued against strict rules and for a more flexible approach, where even justice considerations can be overridden in extreme cases if violating them would lead to greater overall utility.\n\nIn \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill says that justice is a part of utility, but it has a special status because it protects important values like individual rights and social order. However, he also maintains that in extraordinary cases, utility can override justice.\n\nSo, if Mill sees justice as generally corresponding to absolute obligations but still allows for exceptions based on utility, then maybe option D isn't the best fit.\n\nLet me consider option B again: positive and negative duties. Justice seems to encompass both. For example, not stealing is a negative duty (to refrain from harming), while enforcing laws and possibly providing justice systems could be positive duties.\n\nSimilarly, option A: perfect and imperfect obligations\u2014if I recall correctly, Kant distinguished between perfect duties, which are strict and imperative, and imperfect duties, which allow for more discretion. Mill, being a utilitarian, might not make this distinction in the same way.\n\nOption C: strong and weak duties\u2014this seems plausible. Maybe Mill saw justice as involving stronger duties that are more compelling and less easily overridden by conflicting considerations.\n\nBut I need to think carefully about what Mill actually wrote. In his essay \"Speech on the Cobden Club,\" Mill discusses the role of justice in relation to social reform and utility. He argues that justice has a unique moral force that makes it particularly important, but still subordinate to the general principle of utility.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the distinction he's making is between duties that are strong but not necessarily absolute, and other, weaker moral obligations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he sees justice as corresponding to perfect obligations, in the sense that they are strictly required, whereas other moral obligations are imperfect and allow for more flexibility.\n\nBut again, I'm mixing Kant's terminology with Mill's utilitarian framework, which might not be accurate.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the sources or recall specific quotes from Mill's works.\n\nIn \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill writes that justice is a name for certain moral requirements that are more pressing and override considerations of general utility in many cases. He also discusses that justice often involves the protection of individual rights.\n\nGiven that, maybe justice for Mill corresponds to perfect obligations, which are strictly required, as opposed to imperfect obligations, which are more discretionary.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if Mill used the terms \"perfect\" and \"imperfect\" obligations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he used \"strong\" and \"weak\" duties to describe this distinction.\n\nWait, in \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill does discuss the idea that some utilities are more important than others. He argues that higher pleasures are more valuable than lower pleasures, but I don't recall him specifically using \"strong\" and \"weak\" to describe duties.\n\nPerhaps option B is the best answer: positive and negative duties. Justice often involves negative duties, such as not harming others, which are central to his concept of justice.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, justice also includes positive duties, like enforcing laws and providing for the administration of justice.\n\nMaybe the question is testing whether I remember that Mill saw justice as corresponding perfectly to one of these distinctions, but in reality, it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A: perfect and imperfect obligations, and I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me consider the context again. Mill was influenced by Bentham's utilitarianism but also incorporated ideas from Kant and others.\n\nPerhaps he saw justice as corresponding to perfect obligations, which must be fulfilled without exception, while other moral obligations are imperfect and allow for more flexibility.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to impose Kant's distinctions onto Mill's utilitarian framework.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Mill saw justice as involving both positive and negative duties, making option B the correct answer.\n\nWait, but the question says \"corresponds perfectly to the distinction between,\" suggesting a one-to-one correspondence.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option A is the best fit, assuming that Mill equates justice with perfect obligations.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider the consequences of each option.\n\nIf I choose A, perfect and imperfect obligations, that suggests that justice corresponds to perfect obligations, which are strictly required, while other moral obligations are imperfect and allow for more discretion.\n\nThis aligns somewhat with how Mill views justice as having a special status and being less flexible than other moral considerations.\n\nOption B, positive and negative duties, is also plausible because justice often involves both acting in certain ways (positive duties) and refraining from harmful actions (negative duties).\n\nOption C, strong and weak duties, seems general and perhaps too vague for Mill's specific views.\n\nOption D, absolute and relative obligations, suggests that justice consists of absolute obligations that hold without exception, while other moral obligations are relative and can be adjusted based on circumstances.\n\nBut, as I recall, Mill believed that even justice could be overridden in extreme cases if it led to greater overall utility, so perhaps justice isn't absolutely impermissible to override.\n\nGiven that, option D might not be the best fit.\n\nBetween A and B, I think A is more likely because it pertains to the strictness and imperativeness of justice as a moral requirement.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option A: perfect and imperfect obligations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
