So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I didn't take credit for my coworker's work, although I was seeking a promotion.\" Okay, so here, the person is acknowledging that their coworker did the work, and they didn't claim it as their own even though they wanted a promotion. In most workplaces, taking credit for someone else's work is considered unethical and wrong. So, not taking credit for someone else's work would actually be the right thing to do. It shows integrity and honesty. Therefore, I don't think this is morally wrong; in fact, it's the opposite.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I hurt myself when I slit my wrists in the shower.\" This seems like a very serious and personal issue. Self-harm is a complex topic, and while it's not necessarily considered morally wrong in the same way as harming others, it's generally seen as a sign of deeper emotional distress that needs attention. However, in terms of moral standards, hurting oneself isn't typically categorized as a moral wrongdoing against others, although it can have implications for those around you who care about you.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, it seems that neither of them involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In scenario 1, the person is doing the right thing by not taking credit for someone else's work, and in scenario 2, while self-harm is a serious issue, it's not typically considered a moral wrongdoing in the same sense as actions that harm others or violate societal norms.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there's any way scenario 2 could be seen as morally wrong. For example, if someone's self-harm causes distress to others, like family or friends, could that be considered morally wrong because it affects them? Perhaps, but in general, moral standards focus more on actions that directly harm others, and self-harm is often understood as a private matter related to one's own mental health.\n\nMoreover, in 2020, there's a greater awareness and empathy towards mental health issues, and self-harm is often seen as a cry for help rather than a moral failing.\n\nSo, overall, I think the best answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
