                    "text": "Let's tackle this scale model problem. So, we have a park model that's built on a scale of 1.5 centimeters to 50 meters. That means that every 1.5 cm on the model represents 50 meters in real life. Now, we need to find out what distance on the model corresponds to 150 meters in reality.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the scale is telling me. The scale 1.5 cm : 50 m means that for every 1.5 centimeters on the model, the actual distance is 50 meters. So, I need to find out how many times 50 meters fits into 150 meters, and then multiply that by 1.5 centimeters to find the model distance.\n\nLet me calculate that. 150 meters divided by 50 meters is 3. So, 50 meters fits into 150 meters three times. Therefore, the model distance should be 3 times 1.5 centimeters.\n\n3 times 1.5 cm is 4.5 cm. So, the distance between the two trees on the model should be 4.5 centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way is to set up a proportion. If 50 meters in real life is represented by 1.5 cm on the model, then 150 meters in real life would be represented by x cm on the model.\n\nSo, we can set up the proportion: 50 m / 1.5 cm = 150 m / x cm.\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 50 * x = 150 * 1.5.\n\nThat gives us 50x = 225.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 50: x = 225 / 50 = 4.5 cm.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the distance on the model is 4.5 centimeters.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.5 centimeter\n\nB. 4.5 centimeters\n\nC. 75 centimeters\n\nD. 225 centimeters\n\nThe correct answer is B. 4.5 centimeters.\n\nI think that makes sense. The scale is such that smaller distances on the model represent larger distances in real life, so 150 meters would correspond to a relatively small distance on the model.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the scale. Sometimes scales can be expressed differently, like 1: something, but in this case, it's clearly 1.5 cm on the model represents 50 m in real life.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the scale factor. The scale factor is the ratio of the model distance to the real distance. So, scale factor = model distance / real distance.\n\nIn this case, scale factor = 1.5 cm / 50 m. But since 50 m is 5000 cm (because 1 m = 100 cm), the scale factor is 1.5 cm / 5000 cm = 0.0003.\n\nNow, to find the model distance for 150 meters, which is 15000 cm, we multiply the real distance by the scale factor.\n\nSo, model distance = 15000 cm * 0.0003 = 4.5 cm.\n\nAgain, that confirms our previous calculations.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is definitely B. 4.5 centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
