                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about longevity in a certain locality. It says that the standard deviation of life spans is 14 years, and that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. I need to find the mean longevity, and there are four options provided. The problem also assumes that life spans follow a normal distribution.\n\nOkay, first things first. I know that in a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. That means that the mean, median, and mode are all the same value. So, if I can find where the 75 years falls in this distribution, I might be able to work backwards to find the mean.\n\nGiven that 30% of people live longer than 75 years, that means that 70% live less than or equal to 75 years. In terms of the normal distribution, this means that 75 years corresponds to the 70th percentile.\n\nTo find the mean, I need to use the properties of the normal distribution and the z-score. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. The formula for z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( X \\) is the value from the distribution (in this case, 75 years),\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean,\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation (14 years).\n\nI know \\( X = 75 \\), \\( \\sigma = 14 \\), and I need to find \\( \\mu \\). But to find \\( z \\), I need to know the cumulative probability up to that point, which is 70% or 0.70.\n\nI can look up the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.70 in a standard normal distribution table. From the z-table, a cumulative probability of 0.70 corresponds to a z-score of approximately 0.5244.\n\nSo, plugging into the z-score formula:\n\n\\[ 0.5244 = \\frac{75 - \\mu}{14} \\]\n\nNow, I can solve for \\( \\mu \\):\n\n\\[ 0.5244 \\times 14 = 75 - \\mu \\]\n\n\\[ 7.3416 = 75 - \\mu \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu = 75 - 7.3416 \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu = 67.6584 \\]\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them directly give this value. Let me see what the options are:\n\nA. 75 - 0.30(14)\n\nB. 75 + 0.30(14)\n\nC. 75 - 0.4756(14)\n\nD. 75 - 0.5244(14)\n\nHmm, option D looks similar to what I did, but let me verify.\n\nI used the z-score corresponding to the 70th percentile, which is approximately 0.5244, and then calculated \\( \\mu = 75 - 0.5244 \\times 14 \\), which matches option D.\n\nSo, option D is 75 - 0.5244(14). Calculating that:\n\n0.5244 \u00d7 14 = 7.3416\n\n75 - 7.3416 = 67.6584, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check the z-score. For a cumulative probability of 0.70, the z-score is indeed around 0.5244. Some tables might show slight variations, but this should be accurate enough.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently. Since 30% live longer than 75 years, that means 75 years is above the mean, right? Wait, no. Actually, since 70% live less than or equal to 75 years, that means the mean should be less than 75 years, because more people live below 75 than above it.\n\nWait a minute, but in my calculation, \\( \\mu = 67.6584 \\), which is less than 75. That makes sense because if the mean is less than 75, then more people would live below 75 years.\n\nBut let me consider if I've interpreted this correctly. In a normal distribution, if the mean is less than 75, then indeed, more people would live below 75 years. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the mean were greater than 75, then less than 50% would live below 75, but we have 70% living below 75, so the mean must be less than 75.\n\nTherefore, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let me look at the other options to see why they might be wrong.\n\nOption A: 75 - 0.30(14) = 75 - 4.2 = 70.8\n\nOption B: 75 + 0.30(14) = 75 + 4.2 = 79.2\n\nOption C: 75 - 0.4756(14) = 75 - 6.6584 = 68.3416\n\nOption D: 75 - 0.5244(14) = 75 - 7.3416 = 67.6584\n\nComparing these to my calculation, option D matches.\n\nBut wait, why is the z-score multiplied by the standard deviation and subtracted from 75? Is there another way to approach this?\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentiles. Since 30% live longer than 75 years, that means 75 years is the 70th percentile. So, I can use the formula for the percentile in a normal distribution:\n\n\\[ X = \\mu + z \\times \\sigma \\]\n\nwhere z is the z-score corresponding to the desired percentile.\n\nIn this case, for the 70th percentile, z \u2248 0.5244.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 75 = \\mu + 0.5244 \\times 14 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ \\mu = 75 - 0.5244 \\times 14 \\]\n\nAgain, this matches option D.\n\nAlternatively, if I rearrange the formula:\n\n\\[ \\mu = 75 - z \\times \\sigma \\]\n\nWhich is what option D has.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach using the properties of the normal distribution or the empirical rule, but I think using the z-score is the most straightforward method.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: 75 - 0.5244(14).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
