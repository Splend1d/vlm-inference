It's asking which perspective aligns with the idea that we have control over our own development and that our behaviors determine our success in aging.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each option means:\n\nA. Organismic: This perspective probably views development as a natural, innate process, like a plant growing. It might emphasize internal, biological factors.\n\nB. Nurture: This is about environmental influences shaping development, like how parents raise a child or the culture one grows up in.\n\nC. Continuity: This perspective likely sees development as a smooth, continuous process without abrupt changes.\n\nD. Mechanistic: This might view development in terms of mechanical or cause-and-effect relationships, where specific actions lead to specific outcomes.\n\nNow, the question mentions that we are mostly in control of our own development and that our behaviors determine the success of our aging. So, it's emphasizing personal control and the impact of behaviors.\n\nOption A, organismic, seems to focus on natural, internal processes, which doesn't align with the idea of personal control over development.\n\nOption B, nurture, focuses on environmental influences, but it's not specifically about personal control over one's own development.\n\nOption C, continuity, is about the process being smooth, which doesn't directly relate to control or behavior determining success in aging.\n\nOption D, mechanistic, suggests a cause-and-effect relationship, where specific actions lead to specific outcomes. This seems to align with the idea that our behaviors determine the success of our aging, as it implies that by controlling our behaviors, we can control the outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the perspective that aligns with believing we are in control of our own development and that our behaviors determine the success of our aging is the mechanistic perspective.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Mechanistic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
