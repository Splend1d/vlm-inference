                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"All robots are artifacts.\" And I need to translate that into predicate logic. There are four options:\n\nA. (\u2200x)(Ax \u2228 Rx)\n\nB. (\u2200x)(Ax \u2022 Rx)\n\nC. (\u2200x)(Rx \u2283 Ax)\n\nD. (\u2200x)(Rx \u2022 Ax)\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what \"All robots are artifacts\" means. It means that if something is a robot, then it is an artifact. So, it's a universal statement about robots and artifacts.\n\nIn predicate logic, universal statements are typically represented with the universal quantifier (\u2200x), which means \"for all x.\" Then, we need to express the relationship between being a robot and being an artifact.\n\nLet me think about the logical connectives here. There's disjunction (\u2228), which means \"or\"; conjunction (\u2022), which means \"and\"; implication (\u2283), which means \"if... then\"; and conjunction again (\u2022), which is just \"and.\"\n\nOption A is (\u2200x)(Ax \u2228 Rx), which translates to \"For all x, x is an artifact or x is a robot.\" But that doesn't capture the relationship that all robots are artifacts. It just says that everything is either an artifact or a robot, which is different.\n\nOption B is (\u2200x)(Ax \u2022 Rx), which means \"For all x, x is an artifact and x is a robot.\" That would mean everything is both an artifact and a robot, which is not what we want.\n\nOption C is (\u2200x)(Rx \u2283 Ax), which translates to \"For all x, if x is a robot, then x is an artifact.\" That sounds exactly like \"All robots are artifacts.\"\n\nOption D is (\u2200x)(Rx \u2022 Ax), which is similar to option B: \"For all x, x is a robot and x is an artifact.\" Again, that's not the same as saying all robots are artifacts.\n\nSo, between these options, option C seems to be the correct translation. It correctly uses implication to show that being a robot entails being an artifact.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider what each option is saying in English.\n\nOption A: \"Everything is either an artifact or a robot.\" That's too broad and doesn't capture the relationship.\n\nOption B: \"Everything is both an artifact and a robot.\" That's clearly not what we mean.\n\nOption C: \"If something is a robot, then it is an artifact.\" That's exactly what \"All robots are artifacts\" means.\n\nOption D: \"Everything is a robot and an artifact.\" Again, not correct.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is option C: (\u2200x)(Rx \u2283 Ax).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
