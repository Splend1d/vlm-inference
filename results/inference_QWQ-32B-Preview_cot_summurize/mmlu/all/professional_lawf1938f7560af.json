                    "text": "Let's see. So, this is a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. A highway patrol officer stopped a driver for speeding and found out she had a suspended license. He let her husband drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. After putting her in the squad car, he searched the vehicle and found a bag of cocaine in a zippered jacket on the back seat. Now, she's moving to suppress the cocaine evidence before trial. We need to figure out which option is most likely correct.\n\nOption A says yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police couldn't expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car. Hmm, I think this is related to the idea that searches incident to arrest are allowed to protect officers and prevent destruction of evidence, but only within certain limits.\n\nOption B says no, the motion will be denied because there's no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car. Wait, but cars do have an expectation of privacy, just a reduced one compared to homes. So, I'm not sure about that.\n\nOption C says no, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest. Okay, this seems plausible. When someone is arrested, officers can search the area within their immediate control, which often includes the vehicle if they were just in it.\n\nOption D says yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances. Exigent circumstances are like emergencies where getting a warrant isn't practical.\n\nLet me think about this. First, the arrest was for driving with a suspended license, which is a misdemeanor, I believe. And the search was after she was secured in the squad car, so officer safety shouldn't be an issue at that point.\n\nIn general, searches incident to arrest allow officers to search the arrestee's person and the area within their immediate control at the time of arrest, to ensure officer safety and prevent destruction of evidence. In the context of a vehicle, this usually means the passenger compartment and any containers within reach.\n\nIn this case, since she was already secured in the squad car, some might argue that the justification for the search is weakened because she couldn't access the car to destroy evidence or pose a threat. On the other hand, there's case law that allows searches incident to arrest even after the arrestee is secured, especially if there's a reasonable belief that evidence related to the arrest might be found in the vehicle.\n\nThe cocaine was found in a zippered jacket on the back seat. Was the jacket in plain view? If it was in plain view, perhaps the officer could argue that it was in plain view and thus didn't require a search. But since he had to open the zipper, it seems like a search was involved.\n\nI recall that in Arizona v. Gant, the Supreme Court held that officers may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it's reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.\n\nIn this case, the offense of arrest is driving with a suspended license, which typically doesn't involve evidence in the car, unless perhaps there are documents or something. But cocaine is not evidence related to driving with a suspended license.\n\nSo, under Gant, it seems like the search might not be justified as a search incident to arrest because the cocaine isn't related to the offense of arrest, and she was already secured in the squad car, so she couldn't access the vehicle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the officer had probable cause to believe there was contraband in the car based on other information, but the question doesn't mention that.\n\nAnother consideration is the plain view doctrine. If the officer saw something in plain view that was incriminating, he could seize it without a warrant. But in this case, he had to open the zipper of the jacket to find the cocaine, so it wasn't in plain view.\n\nPerhaps there's an argument for inventory search, but the question doesn't indicate that the car was impounded or that an inventory search was conducted.\n\nGiven all this, it seems like the search might not be justified as a search incident to arrest, especially since the arrest was for a traffic violation related to her license, and the evidence found was for a separate crime.\n\nTherefore, the trial court might grant the suppression motion.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.\n\nThis seems plausible, given the Gant decision.\n\nB. No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.\n\nThis isn't accurate because there is an expectation of privacy in one's car, just reduced compared to a home.\n\nC. No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\n\nBut given Gant, it might not be valid, since the search wasn't related to the offense of arrest and she was already secured.\n\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n\nExigent circumstances might exist, but the question doesn't suggest any emergency situation.\n\nBetween A and D, A seems more precise because it relates specifically to the nature of the arrest and the lack of connection to the evidence found.\n\nSo, I think A is the most likely correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
