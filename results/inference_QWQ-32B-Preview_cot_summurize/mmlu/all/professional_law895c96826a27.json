                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure this out. So, there's a shooting incident, and the police chase one of the shooters into an apartment, where they arrest him. While in the apartment, a detective sees some antique furniture that looks really valuable and out of place. He checks the furniture and finds markings that suggest it was stolen from a museum six months earlier. Based on that, he seizes the items and arrests another person in the apartment for burglary. That person then files a motion to suppress the evidence, saying that the search was warrantless and without probable cause, and the police are relying on the plain view doctrine.\n\nSo, the question is, will the court likely suppress the evidence? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the plain view doctrine is. From what I recall, the plain view doctrine allows police officers to seize evidence without a warrant if certain conditions are met. The key elements are:\n\n1. The officer is lawfully present in the area where the evidence can be plainly seen.\n\n2. The incriminating nature of the evidence is immediately apparent.\n\n3. The officer has a lawful right of access to the evidence.\n\nIn this case, the officer entered the apartment in pursuit of a shooter, so I think that's considered exigent circumstances, which would justify the entry without a warrant. So, the officer is lawfully present in the apartment.\n\nNext, the officer sees the antique furniture, which seems out of place and of collectors' quality. He turns them over and finds markings that indicate they were stolen from a museum. So, the incriminating nature of the evidence becomes apparent when he examines the furniture.\n\nBut there's a catch here. The motion to suppress is based on the claim that there was no probable cause for the search and seizure. The defendant is arguing that the plain view doctrine doesn't apply because the officer didn't have probable cause to believe the items were contraband.\n\nI need to think about whether the officer's actions complied with the plain view doctrine.\n\nFirst, was the officer lawfully present in the apartment? Yes, because they entered in hot pursuit of a shooter, which is an exigent circumstance that allows warrantless entry.\n\nSecond, did the officer immediately see the evidence in plain view? Well, he saw the furniture, but the incriminating markings were only visible after he moved and turned over the pieces. So, was the incriminating nature immediately apparent, or did the officer have to manipulate the items to discover it?\n\nThis is a key point. In plain view cases, the incriminating nature of the evidence must be immediately apparent. If the officer has to conduct a further search or manipulate the items to discover the incriminating nature, it might not qualify for plain view.\n\nIn this scenario, the detective had to move and turn over the furniture to look for markings. That seems like more than just happening upon something in plain view; it requires some degree of handling and examination.\n\nAdditionally, the officer then calls headquarters to confirm that items with those markings were stolen six months earlier. So, the immediate recognition of the items as contraband wasn't obvious; it required verification.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the incriminating nature wasn't immediately apparent. The officer had to take additional steps to discover and confirm that the items were stolen.\n\nTherefore, the plain view doctrine might not apply here, which could lead the court to suppress the evidence.\n\nBut let's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, the evidence will be suppressed because the police can never search a personal residence or seize any unrelated items after entering for exigent circumstances dealing with something else.\n\nThis seems too broad. While it's true that warrantless searches are generally disfavored, especially in homes, there are exceptions like exigent circumstances and plain view. So, saying \"never\" is probably too absolute.\n\nB. No, the evidence was properly seized because the officer had a right to investigate it further once he had properly entered the apartment under exigent circumstances.\n\nThis suggests that once the officer is lawfully inside, they can investigate and seize anything they find, regardless of the plain view requirements. But that doesn't align with the limitations of the plain view doctrine, which requires that the incriminating nature be immediately apparent.\n\nC. No, the evidence was subject to further search and seizure because it was in plain view and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that it was contraband.\n\nThis option introduces \"reasonable suspicion,\" which is lower than probable cause but higher than just a hunch. However, in plain view cases, the incriminating nature must be immediately apparent, not just suspected.\n\nD. Yes, the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine does not apply where the officer had no probable cause to believe that the observed item was contraband.\n\nThis seems closest to the analysis I've done. The officer didn't have immediate knowledge that the items were contraband; he had to manipulate them and verify with headquarters to confirm their stolen status.\n\nTherefore, since the incriminating nature wasn't immediately apparent, the plain view doctrine doesn't apply, and the evidence should be suppressed.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the officer's actions were reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nThe officer entered lawfully due to exigent circumstances. He saw furniture that was out of place and of high value in a squalid apartment. That could raise suspicion that the furniture was stolen. Maybe that's enough to justify further investigation.\n\nHowever, turning over the furniture and examining it for markings might be considered a search, which would require probable cause or consent.\n\nIn Kentucky v. King, the Supreme Court held that police can rely on the plain view doctrine to seize evidence without a warrant if they are lawfully present and the incriminating nature of the evidence is immediately apparent.\n\nBut in this case, the incriminating nature wasn't immediately apparent; the officer had to manipulate the items to discover the markings and then confirm with headquarters that they were stolen.\n\nAnother case, Arizona v. Hicks, might be relevant here. In that case, the Supreme Court held that moving a piece of equipment to check its serial number was a search that required a warrant, even if the item was in plain view, because it wasn't immediately apparent that it was stolen.\n\nThis seems similar to the current scenario. The officer had to move the furniture and examine it to discover the incriminating markings.\n\nTherefore, based on Arizona v. Hicks, it seems likely that the court would find that the officer's actions constituted a search that required a warrant, and since there was no warrant, the evidence should be suppressed.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer: Yes, the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine does not apply where the officer had no probable cause to believe that the observed item was contraband.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other doctrine or exception that might apply.\n\nPerhaps the inevitable discovery doctrine could apply if the officer would have inevitably discovered the items anyway, but that seems unlikely in this context.\n\nOr maybe the plain touch doctrine, where an officer can feel an object to determine if it's a weapon, but in this case, the officer was examining for markings, not checking for weapons.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe the items were contraband before manipulating them. Seeing high-value furniture in a squalid apartment might raise suspicion, but is that enough to make the incriminating nature immediately apparent?\n\nIn some cases, the courts have allowed seizure based on reasonable suspicion, but in the context of plain view, the general rule is that the incriminating nature must be immediately apparent without further investigation.\n\nGiven that, it's still likely that the evidence would be suppressed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: Yes, the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine does not apply where the officer had no probable cause to believe that the observed item was contraband.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
