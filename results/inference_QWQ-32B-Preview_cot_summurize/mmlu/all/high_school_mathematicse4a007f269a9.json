                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: find the sum of the primes between 100 and 200, inclusive, that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square. The options are A. 102, B. 298, C. 256, D. 300.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it's asking. I need to find prime numbers between 100 and 200 that are either 1 or 2 more than some perfect square. Then, sum those primes up and see which option matches.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Primes between 100 and 200: that's a list of prime numbers in that range. Then, among these, pick those which can be expressed as \\( n^2 + 1 \\) or \\( n^2 + 2 \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. List all perfect squares such that \\( n^2 \\) is less than 200.\n\n2. For each of these squares, calculate \\( n^2 + 1 \\) and \\( n^2 + 2 \\).\n\n3. Check if these numbers are prime and lie between 100 and 200.\n\n4. Sum those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet me start by finding all perfect squares less than 200.\n\nThe square root of 200 is approximately 14.14, so \\( n \\) can be from 1 to 14.\n\nSo, perfect squares are:\n\n\\( 1^2 = 1 \\)\n\n\\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n\n\\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n\n\\( 4^2 = 16 \\)\n\n\\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n\n\\( 6^2 = 36 \\)\n\n\\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n\n\\( 8^2 = 64 \\)\n\n\\( 9^2 = 81 \\)\n\n\\( 10^2 = 100 \\)\n\n\\( 11^2 = 121 \\)\n\n\\( 12^2 = 144 \\)\n\n\\( 13^2 = 169 \\)\n\n\\( 14^2 = 196 \\)\n\nNow, for each of these, calculate \\( n^2 + 1 \\) and \\( n^2 + 2 \\), and check if they are prime and between 100 and 200.\n\nLet's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with \\( n = 10 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 100 \\)\n\n\\( 100 + 1 = 101 \\)\n\n\\( 100 + 2 = 102 \\)\n\nNow, check if 101 and 102 are prime.\n\n101 is a prime number.\n\n102 is even, so it's not prime.\n\nSo, 101 is a candidate.\n\nNext, \\( n = 11 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 121 \\)\n\n\\( 121 + 1 = 122 \\)\n\n\\( 121 + 2 = 123 \\)\n\nCheck if 122 and 123 are prime.\n\n122 is even, so not prime.\n\n123 is divisible by 3 (3*41=123), so not prime.\n\nNo primes here.\n\nNext, \\( n = 12 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 144 \\)\n\n\\( 144 + 1 = 145 \\)\n\n\\( 144 + 2 = 146 \\)\n\nCheck if 145 and 146 are prime.\n\n145 ends with 5, so divisible by 5 (29*5=145), not prime.\n\n146 is even, not prime.\n\nNothing here.\n\nNext, \\( n = 13 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 169 \\)\n\n\\( 169 + 1 = 170 \\)\n\n\\( 169 + 2 = 171 \\)\n\nCheck if 170 and 171 are prime.\n\n170 is even, not prime.\n\n171 is divisible by 3 (57*3=171), not prime.\n\nNo primes here.\n\nNext, \\( n = 14 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 196 \\)\n\n\\( 196 + 1 = 197 \\)\n\n\\( 196 + 2 = 198 \\)\n\nCheck if 197 and 198 are prime.\n\n197 is a prime number.\n\n198 is even, not prime.\n\nSo, 197 is a candidate.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other \\( n \\) beyond 14 whose squares are less than 200.\n\n\\( n = 15 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 225 \\), which is greater than 200, so we stop here.\n\nSo, the candidate primes are 101 and 197.\n\nNow, sum them up: 101 + 197 = 298.\n\nLooking at the options, B. 298 matches this sum.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there are any other \\( n \\) that I might have missed.\n\nLet's make sure that I've covered all possible \\( n \\) where \\( n^2 + 1 \\) or \\( n^2 + 2 \\) is between 100 and 200.\n\nStarting from \\( n = 10 \\) to \\( n = 14 \\), that seems complete.\n\nAlso, confirmed that 101 and 197 are primes.\n\nSo, the sum is indeed 298.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 298.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{298} \\]"
