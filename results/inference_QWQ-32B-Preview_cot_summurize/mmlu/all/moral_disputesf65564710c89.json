                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Mill's thoughts on what each person desires. So, Mill is a philosopher, right? John Stuart Mill, I think. He's known for his work in utilitarianism and liberalism. Okay, so the question is: Mill thinks that each person desires... and then there are four options: A. to do his or her duty. B. to be virtuous. C. his or her own happiness. D. none of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Mill's views on human desires and motivations. I remember that Mill is associated with utilitarianism, which is a theory that suggests actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they produce the opposite of happiness. So, happiness seems to be a key concept here.\n\nLet me think about option A: to do his or her duty. Duty is more of a deontological concept, associated with philosophers like Immanuel Kant, who argue that morality is about following duties and rules, regardless of the consequences. Mill, being a utilitarian, seems more focused on consequences and happiness rather than duties. So, maybe A isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B: to be virtuous. Virtue ethics is another approach to morality, focusing on character traits and virtues like courage, compassion, and honesty. While virtues are important, Mill's utilitarianism seems more concerned with the outcomes of actions rather than the virtues of the person performing them. So, perhaps B isn't the primary desire according to Mill.\n\nOption C: his or her own happiness. This seems aligned with Mill's utilitarian philosophy. In \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill argues that the ultimate goal is the greatest happiness for the greatest number. He also discusses individual happiness as a central concern. So, it makes sense that each person desires their own happiness.\n\nOption D: none of the above. Well, if C is correct, then D wouldn't apply.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look back at Mill's actual words to confirm. I recall that Mill distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures. He argues that some kinds of happiness are more valuable than others. But the core idea is still about happiness.\n\nIn his essay \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill writes, \"Utility, then, is that property in any object, whereby it tends to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness, or to prevent the happening of mischief, pain, evil, or unhappiness to any sentient being.\" This suggests that happiness is the central aim.\n\nFurthermore, Mill discusses the principle of utility as determining right actions based on their consequences in terms of happiness. So, it seems that happiness is a key concept in Mill's philosophy.\n\nBut is it accurate to say that each person desires their own happiness? Well, yes, generally speaking, people seek their own happiness and well-being. Mill would likely agree with that.\n\nOn the other hand, Mill also emphasizes the importance of considering the happiness of others, not just one's own. In fact, utilitarianism requires considering the overall happiness, not just individual happiness. But the question is about what each person desires, not necessarily what moral theory prescribes.\n\nPerhaps Mill would say that naturally, people desire their own happiness, but morally, they ought to consider the happiness of all. So, in terms of desires, it's their own happiness that they seek.\n\nLet me check if there's any specific passage where Mill talks about human desires. In \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill discusses the nature of happiness and the role it plays in moral decision-making. He argues that happiness is the only thing desired for its own sake, and all other desires are means to achieve happiness.\n\nSo, in that sense, each person desires their own happiness, and actions are evaluated based on how well they promote happiness in general.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider options A and B again. Does Mill discuss duty or virtue?\n\nIn Mill's work, particularly in his essay on Bentham, he discusses the role of duty in utilitarianism. He argues that duties are derived from the principle of utility, meaning that actions are duties if they promote happiness. So, duty is secondary to happiness in Mill's view.\n\nSimilarly, virtue is valued insofar as it contributes to happiness. So, while duty and virtue have their places in Mill's philosophy, they are instrumental to the greater end of happiness.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the fundamental desire Mill attributes to each person is their own happiness.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. his or her own happiness.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
