The landlord is suing the tenant for not paying rent after the fire, and we need to figure out who should win the case based on the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand the situation:\n\n- The landlord leased a three-story building and surrounding property to a tenant for six years, from December 1, 2003, to November 30, 2009.\n\n- On April 15, 2004, a neighbor was burning leaves and underbrush, which got carried by wind onto the tenant's property, causing a fire that damaged the building to the tune of $150,000.\n\n- Because of the fire, the tenant hasn't occupied the premises since, as the building is uninhabitable.\n\n- The state is a common law jurisdiction, and the statute of limitations for negligence is five years from when the cause of action accrues.\n\n- On May 1, 2004, the landlord sues the tenant for breach of contract for not paying rent.\n\nNow, the question is, who should win: the landlord or the tenant? And why?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The landlord, because the tenant remains liable to pay rent even if the property is uninhabitable due to fire.\n\nB. The landlord, because the covenant to pay rent runs with the land.\n\nC. The tenant, because it would be inequitable to enforce the rental provision when the premises are uninhabitable.\n\nD. The tenant, because some states have statutes that relieve tenants from paying rent when the premises are rendered uninhabitable by fire or other acts of God.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the basic principles of lease agreements and the obligations of both landlords and tenants.\n\nIn a standard lease agreement, the tenant agrees to pay rent in exchange for the right to use the property. The landlord agrees to provide the property in a condition suitable for the tenant's use, as specified in the lease.\n\nIn this case, the property was rendered uninhabitable due to a fire caused by a third party's negligence. So, the question is whether the tenant is still obligated to pay rent for a property they can't use.\n\nOption A suggests that the tenant remains liable for rent regardless of the property's condition. This might be the case if the lease specifically states that the tenant is responsible for paying rent no matter what happens to the property.\n\nOption B mentions that the covenant to pay rent runs with the land. This means that the obligation to pay rent transfers with the possession of the land. However, even if the covenant runs with the land, if the property is destroyed or rendered uninhabitable, the tenant's obligation might be affected.\n\nOption C argues that it would be inequitable to enforce the rental payment when the premises are uninhabitable. This seems fair; why should the tenant pay for a property they can't use?\n\nOption D suggests that some states have statutes relieving tenants from paying rent when the premises are rendered uninhabitable by fire or other acts of God. However, the scenario specifies that this is a common law jurisdiction, meaning that statutes might not override common law principles.\n\nIn common law, there are principles that address situations where the leased property is destroyed or becomes uninhabitable.\n\nOne key concept is the doctrine of \"constructive eviction.\" This occurs when the landlord fails to fulfill their obligations under the lease, making the property uninhabitable or unfit for its intended use. In such cases, the tenant may be relieved from their obligation to pay rent.\n\nAnother relevant principle is the \"impossibility of performance.\" If the property is destroyed or rendered unusable through no fault of the tenant, the tenant may be excused from their obligation to pay rent.\n\nIn this scenario, the fire was caused by a neighbor's negligence, not by the tenant or the landlord. So, neither party is at fault for the fire.\n\nHowever, under common law, the tenant's obligation to pay rent typically continues even if the property is destroyed or becomes uninhabitable, unless the lease specifically provides otherwise.\n\nBut, there's also the concept of \"condition precedent.\" If the premises being habitable is a condition precedent to the tenant's obligation to pay rent, then if the condition is not met, the tenant may not have to pay rent.\n\nGiven that this is a common law jurisdiction, and without any specific statute mentioned that relieves tenants from paying rent in case of fire, we might have to rely on common law principles.\n\nHowever, option D mentions that an \"increasing number of states have enacted statutes relieving a tenant of his obligation to pay rent where the premises are rendered uninhabitable by fire or other acts of God.\" Even though the jurisdiction is common law, it's possible that such a statute exists, but the scenario doesn't specify.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, let's analyze further.\n\nFirst, the fire was caused by a neighbor's negligence, which is likely considered an act of God or a third party's act, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if the property is destroyed without the fault of either party, the lease may be considered frustrated, and the tenant's obligation to pay rent may be suspended or terminated.\n\nMoreover, if the property is rendered uninhabitable, and the lease requires the landlord to provide habitable premises, the landlord may be in breach, leading to the tenant being relieved from their obligation to pay rent.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Landlord wins because tenant remains liable for rent despite the property being uninhabitable.\n\nB. Landlord wins because the covenant to pay rent runs with the land.\n\nC. Tenant wins because it's inequitable to enforce rent payment for an uninhabitable premises.\n\nD. Tenant wins because some states have statutes relieving tenants from paying rent when premises are rendered uninhabitable by fire or acts of God.\n\nGiven that it's a common law jurisdiction, option D might not apply, as it refers to statutes that may not be present.\n\nBetween options A and C, option C seems more equitable, but legality sometimes doesn't align with equity.\n\nHowever, in common law, the general rule is that the tenant remains liable for rent even if the property is destroyed or uninhabitable, unless the lease provides otherwise.\n\nBut, there are exceptions, such as when the destruction is due to the landlord's fault or when the lease makes habitability a condition precedent to the tenant's obligation to pay rent.\n\nIn this case, the fire was caused by a third party, so it's not the landlord's fault.\n\nTherefore, under the general common law rule, the tenant may still be liable for rent.\n\nBut option C appeals to equity, suggesting that it would be unfair to make the tenant pay for an uninhabitable property.\n\nIn practice, courts may consider the equities involved and possibly relieve the tenant from paying rent during the period the property is uninhabitable.\n\nHowever, based on standard common law principles, option A seems more accurate.\n\nOption B mentions that the covenant to pay rent runs with the land. This means that the obligation to pay rent transfers with the possession of the land. But even if the covenant runs with the land, if the property is destroyed or uninhabitable, the tenant's obligation might be affected.\n\nOption D is less likely to apply since it's a common law jurisdiction, and the scenario doesn't specify any such statute.\n\nTherefore, the most correct answer seems to be option A: the landlord, because the tenant remains liable to pay rent even though the property was rendered uninhabitable by fire.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that this is a general common law principle, and specific lease terms or local statutes could modify this outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, judgment should be for the landlord based on the standard common law principle that the tenant remains liable for rent payments even if the premises become uninhabitable due to fire or other causes not attributable to the landlord.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
