                    "text": "So I've got this question here about how the FASB makes changes to the Accounting Standards Codification. The options are:\n\nA. Accounting Standards Updates.\n\nB. Emerging Issues Task Force Releases.\n\nC. Statements of Financial Accounting Standards.\n\nD. Staff Technical Bulletins.\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct. Let's start by understanding what the FASB is and what the Accounting Standards Codification is.\n\nThe FASB, or the Financial Accounting Standards Board, is the main authoritative body for accounting standards in the United States. They establish the rules and guidelines that companies must follow when preparing their financial statements.\n\nThe Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, is like the official rulebook for accounting. It's a comprehensive database that organizes all the authoritative accounting standards issued by the FASB.\n\nNow, the question is asking how the FASB makes changes to this codification. So, I need to know what mechanism or type of document the FASB uses to update or amend the ASC.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Accounting Standards Updates.\n\nI've heard of ASUs, or Accounting Standards Updates. I think this is how the FASB issues updates to the ASC. Each ASU typically addresses a specific issue or topic and amends the existing codification accordingly.\n\nOption B: Emerging Issues Task Force Releases.\n\nThe Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, is a group that identifies and debates financial accounting issues that emerge in practice. They make recommendations to the FASB, and sometimes those recommendations are incorporated into the ASC via ASUs. But I don't think EITF releases directly change the codification.\n\nOption C: Statements of Financial Accounting Standards.\n\nSFAS, or Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, were the main way the FASB issued standards before the ASC was established. Prior to the ASC, the FASB would issue SFAS documents to establish new standards or amend existing ones. However, with the implementation of the ASC in 2009, the FASB stopped issuing SFAS and started using ASUs to update the codification.\n\nOption D: Staff Technical Bulletins.\n\nSTBs, or Staff Technical Bulletins, were issued by the FASB staff to provide guidance on implementing accounting standards. But they are not authoritative and do not carry the same weight as ASUs or SFAS. They are more like interpretations or explanations.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that ASUs are the primary way the FASB makes changes to the Accounting Standards Codification.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nBefore the ASC, the FASB issued SFAS to establish standards. After the ASC was implemented, the FASB stopped issuing SFAS and instead issues ASUs to update the codification.\n\nEITF releases can influence the FASB's decisions, but it's the FASB that ultimately issues ASUs to change the codification.\n\nSTBs are informational and don't have the authority to change the codification.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Accounting Standards Updates.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that EITF consensus outcomes are also incorporated into the ASC through ASUs. So, perhaps EITF releases do contribute to changes in the codification, but indirectly through ASUs.\n\nSimilarly, SFAS used to be the way to change standards before the ASC, but now it's ASUs.\n\nSo, in the current environment, ASUs are the primary means of updating the codification.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any other ways the FASB might change the codification.\n\nI know that the FASB also issues Accounting Standards Codification Updates, but I believe that's just another name for ASUs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they issue amendments directly, but I think ASUs are the vehicle for those amendments.\n\nSo, I think A is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA. Accounting Standards Updates."
