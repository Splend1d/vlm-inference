                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to recall what Keynesian economists believe. I think option C says that the economy is inherently stable, but I don't think that's what Keynesians would say. Keynesian economics is all about how government intervention can help stabilize the economy during downturns, so I guess they don't think the economy is inherently stable.\n\nOption D mentions that inadequate supply is largely to blame for periods of stagnation. Hmm, but isn't Keynesian economics more focused on demand-side issues? Like, during a recession, it's because there's not enough demand for goods and services, not necessarily a problem with supply. So maybe D isn't the right answer.\n\nOption A says that the investment demand curve is relatively elastic. I'm not sure about that. Elasticity refers to how much quantity changes in response to a price change. If the investment demand curve is elastic, that means that small changes in interest rates or other factors can lead to big changes in investment. I think Keynesians might believe that investment is interest-rate sensitive, so maybe A is a possibility.\n\nBut option B says that fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy. I remember that Keynesian economists often advocate for fiscal policy, like government spending and tax cuts, to stimulate the economy during recessions. They sometimes argue that monetary policy, which is controlled by the central bank, might not be as effective, especially when interest rates are already low.\n\nSo, comparing A and B, I think B is more directly associated with Keynesian economics. Keynes himself emphasized the role of government spending in pulling an economy out of a slump, and he was somewhat critical of relying solely on monetary policy.\n\nLet me just double-check. If Keynesians think that fiscal policy is more effective, that would mean they believe that government actions, like increasing spending or cutting taxes, can have a bigger impact on economic activity than actions by the central bank, like changing interest rates.\n\nAlso, I recall that during the Great Depression, Keynes argued that the government needed to step in and increase spending because the private sector wasn't doing enough on its own. That seems consistent with option B.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B: fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
