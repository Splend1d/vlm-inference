A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\nB. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's about water rights, specifically in a scenario where there's a stream running from a ranch on top of a mountain down to an estate below. There's a conflict between the rancher and the millionaire over the use of this stream's water.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal framework here. The problem states that the jurisdiction follows the common law of riparian rights but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation. So, riparian rights are the key here.\n\nRiparian rights generally mean that anyone who owns land adjacent to a body of water has the right to use that water. It's based on the idea that the water is part of the land it's connected to. In contrast, prior appropriation is more about who used the water first, regardless of land ownership.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\n\nWait, but in riparian rights, the key is adjacency, not necessarily the upstream position. So, both the rancher and the millionaire have riparian rights because their lands are adjacent to the stream. However, in some systems, upstream users do have priority, but the problem specifies that riparian rights are followed, not prior appropriation. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nB. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against agricultural use.\n\nThis seems plausible. Domestic use is often given higher priority than agricultural use in water rights law because people need water for drinking and sanitation before crops need it for irrigation.\n\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\n\nEasement by prescription usually requires continuous use for a certain period, which in this jurisdiction is 15 years. The millionaire started using the water in 1956, and the rancher in 1986. So, by 1996, the millionaire has been using the water for 40 years, which is well beyond the 15-year prescription period. But, does this create an easement for the water use?\n\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n\nThis seems similar to prior appropriation, but the jurisdiction doesn't follow that doctrine. However, since riparian rights also consider prior use and continuous use, it might still carry some weight.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, both the rancher and the millionaire are riparian owners since their lands are adjacent to the stream.\n\nUnder riparian rights, they both have the right to use the water, and the water should be divided equitably among them, considering the nature of their uses and the historical usage.\n\nThe millionaire started using the water in 1956 for irrigation, and the rancher started in 1986 for domestic purposes.\n\nIn times of water scarcity, like the drought in 1987, there isn't enough water to satisfy both uses fully.\n\nThe question is, who should get priority in such cases?\n\nOption A suggests that the upstream user (the rancher) has superior rights. But in riparian rights, it's more about adjacency than position along the stream. So, this might not be correct.\n\nOption B suggests that domestic use is superior to agricultural use. This is a strong argument because domestic needs are often prioritized in water law.\n\nOption C mentions that the millionaire has an easement by prescription. An easement by prescription is acquired through continuous, open, and uninterrupted use for the statutory period, which is 15 years in this case. The millionaire has been using the water for 40 years by 1996, so he might have an easement for the quantity he was using historically.\n\nOption D says the millionaire has prior use and continuous use, which, under riparian rights, could give him a stronger claim, especially if his use was established long before the rancher's.\n\nBut, domestic use is generally given higher priority than agricultural use. So, even if the millionaire has an established use, the rancher's domestic use might take precedence.\n\nHowever, the millionaire has been using the water for irrigation continuously for 40 years, which is much longer than the rancher's 10-year use for domestic purposes.\n\nMoreover, the problem mentions that the stream is non-navigable, which might be relevant in some water rights doctrines, but in riparian rights, navigability might not be as crucial.\n\nAlso, the jurisdiction has a 15-year prescription period, which the millionaire has far exceeded.\n\nIf the millionaire has an easement by prescription, that might lock in his right to use the water as he has been doing.\n\nBut, can an easement override domestic use priorities?\n\nI'm a bit confused here.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that under riparian rights, prior use and continuous use can establish a prescriptive right.\n\nGiven that the millionaire has been using the water for 40 years, and the rancher started using it only 10 years ago, it's possible that the millionaire's prescriptive right would take precedence.\n\nHowever, domestic use is often given special protection in water law.\n\nMaybe the court would balance the interests and try to allocate water to satisfy both uses to the extent possible.\n\nBut in this scenario, there's not enough water to go around during droughts.\n\nSo, who should get priority?\n\nIf the jurisdiction follows riparian rights and recognizes prescriptive easements, the millionaire might have a strong case for continuing his historical use.\n\nBut domestic use is crucial, and courts might prioritize that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rancher, as the upstream user, could argue that he's entitled to the natural flow of the stream, but I'm not sure if that's strictly aligned with riparian rights.\n\nWait, in riparian rights, both owners have a right to use the water, but they must do so reasonably and not unreasonably interfere with the other owner's use.\n\nIn cases of scarcity, courts often prioritize domestic use over other uses.\n\nBut, given that the millionaire has been using the water for 40 years, and the rancher for only 10, perhaps the court would recognize the millionaire's established use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court would consider the historical use and allocate water accordingly.\n\nGiven that the southern half of the estate was cleared and placed in cultivation before the millionaire purchased it, and he continued that use, it's possible that the water use was established even before his ownership.\n\nBut, I don't have information on whether the previous owner was also using the water for irrigation.\n\nAssuming the millionaire has been using the water for irrigation continuously since 1956, and the rancher started using it in 1986, by 1996, the millionaire has a well-established use.\n\nIn this jurisdiction, with a 15-year prescription period, his use might have ripened into an easement.\n\nTherefore, he could have a prescriptive right to the quantity of water he was using historically.\n\nOn the other hand, the rancher's domestic use is more recent but is of higher priority in terms of necessity.\n\nHowever, the millionaire has a prescriptive right that might entitle him to continue his historical use.\n\nPerhaps the court would recognize the millionaire's prescriptive right to the water he was using before the rancher started using it, and the rancher would be entitled to any remaining water.\n\nBut in this case, during droughts, there's not enough water for both.\n\nSo, the millionaire might be entitled to continue his historical use, and the rancher would have to make do with what's left.\n\nAlternatively, the court might prioritize domestic use and limit the millionaire's use accordingly.\n\nThis is a tricky one.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\n\nThis seems incorrect because riparian rights are based on adjacency, not just upstream position.\n\nB. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against agricultural use.\n\nThis has merit, but needs to be considered against the millionaire's prescriptive right.\n\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\n\nThis also has merit, given his long-term use.\n\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n\nThis is similar to option C, focusing on prior and continuous use.\n\nGiven that the jurisdiction recognizes prescriptive rights after 15 years, and the millionaire has used the water for 40 years, option C seems strong.\n\nBut, domestic use is often given priority in law, which complicates things.\n\nPerhaps the court would strike a balance, allowing both parties to use a portion of the water.\n\nHowever, the question asks for judgment in favor of whom.\n\nGiven the options, I think D is the most accurate, as the millionaire has prior and continuous use, which under riparian rights and prescriptive easement, would entitle him to continue his historical use.\n\nOption B is tempting, but the prescriptive right might override the domestic use priority.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court would prioritize domestic use and limit the millionaire's use accordingly.\n\nI'm torn between B and D.\n\nGiven that the jurisdiction follows riparian rights and recognizes prescriptive easements, and considering the long history of the millionaire's use, I think D is the correct answer.\n\nThe millionaire has put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used it, establishing a prescriptive right.\n\nTherefore, the judgment should be for the millionaire.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
