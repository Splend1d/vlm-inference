                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what happens in the long run when taxes are cut in an economy that's already at full employment. So, full employment means that pretty much everyone who wants to work has a job, and the economy is producing as much as it can with its current resources.\n\nNow, if taxes are cut, that means people and businesses have more disposable income. So, they might spend more, which could boost demand for goods and services. But since the economy is already at full employment, the productive capacity is maxed out. So, if demand increases but supply can't increase, what happens?\n\nI think the price level might rise because there's more demand chasing the same amount of goods and services. That sounds like inflation. So, option D says \"raise the price level,\" which seems plausible.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe in the long run, the tax cut could stimulate investment or encourage more people to work, which could increase the supply side of the economy. But the question says the economy is initially at full employment, so it's not clear if there's much room for increasing the labor force or productivity right away.\n\nLet me think about the AD-AS model. AD is aggregate demand, and AS is aggregate supply. A tax cut would shift the AD curve to the right because people have more money to spend. But in the long run, the AS curve is vertical at the full employment output level because that's the economy's potential output.\n\nSo, if AD shifts right and AS is vertical at full employment, then the equilibrium happens at a higher price level but the same real output. That sounds like option D: raise the price level.\n\nBut option A says \"raise real output and raise the price level.\" However, since the economy is already at full employment, it's hard to see how real output can increase in the long run. Maybe in the short run there's some boost, but in the long run, you can't sustain higher output beyond full employment without causing inflation.\n\nOption B says \"lower real output and raise the price level.\" That doesn't make sense to me because a tax cut should stimulate the economy, not shrink it.\n\nOption C says \"raise real output and lower the price level.\" Again, that doesn't align with the AD-AS model for full employment economy.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like D is the correct answer: the tax cut will raise the price level in the long run without increasing real output.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any other effects I might be missing. For example, maybe the tax cut encourages more work or investment, which could shift the AS curve to the right. But if the economy is already at full employment, it's not clear where that additional supply would come from. Perhaps over time, the tax cut could lead to more investment and capital accumulation, which could increase potential output, but that might be beyond the scope of the immediate question.\n\nAlternatively, if the tax cut leads to a budget deficit, that could have other effects on the economy, like higher interest rates crowding out private investment. But again, in the long run and in the context of full employment, it seems like the main effect would be on the price level.\n\nSo, I think D is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
