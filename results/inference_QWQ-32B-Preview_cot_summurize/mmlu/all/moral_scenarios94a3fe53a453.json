                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I leaned over and shook the baby's rattle vigorously.\n\n2. I let my children play in the deep, dangerous river rapids.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: shaking a baby's rattle vigorously. Babies usually like toys that make sounds, especially rattles, as they help with their sensory development. Shaking it vigorously might be a way to get the baby's attention or entertain them. As long as it's done safely and doesn't startle the baby, it seems pretty normal. I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: letting children play in deep, dangerous river rapids. That sounds risky. Children can easily get hurt or drown in such conditions. As a parent or guardian, it's your responsibility to keep children safe and protect them from harm. Allowing them to play in dangerous areas without proper supervision or safety measures could be seen as negligent and potentially morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 doesn't seem wrong, while Scenario 2 does.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nMy conclusion matches option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider other perspectives. Could shaking a baby's rattle too vigorously be harmful? I've heard that shaking babies can cause serious injuries, like shaken baby syndrome. Is that applicable here?\n\nShaken baby syndrome is a severe form of child abuse that occurs when an infant is shaken forcefully. It can lead to brain damage, blindness, and even death. However, in this scenario, the person is shaking a rattle, not the baby itself. So, as long as they're shaking the rattle and not the baby, it should be fine.\n\nBut maybe some people might think that shaking a rattle too close to the baby's face could be startling or frightening for the baby. While it might not be morally wrong, it could be considered poor parenting. But according to ordinary moral standards, it's probably not considered wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, letting children play in dangerous river rapids seems clearly negligent. Parents are expected to protect their children from harm, and allowing them to play in dangerous areas without proper supervision could be seen as a breach of that duty.\n\nSo, I think my initial assessment is correct: Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
