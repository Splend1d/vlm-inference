                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a wedding planner, a neighbor, and an access road to a summer cottage. Let's break it down step by step to figure out what kind of interest the wedding planner acquired in the access road.\n\nFirst, the wedding planner owned a summer cottage on a lake, and it was located on a knoll above the lake, which probably means it's a bit elevated or set back from the water. To make accessing the cottage easier, especially for motor vehicles, the wedding planner entered into an agreement with a neighboring landowner. This neighbor owned property adjacent to the wedding planner's land.\n\nIn this agreement, the neighbor granted the wedding planner a right-of-way over a specific strip of land: 30 feet wide and a quarter of a mile long, along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Importantly, this grant was in writing, which suggests it's a formal, legal agreement.\n\nSo, the wedding planner now has the right to use this strip of land for access to his cottage. Then, without notifying the neighbor, the wedding planner improved the road by having it asphalted to make it more suitable for motor vehicle traffic.\n\nA few years later, the neighbor started a sand business and began heavy hauling, which damaged the asphalt surface of the road. Despite this, the wedding planner sold his lakefront property to an artist ten years after the neighbor started his sand business.\n\nShortly after the artist took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, blocking access to the artist's property.\n\nNow, the question is: What is the best description of the interest that the wedding planner acquired in the access road?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. An easement in gross.\n\nB. An easement implied by prior use.\n\nC. An easement by necessity.\n\nD. An express easement.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\n**A. Easement in gross:**\n\nAn easement in gross is a right that benefits a particular individual or entity, rather than being tied to the land they own. For example, a utility company might have an easement in gross to maintain power lines across someone's property.\n\nIn this case, the right-of-way was granted to the wedding planner for access to his cottage. It seems to be tied to the land (the cottage), not just to the individual (the wedding planner). So, this might not fit perfectly.\n\n**B. Easement implied by prior use:**\n\nThis type of easement is implied based on the existing use of the land before it was divided among different owners. For example, if there was a path used by both parties before the land was sold, an easement might be implied to continue that use.\n\nIn this scenario, there's no mention of any prior use before the agreement was made. The neighbor granted the right-of-way in writing, which suggests it's an express agreement, not an implied one.\n\n**C. Easement by necessity:**\n\nAn easement by necessity arises when there's an absolute necessity for access to a landlocked property. For example, if the only way to access a property is through a neighbor's land, a court might imply an easement by necessity.\n\nHere, the wedding planner's cottage is on a knoll above the lake, but it's not necessarily landlocked since it's near a lake. Also, the neighbor granted an express right-of-way, so there might not be a need to imply an easement by necessity.\n\n**D. Express easement:**\n\nAn express easement is one that is clearly and explicitly granted, usually in writing, as in this case. The neighbor granted the wedding planner a right-of-way in writing, specifying the dimensions of the strip of land.\n\nThis seems to fit the scenario perfectly. The agreement was formal and explicit, defining the scope and nature of the right-of-way.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate description of the interest acquired by the wedding planner is an express easement.\n\nHowever, let's double-check to make sure.\n\nThe fact that the wedding planner improved the road by asphalting it suggests that he had the right to do so, which aligns with an express easement where such improvements might be permitted, especially if specified in the agreement.\n\nWhen the neighbor started a sand business and damaged the road, it indicates that the neighbor was aware of the easement but may have neglected the condition of the road.\n\nThen, when the wedding planner sold the property to the artist, the easement likely passed to the new owner, assuming it was properly recorded and attached to the land.\n\nFinally, when the neighbor blocked the road with wooden barriers, he was interfering with the easement, which would likely be a legal issue.\n\nGiven all this, the interest is best described as an express easement, which is option D.\n\nWait a minute, though. Let's consider if it could be an easement in gross again.\n\nAn easement in gross benefits a particular individual or entity, not the land itself. In this case, the right-of-way was for the benefit of the wedding planner's cottage, which suggests it's appurtenant to the land, meaning it benefits the land rather than a particular individual.\n\nIf it's appurtenant, then it's not an easement in gross but rather a typical easement appurtenant, which is usually expressed in writing.\n\nBut looking back at the options, \"express easement\" could encompass an easement appurtenant that is expressly granted in writing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a distinction here that I'm missing.\n\nLet me check the differences between an easement in gross and an easement appurtenant.\n\nAn easement appurtenant benefits the land and transfers with the land when it's sold, while an easement in gross benefits a particular individual or entity and doesn't necessarily transfer with the land.\n\nIn this case, the right-of-way was granted to the wedding planner for access to his cottage, suggesting it's for the benefit of the land (the cottage), not just the wedding planner personally.\n\nTherefore, it should be an easement appurtenant, not an easement in gross.\n\nBut the options don't include \"easement appurtenant.\" Instead, option D is \"express easement,\" which could cover both easements in gross and easements appurtenant that are expressly granted.\n\nHowever, given that the right was for access to a specific piece of land, it's more accurately an easement appurtenant.\n\nBut since that's not an option, and \"express easement\" is, that might be the best choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether the easement is in gross or appurtenant.\n\nGiven that the wedding planner sold the property to the artist, and the easement presumably transferred with the land, it suggests it's an easement appurtenant.\n\nBut again, the options don't include that specific term.\n\nOption A is \"easement in gross,\" which, as we've determined, doesn't fit as well as \"express easement.\"\n\nOptions B and C don't seem to apply as clearly as option D.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is D, an express easement.\n\nIt's important to note that in some jurisdictions, an express easement could be either in gross or appurtenant, depending on the language of the grant.\n\nHowever, given the context here, where the right-of-way is for access to a specific piece of land, it's more likely an easement appurtenant.\n\nBut since that's not an option, \"express easement\" is the best choice.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the neighbor granted the right in writing makes it express, not implied.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Not an easement in gross (option A), because it benefits the land, not just an individual.\n\n- Not easement implied by prior use (option B), because it was an express grant.\n\n- Not easement by necessity (option C), because there was an express grant and the property isn't necessarily landlocked.\n\n- Therefore, it's an express easement (option D).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) an express easement"
