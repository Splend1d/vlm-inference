Each ommatidium captures a small portion of the visual field, and the information from all the ommatidia is combined in the brain to form a complete image. This type of eye structure is common in arthropods and provides a wide field of view and good motion detection, although it may have lower resolution compared to vertebrate eyes.\n\n- **Eyespot**: A simple light-sensitive structure found in some unicellular organisms and primitive multicellular animals. It can detect the presence and direction of light but does not form images.\n\n- **Simple eye**: Also known as a lens eye, this type of eye uses a single lens to focus images onto a retina. Vertebrates, including humans, have simple eyes.\n\n- **Binocular eye**: This term refers to eyes that are capable of binocular vision, where both eyes work together to provide depth perception. Many mammals, including humans, have binocular vision.\n\nGiven that crustaceans and insects have compound eyes composed of numerous ommatidia, the correct answer is C. compound eye."
