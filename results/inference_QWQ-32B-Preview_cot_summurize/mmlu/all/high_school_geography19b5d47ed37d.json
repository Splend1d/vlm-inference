                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about East Asia's industrial regions. I need to pick the statement that's true among these options. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Japan has a rich natural resource base.\" Hmm, I know that Japan is a small island nation, and it's pretty mountainous. From what I've learned, Japan doesn't have a lot of natural resources, especially not in abundance. In fact, I think it imports most of its raw materials and energy sources, like oil and minerals. So, this statement seems false.\n\nOption B: \"China lacks natural resources but has a massive labor force.\" Okay, China is a huge country with a large population, so it definitely has a massive labor force. But does it lack natural resources? I don't think so. China has significant reserves of coal, rare earth metals, and other resources. So, saying it lacks natural resources seems incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"China is industrializing rapidly.\" This one sounds familiar. I've heard a lot about China's rapid economic growth and industrialization over the past few decades. It's often referred to as the \"world's factory\" because of its massive manufacturing sector. So, this seems like a true statement.\n\nOption D: \"Taiwan lacks industrial enterprise and an educated workforce.\" Wait a minute, Taiwan is known for its high-tech industries, like semiconductor manufacturing. Companies like TSMC are global leaders in semiconductor production. Also, Taiwan has a well-educated population, with a strong emphasis on education. So, this statement seems completely false.\n\nBased on this analysis, it looks like option C is the correct choice. China is indeed industrializing rapidly. The other statements seem to have inaccuracies or are outright false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
