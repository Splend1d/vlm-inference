                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There's a tube of water moving at half the speed of light relative to the lab frame, and a beam of light is entering the tube in the same direction. I need to find out the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame, and the index of refraction of water is given as 4/3. The options are A. 1/2 c, B. 2/3 c, C. 5/6 c, and D. 10/11 c.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the speed of light changes in different media. I know that in a medium with an index of refraction n, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. So, in water, the speed of light should be c divided by 4/3, which is 3c/4. But wait, this is in the rest frame of the water. However, in this problem, the water is moving at half the speed of light relative to the lab frame. So, I need to account for that motion as well.\n\nI think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity because we're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light. The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n\nv = (u + v') / (1 + (u * v') / c\u00b2)\n\nwhere:\n\n- u is the velocity of the first frame relative to the second,\n\n- v' is the velocity in the first frame,\n\n- v is the velocity in the second frame.\n\nIn this case, the water is moving at u = 0.5 c relative to the lab frame. The light is moving at v' = c in the water's rest frame. But wait, no. Actually, in the water's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n = 3c/4, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, u = 0.5 c (velocity of water relative to lab),\n\nv' = 3c/4 (speed of light in water relative to water).\n\nI need to find v, the speed of light in water relative to the lab frame.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nv = (u + v') / (1 + (u * v') / c\u00b2)\n\nv = (0.5 c + 0.75 c) / (1 + (0.5 c * 0.75 c) / c\u00b2)\n\nv = (1.25 c) / (1 + 0.375)\n\nv = (1.25 c) / 1.375\n\nv = (1.25 / 1.375) c\n\nNow, 1.25 divided by 1.375.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n1.25 \u00f7 1.375.\n\nAlternatively, 1.25 / 1.375 = (125 / 137.5) = (250 / 275) = (50 / 55) = (10 / 11).\n\nSo, v = 10/11 c.\n\nWait, but that's option D. Is that correct?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nFirst, speed of light in water in water's frame: c/n = 3c/4.\n\nThen, velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (u + v') / (1 + (u v') / c\u00b2)\n\nwith u = 0.5 c and v' = 0.75 c.\n\nSo, v = (0.5 + 0.75) / (1 + (0.5 * 0.75)) = 1.25 / (1 + 0.375) = 1.25 / 1.375 = 10/11 c.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, is there any relativistic effect I'm missing here? Or is this the complete solution?\n\nI think this is the correct approach. The index of refraction affects the speed of light in the medium, and then the motion of the medium relative to the lab frame requires using the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 10/11 c.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
