                    "text": "Let's tackle this equilibrium problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on equilibrium constants, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on. We have HI gas dissociating into hydrogen gas and iodine vapor. The equation should look like this:\n\n2HI(g) \u21cc H\u2082(g) + I\u2082(g)\n\nAnd we're given the equilibrium constant Kc is 21 at a certain temperature. We're also given that 15 grams of HI gas is introduced into a 12.0-liter flask and allowed to reach equilibrium. We need to find the molar concentration of iodine vapor at equilibrium.\n\nOkay, so I need to find [I\u2082] at equilibrium. To do that, I probably need to set up an ICE table. But first, I need to find the initial concentration of HI.\n\nLet's start by finding the initial moles of HI. We have 15 grams of HI. What's the molar mass of HI? Hydrogen is about 1 g/mol, and iodine is about 127 g/mol, so HI is roughly 128 g/mol.\n\nSo, moles of HI = 15 g / 128 g/mol = 0.1171875 moles.\n\nNow, the initial concentration of HI is moles divided by volume:\n\n[HI] initial = 0.1171875 mol / 12.0 L = 0.009765625 M.\n\nAlright, now I can set up my ICE table. Let's represent the change in concentration of HI as -2x, since two moles of HI dissociate to produce one mole of H\u2082 and one mole of I\u2082.\n\nSo, the ICE table looks like this:\n\nInitial:\n\n[HI] = 0.009765625 M\n\n[H\u2082] = 0 M\n\n[I\u2082] = 0 M\n\nChange:\n\n[HI] = -2x\n\n[H\u2082] = +x\n\n[I\u2082] = +x\n\nEquilibrium:\n\n[HI] = 0.009765625 - 2x\n\n[H\u2082] = x\n\n[I\u2082] = x\n\nNow, the equilibrium constant expression for Kc is:\n\nKc = [H\u2082][I\u2082] / [HI]^2\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n21 = (x)(x) / (0.009765625 - 2x)^2\n\nSo, 21 = x\u00b2 / (0.009765625 - 2x)^2\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Solving this might be a bit tricky, but let's see.\n\nFirst, take the square root of both sides to simplify:\n\nsqrt(21) = x / (0.009765625 - 2x)\n\nsqrt(21) is approximately 4.5826.\n\nSo, 4.5826 = x / (0.009765625 - 2x)\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 4.5826 * (0.009765625 - 2x)\n\nx = 4.5826 * 0.009765625 - 4.5826 * 2x\n\nx = 0.0447265625 - 9.1652x\n\nNow, add 9.1652x to both sides:\n\nx + 9.1652x = 0.0447265625\n\n10.1652x = 0.0447265625\n\nNow, divide both sides by 10.1652:\n\nx = 0.0447265625 / 10.1652 \u2248 0.004401 M\n\nSo, [I\u2082] at equilibrium is x, which is approximately 0.004401 M.\n\nBut let's check if this makes sense. Let's see if the quadratic approximation holds. The initial [HI] is 0.009765625 M, and x is 0.004401 M. So, 2x is 0.008802 M.\n\nSubtracting 2x from [HI] initial: 0.009765625 - 0.008802 = 0.000963625 M.\n\nThis is much smaller than the initial [HI], so the approximation might not be great, but let's see.\n\nLet's plug x back into the Kc expression to verify:\n\nKc = (x)^2 / (0.009765625 - 2x)^2 = (0.004401)^2 / (0.000963625)^2\n\n= 0.000019368 / 0.0000009286 \u2248 20.86, which is close to 21, so it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, [I\u2082] = x \u2248 0.004401 M.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 4.58 mol/L - that's way too high.\n\nB. 0.00687 mol/L - higher than my answer.\n\nC. 4.4 \u00d7 10^-3 M - that's 0.0044 M, which matches my calculation.\n\nD. 9.76 \u00d7 10^-3 M - that's 0.00976 M, higher than my answer.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 4.4 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nWait a minute, but in the options, C is 4.4 \u00d7 10^-3 M, which is 0.0044 M, and my calculation gave me 0.004401 M, which matches.\n\nBut let's see why option D is 9.76 \u00d7 10^-3 M. That's interesting because 9.76 \u00d7 10^-3 is close to the initial [HI] of 0.009765625 M.\n\nMaybe someone thought to use the initial [HI] as the answer, but that's not correct because we need the equilibrium concentration of I\u2082, which is x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they misapplied the stoichiometry.\n\nBut based on my calculation, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
