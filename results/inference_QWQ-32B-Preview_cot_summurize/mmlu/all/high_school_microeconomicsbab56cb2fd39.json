                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. We've got a firm in a perfectly competitive market that makes a technological innovation, which significantly increases its marginal physical product (MPP). We need to figure out what happens to the firm\u2019s employment level and workers\u2019 wages as a result.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand the key concepts here. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers, meaning they have no control over the price of the goods they sell or the wages they pay their workers. The price of the goods is determined by the market supply and demand, and wages are determined by the equilibrium in the labor market.\n\nNow, marginal physical product (MPP) is the additional output produced by hiring one more unit of labor. So, if this firm\u2019s MPP increases due to a technological innovation, that means each worker is now more productive and can produce more output per hour.\n\nIn microeconomics, firms decide how many workers to hire based on the marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor. MRP is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker, which is equal to the marginal physical product (MPP) multiplied by the marginal revenue (MR) of the output. In perfect competition, MR is equal to the price of the good (since the firm can sell additional units at the market price). So, MRP = MPP * P.\n\nThe firm will hire workers up to the point where the MRP equals the wage rate (W). So, the hiring condition is MRP = W.\n\nNow, let's see what happens when MPP increases due to the innovation.\n\nSince MPP increases, and P is constant (because the firm is a price taker), MRP increases. So, MRP = (higher MPP) * P.\n\nThis means that for any given wage rate, the firm now gets more revenue from each additional worker. Therefore, the firm will find it profitable to hire more workers until the new MRP equals the wage rate.\n\nSo, the firm will hire more workers.\n\nNow, what about wages? In a perfectly competitive labor market, wages are determined by the market equilibrium of labor supply and demand. Since this is just one firm innovating and not all firms, the overall labor market conditions don\u2019t change immediately. So, the wage rate remains the same in the short run.\n\nTherefore, the firm hires more workers at the same wage rate.\n\nBut wait, option D says the firm hires more workers and pays them higher wages. Option C says the firm hires more workers but doesn\u2019t raise their wages.\n\nGiven our analysis so far, it seems like option C is more accurate because wages are determined by the market and don\u2019t change due to one firm\u2019s innovation.\n\nHowever, let's think deeper. If this firm becomes more productive and starts hiring more workers, could that affect the local labor market and potentially bid up wages?\n\nIn the short run, probably not, because the firm is just one among many in the labor market, and the overall labor supply is large. So, wages are likely to remain constant.\n\nBut in the long run, if the firm continues to hire more workers and becomes more profitable, it might attract more workers to the area, increasing labor supply, or other firms might try to copy the technology, changing the overall dynamics. But in the context of this question, which seems to be focusing on the short run, wages remain constant.\n\nOption A says reduce the firm\u2019s employment level because fewer workers are now needed. But that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019ve concluded. Since each worker is more productive, the firm can produce more with the same number of workers, but because the MRP has increased, the firm finds it profitable to hire more workers, not fewer.\n\nOption B says raise the workers\u2019 hourly wage as they now contribute more marginal revenue. But in perfect competition, the firm is a wage taker and can\u2019t unilaterally change wages. Wages are determined by the market.\n\nOption D says lead the firm to hire more workers and to pay them higher wages. But again, in perfect competition, the firm can\u2019t pay higher wages unless the market wage increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer seems to be C: lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages.\n\nWait a minute, but let's consider another angle. If the firm\u2019s MPP increases, and it hires more workers, and if other firms don\u2019t have access to this technology, then the demand for labor by this firm increases, which might slightly increase the wage rate in the local labor market.\n\nHowever, in perfect competition, the labor market is assumed to be large enough that one firm\u2019s actions don\u2019t affect the market wage. So, even if this firm hires more workers, it won\u2019t drive up wages because there are many other workers available in the market.\n\nTherefore, the wage rate remains unchanged, and the firm hires more workers at the same wage.\n\nHence, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let\u2019s think about what would happen if the innovation was adopted by other firms as well.\n\nIf other firms also adopt the same technology, then the overall MPP in the industry increases, which would increase the demand for labor in the entire industry. This could shift the labor demand curve to the right, leading to an increase in the equilibrium wage rate.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, only one firm has made the innovation, and it\u2019s not specified that other firms can copy it immediately. So, we should assume that only this one firm\u2019s MPP increases, and others remain the same.\n\nTherefore, only this firm\u2019s labor demand increases, but the overall labor market remains unchanged, and wages stay the same.\n\nThus, the firm hires more workers at the same wage rate.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
