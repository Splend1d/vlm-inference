                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about direct labor variances. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The company predicted they'd make 10,000 units in March, and each unit was supposed to take 2.4 direct labor hours at $20 per hour. So, the standard cost per unit is $48. But actually, they made 9,000 units, each taking 2.5 hours, and they paid $21 per hour, making the actual cost per unit $52.50. I need to find the direct labor rate variance for March.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a direct labor rate variance is. I think it's the difference between the actual cost per hour and the standard cost per hour, multiplied by the actual hours worked. Yeah, that sounds right. So, the formula should be:\n\nDirect labor rate variance = (Actual rate - Standard rate) \u00d7 Actual hours worked.\n\nOkay, so I need to plug in the actual rate, standard rate, and actual hours worked.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Standard rate is $20 per hour.\n\n- Actual rate is $21 per hour.\n\n- Actual hours worked are 9,000 units \u00d7 2.5 hours per unit.\n\nLet me calculate the actual hours worked:\n\n9,000 units \u00d7 2.5 hours/unit = 22,500 hours.\n\nNow, plug these into the formula:\n\nDirect labor rate variance = ($21 - $20) \u00d7 22,500 hours = $1 \u00d7 22,500 = $22,500.\n\nSo, the variance is $22,500.\n\nBut wait, I should check if it's favorable or unfavorable. Since the actual rate is higher than the standard rate, this variance is unfavorable. Maybe I should put it as $22,500 unfavorable.\n\nBut looking back at the options, it's just asking for the amount, and $22,500 is one of the choices.\n\nLet me see if I missed something. Is there any other factor I need to consider?\n\nOh, I remember that sometimes variances can be calculated differently, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should confirm if the actual cost per unit is relevant here. Wait, the actual cost per unit is given as $52.50, which is based on 2.5 hours at $21 per hour. But for the rate variance, I'm only concerned with the rate per hour and the actual hours worked.\n\nSo, $22,500 seems correct.\n\nLet me consider if the predicted production affects this variance. The company predicted 10,000 units but only made 9,000. Does this impact the rate variance?\n\nI think the rate variance is only about the rate paid per hour compared to the standard, based on actual hours worked. So, the predicted production shouldn't affect this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $22,500.\n\nBut let me double-check the options:\n\nA. $18,000\n\nB. $22,500\n\nC. $25,000\n\nD. $40,500\n\n$22,500 is option B.\n\nIs there a chance I need to calculate something else, like the efficiency variance or total labor variance?\n\nNo, the question specifically asks for the direct labor rate variance, so $22,500 should be the correct answer.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
