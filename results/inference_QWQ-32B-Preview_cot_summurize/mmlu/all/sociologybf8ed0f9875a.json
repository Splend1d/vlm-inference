                    "text": "Let's think about this problem step by step. So, there's a new highway being built from a major city through an area that's currently used for farmland. We need to figure out what's most likely to happen as a result of this development. There are four options:\n\nA. Farmers will increase the acreage under production.\n\nB. The city will evolve into a multiple nuclei model.\n\nC. Suburbanization will develop because the time it takes to commute to the city has been decreased.\n\nD. People from the countryside will move to the city, depopulating the farmland region.\n\nFirst, let's consider what a highway does. It provides better connectivity between different areas. In this case, it connects the major city to the farmland area. So, it's likely to affect both the city and the surrounding countryside.\n\nOption A suggests that farmers will increase the acreage under production. Well, building a highway through farmland might actually reduce the amount of available farmland, since some land is used for the highway. So, it's unlikely that farmers would increase acreage under production because of this. In fact, they might have less land to farm.\n\nOption B talks about the city evolving into a multiple nuclei model. A multiple nuclei model is a urban geography concept where instead of one central business district, a city has several centers of activity. This can happen when different parts of the city develop their own commercial or industrial areas. Building a highway might facilitate the development of new centers away from the main city center, but it's not directly related to the farmland area.\n\nOption C suggests that suburbanization will develop because commuting time to the city has decreased. Suburbanization is the process where people move from the city to the suburbs, which are areas outside the city but within commuting distance. If the highway reduces commuting time, it makes it more attractive for people to live outside the city and work in the city. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D proposes that people from the countryside will move to the city, depopulating the farmland region. This could happen if the highway makes it easier for rural residents to access urban job opportunities, but it's also possible that the improved connectivity could lead to development in the countryside, attracting more people to stay or move there.\n\nComparing options C and D, option C seems more directly related to the construction of the highway through farmland. The highway improves access to the city, which could encourage suburban development in the farmland area. On the other hand, option D suggests that people move from the countryside to the city, which might not necessarily be the case if the highway also provides better opportunities in the countryside.\n\nAdditionally, option A seems unlikely because the highway might reduce farmland. Option B is possible, but it's more about the city's internal structure rather than the impact on the farmland area.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that suburbanization will develop because the time it takes to commute to the city has been decreased.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
