I need to figure out if these events are independent, mutually exclusive, or neither.\n\nFirst, I recall that for two events to be mutually exclusive, their intersection should have a probability of zero. That is, P(E \u2229 F) = 0. But here, P(E \u2229 F) = 0.048, which is not zero. So, events E and F are not mutually exclusive.\n\nNext, for independence, I know that two events are independent if P(E \u2229 F) equals P(E) times P(F). So, I should calculate P(E) * P(F) and see if it equals P(E \u2229 F).\n\nLet me do that: P(E) * P(F) = 0.32 * 0.15. Let's see, 32 times 15 is 480, so 0.32 * 0.15 = 0.048.\n\nWait a minute, P(E \u2229 F) is also 0.048. So, P(E \u2229 F) = P(E) * P(F), which means events E and F are independent.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that they are not mutually exclusive. So, the correct conclusion should be that the events are independent but not mutually exclusive.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The events E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive.\n\nBut we saw they are not mutually exclusive, so A is incorrect.\n\nB. The events E and F are neither independent nor mutually exclusive.\n\nBut they are independent, so B is incorrect.\n\nC. The events E and F are mutually exclusive but not independent.\n\nAgain, they are not mutually exclusive, so C is incorrect.\n\nD. The events E and F are independent but not mutually exclusive.\n\nThis matches what I concluded.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
