                    "text": "So I've got this question here about diodes when they're reverse biased. It asks, \"A diode (p-n junction) when reverse biased acts as...\" and then gives options: A. On Switch, B. Zener diode, C. Capacitor, D. Off Switch. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that a diode is a p-n junction that allows current to flow in one direction, right? So, when it's forward biased, it conducts, and when it's reverse biased, it shouldn't conduct. But the question is asking what it acts like when it's reverse biased.\n\nOption A says \"On Switch.\" Well, if it's on, that would mean it's conducting, but reverse bias is supposed to turn it off. So that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says \"Zener diode.\" Now, Zener diodes are special diodes that can conduct in reverse bias beyond a certain voltage, called the Zener voltage. But the question is about a regular p-n junction diode, not a Zener diode. So, I don't think that's the answer.\n\nOption C says \"Capacitor.\" Interesting. I recall that in reverse bias, the p-n junction behaves somewhat like a capacitor because the depletion region acts as an insulator with conductive plates on either side. So, maybe it does act like a capacitor to some extent.\n\nOption D says \"Off Switch.\" Well, that aligns with what I initially thought: in reverse bias, the diode shouldn't conduct, so it's like an open switch.\n\nBut wait, if it's acting like a capacitor, then it might allow high-frequency AC to pass through while blocking DC, which is different from just being an open switch. So, there might be more to it.\n\nLet me think about this. In reverse bias, the diode has a depletion region that's wide, and the junction doesn't conduct until the breakdown voltage is reached. So, under normal reverse bias conditions, it should act like an open switch, not allowing any current to flow.\n\nHowever, capacitors can store electrical energy in an electric field, and the depletion region in a reverse-biased diode does have a certain capacitance because it's essentially an insulator between two conductive regions.\n\nIn some applications, especially at high frequencies, the diode's junction capacitance can become significant. So, in those cases, the diode might act like a capacitor rather than just an open switch.\n\nBut for DC conditions, it should act like an open switch.\n\nThe question doesn't specify the frequency or the bias level, so I'm a bit confused.\n\nMaybe the best answer is \"Off Switch\" because that's the general behavior in reverse bias, and \"Capacitor\" could be a secondary effect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's \"Capacitor\" because that's a more precise description of its behavior in reverse bias.\n\nLet me check a reference. (Pauses to imagine looking something up.)\n\nAh, according to my electronics textbook, in reverse bias, the p-n junction behaves like a capacitor due to the depletion region acting as the dielectric. The capacitance is known as junction capacitance.\n\nSo, it seems that \"Capacitor\" is a more accurate description of how a reverse-biased diode behaves.\n\nBut, in many practical circuits, especially at low frequencies, this capacitance might be negligible, and the diode is just considered off.\n\nHowever, since the question is asking about what it acts like when reverse biased, and considering that it does exhibit capacitance in that state, I think \"Capacitor\" is the correct answer.\n\nOption C makes the most sense in terms of the electrical behavior of the diode in reverse bias.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the answer is both \"Off Switch\" and \"Capacitor.\" But since it's a multiple-choice question with only one answer, I need to pick the most appropriate one.\n\nIn linear circuits, the capacitance might be relevant, whereas in switching circuits, it might be more straightforward to consider it as an off switch.\n\nPerhaps the question expects \"Off Switch\" as the answer, considering the diode's primary function.\n\nBut I think, technically speaking, \"Capacitor\" is more accurate because it describes the actual electrical behavior in reverse bias.\n\nI should probably go with C. Capacitor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
