                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about Corvino's view on harm arguments against homosexuality. I think the key here is understanding what Corvino sees as a problematic hidden assumption in these arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what harm arguments against homosexuality typically claim. These arguments usually suggest that homosexuality is wrong or immoral because it causes harm, either to the individuals involved or to society at large. This harm might be emotional, physical, or social.\n\nNow, Corvino, I believe, is a philosopher who has written about homosexuality and morality. He likely critiques these harm arguments by pointing out flaws in their reasoning or underlying assumptions.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. If a practice is riskier than the alternatives, then that practice is moral, prudent, or otherwise to be pursued.\n\nB. If a practice is riskier than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided.\n\nC. If a practice is safer than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nI need to think about which of these assumptions would be problematic in the context of harm arguments against homosexuality.\n\nOption A suggests that riskier practices are moral or prudent to pursue. That seems counterintuitive because generally, riskier practices are avoided unless there are overriding benefits. So, this doesn't seem like a hidden assumption that harm arguments would make.\n\nOption B states that if a practice is riskier than alternatives, it's immoral or imprudent to engage in it. This seems more plausible as a hidden assumption in harm arguments. If homosexuality is considered riskier than heterosexuality in certain aspects, then concluding it's immoral or should be avoided follows from this assumption.\n\nOption C says that if a practice is safer than alternatives, it's immoral or imprudent to engage in it. This seems contrary to common sense, as safer practices are usually preferred. So, it's unlikely to be a hidden assumption in harm arguments.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which I'll consider if none of the other options seem fitting.\n\nGiven this, I think Option B is the most likely candidate for the problematic hidden assumption that Corvino identifies. Harm arguments against homosexuality might assume that because homosexuality is riskier in some ways (e.g., higher rates of mental health issues due to social stigma), it's therefore immoral or should be avoided.\n\nHowever, Corvino might argue that this assumption is problematic because not all risky practices are immoral or imprudent. Sometimes, people choose to engage in risky behaviors for various reasons, and morality isn't solely determined by risk levels.\n\nMoreover, Corvino might contend that the risks associated with homosexuality are often due to societal attitudes and discrimination rather than inherent aspects of homosexuality itself. Therefore, concluding that homosexuality is immoral based on these risks is flawed.\n\nIn summary, I believe the answer is Option B: If a practice is riskier than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided. This seems to be the problematic hidden assumption that Corvino takes issue with in harm arguments against homosexuality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
