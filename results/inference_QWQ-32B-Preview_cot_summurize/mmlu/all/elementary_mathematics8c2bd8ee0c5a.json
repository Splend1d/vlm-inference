                    "text": "Let's tackle this inequality problem. The inequality we're dealing with is 2x - 1 < 10, and we need to find out which set of numbers makes this inequality true. We have four options: A, B, C, and D, each containing three numbers. Our goal is to check each number in these sets to see if they satisfy the inequality.\n\nFirst, I think it would be helpful to solve the inequality for x to understand what values of x make it true. This way, instead of plugging in each number from the sets, I can determine the range of x that satisfies the inequality and then see which set entirely falls within that range.\n\nSo, let's solve 2x - 1 < 10 for x.\n\nStep 1: Add 1 to both sides of the inequality to isolate the term with x.\n\n2x - 1 + 1 < 10 + 1\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x < 11\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x.\n\n2x / 2 < 11 / 2\n\nx < 5.5\n\nSo, the inequality 2x - 1 < 10 is true for all x less than 5.5.\n\nNow, I need to look at each set and check if all the numbers in the set are less than 5.5.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nOption A: {10, 15, 20}\n\nLooking at these numbers:\n\n10 is greater than 5.5\n\n15 is greater than 5.5\n\n20 is greater than 5.5\n\nNone of these numbers are less than 5.5, so option A is not the correct choice.\n\nOption B: {5, 7, 9}\n\nLet's check each number:\n\n5 is equal to 5, which is not less than 5.5\n\n7 is greater than 5.5\n\n9 is greater than 5.5\n\nSince not all numbers are less than 5.5 (in fact, only one is equal to 5 and the others are greater), option B is not the correct choice.\n\nOption C: {4, 6, 8}\n\nChecking each number:\n\n4 is less than 5.5\n\n6 is greater than 5.5\n\n8 is greater than 5.5\n\nHere, only one number (4) is less than 5.5, while the others are greater. Therefore, option C does not meet the criteria.\n\nOption D: {2, 3, 4}\n\nLet's verify each number:\n\n2 is less than 5.5\n\n3 is less than 5.5\n\n4 is less than 5.5\n\nAll three numbers in this set are less than 5.5, which means they all satisfy the inequality 2x - 1 < 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option D.\n\nTo summarize, by solving the inequality to find that x must be less than 5.5 and then checking each set to see if all its elements are less than 5.5, we can confidently select option D as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
