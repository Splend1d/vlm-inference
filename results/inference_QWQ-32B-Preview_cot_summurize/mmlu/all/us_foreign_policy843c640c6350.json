The options are:\n\nA. national security adviser.\n\nB. director of the CIA.\n\nC. secretary of defense.\n\nD. secretary of state.\n\nHmm, let's see. The president has a lot of advisers, but I need to find out who specifically advises on military issues as a civilian.\n\nFirst, what does \"principal civilian adviser on the military\" mean? It means the main person who gives advice to the president about military matters, and this person is a civilian, not a military officer.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. National security adviser: This person is involved in national security issues, which include military matters, but is this their primary role regarding military advice?\n\nB. Director of the CIA: The CIA is more about intelligence gathering and analysis. While intelligence is important for military decisions, is the CIA director the main military adviser?\n\nC. Secretary of defense: This seems likely because the Department of Defense is in charge of the military. So, the secretary of defense should be the main civilian adviser on military matters.\n\nD. Secretary of state: This person deals with foreign affairs and diplomacy. While military issues can be related to foreign policy, is this their main role in advising on military matters?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the chain of command and who has direct responsibility for the military.\n\nI know that the president is the commander-in-chief, and the secretary of defense is in charge of the Department of Defense, which includes the military branches.\n\nSo, the secretary of defense would be the civilian leader of the military, and therefore, should be the main adviser to the president on military matters.\n\nLet me check what the national security adviser does. The national security adviser is part of the National Security Council and advises the president on national security and foreign policy issues. While this includes military matters, it seems more broad than just military issues.\n\nThe director of the CIA is responsible for intelligence, which supports military operations, but again, not directly in charge of military advice.\n\nThe secretary of state is more focused on diplomacy and foreign affairs, although military issues can be part of that.\n\nSo, comparing all these roles, it seems that the secretary of defense is the principal civilian adviser on military matters.\n\nBut let me make sure. Maybe there's some overlap or specific provisions in law or practice that make it different.\n\nIn the National Security Act of 1947, it established the National Military Establishment, which later became the Department of Defense. The secretary of defense is the head of that department and is the president's principal assistant for matters relating to the Department of Defense.\n\nThat sounds like they are the main adviser on military matters.\n\nAlso, during National Security Council meetings, the secretary of defense would provide input on military issues, whereas the national security adviser helps coordinate national security policy.\n\nSo, while the national security adviser plays a crucial role in coordinating advice, the secretary of defense is the one who directly advises on military matters.\n\nSimilarly, the CIA director provides intelligence, which informs military decisions, but doesn't directly advise on military strategy or operations.\n\nThe secretary of state might advise on the diplomatic implications of military actions, but again, not specifically on military matters.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be C. secretary of defense.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should look up the official descriptions of these positions.\n\nAccording to the U.S. government's website, the secretary of defense is responsible for providing the president with military advice and overseeing the Department of Defense.\n\nThe national security adviser is described as a key adviser to the president on national security and foreign policy issues, but not specifically on military matters.\n\nThe director of the CIA is responsible for intelligence collection and analysis.\n\nThe secretary of state is the chief foreign affairs adviser.\n\nSo, based on this, it's clear that the secretary of defense is the president's principal civilian adviser on military matters.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
