I need to find one point that must be on the graph of y = h(x) and then find the sum of the coordinates of that point.\n\nAlright, first things first. If (3,6) is on the graph of y = g(x), that means that when x is 3, g(3) is 6. So, g(3) = 6.\n\nNow, h(x) is defined as (g(x))^2. So, for any x, h(x) is just the square of g(x).\n\nI need to find a point on the graph of y = h(x). Since I know g(3) = 6, maybe I can use that to find h(3).\n\nLet me try that. h(3) = (g(3))^2 = 6^2 = 36.\n\nSo, when x is 3, h(3) is 36. That means the point (3,36) is on the graph of y = h(x).\n\nNow, the question asks for the sum of the coordinates of that point. So, the coordinates are 3 and 36. Adding them together: 3 + 36 = 39.\n\nLooking back at the options, 39 is one of the choices. So, it seems like the answer is 39.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there's any other point that must be on the graph of y = h(x). The problem says \"one point\", and it's clear that (3,36) is such a point based on the given information.\n\nI don't think there's any other point that we can definitively say must be on the graph of y = h(x) with the information given. So, (3,36) seems to be the correct point, and the sum of its coordinates is 39.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{39} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{39} \\]"
