                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the molarity of a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. We know that it requires 42.6 mL of 0.108 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) to neutralize 40.0 mL of the NaOH solution. Let's go through the steps to find the answer.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the chemical reaction between NaOH and HCl. Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid react in a 1:1 molar ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{NaOH} + \\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{NaCl} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\nThis means that one mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of HCl.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of HCl used in the reaction. We can calculate this using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles} = \\text{molarity} \\times \\text{volume} \\]\n\nThe volume needs to be in liters, so we convert 42.6 mL to liters:\n\n\\[ 42.6 \\, \\text{mL} = 0.0426 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the moles of HCl:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of HCl} = 0.108 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.0426 \\, \\text{L} = 0.0046128 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nSince the reaction is 1:1, the number of moles of NaOH is equal to the number of moles of HCl:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of NaOH} = 0.0046128 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the molarity of the NaOH solution. We know the volume of the NaOH solution is 40.0 mL, which is 0.0400 L. Molarity is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{molarity} = \\frac{\\text{moles}}{\\text{volume}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{molarity of NaOH} = \\frac{0.0046128 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.0400 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.11532 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures, this is approximately 0.115 M.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.0641 M\nB. 1.64 M\nC. 0.115 M\nD. 0.400 mol/L\n\nThe correct answer is C. 0.115 M.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
