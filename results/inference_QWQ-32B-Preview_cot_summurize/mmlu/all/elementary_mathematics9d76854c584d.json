We need to find out how much money they have left after these purchases.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much they spent in total. Sonia spent $12.35 and Negin spent $10.11. So, total spending is $12.35 + $10.11.\n\nLet me add those up. 12.35 plus 10.11. 12 plus 10 is 22, and 0.35 plus 0.11 is 0.46. So, total spending is $22.46.\n\nNow, they started with $27.00. So, the remaining money is $27.00 minus $22.46.\n\nLet's do that subtraction. 27.00 minus 22.46.\n\nFirst, subtract the cents: 00 minus 46. Well, we can't do that, so we'll borrow 1 from the dollars. So, 100 cents minus 46 cents is 54 cents.\n\nNow, the dollars: since we borrowed 1, it's 26 dollars minus 22 dollars, which is 4 dollars.\n\nSo, remaining money is $4.54.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $4.46\n\nB. $4.54\n\nC. $5.36\n\nD. $5.76\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. $4.54.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal money: $27.00\n\nSonia spends: $12.35\n\nNegin spends: $10.11\n\nTotal spent: $12.35 + $10.11 = $22.46\n\nRemaining: $27.00 - $22.46 = $4.54\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it step by step.\n\nStarting with $27.00.\n\nSonia buys a shirt for $12.35, so remaining money after Sonia's purchase is $27.00 - $12.35.\n\nLet's calculate that: $27.00 - $12.35.\n\nSubtracting 12.35 from 27.00:\n\n27.00\n\n-12.35\n\n________\n\n14.65\n\nSo, after Sonia's purchase, they have $14.65 left.\n\nThen, Negin buys sandals for $10.11, so remaining money is $14.65 - $10.11.\n\nLet's do that subtraction: 14.65 - 10.11.\n\n14.65\n\n-10.11\n\n________\n\n4.54\n\nSo, again, remaining money is $4.54.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $4.54.\n\nI think that's right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
