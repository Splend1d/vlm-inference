This seems clearly morally wrong because it's destructive and malicious behavior towards someone else's property. It's a form of vandalism and could be considered a criminal act. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this is wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character convinced their wife that they should sell their car. On its own, this doesn't seem morally wrong. Deciding to sell a car is a personal financial decision, and as long as both parties agree, there's no moral issue here. Maybe the wife was persuaded through reasonable arguments about financial benefits or environmental concerns. Without any indication of coercion or deception, this seems like a legitimate discussion between spouses.\n\nSo, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. That makes option B the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
