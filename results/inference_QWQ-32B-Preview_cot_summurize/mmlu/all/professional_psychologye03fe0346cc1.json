                    "text": "The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is a widely used self-report measure for assessing the severity of depression in adults. It consists of 21 items, each rated on a scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. The total score can range from 0 to 63.\n\nInterpretation of BDI-II scores generally follows these guidelines:\n\n- 0-13: Minimal depression\n\n- 14-19: Mild depression\n\n- 20-28: Moderate depression\n\n- 29-63: Severe depression\n\nGiven this information, a score of 50 would fall into the \"severe depression\" category.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the BDI-II is a screening tool and not a diagnostic instrument. A high score suggests the presence of significant depressive symptoms, but a formal diagnosis should be made by a mental health professional based on a comprehensive evaluation.\n\nAdditionally, the interpretation of BDI-II scores can vary depending on the clinical context and the specific guidelines used by the practitioner. Some sources may have slightly different cut-off points for categorizing the severity of depression.\n\nIn summary, according to standard guidelines, a score of 50 on the BDI-II indicates severe depression.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
