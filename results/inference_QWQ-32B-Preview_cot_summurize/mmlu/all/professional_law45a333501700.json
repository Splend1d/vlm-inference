The lender notified the man and the investor of its intention to accelerate the loan pursuant to the terms of the note and mortgage unless the default was cured within 60 days. When neither the man nor the investor made the required payment, the lender accelerated the loan and initiated foreclosure proceedings, naming both the man and the investor as party defendants.

                    "text": "This question involves understanding the legal relationships between a borrower, an investor, and a lender, particularly regarding mortgages and loan assumptions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a man who borrowed money from a lender and mortgaged his land to secure the loan. So, the man is the original borrower and mortgagor.\n\nThen, before fully repaying the loan, the man conveyed the land to an investor, who expressly assumed the loan. This is key: an \"express assumption\" means that the investor explicitly agrees to take over the borrower's obligations under the loan.\n\nNow, the note and mortgage didn't have a due-on-sale clause. A due-on-sale clause allows the lender to demand full payment if the property is sold or transferred. Since there wasn't one, the transfer didn't automatically default the loan.\n\nAfter the transfer, the investor made some payments but then defaulted on two payments. The lender notified both the man and the investor about accelerating the loan unless the default was cured within 60 days. Neither party made the required payment, so the lender accelerated the loan and started foreclosure proceedings against both.\n\nThe foreclosure sale led to a deficiency, meaning the sale proceeds weren't enough to cover the loan amount. The lender is now seeking a deficiency judgment against only the man because the investor has become insolvent.\n\nThe question is: will the court likely find the man liable for the deficiency?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the investor's express assumption of the loan released the man from liability.\n\nB. No, because the lender must first seek to obtain a deficiency judgment against the investor.\n\nC. Yes, because even after the assumption, the man remains liable as a surety of the investor in the absence of a release from the lender.\n\nD. Yes, because the note and mortgage did not contain a due-on-sale clause.\n\nOption A suggests that the express assumption releases the original borrower. But in many jurisdictions, an express assumption by a third party doesn't automatically release the original borrower unless the lender agrees to release them. Since there's no mention of such a release here, the man might still be liable.\n\nOption B says the lender must first go after the investor. However, in many states, the lender can choose whom to pursue for a deficiency judgment, especially if one party is insolvent. So this might not necessarily be the case.\n\nOption C proposes that the man remains liable as a surety. A surety is someone who promises to pay if the primary obligor doesn't. In this scenario, the investor assumed the loan, making themselves the primary obligor, but the original borrower might still be secondarily liable unless released.\n\nOption D suggests that the lack of a due-on-sale clause means the man remains liable. However, the due-on-sale clause is related to the transfer of the property, not directly to the liability of the original borrower post-assumption.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate answer seems to be C: Yes, because even after the assumption, the man remains liable as a surety of the investor in the absence of a release from the lender.\n\nThis is because, without a specific release from the lender, the original borrower typically remains secondarily liable on the loan, similar to a surety. The express assumption by the investor doesn't automatically relieve the original borrower of liability.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to find the man liable for the deficiency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
