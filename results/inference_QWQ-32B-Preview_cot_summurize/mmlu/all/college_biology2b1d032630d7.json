                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which technique demonstrates protein binding to specific DNA sequences. Okay, let's go through each option one by one.\n\nFirst, Western blot hybridization. I know that Western blots are used to detect specific proteins. You separate proteins by SDS-PAGE and then transfer them to a membrane, where you can probe them with antibodies. But binding to DNA sequences? That doesn't seem directly related. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't think this is the right choice.\n\nNext, Northern blot hybridization. I recall that Northern blots are used for RNA detection and analysis. Similar to Western blots, but for RNA instead of proteins. You separate RNA molecules by gel electrophoresis and then hybridize them with probes. Again, this seems more about RNA than protein-DNA interactions. So, probably not the answer.\n\nNow, Southern blot hybridization. I remember that Southern blots are for DNA detection. You separate DNA fragments by gel electrophoresis, transfer them to a membrane, and then hybridize with a probe to detect specific DNA sequences. This sounds more relevant because it involves DNA, but it's primarily for detecting DNA, not protein binding to DNA.\n\nLastly, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, or EMSA. I've heard of this technique before. From what I understand, it's used to detect protein-DNA interactions. The idea is that when a protein binds to a DNA fragment, it changes the electrophoretic mobility of that fragment in a gel. So, you can see a shift in the position of the DNA band, indicating that it's bound to a protein.\n\nComparing all these options, EMSA seems directly related to demonstrating protein binding to specific DNA sequences, whereas the others are more about detecting nucleic acids or proteins without specifically looking at their interactions.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check what each technique actually does. Let's start with Western blot. It's indeed for protein detection using antibodies. It doesn't involve DNA or protein-DNA interactions directly.\n\nNorthern blot is similar but for RNA. Again, not directly related to protein-DNA interactions.\n\nSouthern blot is for DNA detection. Although it involves DNA, it's not designed to show interactions with proteins.\n\nEMSA, on the other hand, is specifically designed to study protein-DNA interactions. In this assay, you mix a radiolabeled DNA fragment with a protein extract, and then run the mixture on a gel. If a protein binds to the DNA, it slows down the DNA's movement in the gel, causing it to shift positions compared to the free DNA.\n\nThere's also another technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which is used to investigate protein-DNA interactions in vivo. But that's not one of the options here.\n\nAnother thing I recall is that sometimes, protein-DNA interactions can be studied using DNA footprinting or gel shift assays, which are similar to EMSA.\n\nSo, among the given choices, EMSA is the most appropriate technique for demonstrating protein binding to specific DNA sequences.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider if any of the blotting techniques could indirectly show protein-DNA interactions. For example, if a protein is only expressed in the presence of a certain DNA sequence, but that seems stretchy and not direct like EMSA.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Southern blot could be modified to detect protein-DNA complexes, but I don't think that's standard practice.\n\nI think I'm sticking with EMSA as the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
