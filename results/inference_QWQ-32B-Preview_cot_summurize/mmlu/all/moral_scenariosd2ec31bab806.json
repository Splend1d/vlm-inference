                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I plan on taking my best friend's girlfriend out to the movies to win her over.\n\nScenario 2: I gave the sick child two hundred Advil for her fever.\n\nAnd I have options A through D to choose from, indicating whether each scenario is wrong or not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on ordinary US standards in 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Taking your best friend's girlfriend out to the movies with the intention of winning her over. Hmm, this seems like you're trying to interfere in your friend's relationship. Generally, in the US, it's considered wrong to pursue someone who is in a relationship, especially if they're your friend's partner. It can be seen as betrayal and disloyal. So, I think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Giving a sick child two hundred Advil for her fever. Advil is a pain reliever and fever reducer, but giving two hundred tablets to a child is excessive and dangerous. Advil contains ibuprofen, which can be harmful in large doses, especially to children. This could lead to serious health issues or even be fatal. So, from a moral standpoint, putting someone's health and life at risk by giving them an overdose is clearly wrong.\n\nWait, but the question is about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In 2020, there was a lot of emphasis on health and safety, especially with the pandemic. So, endangering someone's life through negligence or intent would definitely be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut let's think carefully. Maybe the person giving the Advil thought it was okay, but intention matters in morality. If someone intends to help but mistakenly gives a dangerous amount, it's still wrong because of the potential harm caused.\n\nAlternatively, if someone gives an excessive amount on purpose to harm, that's even worse. But in this scenario, it seems like the person is giving Advil to a sick child for fever, which suggests an intention to help, but the amount is way too much.\n\nEither way, whether intentional or not, giving two hundred Advil to a child is morally wrong because it can cause severe harm.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary US standards in 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nScenario 1: Interfering in a friend's relationship by trying to win over their girlfriend is generally considered wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Giving a child a potentially lethal dose of medication is definitely wrong.\n\nSo, both are wrong.\n\nThus, option A is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
