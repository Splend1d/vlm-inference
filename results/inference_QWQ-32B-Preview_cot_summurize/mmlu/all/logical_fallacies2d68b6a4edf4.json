                    "text": "So I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which fallacy is being committed in this scenario. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\n\"The Dean was showing a visitor around the campus. The visitor asked, 'About how many students do you have here?' After a moment of reflection, the Dean replied, 'Oh, I'd guess about one in a hundred.'\"\n\nOkay, so the visitor is asking for the number of students on campus, and the Dean answers \"one in a hundred.\" That seems a bit ambiguous. I need to interpret what the Dean might have meant by that.\n\nMaybe the Dean is saying that only one percent of the population is students, implying that for every 100 people, one is a student. But that doesn't make much sense in the context of a campus, where students are the majority. Or perhaps the Dean is just giving a vague answer because he doesn't know the exact number.\n\nWait, maybe \"one in a hundred\" is a typo, and it should be \"one thousand\" or something like that. But no, it's written as \"one in a hundred,\" which is a ratio.\n\nLet me look at the options provided to see which fallacy this might be.\n\nA. Equivocation\n\nB. Fallacy of Division\n\nC. Appeal to Authority\n\nD. Denying the Antecedent\n\nFirst, what is equivocation? It's when a word or phrase is used with more than one meaning in an argument, leading to confusion or a mistaken conclusion.\n\nFallacy of Division is when someone assumes that what is true of the whole must also be true of its parts. For example, if a car is heavy, assuming that each part of the car is heavy.\n\nAppeal to Authority is when someone uses the opinion of an authority figure as evidence in an argument, even when the authority is not an expert in that particular area.\n\nDenying the Antecedent is a specific type of logical fallacy in formal logic, where someone invalidly infers the negation of the consequent from the negation of the antecedent in a conditional statement.\n\nLooking back at the Dean's response, I'm not seeing a direct conditional statement, so Denying the Antecedent might not fit here.\n\nAppeal to Authority doesn't seem relevant because the visitor is asking for information, and the Dean is presumably an authority on the number of students, but his response is unclear.\n\nFallacy of Division also doesn't seem to apply, as there's no assertion about parts based on the whole.\n\nThat leaves Equivocation. Maybe the Dean is using \"one in a hundred\" ambiguously. Is \"one in a hundred\" being used to mean something other than a number?\n\nWait, perhaps the Dean is using \"one in a hundred\" to describe the selectivity of admissions, meaning that only one in a hundred applicants is accepted, but the visitor is asking about the current number of students.\n\nThat could be a case of equivocation, where the phrase \"one in a hundred\" is being interpreted in different ways by the Dean and the visitor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Dean is confused and is mixing up different statistics.\n\nBut considering the options, Equivocation seems like the most plausible fallacy here, because there's ambiguity in the phrase \"one in a hundred\" and it's not clear what exactly the Dean is referring to.\n\nI think the answer is A. Equivocation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Equivocation}} \\]"
