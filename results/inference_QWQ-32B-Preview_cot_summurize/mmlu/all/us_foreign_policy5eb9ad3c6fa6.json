The character of a state's leader\n\nB. The distribution of power in the international system\n\nC. The distribution of power within a state's governmental system\n\nD. A state's political ideology\n\nFirst, I need to recall what systemic theories in international relations are. I think systemic theories look at the overall structure of the international system and how that shapes state behavior. So, it's more about the big picture rather than individual leaders or internal politics.\n\nRealism, for example, is a systemic theory that emphasizes the anarchic nature of the international system and the distribution of power among states as key determinants of foreign policy. So, in realism, the international system's power structure is crucial.\n\nLiberalism, another systemic theory, might consider both the international system and domestic factors, but I think in terms of the primary determinant, it might lean towards the international system as well, especially regarding institutions and interdependence.\n\nSo, looking at option B, \"the distribution of power in the international system,\" that seems to align with what I recall about systemic theories, particularly realism.\n\nOption A, \"the character of a state's leader,\" seems more related to leader-focused theories or maybe constructivism, which looks at identities and norms, but not primarily systemic theories.\n\nOption C, \"the distribution of power within a state's governmental system,\" sounds more like domestic politics and might be relevant in neo-institutionalism or other theories that consider internal political structures, but again, not the primary focus of systemic theories.\n\nOption D, \"a state's political ideology,\" seems more relevant to liberal theories or constructivism, which might consider ideology as influencing foreign policy, but again, not the primary determinant in systemic theories.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the answer is B, the distribution of power in the international system.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should think about other systemic theories. Marxism, for example, might look at the economic structure of the international system, but even then, it's about the system-level factors rather than individual leaders or domestic power distribution.\n\nAlso, neoliberalism, a branch of liberalism, emphasizes interdependence and international institutions, but still, the focus is on the international system rather than domestic factors or individual leaders.\n\nTherefore, I believe that among the given options, B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
