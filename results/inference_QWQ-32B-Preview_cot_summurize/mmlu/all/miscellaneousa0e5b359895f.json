The options are Hutu, Zulu, Aztec, and Masai.\n\nFirst, I know that South Africa is in Africa, so empires from other continents probably wouldn't be controlling areas there. The Aztecs were in Central America, right? So, they're probably not the answer here. That leaves Hutu, Zulu, and Masai.\n\nI think the Zulu are from South Africa. I've heard about the Zulu kingdom or something like that. Maybe they had a big empire at some point in the 19th century.\n\nThe Hutu, I think, are from Rwanda and Burundi, which are in East Africa, not necessarily South Africa. And the Masai are from Kenya and Tanzania, which are also in East Africa.\n\nSo, compared to these options, the Zulu seem the most likely to have controlled large areas of South African territory during the 19th century.\n\nBut let me make sure. Maybe I should think about the history a bit more.\n\nIn the 19th century, there were various tribal kingdoms and empires in Africa before European colonization really took hold. South Africa was no exception.\n\nThe Zulu kingdom was indeed a powerful entity in the region during that time. Shaka Zulu was a famous leader who expanded the Zulu territory significantly in the early 19th century.\n\nSo, it makes sense that the Zulu would be the answer here.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to be sure.\n\nThe Hutu are an ethnic group primarily found in Rwanda and Burundi, which are closer to the Great Lakes region of Africa. While they have their own histories and polities, they weren't controlling large areas of South Africa.\n\nThe Masai are from Kenya and Tanzania, again in East Africa, and are known for their pastoralist culture. They didn't have control over South African territories.\n\nThe Aztecs, as I thought earlier, were from Mesoamerica, which is in North America, not Africa at all. So, they're definitely not the answer here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Zulu.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
