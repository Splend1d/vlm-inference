I can tell you that the right to privacy, the right to life, and the right to exercise religious freedom are all considered fundamental human rights in many legal and philosophical systems. The right to privacy is often seen as a right of noninterference, as it protects individuals from unwarranted intrusion into their personal lives. The right to life is also a right of noninterference, as it protects individuals from being deprived of their life without due process. The right to exercise religious freedom is also a right of noninterference, as it protects individuals from being coerced into practicing a particular religion or from being prevented from practicing their own religion. So, all of the above could be considered rights of noninterference."
