                    "text": "This question is about a state statute that limits aliens to owning no more than 10 acres of land within the state. A resident alien enters into a contract to buy 50 acres and then files a lawsuit in federal court to stop the state from enforcing this statute against him. We need to determine which constitutional argument is his best bet.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\n**Option A: The statute violates the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.**\n\nThe Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment says that no state shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. However, this clause has been interpreted narrowly and primarily protects national citizenship rights, not state citizenship rights. Since the statute affects aliens, who are not citizens, this clause might not provide much help. So, this might not be the strongest argument.\n\n**Option B: The statute violates the Contract Clause.**\n\nThe Contract Clause in Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution says that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. Here, the alien entered into a contract to buy 50 acres, but the statute limits his ownership to 10 acres, which could potentially impair his ability to fulfill or benefit from that contract.\n\nHowever, the Contract Clause typically applies to existing contracts, and courts often balance the state's interest against the impairment. In this case, the state has a interest in regulating land ownership by aliens, and the courts might find that interest compelling. Additionally, the Contract Clause doesn't absolutely prohibit all impairment, just those that are unreasonable.\n\n**Option C: The statute violates the Commerce Clause in that it interferes with land ownership.**\n\nThe Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, but it also has been used to strike down state laws that unduly burden interstate commerce. However, land ownership is generally considered a local matter, and this statute seems to regulate internal affairs rather than interstate commerce. It's unlikely that this statute would be seen as substantially affecting interstate commerce, so this argument seems weak.\n\n**Option D: The statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.**\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment says that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. This clause is central to cases involving discrimination based on various classifications, including alienage.\n\nAliens are a suspect class when it comes to certain rights, and the courts have held that restrictions based on alienage must serve a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\nIn this case, the statute discriminates based on alienage by limiting land ownership to aliens but not to citizens. The state would need to show a compelling interest for this restriction. If the state can't demonstrate a compelling interest, then the statute would violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nGiven that land ownership is a fundamental right, and alienage is a suspect classification, this seems like a strong argument.\n\nComparing all the options:\n\n- Option A: Privileges or Immunities Clause might not apply because it protects citizens' rights, not aliens'.\n\n- Option B: Contract Clause could be applicable, but it's not as directly on point as Equal Protection, and the state likely has a justification.\n\n- Option C: Commerce Clause seems irrelevant to this local land ownership regulation.\n\n- Option D: Equal Protection Clause directly addresses discrimination based on alienage, which is a suspect classification.\n\nTherefore, the best argument for the resident alien is likely under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
