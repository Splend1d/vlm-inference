                    "text": "Let's tackle this clock problem. So, John leaves home after 6 p.m. and returns before 7 p.m. on the same night, and both times the angle between the minute and hour hands is 110 degrees. We need to find out how many minutes he was away, and it's more than five minutes. The options are 36, 40, 38, or 43 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles on a clock work. On a standard 12-hour clock, the hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which is 30 degrees per hour (360 / 12). The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which is 6 degrees per minute (360 / 60).\n\nAt 6 p.m., the hour hand is at 180 degrees (since 6 hours * 30 degrees per hour). The minute hand is at 0 degrees at exactly 6 p.m. But John leaves after 6 p.m., so the minute hand has moved some degrees.\n\nLet's denote the number of minutes after 6 p.m. when John leaves as \\( m \\) minutes. So, the minute hand is at \\( 6m \\) degrees, and the hour hand has also moved due to the passing minutes. The hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute (since 30 degrees per hour / 60 minutes = 0.5 degrees per minute). So, at \\( m \\) minutes past 6 p.m., the hour hand is at \\( 180 + 0.5m \\) degrees.\n\nThe angle between the hour and minute hands is given by the absolute difference between their positions, adjusted to be the smallest angle on the clock, which means it should be less than or equal to 180 degrees.\n\nSo, the angle \\( \\theta \\) is:\n\n\\( \\theta = |(180 + 0.5m) - 6m| \\)\n\nSimplify that:\n\n\\( \\theta = |180 - 5.5m| \\)\n\nBut since angles on a clock are cyclic every 360 degrees, and we're interested in the smallest angle, we can consider:\n\n\\( \\theta = \\min(|180 - 5.5m|, 360 - |180 - 5.5m|) \\)\n\nBut in this problem, the angle is given as 110 degrees, so:\n\n\\( |180 - 5.5m| = 110 \\) or \\( 360 - |180 - 5.5m| = 110 \\)\n\nLet's solve both equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n\\( |180 - 5.5m| = 110 \\)\n\nThis gives two cases:\n\n1. \\( 180 - 5.5m = 110 \\)\n\n2. \\( 180 - 5.5m = -110 \\)\n\nSolve case 1:\n\n\\( 180 - 5.5m = 110 \\)\n\nSubtract 110 from both sides:\n\n\\( 70 = 5.5m \\)\n\nSo, \\( m = 70 / 5.5 = 12.7272... \\) minutes, which is approximately 12 minutes and 44 seconds.\n\nSolve case 2:\n\n\\( 180 - 5.5m = -110 \\)\n\nAdd 5.5m to both sides:\n\n\\( 180 + 110 = 5.5m \\)\n\n\\( 290 = 5.5m \\)\n\n\\( m = 290 / 5.5 = 52.7272... \\) minutes, which is approximately 52 minutes and 44 seconds.\n\nNow, the second equation:\n\n\\( 360 - |180 - 5.5m| = 110 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( |180 - 5.5m| = 250 \\)\n\nAgain, two cases:\n\n3. \\( 180 - 5.5m = 250 \\)\n\n4. \\( 180 - 5.5m = -250 \\)\n\nSolve case 3:\n\n\\( 180 - 5.5m = 250 \\)\n\nSubtract 180 from both sides:\n\n\\( -5.5m = 70 \\)\n\n\\( m = -70 / 5.5 = -12.7272... \\) minutes, which doesn't make sense in this context because time can't be negative.\n\nSolve case 4:\n\n\\( 180 - 5.5m = -250 \\)\n\nAdd 5.5m to both sides:\n\n\\( 180 + 250 = 5.5m \\)\n\n\\( 430 = 5.5m \\)\n\n\\( m = 430 / 5.5 = 78.1818... \\) minutes, which is approximately 78 minutes and 11 seconds. But since we're dealing with time between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m., which is only 60 minutes, this solution is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solutions are \\( m = 12.7272... \\) minutes and \\( m = 52.7272... \\) minutes.\n\nSo, John left home at approximately 6:12:44 and returned at approximately 6:52:44.\n\nNow, to find out how many minutes he was away, we subtract the leaving time from the returning time:\n\n\\( 52.7272... - 12.7272... = 40 \\) minutes.\n\nWait, but the problem says he was away for more than five minutes, and 40 is indeed more than five, but let's check if there are other possibilities.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says that both when he left and when he returned, the angle was 110 degrees. We found two times between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. where the angle is 110 degrees: at approximately 6:12:44 and 6:52:44. The difference is 40 minutes, which is one of the options.\n\nBut let's double-check if there could be other times within that hour where the angle is 110 degrees.\n\nFrom our earlier equations, the only valid solutions within 0 to 60 minutes are \\( m = 12.7272... \\) and \\( m = 52.7272... \\) minutes. So, the only possible time he was away is 40 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 40 minutes.\n\nBut the problem provides options: A. 36, B. 40, C. 38, D. 43.\n\nSo, option B is 40 minutes.\n\nWait, but the calculation gives exactly 40 minutes. But perhaps there's a mistake in assuming the times are only at 12.7272 and 52.7272 minutes past 6 p.m.\n\nLet me re-examine the equations.\n\nWe had:\n\n\\( |180 - 5.5m| = 110 \\) or \\( |180 - 5.5m| = 250 \\)\n\nFrom which we got:\n\n1. \\( m = 12.7272... \\) minutes\n\n2. \\( m = 52.7272... \\) minutes\n\n3. \\( m = -12.7272... \\) minutes (invalid)\n\n4. \\( m = 78.1818... \\) minutes (invalid)\n\nSo, only two valid times within the hour: 12.7272 and 52.7272 minutes past 6 p.m.\n\nDifference is exactly 40 minutes.\n\nBut perhaps the angle repeats more than once in an hour. However, in a standard clock, for a given angle, there are typically two times in an hour where the angle between the hands is the same, which is what we've found.\n\nTherefore, John was away for 40 minutes.\n\nBut the problem mentions that he was away for more than five minutes, which 40 minutes satisfies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another pair of times within the hour where the angle is 110 degrees, but I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the angle can be 110 degrees in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.\n\nBut in our equations, \\( |180 - 5.5m| \\) already accounts for the smaller angle between the hands.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the angle can be 110 degrees or 250 degrees, but as we saw, 250 degrees leads to invalid times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set up the equation differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to calculate the time difference based on the angles.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe rate at which the angle between the hands changes is the difference in their speeds.\n\nThe minute hand moves at 6 degrees per minute, and the hour hand at 0.5 degrees per minute.\n\nSo, the relative speed is 6 - 0.5 = 5.5 degrees per minute.\n\nSo, the angle between them changes at 5.5 degrees per minute.\n\nIf the angle is 110 degrees when he leaves and again when he returns, the change in angle during his absence is 0 degrees, meaning the angle has completed full cycles plus the initial angle.\n\nBut since the angle changes at 5.5 degrees per minute, the time \\( t \\) for the angle to change by 360 degrees is \\( t = 360 / 5.5 \\) minutes.\n\nBut in this case, the angle is the same, so the time away could be multiples of \\( 360 / 5.5 \\) minutes.\n\nBut since he was away for less than 60 minutes, and 360 / 5.5 is approximately 65.4545 minutes, which is more than 60 minutes, the only possibility within 60 minutes is 0 minutes, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle difference accumulates to a multiple of 360 degrees plus the initial angle.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the angle between the hands changes continuously, and when it reaches 110 degrees again, it would have covered some multiple of 360 degrees plus or minus the initial angle.\n\nSo, the change in angle in time \\( t \\) is \\( 5.5t \\) degrees.\n\nIf the angle is the same, then \\( 5.5t = 360k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nBut since he was away for less than 60 minutes, and \\( t = 360k / 5.5 \\), for \\( k = 1 \\), \\( t = 360 / 5.5 \\approx 65.4545 \\) minutes, which is more than 60 minutes.\n\nSo, no full cycles within 60 minutes, meaning \\( k = 0 \\), which would imply \\( t = 0 \\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the angle could have decreased by 110 degrees as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the change in angle is such that the angle difference is 110 degrees again, meaning the relative movement is either 110 degrees or 360 - 110 = 250 degrees.\n\nSo, the time \\( t \\) for the angle to change by 110 degrees is \\( t = 110 / 5.5 = 20 \\) minutes.\n\nSimilarly, the time for the angle to change by 250 degrees is \\( t = 250 / 5.5 \\approx 45.4545 \\) minutes.\n\nBut in this case, since the angle is the same at both times, perhaps the total change is 0 degrees, meaning he was away for a time that is a multiple of the cycle time, but as we saw, that's more than 60 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the angle difference between the two positions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nGiven that the angle is 110 degrees at both times, and the relative speed is 5.5 degrees per minute, the time between the two instances when the angle is 110 degrees can be calculated by considering the angular movement.\n\nThe angle increases at 5.5 degrees per minute, so the time between two instances where the angle is 110 degrees would be the time it takes for the angle to increase by 360 degrees, but since the angle is the same, perhaps it's the time for the angle to make a full cycle and come back to the same angle.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, 360 / 5.5 \u2248 65.4545 minutes, which is more than 60 minutes, so not applicable within the same hour.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time between two angles of 110 degrees is equal to the time it takes for the relative angle to increase by 220 degrees (since 360 - 140 = 220, but I'm getting confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the angular speed is 5.5 degrees per minute.\n\nIf the angle is 110 degrees at time \\( t_1 \\) and again at time \\( t_2 \\), then the change in angle is 0 degrees, meaning \\( 5.5(t_2 - t_1) = 360k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nBut since \\( t_2 - t_1 < 60 \\) minutes, and \\( 360 / 5.5 \\approx 65.4545 \\) minutes, the only possible \\( k \\) is 0, which implies \\( t_2 - t_1 = 0 \\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nThis suggests that within the same hour, the angle between the hands is 110 degrees only twice, and the time difference is fixed.\n\nGiven that, and our earlier calculation showing a difference of 40 minutes, perhaps 40 minutes is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this.\n\nLet's consider the general formula for the angle between the hour and minute hands.\n\nThe angle \\( \\theta \\) in degrees is given by:\n\n\\( \\theta = |30h - 5.5m| \\)\n\nWhere \\( h \\) is the hour and \\( m \\) is the minutes.\n\nIn this case, \\( h = 6 \\), so:\n\n\\( \\theta = |180 - 5.5m| \\)\n\nSet \\( \\theta = 110 \\):\n\n\\( |180 - 5.5m| = 110 \\)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\( 180 - 5.5m = 110 \\) or \\( 180 - 5.5m = -110 \\)\n\nSolving:\n\n1. \\( 180 - 5.5m = 110 \\) \u2192 \\( m = (180 - 110) / 5.5 = 70 / 5.5 = 12.7272... \\) minutes\n\n2. \\( 180 - 5.5m = -110 \\) \u2192 \\( m = (180 + 110) / 5.5 = 290 / 5.5 = 52.7272... \\) minutes\n\nSo, the two times are approximately 12.7272 and 52.7272 minutes past 6 p.m.\n\nDifference is \\( 52.7272 - 12.7272 = 40 \\) minutes.\n\nTherefore, John was away for 40 minutes.\n\nGiven that, and the option B being 40 minutes, that should be the answer.\n\nBut perhaps there's a trick here, or maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering multiple days or something, but it specifies it's the same night, between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is considered in both directions, but I think I've covered that with the absolute value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of \"the angle was 110 degrees\" \u2013 maybe considering the reflex angle, but I think I've accounted for that by considering the smaller angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the clock is running fast or slow, but the problem doesn't indicate that; it's a standard clock.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps John left home at one 110-degree time and returned at the next 110-degree time, which in this case is 40 minutes later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are multiple 110-degree times within the hour, but as per our calculations, only two such times exist within the hour.\n\nTherefore, the time he was away is 40 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 40 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
