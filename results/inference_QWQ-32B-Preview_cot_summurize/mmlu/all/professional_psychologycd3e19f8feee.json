The options are triangulation, audits, inductive processes, and member checking.\n\nFirst, I know that triangulation is a method used in qualitative research to enhance validity. It involves using multiple data sources or methods to cross-validate findings. So, that seems like it would increase reliability and validity.\n\nAudits, in the context of research, often refer to having an external reviewer check the research process and findings for accuracy and consistency. This is similar to peer review and can definitely help ensure the reliability and validity of the research.\n\nMember checking is another technique where researchers share their interpretations with the participants to get their feedback and ensure that the researchers' understanding aligns with the participants' intentions. This helps to improve the accuracy of the findings.\n\nNow, inductive processes are a way of analyzing data in qualitative research, where researchers start with specific observations and build general theories or patterns from them. While inductive reasoning is a fundamental part of qualitative research, I'm not sure if it directly increases reliability and validity in the same way that triangulation, audits, and member checking do.\n\nReliability and validity are about the consistency and accuracy of the research findings. Triangulation, audits, and member checking are all methods designed specifically to enhance these aspects. Inductive processes are more about the analytical approach and less about verifying the research's reliability and validity.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Inductive processes, because while they are important for qualitative research, they aren't specifically methods for increasing reliability and validity in the same way as the other options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
