                    "text": "So Maddie is planning to ride her bike a total of 56 miles over 7 days, and she wants to ride the same number of miles each day. She's being consistent, which is great! Now, the question is asking for the total number of miles she will ride each day. So, basically, we need to find out how many miles she rides per day.\n\nAlright, let's think about this. If she rides the same amount every day, we can probably find this by dividing the total miles by the number of days. That makes sense because if you have a total and you want to split it evenly over a certain number of periods, division is the way to go.\n\nSo, total miles are 56, and the number of days is 7. So, 56 divided by 7 should give us the miles per day.\n\nLet me do the math: 56 \u00f7 7 equals 8.\n\nSo, Maddie will ride 8 miles each day.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 8\n\nB. 9\n\nC. 49\n\nD. 63\n\nOption A is 8, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider if there's any other way to approach this problem to ensure I'm not missing something.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about multiplication. If she rides the same number of miles each day for 7 days to total 56 miles, then miles per day multiplied by 7 should equal 56.\n\nSo, let's denote the miles per day as x. Then, 7x = 56.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 56 \u00f7 7, which again is 8.\n\nOkay, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to add up 8 miles for each of the 7 days, 8 times 7 is 56, which matches the total miles she plans to ride.\n\nSo, it seems definite that the answer is 8 miles per day.\n\nI don't see any reason to choose another option. Option B is 9, which would total 63 miles if multiplied by 7, but she's only riding 56 miles. So that's too much.\n\nOption C is 49, which would be if she rode 7 miles per day (since 7 times 7 is 49), but that's less than 56.\n\nOption D is 63, which would be 9 miles per day times 7 days.\n\nBut according to the problem, it's 56 miles total, so only option A makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
