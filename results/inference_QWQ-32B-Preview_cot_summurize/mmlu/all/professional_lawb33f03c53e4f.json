                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this problem about a landowner who sold 50 acres of his orchard to a farmer. The deed had some covenants: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances. But when the landowner sold the property, there was already an outstanding mortgage on it. The farmer took possession and then, facing foreclosure, paid off the mortgage with interest. Now, the farmer is suing for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. I need to figure out what the court will likely allow.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these covenants mean. The covenant of seisin assures that the grantor owns the property and has the right to transfer it. The covenant of right to convey ensures that the grantor has the authority to transfer the property. The covenant against encumbrances promises that there are no undisclosed liens or encumbrances on the property.\n\nIn this case, there was an outstanding mortgage, which is an encumbrance, and the deed had a covenant against encumbrances. So, it seems like the landowner breached that covenant by not ensuring that there were no encumbrances on the property.\n\nThe farmer paid off the mortgage to avoid foreclosure. Now, he's suing for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. I need to determine what kind of recovery the court will likely allow.\n\nOption A says recovery for the amount in principal and interest from the time of the mortgage payment. Option B is only for the principal paid on the mortgage. Option C is for the measure of value between the land with and without the encumbrance. Option D is no recovery.\n\nI think I need to look into what the remedy is for breaching a covenant against encumbrances.\n\nFrom what I recall, when there's a breach of the covenant against encumbrances, the measure of damages is the difference in the value of the property with the encumbrance and without it. Alternatively, it could be the cost to remove the encumbrance.\n\nIn this case, the farmer paid off the mortgage to remove the encumbrance. So, perhaps the recovery would be for the amount he paid to remove it.\n\nBut I need to think carefully. The covenant against encumbrances typically means that the grantor warrants that there are no encumbrances on the property except those specified. If there is an encumbrance that wasn't disclosed, and the grantor has warranted that there are none, then the grantor is liable for the damage caused by that encumbrance.\n\nIn this scenario, the farmer had to pay off the mortgage to save the property from foreclosure. So, he incurred costs that he wouldn't have had to incur if the property had been free from encumbrances as warranted.\n\nNow, I need to consider what the law says about recovery in such cases. I think the general rule is that the grantee can recover the amount paid to satisfy the encumbrance or the decrease in value of the property due to the encumbrance.\n\nIn this case, since the farmer actually paid off the mortgage, it makes sense that he could recover that amount from the grantor who breached the covenant.\n\nBut let's look at the options again.\n\nOption A includes both principal and interest from the time of the mortgage payment. Option B is just the principal.\n\nWait, the farmer paid off the mortgage with interest. So, the total amount he paid includes both principal and interest.\n\nIf he's suing for breach of covenant, would he be entitled to recover both the principal and the interest he paid?\n\nI think so, because that's the full amount he had to pay to remove the encumbrance.\n\nOption C talks about the measure of value between the land with and without the encumbrance. That could be different from the amount of the mortgage, depending on factors like the interest rate or other considerations.\n\nBut in this case, since the farmer actually paid off the mortgage, it's straightforward to say he should recover what he paid.\n\nOption D is no recovery, which seems unlikely because there was a breach of covenant.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and C, I need to decide which one is most appropriate.\n\nOption C seems a bit vague. It depends on how you measure the value difference. It might be equivalent to the amount paid, but it might not be.\n\nOption A specifies recovery for the principal and interest from the time of the mortgage payment.\n\nWait, \"from the time of the mortgage payment\" might mean that interest accrues from the date he paid it. But I'm not sure.\n\nOption B is only for the principal, which might not be sufficient because he also paid interest.\n\nI think Option A is the most comprehensive, as it includes both principal and interest.\n\nBut let me think again. If the farmer paid off the mortgage with interest, and he's suing for the amount he had to pay due to the encumbrance, then recovering the principal and interest makes sense.\n\nHowever, the phrase \"from the time of the mortgage payment\" is a bit confusing. Does it mean that interest continues to accrue from the date he paid it? That might not make sense.\n\nMaybe it's just a way of saying that he's entitled to recover the amount he paid, including interest, at the time he made the payment.\n\nAlternatively, it might mean that he's entitled to recover the principal and interest from the time he paid it, meaning that the grantor has to pay him back with interest starting from the date of payment.\n\nI need to clarify this.\n\nIn general, when you pay a sum of money and then seek recovery, you might be entitled to recover that sum plus interest from the date you paid it.\n\nSo, in that case, Option A makes sense.\n\nOption B is too limited because it only includes the principal, not the interest the farmer had to pay.\n\nOption C is more about the difference in value, which might not directly correspond to the amount paid on the mortgage.\n\nOption D is not acceptable because there was a breach of covenant.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is Option A: recovery for the amount in principal and interest from the time of the mortgage payment.\n\nThis would compensate the farmer for the entire amount he had to pay to remove the encumbrance, including the interest, and also account for the time value of money since the date he made the payment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
