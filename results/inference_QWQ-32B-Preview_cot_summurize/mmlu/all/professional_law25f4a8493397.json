Shortly thereafter and prior to the July commencement date of employment, the school elected to terminate its varsity football program. The school publicly attributed the decision to economic factors. Upon hearing this news, the man sought out the headmaster of the school to inquire as to the effect, if any, of this decision on his salary and responsibilities. In order to resolve the matter, the headmaster arranged a meeting among various school officials to discuss the man's situation. Afterward, the school sent written notice to the man of its intent to terminate his employment contract. The man then commenced suit to recover the full balance of his salary calculated on the basis of the contract. At trial, the headmaster was called to testify. On direct examination, he testified that six people (including himself) attended the meeting where it was decided to terminate the man's employment contract. When asked to identify the attendees, the headmaster gave the names of four but, despite trying, was unable to remember the name of the fifth person. The attorney who called the headmaster to testify now seeks to show him her handwritten notes that the attorney prepared during her pretrial interview with the headmaster, in which he provided all five names.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out what's going on here. There's a legal case involving a man who had a contract to work at a school as an athletic director, teacher, and football coach for a year, with a salary of $37,750. But before his employment started, the school decided to end its varsity football program and then terminated his employment contract. Now, he's suing to get his full salary as per the contract.\n\nAt trial, the headmaster is testifying. He mentioned that six people attended a meeting to decide to terminate the man's contract, and he could remember four of their names but not the fifth. The attorney who called him to testify wants to show him her handwritten notes from a pretrial interview where the headmaster provided all five names. The question is, what is the trial court likely to consider this action as?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. a proper attempt to refresh the headmaster's recollection.\n\nB. a proper attempt to introduce recorded recollection.\n\nC. an improper attempt to support the headmaster's credibility.\n\nD. an improper attempt to lead the witness.\n\nI need to understand the difference between these options.\n\nFirst, \"refreshing recollection\" is when a witness's memory is refreshed by looking at a document or object that helps them remember something they had forgotten. This is generally allowed during direct examination.\n\n\"Recorded recollection\" is a bit different. It's when a witness had knowledge about something at an earlier time, recorded their recollection in a document, and now, at trial, they can't remember the details, but they can testify to what they wrote in that document, provided certain conditions are met.\n\n\"Supporting credibility\" might involve introducing evidence to make the witness seem more believable, but I'm not sure if that's directly related here.\n\n\"Leading the witness\" is when the attorney asks questions in a way that suggests the answer, which is generally not allowed on direct examination.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the attorney wants to show the headmaster her notes from a pretrial interview to help him remember the fifth person's name. This sounds like an attempt to refresh his recollection.\n\nBut, since the headmaster can't remember the name now, and the notes were made at an earlier time when he did remember, it might also qualify as recorded recollection.\n\nI need to think about which one is more appropriate here.\n\nOption A is \"a proper attempt to refresh the headmaster's recollection.\" This seems plausible because the attorney is showing the headmaster his own earlier statement to help him remember the name.\n\nOption B is \"a proper attempt to introduce recorded recollection.\" This might also be applicable because the notes were made at a time when the headmaster could remember the name, and now he can't, so his recorded recollection could be admitted as evidence.\n\nOption C is \"an improper attempt to support the headmaster's credibility.\" I don't think that's what's happening here. The attorney isn't trying to make the headmaster seem more credible; she's just trying to help him remember a specific detail.\n\nOption D is \"an improper attempt to lead the witness.\" Leading questions are generally not allowed on direct examination, but showing the witness documents to refresh their memory is usually permitted.\n\nSo, between A and B, which one is more accurate?\n\nRefreshing recollection typically involves showing the witness a document that helps them recall information, and then the witness testifies based on their refreshed memory.\n\nRecorded recollection allows the witness to testify about the content of the document if they can't recall the information now, provided certain foundations are laid, such as the document was made near the time of the event when the witness's memory was fresher.\n\nIn this case, since the headmaster can't remember the name now, and the notes were made during a pretrial interview, it might be more appropriate to treat this as recorded recollection.\n\nHowever, the attorney is showing the notes to the headmaster to see if they help him remember the name, not necessarily to introduce the notes as evidence.\n\nSo, perhaps it's still an attempt to refresh recollection.\n\nBut, if the headmaster still can't remember after looking at the notes, then the attorney might try to introduce the notes themselves as recorded recollection.\n\nGiven that, the trial court is likely to consider the showing of the notes as a proper attempt to refresh the headmaster's recollection, which is option A.\n\nOption B might come into play later if the headmaster still can't remember after looking at the notes, and the attorney seeks to introduce the notes as evidence of what was said in the interview.\n\nBut at this point, it's just an attempt to refresh recollection.\n\nAlso, option C seems unlikely because supporting credibility isn't directly related to showing notes to refresh memory.\n\nOption D, leading the witness, might be a concern, but showing documents to refresh memory is generally allowed on direct examination.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is A: a proper attempt to refresh the headmaster's recollection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
