I remember that it has something to do with how certain types of legislation must start in a particular part of Congress. Let me think about the options given.\n\nOption A says that the Bill of Rights must not be infringed upon by any state legislature. Hmm, that sounds more like the Fourteenth Amendment, which applies the Bill of Rights to the states. But I don't think that's what the origination clause is about.\n\nOption B says that Congress and the president must jointly create the annual federal budget. I know that Congress is responsible for creating the budget through the House and Senate, and the president can veto it, but I don't recall that being called the origination clause.\n\nOption C says that revenue bills must be initiated in the House of Representatives. That rings a bell. I think the origination clause has something to do with where certain kinds of bills must start, and I believe it's about revenue or tax bills beginning in the House.\n\nOption D says that the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over all constitutional matters. I know that the Constitution does outline the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, but I don't think that's what the origination clause is about.\n\nLet me double-check what the origination clause actually is. I recall that it's a provision in the Constitution that specifies where certain types of legislation must originate. Specifically, it's about revenue bills.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C seems to match that. It says that revenue bills must be initiated in the House of Representatives. That sounds right. The House is often referred to as the People's House, and since taxing is a powerful authority, it makes sense that the branch closest to the people would have the power to initiate revenue bills.\n\nI think option C is the correct answer. The origination clause requires that all bills for raising revenue must start in the House of Representatives.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
