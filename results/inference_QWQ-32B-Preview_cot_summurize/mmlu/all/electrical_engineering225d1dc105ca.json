An op-code fetch cycle\n\nB. A memory read cycle\n\nC. A memory write cycle\n\nD. An I/O read cycle\n\nI think I need to recall how the 8085A fetches and executes instructions. Let's see...\n\nFirst, I know that in a microprocessor, instructions are stored in memory, and the processor needs to fetch them before it can execute them. So, I believe the first step is to fetch the opcode from memory.\n\nOption A says \"An op-code fetch cycle.\" That sounds right. But let me make sure.\n\nOption B is \"A memory read cycle.\" Well, fetching the opcode involves reading from memory, so maybe this is also correct. But is it specific enough?\n\nOption C is \"A memory write cycle.\" That doesn't sound right for the first cycle, because writing would happen during the execution of the instruction, not during the fetch.\n\nOption D is \"An I/O read cycle.\" The 8085A can read from I/O devices, but instruction fetching is typically from memory, not I/O.\n\nSo, between options A and B, which one is more accurate?\n\nI think op-code fetch is a specific type of memory read cycle. Maybe they are both correct, but option A is more precise.\n\nLet me look up how the 8085A performs instruction fetching.\n\nOkay, according to my notes, the 8085A has a fetch cycle where it reads the opcode from the memory location pointed to by the program counter (PC). So, it's indeed a memory read operation, specifically for the opcode.\n\nPerhaps option A is better because it specifies that it's fetching the opcode, which is the first step in executing an instruction.\n\nBut I should consider if there are any exceptions. For example, are there any instructions that don't start with an opcode fetch cycle?\n\nI don't think so. All instructions begin with the processor fetching the opcode from memory.\n\nAlso, I recall that the 8085A has different types of machine cycles for different operations, like memory read, memory write, I/O read, and I/O write.\n\nBut for instruction fetching, it's specifically reading the opcode from memory, which is a memory read operation.\n\nSo, while option B is correct in that it's a memory read cycle, option A provides more detail by specifying that it's an op-code fetch cycle.\n\nI think the question is asking for the first machine cycle of an instruction, and since op-code fetch is the initial step, option A is the most appropriate answer.\n\nLet me double-check with another source.\n\nAccording to the Intel 8085A datasheet, the instruction fetch cycle is the first machine cycle for any instruction, where the processor reads the opcode from the memory location specified by the PC.\n\nSo, it confirms that the first machine cycle is indeed the op-code fetch cycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: An op-code fetch cycle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
