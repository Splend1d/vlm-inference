We have two types of networks: a fully interconnected network and a ring network, both connecting n processors with bidirectional links. We need to find the ratio of a figure of merit for the fully connected network to that of the ring network, and this figure of merit is defined as the product of the number of links required for the network times the worst-case path length connecting any two processors.\n\nFirst, let's understand both network types:\n\n1. **Fully Interconnected Network:**\n   - In this network, each processor is directly connected to every other processor.\n   - So, for n processors, the number of links is the number of ways to choose 2 processors out of n, which is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n   - The worst-case path length is 1, because any two processors are directly connected.\n\n2. **Ring Network:**\n   - In this network, each processor is connected to two other processors, forming a ring.\n   - So, for n processors, the number of links is n (since each processor connects to two others, but each link is shared between two processors).\n   - The worst-case path length is n/2 for even n > 2, because in a ring, the maximum distance between any two nodes is half the perimeter of the ring.\n\nNow, the figure of merit for each network is the product of the number of links and the worst-case path length.\n\nLet's calculate the figure of merit for both networks:\n\n1. **Fully Interconnected Network:**\n   - Number of links: n(n-1)/2\n   - Worst-case path length: 1\n   - Figure of merit: [n(n-1)/2] * 1 = n(n-1)/2\n\n2. **Ring Network:**\n   - Number of links: n\n   - Worst-case path length: n/2\n   - Figure of merit: n * (n/2) = n\u00b2/2\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the figure of merit of the fully interconnected network to that of the ring network:\n\nRatio = [Figure of merit of fully connected] / [Figure of merit of ring]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nRatio = [n(n-1)/2] / [n\u00b2/2] = [n(n-1)/2] * [2/n\u00b2] = (n-1)/n\n\nSo, the ratio is (n-1)/n.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1/(n\u00b2)\n\nB. 1/(n(n-1))\n\nC. 1/n\n\nD. (n-1)/n\n\nThe correct answer is D. (n-1)/n\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
