The options are A. -80, B. 0, C. 6, and D. 53.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It looks like I need to complete the square for the quadratic expression. Completing the square is a method to write a quadratic in the form of a perfect square trinomial plus some constant.\n\nThe given expression is \\(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\\). I need to transform this into the form \\(a(x + d)^2 + e\\).\n\nLet me start by factoring out the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) from the first two terms, since the coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nSo, \\(-2x^2 - 20x - 53 = -2(x^2 + 10x) - 53\\).\n\nNow, to complete the square inside the parentheses, I need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of \\(x\\). The coefficient of \\(x\\) is 10, so half of that is 5, and squaring it gives 25.\n\nTherefore, inside the parentheses: \\(x^2 + 10x = (x + 5)^2 - 25\\).\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression:\n\n\\(-2(x^2 + 10x) - 53 = -2[(x + 5)^2 - 25] - 53\\).\n\nNext, distribute the \\(-2\\) through the parentheses:\n\n\\(-2(x + 5)^2 + 50 - 53\\).\n\nNow, combine the constant terms:\n\n\\(50 - 53 = -3\\).\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\(-2(x + 5)^2 - 3\\).\n\nNow, comparing this with the form \\(a(x + d)^2 + e\\), I can see that:\n\n\\(a = -2\\), \\(d = 5\\), and \\(e = -3\\).\n\nFinally, the sum \\(a + d + e = -2 + 5 - 3 = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
