                    "text": "So I've got these four words: intercontinental, interglacial, interface, and intercept. The question is, they all share a common meaning based on their affixes, and I need to figure out what that is from the options given: between; among, not; opposite of, earth; environment, or under; too little.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"inter-\" is a prefix that shows up in a lot of words, and I think it generally means \"between\" or \"among.\" Let me check each word to see if that makes sense.\n\nStarting with \"intercontinental.\" I know that \"continental\" refers to continents, so \"intercontinental\" should mean between or among continents. That fits with the \"between; among\" option.\n\nNext, \"interglacial.\" I think \"glacial\" has to do with glaciers or ice ages. So, \"interglacial\" might mean the periods between glaciers or ice ages. Again, \"between\" makes sense here.\n\nThen, \"interface.\" I've heard this term in various contexts, like in computing or design. An interface is where two systems or surfaces meet and interact. So, it's like the boundary between two things, which again suggests \"between\" or \"among.\"\n\nLastly, \"intercept.\" When something intercepts, it cuts off or stops something that's on its way somewhere. So, it's like getting in between the thing and its destination. Once more, \"between\" seems applicable.\n\nNow, looking at the other options:\n\nB. \"not; opposite of\" \u2013 I don't think that fits any of these words. \"Inter-\" isn't typically a negation prefix.\n\nC. \"earth; environment\" \u2013 While some of these words might relate to the environment indirectly, it's not the core meaning of the prefix.\n\nD. \"under; too little\" \u2013 \"Inter-\" doesn't seem to carry meanings of under or insufficiency.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, it looks like the shared meaning among all these words is \"between; among.\" Therefore, the answer should be A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. Is there any scenario where \"inter-\" might mean something else in these words?\n\nFor example, in some languages, prefixes can have multiple meanings depending on the context. But in English, \"inter-\" is quite consistently used to indicate involvement between or among different elements.\n\nMoreover, looking at other words with \"inter-,\" like \"international\" (between nations), \"interstate\" (between states), or \"interpersonal\" (between people), they all carry the sense of \"between\" or \"among.\"\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. between; among.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
