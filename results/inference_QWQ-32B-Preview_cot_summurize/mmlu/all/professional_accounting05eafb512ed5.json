                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about audit planning for a user auditor dealing with a service organization. The key here is to figure out the most efficient way to audit when the audit client relies on a service organization for several processes.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the roles involved:\n\n- **User Auditor:** This is the auditor auditing the audit client.\n\n- **Service Organization:** This is an external entity that provides services to the audit client, and these services involve processes that affect the client's financial statements.\n\n- **Service Auditor:** This is the auditor who audits the controls at the service organization.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that the controls at the service organization are adequate and effective, as they impact the audit client's financial statements.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n**Option A: Review that service auditor\u2019s report on controls placed in operations.**\n\nThis seems like a reasonable starting point. The service auditor's report should provide assurance on the effectiveness of the controls at the service organization. By reviewing this report, the user auditor can gain an understanding of the controls and assess whether they are sufficient for the purposes of the audit client.\n\n**Option B: Review the service auditor\u2019s report and outline the accounting system in a memo to the working papers.**\n\nThis option goes a step further than option A by requiring the user auditor to not only review the service auditor's report but also to document the accounting system in a memo to the working papers. This documentation could be helpful for the audit team's understanding and for future reference, but it might not necessarily be the most efficient use of time, especially if the service auditor's report already provides sufficient detail.\n\n**Option C: Audit the service organization\u2019s controls, assess risk, and prepare the audit plan.**\n\nThis option suggests that the user auditor should perform their own audit of the service organization's controls. While this could provide the most direct assurance, it might not be the most efficient approach, as it could be time-consuming and redundant if a service auditor's report is already available.\n\n**Option D: Audit the service organization\u2019s controls to test the work of the service auditor.**\n\nSimilar to option C, this involves the user auditor auditing the service organization's controls, but with the specific purpose of testing the work of the service auditor. This could be necessary in some cases, but again, it might not be the most efficient use of resources if the service auditor is reputable and their report is considered reliable.\n\nConsidering the need for efficiency, the best approach would likely be to rely on the service auditor's report to the extent possible, provided that the service auditor is reputable and the report is recent and relevant.\n\nTherefore, **Option A** seems to be the most efficient, as it involves reviewing the service auditor's report on controls, which should provide the necessary assurance without requiring the user auditor to duplicate the service auditor's work.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that depending on the materiality and risk involved, the user auditor might need to perform additional procedures beyond just reviewing the service auditor's report. But in terms of the options provided, Option A appears to be the most efficient starting point.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- **Option A** is the most efficient as it leverages the service auditor's report.\n\n- **Option B** adds documentation that may not be necessary for efficiency.\n\n- **Options C and D** involve auditing the service organization's controls, which could be redundant and less efficient if the service auditor's report is reliable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **Option A**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
