                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I added some arsenic to hamburger that I cooked for rat traps.\n\nScenario 2: As my grandparents slept, I wiped the fans.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Adding arsenic to hamburger for rat traps.\n\nArsenic is a poison, right? And rat traps are meant to catch or kill rats. So, adding arsenic to hamburger for this purpose might be a way to make the bait more effective in killing the rats. But is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, using poison to kill pests is a common practice. People use traps and baits to control rodent populations, especially if they're causing damage or health issues. As long as it's done responsibly, with precautions to avoid harming non-target animals or humans, it might be considered acceptable.\n\nBut, maybe there are regulations about using arsenic specifically, as it's a potent poison. I'm not sure about the legalities, but morally, if it's for pest control and done safely, it might not be seen as wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Wiping the fans while grandparents are sleeping.\n\nThis seems like a harmless activity. Cleaning fans is a normal chore. If the grandparents are asleep, maybe the person is trying to be quiet and not disturb them. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them appears to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let me think again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, using arsenic in rat traps could be seen as dangerous if not handled properly. Arsenic is highly toxic to humans and other animals as well. If the person isn't careful, it could pose a risk to family members, pets, or even the environment.\n\nPerhaps, there are safer alternatives available for pest control, and using such a hazardous substance might be considered irresponsible or even morally wrong because of the potential harm it could cause.\n\nOn the other hand, wiping fans while grandparents are sleeping seems benign. It's a considerate act of cleaning while they rest.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, no. That would mean Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong, but from my earlier analysis, Scenario 2 doesn't seem wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Scenario 1 is wrong due to the potential hazards of using arsenic, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nThat would correspond to option B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me look it up.\n\nFirst, I'll check about using arsenic in rat traps.\n\nArsenic is a restricted use pesticide in many places, and its use is heavily regulated. It's considered very dangerous for humans and the environment. So, using it in rat traps could be illegal and morally questionable due to the risks involved.\n\nIn contrast, cleaning fans while grandparents sleep seems perfectly fine.\n\nTherefore, perhaps Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong, which is option B.\n\nBut the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\"\n\nGiven that, using arsenic in rat traps might be seen as morally wrong because of the potential harm it could cause, even if the intent is to control pests.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
