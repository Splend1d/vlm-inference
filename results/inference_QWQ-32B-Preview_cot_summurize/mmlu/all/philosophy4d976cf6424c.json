Deception, as I understand it, is when someone is misled or misled about the true nature of something. In research, deception might involve hiding the real purpose of the study or misleading participants about what the research is about.\n\nOption A says, \"The obtaining of company material without permission.\" Hmm, that sounds more like theft or unauthorized access rather than deception. Deception usually involves some kind of misrepresentation or misleading information, not just taking something without asking.\n\nOption B is \"The researcher wearing a disguise during an observation.\" Well, wearing a disguise could be a form of deception because the researcher is concealing their identity or appearance. But is that necessarily deception in the context of business research? Maybe it depends on the situation. In some cases, researchers might use disguises to observe behavior without influencing it, but that could be seen as misleading the subjects about the researcher's true identity.\n\nOption C says, \"The researcher representing their research as being about a different topic.\" This sounds a lot like deception to me. If a researcher is telling participants that the study is about one thing when it's really about something else, that's misrepresenting the purpose of the research. That seems like a clear example of deception.\n\nOption D is \"The researcher failing to ask permission to interview someone.\" Not asking for permission might be impolite or unethical, but is it deception? It seems more like a failure to obtain consent, which is important in research, but it's not necessarily deception unless the researcher is pretending that they have permission when they don't.\n\nComparing all these options, option C seems to be the most straightforward example of deception because it involves misrepresenting the topic of the research, which directly misleads the participants about the study's true purpose.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
