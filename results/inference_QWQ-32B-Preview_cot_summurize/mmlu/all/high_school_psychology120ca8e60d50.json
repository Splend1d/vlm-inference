So, there's a pigeon that's been trained to peck at a green light, and it also ends up pecking at a yellow light. The question is asking what this illustrates, and the options are generalization, discrimination, extinction, or spontaneous recovery.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what each of these terms means in the context of conditioning.\n\nGeneralization, I think, is when a conditioned response gets triggered by stimuli that are similar to the original conditioned stimulus. So, if the pigeon was trained to peck at green, and it also pecks at yellow, which is similar to green, that sounds like generalization.\n\nDiscrimination is when an organism learns to respond differently to different stimuli. For example, if the pigeon pecks at green but not at yellow, that would be discrimination. But in this case, it's pecking at both, so that doesn't fit.\n\nExtinction is when a conditioned response gradually disappears when the conditioned stimulus is presented without the unconditioned stimulus. Here, the pigeon is still pecking at both lights, so extinction doesn't seem to apply.\n\nSpontaneous recovery is when a conditioned response that has been extinguished comes back without further conditioning. That doesn't seem relevant here either, since there's no mention of extinction in the first place.\n\nSo, going back to generalization, it makes sense that the pigeon would peck at yellow light because it's similar to the green light it was trained on. Maybe the pigeon can't distinguish between green and yellow very well, so it responds to both.\n\nI should also consider whether discrimination is involved in some way. Maybe the pigeon was trained to peck at green, but hasn't been trained to discriminate against yellow, so it generalizes the response to similar colors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pigeon has been trained on green, and yellow is close enough in wavelength that the pigeon sees them as similar, hence the generalization.\n\nI don't think extinction or spontaneous recovery are relevant here because there's no information about the response decreasing or reappearing after extinction.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be generalization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
