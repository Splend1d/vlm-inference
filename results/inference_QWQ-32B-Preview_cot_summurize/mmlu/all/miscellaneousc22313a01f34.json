I need to figure out which one of these companies is known for hosting an annual baking competition called 'Bake-Off.'\n\nFirst, I should probably think about each of these companies and see if I recall any of them being associated with a bake-off event.\n\nStarting with A. Betty Crocker: I know that Betty Crocker is a brand famous for its cooking and baking products, and they've been around for a long time. I think they have a lot of recipes and baking tips, but I'm not sure if they host an annual bake-off.\n\nOption B. Duncan Hines: Duncan Hines is known for its baking mixes and other food products, but I don't recall them hosting a bake-off. Maybe they do, but it's not as well-known as some of the others.\n\nOption C. Pillsbury: Now, Pillsbury comes to mind because they are famous for their baking products, especially their dough products like Pillsbury crescent rolls and biscuits. I seem to remember something about a Pillsbury bake-off, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption D. Keebler: Keebler is known for its cookies and other snack products, but again, I don't recall them hosting a bake-off.\n\nLet me try to recall more specifically. I think there was a popular baking competition called the Pillsbury Bake-Off that has been running for many years. I believe it started back in the 1940s or 1950s, and it's an annual event where home bakers can submit their recipes and compete for prizes.\n\nOn the other hand, Betty Crocker does have various baking contests and events, but I don't think they have an annual bake-off specifically named after them like the Pillsbury Bake-Off.\n\nDuncan Hines might have some baking contests, but again, not as prominent as the Pillsbury Bake-Off.\n\nKeebler doesn't seem to have any annual bake-offs that I can recall.\n\nSo, based on my memory, I would go with C. Pillsbury as the company that holds an annual self-named 'Bake-Off.'\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should quickly look up each option to confirm.\n\nStarting with Betty Crocker: A quick search shows that they do have baking contests and events, but no specific annual bake-off that's self-named like the question suggests.\n\nDuncan Hines: Similarly, they have various cooking and baking contests, but nothing that's an annual bake-off specifically named after them.\n\nPillsbury: Here, I find that the Pillsbury Bake-Off is indeed an annual baking competition that has been running since 1949. It's a prestigious event where home bakers can win significant prizes by submitting their original recipes.\n\nKeebler: They don't appear to have an annual bake-off.\n\nTherefore, it seems clear that the correct answer is C. Pillsbury.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
