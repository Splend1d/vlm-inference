                    "text": "As a result of the increasing northward movement of the population from a nearby city, a town enacted a zoning ordinance restricting present and future land use in the town to single family dwellings, except in the downtown commercial shopping area, and except for a small area in which multifamily dwellings not over 40 feet in height were permitted. In addition, all new construction or exterior modifications of existing buildings required prior approval of an aesthetic control board. The zoning ordinance defined the term \"family\" in the context of single family dwellings to mean only one or more persons related by marriage, blood, or adoption, thereby excluding unrelated, unmarried persons from residing in a single residence unit. The enabling legislation contained the following provision:\"This enactment is necessary to preserve the physical and social homogeneity of this community, and preserve and protect the quality of life of its citizens. \"A town resident owns a single family residence with five bedrooms. Prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinance, the resident leased the premises on a month-to-month basis to a boyfriend and girlfriend and three other male law students. The five individuals are all unmarried and attend the nearby law school. The resident now brings suit to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance against himself. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance provision that prohibits unrelated, unmarried persons from residing in a single family residence?\n\nA. The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The zoning ordinance would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the resident's rights under the contract clause.\nD. The zoning ordinance provision would be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option is the most accurate regarding the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance that restricts \"family\" to only related persons by marriage, blood, or adoption in a single-family dwelling. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the ordinance is doing. It's defining \"family\" narrowly to exclude unrelated, unmarried individuals living together. This affects the town resident who was leasing their five-bedroom house to five unrelated, unmarried individuals, presumably as roommates.\n\nNow, the resident is suing to stop the enforcement of this ordinance. So, the question is whether this provision is constitutional.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Unconstitutional under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nB. Unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nC. Unconstitutional under the contract clause.\n\nD. Constitutional under the state's police power.\n\nI need to think about which constitutional principle is being potentially violated here.\n\nOption A mentions due process. Due process generally ensures that laws don't arbitrarily interfere with personal liberties or property rights. In this case, the ordinance is restricting who can live together in a single-family home, which could be seen as interfering with personal liberty or family choices.\n\nOption B is about equal protection, which ensures that laws treat people equally without unjustified discrimination. Here, the ordinance discriminates against unrelated, unmarried individuals by not allowing them to live together in a single-family dwelling.\n\nOption C refers to the contract clause, which protects the obligation of contracts. The resident had a month-to-month lease with the five individuals, so perhaps there's an argument that the ordinance interferes with this contractual relationship.\n\nOption D suggests that the ordinance is constitutional under the state's police power, which allows states to enact laws for the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens.\n\nLet me consider each option in more detail.\n\nStarting with Option A, due process. The due process clause guarantees certain fundamental rights and ensures that any deprivation of life, liberty, or property is done in a fair manner. If the ordinance is seen as infringing on a fundamental right, then it would need to pass strict scrutiny, meaning it must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\n\nIs living arrangements a fundamental right? Well, the Supreme Court has recognized a right to privacy and autonomy in personal relationships, including choices about whom to live with. For example, in Moore v. East Cleveland, the Court struck down a zoning ordinance that restricted the number of unrelated individuals who could live together, finding it violated the due process clause because it interfered with the right to familial association.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, the ordinance limits who can live together in a single-family home based on their relationships, which could be seen as infringing on this right to familial association.\n\nOption B, equal protection. The equal protection clause requires that laws treat people equally unless there's a legitimate reason to differentiate. Here, the ordinance discriminates against unrelated, unmarried individuals by not allowing them to live together in single-family dwellings.\n\nI need to think about what kind of scrutiny would apply here. If the classification affects a fundamental right or a suspect class, it's subject to strict scrutiny. If it's a quasi-suspect class, intermediate scrutiny applies, and for other classifications, rational basis review is used.\n\nIn this case, is there a suspect or quasi-suspect class being discriminated against? Unmarried individuals and unrelated persons might be considered quasi-suspect classes, which would trigger intermediate scrutiny.\n\nUnder intermediate scrutiny, the ordinance would need to be substantially related to an important government interest.\n\nThe enabling legislation states that the ordinance is necessary \"to preserve the physical and social homogeneity of this community, and preserve and protect the quality of life of its citizens.\"\n\nIs preserving social homogeneity and quality of life important government interests? Probably, but I need to consider whether the ordinance is substantially related to achieving those interests.\n\nOption C, the contract clause. The contract clause prohibits states from passing laws that retroactively impair contract rights. Here, the resident had a month-to-month lease with the five individuals, which is a contractual relationship.\n\nIf the ordinance prevents the resident from continuing to lease to these individuals because they are unrelated and unmarried, then it could be argued that it impairs this existing contract.\n\nHowever, contract clause claims are often subject to a balancing test, considering the validity of the state's interest against the degree to which the contract is impaired.\n\nOption D, constitutional under police power. States have broad police power to enact laws for the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens. Zoning ordinances are typically within this power, as they regulate land use to promote community welfare.\n\nBut even under police power, laws must still comply with due process and equal protection requirements. So, while the general zoning power is constitutional, specific provisions might still be challenged on constitutional grounds.\n\nGiven all this, I need to decide which option is the most accurate.\n\nOption A suggests the ordinance would be declared unconstitutional under due process. Given the Supreme Court's recognition of a right to familial association, and the ordinance's restriction on who can live together, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B suggests equal protection issues. While there is discrimination based on relationship status, which could be subject to intermediate scrutiny, it's not clear that this would necessarily lead to the ordinance being struck down, depending on how the court balances the interests.\n\nOption C, contract clause, might be a stretch because month-to-month leases can typically be terminated with minimal notice anyway, and the impairment may not be significant enough to violate the contract clause.\n\nOption D suggests the ordinance would be upheld under police power. While zoning ordinances are generally constitutional, this specific provision might not withstand constitutional scrutiny due to due process or equal protection concerns.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Option A is the most accurate. The ordinance likely violates the due process clause by infringing on the right to familial association, and therefore would be declared unconstitutional.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
