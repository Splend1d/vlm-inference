I need to find out how many baskets she made.\n\nSo, if each basket is worth 2 points, and she scored 18 points in total, I can think of this as dividing the total points by the points per basket to find the number of baskets.\n\nThat is, number of baskets = total points / points per basket.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: number of baskets = 18 / 2.\n\nLet me do the division: 18 divided by 2 is 9.\n\nSo, Jess made 9 baskets.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 20\n\nB. 16\n\nC. 9\n\nD. 8\n\nThe correct answer should be C. 9.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here. Does basketball have different types of baskets worth different points? I know that typically, a regular basket is worth 2 points, and a three-pointer is worth 3 points. But the question specifies that each basket she made was worth 2 points. So, I think it's safe to assume all her baskets were 2-pointers.\n\nTherefore, 18 points divided by 2 points per basket equals 9 baskets.\n\nYes, I think C. 9 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
