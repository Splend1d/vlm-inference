                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Planet X. It says that Planet X orbits its sun once every 100 Earth days and rotates in the prograde direction around its axis with a sidereal day of 100 Earth days. I need to figure out how long a solar day is on Planet X. The options are about 10 Earth days, about 100 Earth days, about 200 Earth days, or there is no solar day because Planet X is tidally locked.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a solar day is. A solar day is the time between two successive noons, when the sun is highest in the sky. It's what we commonly think of as a day. A sidereal day, on the other hand, is the time it takes for the planet to rotate once relative to the stars, not considering the sun.\n\nPlanet X has a sidereal day of 100 Earth days, which means it takes 100 Earth days for it to rotate once relative to the stars. It also orbits its sun every 100 Earth days. Since it's rotating in the prograde direction, that means it's rotating in the same direction as its orbit around the sun.\n\nTo find the solar day, I need to consider both the rotation of the planet on its axis and its revolution around the sun. The formula for the solar day (Ds) in terms of the sidereal day (Dsiderial) and the orbital period (P) is:\n\nDs = Dsiderial / (1 - Dsiderial / P)\n\nGiven that Dsiderial = 100 Earth days and P = 100 Earth days, plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\nDs = 100 / (1 - 100 / 100) = 100 / (1 - 1) = 100 / 0\n\nWait, that's a problem. Dividing by zero is undefined. That suggests that something special is happening here.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If the sidereal day is equal to the orbital period, that means the planet is rotating at the same rate that it's orbiting the sun. In other words, the rotation period matches the revolution period.\n\nThis sounds a lot like tidal locking, where one side of the planet always faces the sun. If that's the case, then there would be no solar day because the sun doesn't rise and set; it stays fixed in the sky on one side of the planet.\n\nBut the problem says that Planet X is rotating in the prograde direction with a sidereal day of 100 Earth days, and it orbits every 100 Earth days. So, yes, that sounds like tidal locking.\n\nHowever, the options include \"there is no solar day because Planet X is tidally locked,\" but I should confirm if that's indeed the case.\n\nTidal locking occurs when the orbital period of a celestial body matches its rotational period, causing the same side to always face the body it's orbiting. In this case, since both the orbital period and the rotational period are 100 Earth days, it's likely that Planet X is tidally locked to its sun.\n\nIf that's the case, then there isn't a solar day in the traditional sense because the sun doesn't rise and set; it remains fixed in the sky. One side of the planet always faces the sun, experiencing perpetual daylight, while the other side faces away, experiencing perpetual night.\n\nBut let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to interpret it.\n\nSuppose Planet X is tidally locked, meaning it always shows the same face to its sun. In that case, the solar day would be infinite because the sun doesn't move across the sky; it stays in the same position all the time.\n\nHowever, the option says \"there is no solar day because Planet X is tidally locked,\" which seems accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the planet isn't completely tidally locked, but in a state where its rotation and orbit are synchronized in a different way. But given that the sidereal day equals the orbital period, it's hard to see how that would differ from tidal locking.\n\nLet me consider the relative speeds. If the planet orbits the sun once every 100 days and rotates once every 100 days in the same direction, then from the perspective of an observer on the planet, the sun would appear stationary in the sky.\n\nTherefore, there would be no solar day as we know it. So, the answer should be that there is no solar day because Planet X is tidally locked.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that Planet X rotates in the prograde direction with a sidereal day of 100 Earth days and orbits every 100 Earth days, but it doesn't explicitly state that it's tidally locked. Maybe there's a difference.\n\nPerhaps the planet is in the process of becoming tidally locked but isn't fully there yet. In that case, there might still be a solar day, but it could be very long.\n\nHowever, given that the sidereal day and the orbital period are exactly equal, it's reasonable to conclude that the planet is indeed tidally locked.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that there is no solar day because Planet X is tidally locked.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. There is no solar day because Planet X is tidally locked}} \\]"
