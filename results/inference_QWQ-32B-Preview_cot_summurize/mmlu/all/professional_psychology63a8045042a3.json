So, it's about the power that comes from their position.\n\nOption A is expert power, which is when someone has power because they are seen as an expert in their field. But in this case, the supervisor is talking about power from their position, not from their expertise.\n\nOption B is legitimate power, which is power that comes from the formal position or role in an organization. That sounds like what the supervisor is referring to. They have authority because of their position.\n\nOption C is reward power, which is the ability to give rewards or benefits to others. While supervisors can have reward power, the statement doesn't mention anything about giving rewards; it's more about the expectation that orders will be followed because of the position.\n\nOption D is referent power, which is when someone has power because others respect and look up to them. Again, this is not about personal qualities or relationships but about the position itself.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the supervisor is talking about legitimate power. Their authority comes from their position, and subordinates follow orders because of that positional authority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
