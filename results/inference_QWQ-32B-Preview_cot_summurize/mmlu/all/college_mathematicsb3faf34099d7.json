The question is: A group G in which (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 for all a, b in G is necessarily... and then it gives options: finite, cyclic, of order two, or abelian.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the condition (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 implies for the group G. Let's start by expanding both sides.\n\nWe know that (ab)^2 means abab, and a^2 b^2 means a a b b. So the equation is:\n\nabab = aabb\n\nNow, I can try to manipulate this equation to see what it tells me about the group operation.\n\nLet's multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by b^{-1}, to see if I can isolate some terms.\n\nStarting with:\n\nabab = aabb\n\nMultiply on the left by a^{-1}:\n\n(a^{-1}a)bab = a^{-1}aabb\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nbab = abb\n\nNow, multiply on the right by b^{-1}:\n\nbab b^{-1} = abb b^{-1}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nba = ab\n\nWait, that's interesting. So from the original condition, I've derived that ba = ab for all a, b in G. That means that G is an abelian group.\n\nLet me check if I did this correctly. Starting from (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2, which is abab = aabb.\n\nThen, multiplying both sides on the left by a^{-1}:\n\na^{-1} abab = a^{-1} aabb\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nbab = abb\n\nThen, multiplying both sides on the right by b^{-1}:\n\nbab b^{-1} = abb b^{-1}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nba = ab\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the condition (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 for all a, b in G implies that G is abelian.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. finite\n\nB. cyclic\n\nC. of order two\n\nD. abelian\n\nAccording to my reasoning, the group is necessarily abelian. But I should check if it's necessarily any of the other options as well.\n\nIs G necessarily finite? Well, consider the group of integers under addition. In that group, (a + b)^2 = a + b + a + b = 2a + 2b = a^2 + b^2, since a^2 = a + a = 2a, and similarly for b. So, the condition holds, but the group of integers is infinite. So, G is not necessarily finite.\n\nOption B: cyclic. Is G necessarily cyclic? Well, a cyclic group is abelian, but not all abelian groups are cyclic. For example, the Klein four-group is abelian but not cyclic. So, even though G is abelian, it's not necessarily cyclic.\n\nOption C: of order two. Well, the condition holds for some groups of order two, but as we've seen, it also holds for groups like the integers, which have infinite order, and for other abelian groups of different orders. So, G is not necessarily of order two.\n\nTherefore, the only option that necessarily holds is D: abelian.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there are any non-abelian groups that satisfy (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2. If I can find even one non-abelian group where this condition holds, then D would not be the correct answer.\n\nLet's consider the dihedral group D3, which is non-abelian. Let's take two elements, say a rotation r and a reflection s. In D3, r^3 = e and s^2 = e, and sr = r^{-1} s.\n\nLet's compute (rs)^2 and r^2 s^2.\n\nFirst, (rs)^2 = rs rs.\n\nSince sr = r^{-1} s, we can rewrite rs rs as r (s r) s = r (r^{-1} s) s = (r r^{-1}) s s = e s s = s^2 = e.\n\nNow, r^2 s^2 = r^2 e = r^2.\n\nIn D3, r^2 is not e (since r^3 = e and r \u2260 e), so (rs)^2 = e \u2260 r^2 = r^2 s^2.\n\nTherefore, D3 does not satisfy the condition (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 for all a, b in G.\n\nLet me try another non-abelian group, maybe the quaternion group Q8.\n\nQ8 consists of {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}, with relations like i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = i j k = -1.\n\nLet's take two elements, say i and j.\n\nCompute (ij)^2 and i^2 j^2.\n\nFirst, ij = k, so (ij)^2 = k^2 = -1.\n\nMeanwhile, i^2 = -1 and j^2 = -1, so i^2 j^2 = (-1)(-1) = 1.\n\nSo, (ij)^2 = -1 \u2260 1 = i^2 j^2.\n\nTherefore, Q8 does not satisfy the condition either.\n\nIt seems that non-abelian groups do not satisfy (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 for all a, b in G.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: abelian.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
