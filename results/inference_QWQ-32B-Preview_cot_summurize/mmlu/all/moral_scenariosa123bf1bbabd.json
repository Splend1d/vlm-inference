Preparing and serving food is generally considered a neutral or positive action. There's nothing inherently morally wrong about making an omelet unless there are specific circumstances not mentioned here, such as serving it to someone with a food allergy or without their knowledge. But based on the information provided, this seems like a normal, everyday activity.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character follows their wife into the fitting room to watch her try on a new dress. Fitting rooms are private spaces designed for individuals to try on clothes in privacy. Entering such a space without permission can be considered intrusive and a violation of personal boundaries. In many cultures and according to ordinary moral standards, respecting someone's privacy is important, especially within a marriage where trust and respect are foundational.\n\nConsidering these points, Scenario 1 appears to be not wrong, while Scenario 2 seems to involve an action that is morally wrong due to the invasion of privacy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
