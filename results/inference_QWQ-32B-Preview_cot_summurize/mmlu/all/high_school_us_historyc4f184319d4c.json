Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope.\u2026 It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\n\u2014Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775\nIn this passage, Henry expresses an abiding American concern about which of the following?\n\nA. No entangling alliances with foreign countries\nB. The dangers of standing armies\nC. Self-government\nD. The separation of church and state\n"

                    "text": "I'm looking at this passage from Patrick Henry's famous speech in 1775. It's pretty intense; he's really stirring up emotions here. Let me try to understand what he's saying and see which of these options\u2014no entangling alliances, dangers of standing armies, self-government, or separation of church and state\u2014best matches his main concern.\n\nFirst, he talks about everything they've done to avert the storm, like petitioning, remonstrating, supplicating, and prostrating themselves before the throne. It sounds like they've tried to be peaceful and seek reconciliation with Britain, but their efforts have been ignored or met with violence and insult. He says there's no longer any room for hope and that the war has actually begun.\n\nHe mentions that their petitions have been slighted, remonstrances have produced additional violence, supplications disregarded, and they've been spurned with contempt. So, it seems like he's frustrated with Britain not listening to their grievances and instead escalating the situation.\n\nThen, he asks rhetorical questions: Why are they standing idle? What do gentlemen wish? Is life so dear or peace so sweet that they'd buy it with chains and slavery? He invokes God and says, \"Give me liberty or give me death!\" which is a pretty powerful statement about choosing freedom over submission.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. No entangling alliances with foreign countries.\n\nWell, in the passage, he's talking about their relationship with Britain, which was their mother country at the time. But he's not specifically discussing alliances with foreign countries; he's discussing their relationship with Britain and the need for independence.\n\nB. The dangers of standing armies.\n\nHe does mention that the next gale will bring the clash of resounding arms, and that their brethren are already in the field, which suggests that there's military action happening. But he doesn't explicitly talk about the dangers of standing armies in this passage. He seems more focused on the need to act and fight for liberty rather than avoiding armies.\n\nC. Self-government.\n\nThis seems really relevant. The entire context is about seeking independence from British rule because their attempts to resolve issues peacefully have failed. The idea of self-government is central to the American Revolution, and Henry's speech is encouraging his fellow colonists to fight for that right.\n\nD. The separation of church and state.\n\nWhile he does say \"Forbid it, Almighty God!\" which invokes divine support, the main thrust of the speech isn't about the relationship between church and state. It's about the political situation and the choice between liberty and slavery.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the abiding American concern expressed in this passage is about self-government. Henry is arguing that peaceful attempts to influence British policies have failed, and now the only option left is to fight for their right to govern themselves.\n\nSo, I would go with option C: self-government.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
