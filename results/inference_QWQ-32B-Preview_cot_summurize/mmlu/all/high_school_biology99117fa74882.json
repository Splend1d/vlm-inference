                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about DDT and insect pests. So, DDT was once thought of as a \"silver bullet\" that could get rid of insect pests forever, but now it's not very effective against many insects. The question is asking which option would have been necessary for the DDT eradication effort to be successful in the long run.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Larger doses of DDT should have been applied.\n\nB. All habitats should have received applications of DDT at about the same time.\n\nC. The frequency of DDT application should have been higher.\n\nD. None of the individual insects should have possessed genomes that made them resistant to DDT.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why DDT isn't effective anymore. I think it's because the insects have developed resistance to it. That makes sense, since we're talking about genetics and evolution.\n\nSo, if insects have developed resistance, that means some insects had genetic variations that allowed them to survive DDT, and they passed those genes on to their offspring.\n\nTherefore, if none of the individual insects had genomes that made them resistant to DDT, then all insects would be susceptible, and DDT would keep working. That sounds like option D.\n\nBut let's think about the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A suggests using larger doses of DDT. But if insects are already resistant, bigger doses might not help because the resistance mechanisms can handle the DDT, whether the dose is small or large.\n\nOption B proposes applying DDT to all habitats at the same time. That might help in the short term by hitting all insect populations at once, but it wouldn't prevent resistance from developing over time. So, it's not addressing the root cause of the problem.\n\nOption C suggests increasing the frequency of DDT application. Again, this might have short-term benefits, but it doesn't solve the issue of resistance developing.\n\nSo, it seems like option D is the correct answer because if no insects had resistance genes to begin with, then DDT would continue to be effective.\n\nBut wait, is it possible to have a population where none of the individuals have any resistance genes? In reality, there might always be some variation in a population, so maybe having \"none\" with resistance genes is unrealistic.\n\nMaybe the question is more theoretical, assuming that if no insects had resistance genes, DDT would remain effective.\n\nAlso, I recall that in evolutionary terms, if there's no genetic variation for resistance, then selection can't favor resistant individuals, and DDT would keep working.\n\nBut in practice, it's hard to ensure that no insects have resistance genes, especially over time, as mutations can occur.\n\nSo, perhaps the question is testing the understanding that resistance arises from genetic variation, and if that variation isn't present, DDT could remain effective.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: None of the individual insects should have possessed genomes that made them resistant to DDT.\n\nI think that makes the most sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
