                    "text": "I've got this question about a US president being mentioned in the opening theme song of \"All in the Family.\" The options are Calvin Coolidge, Harry Truman, Herbert Hoover, and Richard Nixon. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some information about \"All in the Family.\" It's a classic American sitcom that originally aired in the 1970s. The show is known for its controversial topics and the character of Archie Bunker, played by Carroll O'Connor. The opening theme song is pretty iconic, and I think it includes some references to politics, given the nature of the show.\n\nLet me try to remember the lyrics of the opening theme. I think it goes something like this:\n\n\"Those were the days, my friend\nWe thought they'd never end\nWe'd sing and dance\nAnd oh what a blast we'd have\n'Cause those were the days\nYes, those were the days\nWe'd have a few beers\nAnd we'd sit and we'd shoot the breeze\nAnd we'd sing a few songs\nAnd we'd have a few laughs\nThose were the days\nMe and my old lady\nWe'd take a little trip to the store\nAnd we'd hold hands walking down the street\nAnd everybody knew our names\nThose were the days\nWhen Herbert Hoover was president\nAnd we didn't have to think\n'Cause he took care of everything\nThose were the days\"\n\nWait, I think I remember Herbert Hoover being mentioned in the lyrics. But let me double-check because the question specifically says which US president is mentioned by name in the opening theme song, and the options include Herbert Hoover.\n\nI recall that in the show, Archie Bunker often mentions Herbert Hoover favorably, associating him with simpler, better times. So it makes sense that Hoover would be mentioned in the theme song.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should confirm if any of the other presidents listed are mentioned in the song. Let's think about Calvin Coolidge, Harry Truman, and Richard Nixon.\n\nCalvin Coolidge was a president in the 1920s, known for his pro-business approach and small government policies. He might be associated with a period of economic prosperity, but I don't recall him being mentioned in the \"All in the Family\" theme song.\n\nHarry Truman was president from 1945 to 1953, after Franklin D. Roosevelt. He's known for making the decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan, integrating the military, and dealing with the start of the Cold War. Again, I don't think he's mentioned in the theme song.\n\nRichard Nixon was president from 1969 to 1974 and is known for his foreign policy achievements, such as opening relations with China, and for the Watergate scandal, which led to his resignation. Given that \"All in the Family\" started airing in 1971, during Nixon's presidency, it's possible that he might be referenced in the show, but I don't think he's mentioned in the theme song.\n\nGoing back to Herbert Hoover, he was president from 1929 to 1933, during the onset of the Great Depression. He's often associated with the economic hardships of that time, although his administration's response to the Depression is a subject of historical debate.\n\nIn \"All in the Family,\" Archie Bunker often looks back fondly on the past, romanticizing earlier times. Mentioning Hoover in the theme song might be a way to capture Archie's nostalgic, sometimes misguided, view of history.\n\nTo confirm, I can look up the lyrics of the \"All in the Family\" theme song online. But since this is a hypothetical scenario, I'll proceed based on my memory.\n\nSo, according to my recollection, Herbert Hoover is the US president mentioned by name in the opening theme song of \"All in the Family.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Herbert Hoover.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nA. Calvin Coolidge: While Coolidge was a president associated with the Roaring Twenties, there's no specific connection to \"All in the Family's\" theme song.\n\nB. Harry Truman: Truman's presidency was before the time period of \"All in the Family,\" and I don't recall him being mentioned in the theme song.\n\nD. Richard Nixon: Nixon was the president when \"All in the Family\" first aired, but again, I don't think he's mentioned in the theme song.\n\nHence, the answer is C. Herbert Hoover.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
