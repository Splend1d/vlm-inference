                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about assigning professors to courses. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nWe have 10 professors and 20 different courses. Each professor is assigned to teach exactly 2 courses, and each course has exactly one professor. So, it's like pairing up professors with courses, but each professor gets two courses.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many ways to assign the courses to the professors under these constraints.\n\nOne way to think about it is to consider that we have 20 courses to assign, and each professor gets exactly 2 of them.\n\nSo, maybe I can start by choosing 2 courses for the first professor, then 2 for the second, and so on, until all courses are assigned.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFor the first professor, there are 20 courses to choose from, and we need to choose 2. The number of ways to choose 2 courses out of 20 is \"20 choose 2\", which is denoted as C(20,2). That's equal to 20! / (2! * (20-2)!) = (20*19)/2 = 190.\n\nThen, for the second professor, there are 18 courses left, so C(18,2) = (18*17)/2 = 153.\n\nContinuing this way, for the third professor, it's C(16,2) = (16*15)/2 = 120, and so on, until the last professor, who gets C(2,2) = 1 way.\n\nSo, the total number of ways would be:\n\nC(20,2) * C(18,2) * C(16,2) * ... * C(2,2)\n\nThat's the product of these combinations.\n\nBut wait, another way to look at it is to consider that we're dividing the 20 courses into 10 groups of 2 courses each, and then assigning each group to a professor.\n\nSo, the number of ways to divide 20 courses into 10 unordered pairs is given by:\n\n(20 choose 2) * (18 choose 2) * ... * (2 choose 2) / 10!\n\nBecause the order in which we assign the pairs to the professors doesn't matter initially. But since each professor is distinct, we need to assign these pairs to specific professors, so we have to multiply by 10! for the permutations of the professors.\n\nSo, total assignments would be:\n\n[C(20,2) * C(18,2) * ... * C(2,2)] / 10! * 10!\n\nWait, the 10! cancels out, so it's just C(20,2) * C(18,2) * ... * C(2,2).\n\nBut let's think differently. Maybe there's a better way to compute this.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each course needs to be assigned to one of the 10 professors, and each professor needs to have exactly 2 courses.\n\nBut that seems a bit messy. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of permutations.\n\nLet's consider arranging the 20 courses in a line, and then assigning the first 2 to professor 1, the next 2 to professor 2, and so on.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange 20 courses is 20!.\n\nBut, within each pair of 2 courses for a professor, the order doesn't matter. That is, assigning course A and then course B to a professor is the same as assigning course B and then course A.\n\nSince there are 2 courses per professor, and there are 10 professors, there are 10 pairs, each with 2! = 2 ways to arrange them.\n\nSo, to account for this, we need to divide by 2^10.\n\nTherefore, the total number of assignments is 20! / (2^10).\n\nWait a minute, but I need to confirm this.\n\nLet's see: total arrangements of courses: 20!\n\nThen, for each professor, the order within their 2 courses doesn't matter, so we divide by 2 for each professor, hence 2^10.\n\nSo, 20! / 2^10.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 20!/2^10, which matches this.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as selecting 2 courses for each professor in sequence.\n\nFirst professor: C(20,2)\n\nSecond professor: C(18,2)\n\n...\n\nTenth professor: C(2,2)\n\nSo, the product is C(20,2) * C(18,2) * ... * C(2,2)\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n[20! / (2! * 18!)] * [18! / (2! * 16!)] * ... * [2! / (2! * 0!)]\n\nMost terms cancel out, and we're left with 20! / (2!^10)\n\nSince each C(2k,2) = (2k)(2k-1)/2\n\nSo, overall product is 20! / (2^10 * 10!)\n\nWait, no, actually, in this sequence, the factorials cancel in such a way that it's 20! / (2^10 * 10!)\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 20! / 2^10, without the 10!.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me compute a smaller case to verify.\n\nSuppose there are 2 professors and 4 courses.\n\nEach professor teaches 2 courses.\n\nUsing the formula, it should be 4! / 2^2 = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nBut let's list them out.\n\nCourses: A,B,C,D\n\nProf1: A,B; Prof2: C,D\n\nProf1: A,C; Prof2: B,D\n\nProf1: A,D; Prof2: B,C\n\nThat's 3 different assignments.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 6, which is not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some.\n\nAlternative assignments:\n\nProf1: B,C; Prof2: A,D\n\nProf1: B,D; Prof2: A,C\n\nProf1: C,D; Prof2: A,B\n\nWait, that's 6 assignments, matching the formula.\n\nSo, in this smaller case, 4! / 2^2 = 6, which matches the actual count.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, 20! / 2^10 should be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's see why the other approach gave me 20! / (2^10 * 10!).\n\nIn the product of combinations: C(20,2) * C(18,2) * ... * C(2,2)\n\nEach C(2k,2) = (2k)(2k-1)/2\n\nSo, the product is (20*19)/2 * (18*17)/2 * ... * (2*1)/2\n\nWhich is (20*19 * 18*17 * ... * 2*1) / 2^10\n\nNow, 20*19*18*17*...*2*1 is 20!\n\nSo, the product is 20! / 2^10\n\nTherefore, it matches the first approach.\n\nSo, why did I think it was 20! / (2^10 * 10!) earlier? Maybe I was confusing it with something else.\n\nNo, actually, in this case, it's just 20! / 2^10.\n\nOption A is indeed correct.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about assigning courses to professors:\n\nEach course needs to be assigned to one of the 10 professors, and each professor needs to have exactly 2 courses.\n\nBut that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as dividing 20 courses into 10 unordered pairs, and then assigning these pairs to professors.\n\nThe number of ways to divide 20 courses into 10 unordered pairs is 20! / (2^10 * 10!)\n\nThen, assigning these pairs to the 10 professors is 10! ways.\n\nSo, total assignments would be [20! / (2^10 * 10!)] * 10! = 20! / 2^10\n\nWhich again confirms option A.\n\nWait, but this is the same as my first approach.\n\nSo, both approaches confirm that the answer is 20! / 2^10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\dfrac{20!}{2^{10}} } \\]"
