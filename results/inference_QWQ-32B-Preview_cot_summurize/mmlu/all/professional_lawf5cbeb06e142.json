                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out who gets the $5,000 left after the foreclosure sale. So, there's a man who bought a house, got a loan from a bank, and then another loan from a credit union to make repairs. Both loans are secured by mortgages on the house, and they were recorded in the order they were granted. The man defaulted on the bank loan, so the bank foreclosed, and there's $5,000 left after paying off the bank and covering sale expenses. The credit union still has a $20,000 balance, and both the man and the credit union are claiming the $5,000. There's no specific statute mentioned, so I guess I have to go by general principles of mortgage law.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the order of the mortgages. Since both mortgages were recorded in the order they were granted, that means the bank's mortgage is first and the credit union's is second. In most jurisdictions, the recording order determines the priority of the mortgages. So, the first mortgagee (the bank) has priority over the second mortgagee (the credit union).\n\nNow, in a foreclosure sale, the proceeds are typically distributed in the order of priority of the liens. That means the first mortgagee gets paid first, up to the amount they're owed, and then any remaining proceeds go to the second mortgagee, and so on.\n\nIn this case, the bank foreclosed and got the house sold. After paying off the bank's debt and the sale expenses, there's $5,000 left. The credit union still has a $20,000 balance, but only $5,000 is available.\n\nOption A says the credit union gets the $5,000 because they have priority. But wait, the bank's mortgage is first, so shouldn't the bank get paid first? But the bank already got paid in full because the sale covered their debt. So, the remaining $5,000 should go to the next in line, which is the credit union.\n\nOption B says the credit union gets the $5,000 because the man is personally liable on the debt. Well, the man is personally liable on both debts, but that doesn't affect the distribution of the sale proceeds. Personal liability might come into play later if the mortgage doesn't cover the full debt, but in this case, we're only dealing with the sale proceeds.\n\nOption C says the man gets the $5,000 because of his equitable right of redemption. I'm not sure about this. The equitable right of redemption generally allows the owner to redeem the property before the foreclosure sale, but since the sale has already occurred, and the outside party has acquired the house, I don't think the man has any right to the remaining proceeds.\n\nOption D says the man gets the $5,000 because the outside party received title subject to the second mortgage. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. In a foreclosure by the first mortgagee, the sale usually extinguishes the junior mortgages, so the outside party would get title free of the second mortgage.\n\nWait, but in some jurisdictions, the second mortgagee might have some rights to the surplus. Let me think again.\n\nActually, in a foreclosure sale, if there are surplus proceeds after paying off the foreclosing mortgagee, those surplus proceeds should go to the next priority claimant, which in this case is the credit union.\n\nBut let's consider that the man is personally liable on both notes. So, even if the house is sold and there's a deficiency, he can still be pursued for the remaining debt.\n\nGiven that, the $5,000 surplus should go to the second mortgagee, which is the credit union, to apply against the $20,000 balance.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct: the credit union gets the $5,000 because they have priority after the first mortgagee is paid off.\n\nWait, but the bank is the first mortgagee, and they've been paid in full. So, the next in line is the credit union.\n\nOption B says the credit union gets it because the man is personally liable, but personal liability doesn't affect the distribution of the sale proceeds. It just means that after the sale, if there's a deficiency, the credit union can go after the man personally.\n\nSo, I think option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
