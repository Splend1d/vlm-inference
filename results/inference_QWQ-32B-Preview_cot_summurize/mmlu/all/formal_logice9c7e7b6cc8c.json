                    "text": "So I've got this logic problem here, and I need to identify the antecedent of a conditional proposition. The statement is: \"The university raises tuition if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a conditional proposition is. In logic, a conditional statement is typically in the form \"if P, then Q,\" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. So, in this case, I need to identify what's the \"if\" part, or the condition that must be met for something else to happen.\n\nThe statement says: \"The university raises tuition if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\" So, it seems like the condition here is that both the governor approves and the board recommends it, and if that happens, then the university raises tuition.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The university raises tuition.\n\nB. The governor approves of it.\n\nC. The board of trustees recommends it.\n\nD. The governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\n\nOption A is \"The university raises tuition,\" which sounds like the consequence, not the condition. Because it's what happens if the conditions are met.\n\nOption B is \"The governor approves of it.\" That's part of the condition, but it's not the whole condition because it says \"both the governor approves and the board recommends it.\" So, just the governor's approval isn't enough.\n\nOption C is \"The board of trustees recommends it.\" Again, similar to option B, it's part of the condition, but not the whole thing.\n\nOption D is \"The governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\" This seems to be the complete condition that must be met for the university to raise tuition.\n\nSo, based on the structure of the conditional statement, the antecedent should be the condition that must be satisfied, which is option D.\n\nTo double-check, let's rephrase the statement into a more standard \"if P, then Q\" format.\n\nOriginal statement: \"The university raises tuition if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nRephrased: \"If both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it, then the university raises tuition.\"\n\nNow it's clear that P (the antecedent) is \"both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it,\" and Q (the consequent) is \"the university raises tuition.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
