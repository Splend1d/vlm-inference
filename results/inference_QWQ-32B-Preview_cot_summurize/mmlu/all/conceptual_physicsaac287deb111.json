                    "text": "So I've got this question here about plane mirrors, and I need to figure out what the distance of my image behind the mirror is equal to. Let's see the options:\n\nA. half your height\n\nB. half your distance from the mirror\n\nC. your distance in front of the mirror\n\nD. more than your distance in front of the mirror\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall how plane mirrors work. I remember that in plane mirrors, the image formed is virtual and behind the mirror. Also, the image is the same size as the object, and it's upright.\n\nNow, about the distance. I think that the distance of the image behind the mirror is equal to the distance of the object in front of the mirror. Is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nImagine standing in front of a plane mirror, like a dressing mirror. If I stand 1 meter away from the mirror, where is my image? It should appear to be 1 meter behind the mirror, right? So, the distance of the image behind the mirror is equal to my distance in front of the mirror.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Is there any formula for this? I think there is a formula for mirror distances. In optics, for plane mirrors, the image distance (di) is equal to the object distance (do). So, di = do.\n\nThat makes sense. So, if I'm 2 meters away from the mirror, my image is 2 meters behind the mirror.\n\nLet me consider the options again:\n\nA. half your height - that doesn't make sense. My height has nothing to do with the distance of the image.\n\nB. half your distance from the mirror - that would be only half of where I am standing, but according to the formula, it's equal, not half.\n\nC. your distance in front of the mirror - that matches the formula di = do.\n\nD. more than your distance in front of the mirror - that would mean the image is farther behind the mirror than I am in front, which doesn't align with what I recall.\n\nSo, it seems like the correct answer is C. your distance in front of the mirror.\n\nBut let me think about this again to be sure. Is there any scenario where the image distance might be different?\n\nWell, in curved mirrors, like concave or convex mirrors, the image distance can be different from the object distance, but in plane mirrors, it should always be equal.\n\nAlso, I can think about real-life examples. When you look into a plane mirror, your image appears to be at a distance equal to how far you are from the mirror. If you move closer, your image moves closer accordingly.\n\nMoreover, if you measure the distance from your face to the mirror and from the mirror to where your image appears to be, they should be equal.\n\nI think that reinforces the idea that the image distance is equal to the object distance.\n\nLet me consider if there's any trick to this question. Maybe it's trying to see if I get confused between real and virtual images, or something like that.\n\nBut in a plane mirror, the image is always virtual and behind the mirror, and the distances are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some people might think that the image is closer or farther, but according to the mirror formula for plane mirrors, di = do.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through ray diagrams. If I draw rays coming from my face, reflecting off the mirror, and extending behind the mirror, they would intersect at a point equal to my distance in front of the mirror.\n\nSo, ray diagrams also support that the image distance equals the object distance.\n\nLet me consider option D: more than your distance in front of the mirror. That would suggest that the image is farther behind the mirror than I am in front, which doesn't align with the mirror formula.\n\nOption B: half your distance from the mirror. That would mean if I'm 2 meters away, the image is 1 meter behind the mirror, which contradicts the mirror formula.\n\nOption A: half your height. That's just irrelevant. The image distance shouldn't depend on your height.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C: your distance in front of the mirror.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's think about the mirror formula again. For plane mirrors, the focal length is infinite, but the relationship di = do still holds.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
