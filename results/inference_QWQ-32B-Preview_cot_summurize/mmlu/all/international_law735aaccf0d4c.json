I know that the UN has a lot of different bodies and committees, so I need to recall what the Human Rights Council specifically does and what its structure is like.\n\nOption A says that the UN Human Rights Council has the power to impose economic sanctions on a state for human rights violations. Hmm, I think sanctions are usually imposed by the Security Council, not the Human Rights Council. So, maybe A isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B says that the UN Human Rights Council scrutinizes the human rights records of member states on the Council and each member state of the UN. That sounds plausible. I think one of the main functions of the Human Rights Council is to monitor and promote human rights around the world, which would involve looking at the records of member states.\n\nOption C states that the UN Human Rights Council replaced the Economic and Social Committee of the UN. I'm not sure about that. I think the Human Rights Council was created to replace the Commission on Human Rights, not the Economic and Social Committee. So, maybe C is incorrect.\n\nOption D says that the UN Human Rights Council consists of 27 member states. I seem to recall that it has 47 member states, but I might be wrong. It's been a while since I studied this.\n\nLet me try to remember: The Human Rights Council is a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly, established in 2006 to replace the Commission on Human Rights. It's responsible for promoting and protecting human rights around the world. One of its key functions is the Universal Periodic Review, which looks at the human rights records of all UN member states.\n\nSo, considering that, option B seems the most accurate. It says that the Council scrutinizes the human rights records of member states on the Council and each member state of the UN. That aligns with the Universal Periodic Review process, where all member states' records are reviewed, not just those on the Council.\n\nOption A is likely incorrect because imposing sanctions is typically within the purview of the Security Council.\n\nOption C is probably wrong because the Economic and Social Committee sounds like it might be related to economic and social issues, not specifically human rights.\n\nOption D is almost certainly incorrect because I believe the Council has 47 members, not 27.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. The UN Human Rights Council scrutinizes the human rights records of member states on the Council and each member state of the UN.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
