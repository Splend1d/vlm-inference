                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about Justice for Hedgehogs by Ronald Dworkin, where he endorses 'Hume's principle.' The question is asking what Dworkin understands by this idea, and we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what 'Hume's principle' is. I remember that David Hume, the philosopher, made a famous distinction between 'is' and 'ought.' He said that you can't derive an 'ought' from an 'is,' meaning that facts about the world don't directly tell us what we should do or what the law should be. This is often referred to as the 'is-ought problem.'\n\nNow, Dworkin is endorsing Hume's principle in his book Justice for Hedgehogs. So, I need to see which of these options aligns with the idea that facts don't directly determine moral or legal obligations.\n\nOption A says, \"That there is no distinction between law and morality.\" Hmm, that sounds like legal positivism, which is actually contrary to Dworkin's views. Dworkin is known for arguing that law and morality are interconnected, so he wouldn't endorse the idea that there's no distinction between them.\n\nOption B says, \"That there is a distinction between right and wrong.\" Well, that seems pretty basic and not specifically related to Hume's principle. Plus, Dworkin would probably agree with that, but I don't think that's what's being referred to here.\n\nOption C says, \"That facts about the world or human nature cannot normally ordain what ought to be.\" This sounds a lot like Hume's is-ought problem. It's saying that facts don't directly tell us what we ought to do or what the law should be. That seems consistent with Hume's idea.\n\nOption D says, \"That human rights are fundamentally unsound.\" I don't recall Dworkin having that view. In fact, he's known for defending liberal political and legal ideas, which often include human rights.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C is the one that aligns with Hume's principle as endorsed by Dworkin. It captures the idea that facts don't directly determine moral or legal obligations, which is central to Hume's distinction.\n\nTo make sure, maybe I should look back at the text or find some resources on Dworkin's endorsement of Hume's principle. But since this is a multiple-choice question, and option C seems to fit best with what I know about Hume and Dworkin's views, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
