                    "text": "So I've got this question here. Samuel is 43, he just got a bonus at work, which is usually a good thing, right? But he's feeling like he's about to be fired. And the question is asking about cognitive distortions as defined by Aaron Beck. I need to figure out which one of these options best describes Samuel's thinking.\n\nFirst, I should probably remember what cognitive distortions are. They are basically thinking patterns that are inaccurate or irrational, and they can lead to problems like depression and anxiety. Aaron Beck is a psychologist who developed cognitive therapy, and he identified several common cognitive distortions.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Mustabatory thinking\n\nI think this might be a typo or something, because I don't recall a cognitive distortion called \"mustabatory thinking.\" Maybe it's supposed to be \"magical thinking\" or \"should statements,\" which are related to expectations about how things ought to be. But I'm not sure. I'll keep this in mind and see what the other options are.\n\nB. Polarized thinking\n\nThis one I recognize. Polarized thinking, also known as black-and-white thinking, is when someone sees things in extreme terms, like all good or all bad, with no middle ground. For example, if something isn't perfect, it's a complete failure.\n\nC. Personalization\n\nPersonalization is when someone believes that everything is related to them or their actions, even when it's not. For instance, if a colleague is in a bad mood, they might think it's because of something they did, when really it's unrelated.\n\nD. Arbitrary inference\n\nI'm not entirely sure about this one, but I think arbitrary inference is when someone draws a conclusion without sufficient evidence, based on their assumptions or biases.\n\nNow, let's think about Samuel's situation. He just got a bonus, which is typically a positive thing, indicating that his work is valued and he's performing well. But despite this, he feels like he's about to be fired. So there's a disconnect between the positive external feedback (the bonus) and his internal negative expectation (being fired).\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Mustabatory thinking - Not sure what this is, so I'll skip this for now.\n\nB. Polarized thinking - Is Samuel seeing things in extreme black-and-white terms? Well, maybe. He's focusing on the possibility of being fired despite getting a bonus. But polarized thinking is more about seeing things as all good or all bad, whereas here, he's experiencing both positivity and negativity at the same time.\n\nC. Personalization - Is he personalizing something? Maybe if he's attributing some external event to his own actions without reason. But the question doesn't provide enough context to see if that's the case.\n\nD. Arbitrary inference - This seems plausible. He's concluding that he's about to be fired without any real evidence to support that notion. The bonus should logically suggest the opposite, but he's making this negative inference anyway.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another option that's not listed, like \"catastrophizing,\" which is expecting the worst possible outcome in a situation. But the options don't include that.\n\nLet me double-check the terms.\n\nFirst, \"mustabatory thinking\" \u2013 I think this might be a misspelling or misremembering of \"must thinking,\" which is part of David Burns' list of cognitive distortions, where people have expectations that things \"must\" or \"have to\" be a certain way. But Aaron Beck's model might not use that exact term.\n\nAlternatively, it could be \"magnification,\" where someone exaggerates the importance of negative events.\n\nBut since the options include \"mustabatory thinking,\" maybe it's a specific term in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps it's \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" which is similar to polarized thinking.\n\nBut in Beck's original work, he identified several errors in thinking, including:\n\n1. Arbitrary inference: Drawing conclusions without evidence.\n\n2. Selective abstraction: Focusing on a single aspect of a situation while ignoring others.\n\n3. Overgeneralization: Applying a general rule to specific situations\u4e0d\u5f53ly.\n\n4. Personalization: Attributing external events to one's own actions.\n\n5. Catastrophizing: Expecting the worst-case scenario.\n\nGiven these, let's see which one fits Samuel's situation best.\n\nHe's focusing on the possibility of being fired despite receiving a bonus. It doesn't seem like he's personalizing anything here; he's not attributing the bonus or lack thereof to his own actions specifically. So personalization might not be the best fit.\n\nPolarized thinking could be a possibility if he's seeing his job security in extreme terms, but it's not entirely clear.\n\nArbitrary inference seems quite fitting because he's concluding that he's about to be fired without any real evidence to support that conclusion. In fact, the bonus suggests the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he's engaging in \"discounting the positive,\" where he minimizes or dismisses positive experiences and focuses on negative ones.\n\nBut \"discounting the positive\" isn't listed in the options.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Mustabatory thinking \u2013 unclear what this is.\n\nB. Polarized thinking \u2013 possible but not the best fit.\n\nC. Personalization \u2013\u4e0d\u592a\u7b26\u5408\u3002\n\nD. Arbitrary inference \u2013 seems like the best fit.\n\nTherefore, I would go with D. Arbitrary inference.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other way to interpret Samuel's thoughts.\n\nMaybe he's experiencing anxiety or depression, which is causing him to have these irrational thoughts. But the question is specifically about cognitive distortions as defined by Aaron Beck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he has some other reasons to believe he might be fired, like rumors in the company or performance issues that he's not mentioning here. But based on the information provided, I have to go with the assumption that the bonus is the recent event and he's feeling uneasy despite it.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think the best answer is D. Arbitrary inference, because he's making a negative conclusion without sufficient evidence, given the positive feedback he's received.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
