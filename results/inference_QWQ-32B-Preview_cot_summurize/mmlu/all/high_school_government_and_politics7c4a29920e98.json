                    "text": "To determine how many votes a presidential nominee to the Supreme Court needs to be confirmed by the Senate, we need to understand the Senate's confirmation process.\n\nThe U.S. Senate has 100 members, and for most matters, including Supreme Court nominations, a simple majority is required to confirm a nominee. A simple majority means more than half of the senators present and voting.\n\nGiven that there are 100 senators, a simple majority would be 51 votes (since 50 is exactly half, and 51 is more than half).\n\nLet's look at the options provided:\n\nA. Forty percent of 100 is 40 votes.\n\nB. Fifty-one percent of 100 is 51 votes.\n\nC. Fifty-five percent of 100 is 55 votes.\n\nD. Sixty percent of 100 is 60 votes.\n\nOption B states fifty-one percent, which is 51 votes, matching the simple majority required for confirmation.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in the past, Senate rules have sometimes required a higher threshold for confirmation, such as a cloture vote to end debate, which would require 60 votes. But currently, for Supreme Court nominations, the simple majority rule applies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Fifty-one percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
