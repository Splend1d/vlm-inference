I've got four options: Picket Fences, M*A*S*H, Northern Exposure, and The Paper Chase.\n\nFirst, Picket Fences. I remember that was a drama set in a small town dealing with supernatural and mysterious events. I think it was set in the U.S., maybe in Wisconsin or somewhere like that.\n\nNext, M*A*S*H. That's the one about the medical corps during the Korean War. So, Korea is not the United States, but I have to confirm if the series was actually set there or if there were any US-based episodes.\n\nThen, Northern Exposure. I think that was set in a small town in Alaska, which is part of the U.S., so it should count as being set in the U.S.\n\nLastly, The Paper Chase. I'm a bit fuzzy on this one. I think it's about law students at Harvard, which is in Massachusetts, so definitely the U.S.\n\nWait a minute, M*A*S*H was set in Korea during the Korean War, which is definitely not in the United States. But I need to make sure because sometimes series have prequels or spin-offs set in different locations.\n\nLet me double-check each one:\n\n- Picket Fences: Set in the fictional town of Rome, Wisconsin, USA.\n\n- M*A*S*H: Set in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War. So, not in the USA.\n\n- Northern Exposure: Set in Cicely, Alaska, USA.\n\n- The Paper Chase: Set at Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.\n\nSo, based on this, M*A*S*H is the one not set in the United States.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should confirm if there were any US-based episodes in M*A*S*H. I recall that towards the end of the series, some characters returned to the US, but the main setting was in Korea.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be M*A*S*H.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
