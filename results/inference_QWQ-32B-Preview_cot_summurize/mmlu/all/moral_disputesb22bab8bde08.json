                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about utilitarianism, and I'm a bit stuck. The question is: \"One common objection to utilitarianism is that the principle of utility is...\" and then it gives options A through D. I need to choose the most appropriate one.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what utilitarianism is. Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes utility, usually defined as happiness or pleasure, for the greatest number of people. So, the principle of utility is about choosing actions that lead to the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nNow, thinking about common objections to this theory, I recall that some people criticize it for being too demanding. Option B says \"too demanding,\" which seems plausible. Maybe the principle requires too much from individuals, expecting them to always consider the greater good and possibly neglect their own interests or the interests of specific individuals.\n\nOption A says \"too complicated.\" Hmm, utilitarianism is sometimes criticized for being too simplistic, not too complicated. It seems to reduce morality to a calculation of pleasure and pain, which might be seen as oversimplifying complex ethical issues. So, \"too complicated\" doesn't sound right.\n\nOption C says \"too easy to satisfy.\" Well, if utilitarianism is about maximizing happiness, one might argue that it's too permissive because almost any action could be justified if it brings some form of happiness, even if it's superficial or short-term. But I'm not sure if \"too easy to satisfy\" captures that criticism accurately.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" but I don't want to jump to that unless I'm sure the other options are incorrect.\n\nLet me consider the demandingness objection more carefully. One issue with utilitarianism is that it might require too much sacrifice from individuals. For example, it might demand that I donate all my surplus wealth to help others in need, or that I always choose career paths that allow me to do the most good, even if that means giving up personal ambitions. This could be seen as overly demanding because it doesn't allow for personal projects or relationships that don't directly contribute to the greater good.\n\nMoreover, calculating the utility of every action can be practically impossible. We can't always know all the consequences of our actions, and trying to do so might be overly burdensome. So, in that sense, the principle is too demanding in terms of both action and cognition.\n\nComparing this to the other options, \"too complicated\" doesn't seem to fit because utilitarianism is often praised for its simplicity. \"Too easy to satisfy\" might refer to the idea that utilitarianism can justify harmful actions if they lead to a net increase in happiness, but that's more about the permissiveness of the theory rather than how easy it is to satisfy the principle.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: \"too demanding.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
