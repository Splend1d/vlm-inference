                    "text": "So I have this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully.\n\n\"A car moving with speed v reaches the foot of an incline of angle \u03b8. The car coasts up the incline without using the engine. Neglecting friction and air resistance, which of the following is correct about the magnitude of the car\u2019s horizontal acceleration ax and vertical acceleration ay?\n\nA. ax = 0; ay < g\nB. ax = 0; ay = g\nC. ax < g; ay < g\nD. ax < g; ay = g\"\n\nAlright, so the car is moving horizontally with speed v and then it starts going up an incline. It's coasting, meaning no engine power, and we're to neglect friction and air resistance. So, only gravity is acting on it.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the forces acting on the car. Since we're neglecting friction and air resistance, the only force acting is gravity, which is mg downward, where m is the mass of the car and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nNow, the incline is at an angle \u03b8. So, I should probably resolve the gravitational force into components parallel and perpendicular to the incline. But the question is asking for horizontal and vertical accelerations, not components parallel or perpendicular to the incline.\n\nWait, maybe I can work in the coordinate system where x is horizontal and y is vertical.\n\nSo, in that case, the gravitational force is mg downward, which affects the vertical motion.\n\nBut the car is moving up the incline, so its path is at an angle \u03b8 to the horizontal.\n\nI think I need to find expressions for ax and ay, the horizontal and vertical accelerations, respectively.\n\nLet me draw a free-body diagram.\n\n- The car is on an incline of angle \u03b8.\n\n- Only force acting is gravity, mg downward.\n\n- The acceleration due to gravity is g downward.\n\nNow, since the car is moving up the incline, its velocity has components both horizontal and vertical.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- v_x: horizontal component of velocity\n\n- v_y: vertical component of velocity\n\nSimilarly, accelerations:\n\n- a_x: horizontal acceleration\n\n- a_y: vertical acceleration\n\nSince there's no force acting horizontally (neglecting air resistance), the horizontal acceleration should be zero, right? Because there's no horizontal force.\n\nWait, but the car is moving up the incline, so its velocity has both horizontal and vertical components.\n\nActually, the incline is at an angle \u03b8, so the velocity vector is at angle \u03b8 to the horizontal.\n\nBut gravity is acting downward, so it should have components affecting both the horizontal and vertical accelerations.\n\nWait, no. Gravity is only acting downward, so it should only affect the vertical acceleration.\n\nBut, if there's no horizontal force, then according to Newton's second law, a_x = 0.\n\nSo, ax = 0.\n\nNow, for ay, since gravity is the only force acting vertically, ay should be equal to g, the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nBut wait, the options have ay < g and ay = g.\n\nSo, option B says ax = 0 and ay = g.\n\nBut let me think again.\n\nIs ay really equal to g?\n\nWell, the car is moving up the incline, so its vertical acceleration should be affected by gravity, which is pulling it downward.\n\nIn the vertical direction, the only acceleration is due to gravity, so ay = -g if upward is positive.\n\nBut the question asks for magnitudes, so ay = g.\n\nWait, but the car is moving up, so initially v_y is upward, but gravity is decelerating it at rate g.\n\nSo, the magnitude of ay is g.\n\nTherefore, ax = 0 and ay = g.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let me check option A: ax = 0; ay < g.\n\nThat would be incorrect because ay should be equal to g.\n\nOption C: ax < g; ay < g.\n\nBut ax = 0, which is less than g, and ay = g, which is not less than g.\n\nSo, this is partially correct but not entirely.\n\nOption D: ax < g; ay = g.\n\nWell, ax = 0, which is less than g, and ay = g.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nWait, but option B also has ax = 0 and ay = g.\n\nSo, both B and D say ax = 0 and ay = g.\n\nBut in option D, ax < g is true since 0 < g.\n\nSo, both B and D seem correct, but B says ax = 0 and ay = g, while D says ax < g and ay = g.\n\nBut ax = 0 is included in ax < g, since 0 is less than g.\n\nSo, technically, both are correct, but maybe the question expects the most precise answer, which is B, because it specifies ax = 0, whereas D is more general.\n\nBut perhaps the question is about magnitudes, so ax = 0 is fine.\n\nWait, looking back at the question:\n\n\"which of the following is correct about the magnitude of the car\u2019s horizontal acceleration ax and vertical acceleration ay?\"\n\nSo, it's asking about magnitudes.\n\nax is 0, which is its magnitude.\n\nay is g, which is the magnitude of the vertical acceleration.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut option D is also correct because 0 < g and ay = g.\n\nBut perhaps the question is designed to distinguish between ax = 0 and ax < g, but since ax = 0 is less than g, both are true.\n\nMaybe the answer is D, emphasizing that ax is less than g and ay equals g.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical acceleration is not simply g, considering the angle of the incline.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the components of acceleration in the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system where x is horizontal and y is vertical.\n\nThe incline is at angle \u03b8.\n\nThe gravitational force is mg downward.\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is g downward.\n\nSince there's no friction, the only force acting is gravity.\n\nTherefore, the horizontal component of the gravitational force is zero because gravity acts downward, which is along the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, the horizontal acceleration ax is zero.\n\nThe vertical acceleration ay is g downward.\n\nSo, magnitudes: ax = 0 and ay = g.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there is an component of acceleration along the incline, but in terms of horizontal and vertical components, ax = 0 and ay = g.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the motion up the incline.\n\nLet me consider the motion up the incline.\n\nThe car is moving up the incline with initial speed v.\n\nThe acceleration along the incline is -g sin \u03b8, because gravity is acting downward, opposite to the direction of motion up the incline.\n\nSo, the acceleration along the incline is -g sin \u03b8.\n\nNow, to find the horizontal and vertical components of this acceleration.\n\nThe acceleration along the incline is at angle \u03b8 to the horizontal.\n\nTherefore:\n\na_incline = -g sin \u03b8, directed up the incline.\n\nNow, resolving this into horizontal and vertical components.\n\nax = a_incline * cos \u03b8 = (-g sin \u03b8) cos \u03b8\n\nay = a_incline * sin \u03b8 = (-g sin \u03b8) sin \u03b8\n\nWait, but this seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the acceleration along the incline is -g sin \u03b8, and then find its horizontal and vertical components.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, a_incline = -g sin \u03b8, directed up the incline.\n\nThen:\n\nax = a_incline * cos \u03b8 = (-g sin \u03b8) cos \u03b8\n\nay = a_incline * sin \u03b8 = (-g sin \u03b8) sin \u03b8\n\nBut this gives ax and ay in terms of \u03b8, which may not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that there is no horizontal force, so ax must be zero.\n\nWait, but if a_incline is acting along the incline, which has a horizontal component, then ax is not zero.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf the only force is gravity, which is mg downward, then the acceleration is g downward.\n\nBut in terms of horizontal and vertical components:\n\nax = 0 (since no horizontal force)\n\nay = g (downward, so positive if downward is positive, or negative if upward is positive)\n\nBut earlier, I thought about the acceleration along the incline being -g sin \u03b8, which is correct.\n\nBut now, relating that to horizontal and vertical accelerations.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider both the acceleration due to gravity and the motion up the incline.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me consider the car's velocity up the incline.\n\nThe car has an initial horizontal velocity v, but as it goes up the incline, its velocity vector changes direction.\n\nWait, no, the car is moving up the incline, so its velocity is along the incline.\n\nWait, no, the car is moving horizontally with speed v and then starts going up the incline.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the car reaches the foot of an incline of angle \u03b8. The car coasts up the incline without using the engine.\"\n\nSo, it's probably that the car is already moving up the incline with some initial speed, and gravity is slowing it down.\n\nSo, the acceleration along the incline is -g sin \u03b8.\n\nBut I need to find the horizontal and vertical components of this acceleration.\n\nSo, a_incline = -g sin \u03b8, directed up the incline.\n\nNow, to find ax and ay.\n\nLet's define:\n\nax = a_incline * cos \u03b8\n\nay = a_incline * sin \u03b8\n\nSince a_incline = -g sin \u03b8,\n\nThen:\n\nax = (-g sin \u03b8) cos \u03b8\n\nay = (-g sin \u03b8) sin \u03b8 = -g sin\u00b2 \u03b8\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the net force is mg sin \u03b8 up the incline, but actually, it's -mg sin \u03b8 because gravity is down the incline.\n\nWait, hold on.\n\nThe component of gravity parallel to the incline is -mg sin \u03b8, directed down the incline, opposing the motion.\n\nTherefore, a_incline = -g sin \u03b8.\n\nThen, horizontal and vertical components:\n\nax = a_incline * cos \u03b8 = (-g sin \u03b8) cos \u03b8\n\nay = a_incline * sin \u03b8 = (-g sin \u03b8) sin \u03b8 = -g sin\u00b2 \u03b8\n\nBut ax is negative if cos \u03b8 is positive, which it is for \u03b8 between 0 and 90 degrees.\n\nWait, but in terms of magnitudes, ax would be |(-g sin \u03b8) cos \u03b8| = g sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\nSimilarly, ay = -g sin\u00b2 \u03b8, so magnitude is g sin\u00b2 \u03b8\n\nNow, comparing to g, we have:\n\nax = g sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\nay = g sin\u00b2 \u03b8\n\nNow, sin \u03b8 and cos \u03b8 are both less than 1 for \u03b8 between 0 and 90 degrees, except when \u03b8 = 45 degrees, sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 = (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 1/2\n\nBut in general, ax = g sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 < g\n\nSimilarly, ay = g sin\u00b2 \u03b8 < g, since sin\u00b2 \u03b8 < 1 for \u03b8 \u2260 90 degrees.\n\nBut wait, if \u03b8 = 90 degrees, the incline is vertical, which might be a special case.\n\nBut in the problem, \u03b8 is the angle of the incline, probably assumed to be less than 90 degrees.\n\nSo, ax = g sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 < g\n\nay = g sin\u00b2 \u03b8 < g\n\nBut wait, option A says ax = 0; ay < g\n\nOption B says ax = 0; ay = g\n\nOption C says ax < g; ay < g\n\nOption D says ax < g; ay = g\n\nNow, from above, ax = g sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8, which is not zero unless \u03b8 = 0 or 90 degrees.\n\nBut in general, for \u03b8 between 0 and 90 degrees, ax is not zero.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that ax should be zero because there's no horizontal force.\n\nBut according to this, ax = g sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8, which is not zero.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nI think I have a contradiction here.\n\nLet me check my earlier assumption.\n\nI thought that since there's no horizontal force, ax should be zero.\n\nBut according to the component analysis, ax = g sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8, which is not zero.\n\nSo, which one is right?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the components.\n\nLet me consider the acceleration due to gravity in the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nGravity acts downward, so:\n\na_x, gravity = 0\n\na_y, gravity = -g\n\nBut the car is moving up the incline, so its acceleration along the incline is -g sin \u03b8.\n\nBut this acceleration along the incline has both horizontal and vertical components.\n\nSo, the total horizontal acceleration is a_x = a_incline * cos \u03b8 = (-g sin \u03b8) cos \u03b8\n\nSimilarly, a_y = a_incline * sin \u03b8 = (-g sin \u03b8) sin \u03b8 = -g sin\u00b2 \u03b8\n\nBut there is also the vertical component of gravity, which is -g.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider both the acceleration along the incline and the gravitational acceleration.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet me consider the car's motion in the horizontal and vertical directions separately.\n\nIn the horizontal direction:\n\n- There is no force acting (neglecting air resistance), so ax = 0.\n\nIn the vertical direction:\n\n- The only force is gravity, so ay = -g.\n\nTherefore, magnitudes are:\n\nax = 0\n\nay = g\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered the acceleration along the incline, I got different expressions.\n\nPerhaps the horizontal acceleration is indeed zero because there's no horizontal force, and the vertical acceleration is g due to gravity.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B: ax = 0; ay = g\n\nMaybe the component analysis along the incline is not directly relevant to the horizontal and vertical accelerations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the acceleration along the incline affects both horizontal and vertical motions.\n\nBut if there's no horizontal force, ax must be zero.\n\nSimilarly, the vertical acceleration is solely due to gravity, so ay = g.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.\n\nBut let's see what option D says: ax < g; ay = g\n\nSince ax = 0, which is less than g, this is also true.\n\nSo, both B and D are correct in some sense.\n\nBut B specifies ax = 0, which is more precise, while D is more general.\n\nPerhaps the question allows for D as well, but B is more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical acceleration is not simply g, considering the motion up the incline.\n\nBut I think that ay is indeed g, as it's the acceleration due to gravity in the vertical direction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: ax = 0; ay = g\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
