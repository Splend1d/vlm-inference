                    "text": "So I've got this question here about business revenue and price elasticity. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. The business wants to increase its revenue, and it knows that the demand price elasticity of its product is 0.78. So, elasticity is 0.78. Now, I need to decide whether the business should decrease or increase its price based on this information.\n\nFirst things first, I need to remember what price elasticity of demand means. Elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. The formula is usually percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in price. So, if elasticity is 0.78, that means if the price changes by 1%, the quantity demanded changes by 0.78%.\n\nNow, I recall that there are different categories based on the elasticity value:\n\n- If elasticity is greater than 1, demand is elastic. That means quantity changes more than proportionally to price.\n\n- If elasticity is less than 1, demand is inelastic. Quantity changes less than proportionally to price.\n\n- If elasticity equals 1, demand is unit elastic. Quantity changes exactly proportionally to price.\n\nIn this case, elasticity is 0.78, which is less than 1, so demand is inelastic.\n\nOkay, so demand is inelastic. Now, the business wants to increase its revenue. Revenue is price multiplied by quantity sold (R = P x Q). So, if I change the price, quantity changes by a proportion given by the elasticity.\n\nLet's think about what happens if the business increases the price. If price increases, and demand is inelastic, quantity demanded decreases by a smaller percentage than the price increase. So, the increase in price might outweigh the decrease in quantity, leading to higher revenue.\n\nConversely, if the business decreases the price, quantity demanded increases by a smaller percentage than the price decrease. So, the decrease in price might outweigh the increase in quantity, leading to lower revenue.\n\nWait a minute, that seems to suggest that if demand is inelastic, increasing price leads to higher revenue, and decreasing price leads to lower revenue.\n\nBut looking back at the question, it says: \"if a business wants to increase its revenue and it knows that the demand price elasticity of its product is equal to 0.78, it should...\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. decrease price because demand is elastic\n\nB. decrease price because demand is unit elastic\n\nC. decrease price because demand is inelastic\n\nD. increase price because demand is inelastic\n\nHmm, so according to my earlier reasoning, since demand is inelastic (elasticity 0.78 < 1), the business should increase its price to increase revenue. So, option D seems to make sense.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the revenue equation again: R = P x Q.\n\nIf price increases by, say, 1%, and quantity decreases by 0.78% (since elasticity is 0.78), then the new revenue would be:\n\nR' = P * (1 + 0.01) * Q * (1 - 0.0078)\n\n= P * 1.01 * Q * 0.9922\n\n= P * Q * 1.01 * 0.9922\n\n= R * 1.01 * 0.9922\n\n= R * (1.01 * 0.9922) \u2248 R * 1.0021\n\nSo, revenue increases by approximately 0.21%.\n\nSimilarly, if the business decreases the price by 1%, quantity increases by 0.78%, leading to:\n\nR' = P * 0.99 * Q * 1.0078 \u2248 R * 0.99 * 1.0078 \u2248 R * 0.9978\n\nSo, revenue decreases by approximately 0.22%.\n\nThis confirms that increasing price leads to higher revenue when demand is inelastic.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. decrease price because demand is elastic\n\nBut demand is inelastic (elasticity 0.78 < 1), not elastic, so this doesn't make sense.\n\nB. decrease price because demand is unit elastic\n\nBut demand is not unit elastic; it's inelastic.\n\nC. decrease price because demand is inelastic\n\nBut as per my calculation, decreasing price when demand is inelastic leads to lower revenue.\n\nD. increase price because demand is inelastic\n\nThis aligns with my reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's any caveat or exception to this rule.\n\nI recall that for inelastic demand, increasing price increases revenue, and decreasing price decreases revenue. That's a standard principle in microeconomics.\n\nHowever, maybe there are some scenarios where this doesn't hold, like if the business is operating in a market with peculiar characteristics, but the question doesn't provide any additional information, so I'll stick with the general principle.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not confusing elasticity with other concepts, like total revenue test or marginal revenue, but in this context, it's straightforward: revenue is price times quantity, and elasticity measures the responsiveness of quantity to price changes.\n\nSo, in conclusion, since demand is inelastic (elasticity 0.78 < 1), the business should increase its price to increase revenue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
