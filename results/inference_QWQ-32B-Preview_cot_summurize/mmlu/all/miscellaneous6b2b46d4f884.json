Meriwether and William\n\nC. Cabot and Joseph\n\nD. Meredith and George\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out the first names of these two explorers. I remember that Lewis and Clark were famous for their expedition across the Louisiana Purchase, right? That was in the early 1800s, I think. So, their full names should be something like Firstname Lewis and Firstname Clark.\n\nLet me think about option A: Morgan and Mason. I don't think those are their names. I don't recall ever hearing about Morgan Lewis or Mason Clark in that context.\n\nOption B: Meriwether and William. Wait, I think Meriwether Lewis was one of them. Yes, Meriwether Lewis was the leader of the expedition, and William Clark was his partner. That sounds right.\n\nOption C: Cabot and Joseph. Hmm, John Cabot was an explorer, but he was English and explored the east coast of North America much earlier, in the 15th century. So, that doesn't fit here.\n\nOption D: Meredith and George. I don't think that's correct either. I don't recall any explorers with those names associated with the Lewis and Clark expedition.\n\nSo, based on what I remember, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were the names of the explorers who led the Corps of Discovery Expedition from 1804 to 1806. Their mission was to explore the newly purchased Louisiana Territory and to find a water route to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nI think option B is the correct answer. But to be sure, maybe I should double-check. Let me quickly look it up.\n\n[Simulates looking up information]\n\nYes, confirmed. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were the leaders of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. So, the first names are Meriwether and William.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. Meriwether and William.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
