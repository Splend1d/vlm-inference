                    "text": "I think the answer is A. John Stuart Mill. He was a big supporter of utilitarianism, which is about doing what makes the most people happy or has the best overall outcome. Thomas Hobbes was more into social contract theory, Karl Marx was known for his ideas on communism and class struggle, and Adam Smith is often called the father of economics. So, John Stuart Mill seems to be the one most associated with utilitarianism.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should look it up or think about it some more. Utilitarianism is all about maximizing happiness or utility, right? And John Stuart Mill wrote a book called \"Utilitarianism\" where he explains and defends this idea. He also distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures, saying that some kinds of happiness are better than others.\n\nThomas Hobbes, on the other hand, is famous for his book \"Leviathan,\" where he talks about the social contract and the idea that people give up some freedoms to a central authority in exchange for order and protection. That's not really utilitarianism.\n\nKarl Marx is known for his critique of capitalism and his vision of a classless society. His ideas are more about economics and sociology, not specifically about utilitarianism.\n\nAdam Smith is considered the father of modern economics, and his book \"The Wealth of Nations\" discusses how free markets can lead to economic prosperity. Again, not directly related to utilitarianism.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that John Stuart Mill is the correct answer here. He's the one who really championed utilitarianism as a philosophical approach to ethics and decision-making.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
