                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about costs. It's asking for the term that represents unavoidable past costs that can't be changed no matter what action is taken. The options are prime costs, sunk costs, opportunity costs, and incremental costs. I think I've heard of some of these before, but I'm a bit confused about what each one means.\n\nLet me start by trying to recall what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, prime costs. I think prime costs are the direct costs associated with producing a product. That would include things like the cost of raw materials and the direct labor used in making the product. So, it seems like prime costs are more about the current or future costs involved in production, not past costs.\n\nNext, sunk costs. I remember that sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered. No matter what decision you make going forward, you can't get that money back. So, this sounds a lot like what the question is describing\u2014unavoidable past costs that can't be changed.\n\nThen there are opportunity costs. These are the costs associated with the next best alternative that you give up when you make a particular choice. For example, if you choose to spend your time and money on going to a movie, the opportunity cost would be what you could have done instead, like reading a book or saving the money. So, opportunity costs are more about the value of what you\u653e\u5f03 when you make a decision, not about past costs that can't be changed.\n\nFinally, incremental costs. I think incremental costs are the additional costs incurred as a result of a particular decision or action. For example, if you decide to produce one more unit of a product, the cost of the materials and labor for that extra unit would be the incremental cost. So, again, this seems more related to future costs rather than past costs that can't be changed.\n\nComparing all these, it seems like sunk costs are the ones that match the description in the question\u2014unavoidable past costs that can't be changed no matter what action is taken.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check the definitions.\n\nPrime costs: Direct costs like materials and labor involved in production.\n\nSunk costs: Costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered.\n\nOpportunity costs: The value of the next best alternative forgone.\n\nIncremental costs: Additional costs resulting from a specific decision.\n\nYes, sunk costs definitely fit the description given in the question.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Sunk costs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
