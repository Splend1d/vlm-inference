The resident hated the idea of the lawyer's office being close to her home. She felt that it meant dangerous criminals were coming and going in her neighborhood. The resident spent a lot of time looking out her window, trying to figure out which people going in and out of the office building were criminals, and imagining what sorts of crimes they had committed. The resident eventually decided that she needed to drive the lawyer out of the neighborhood. She made a telephone call to the lawyer and said, \"You are scum, and so are all of your clients. I know that you're conspiring to commit crimes with all those bad people you represent. The police should arrest you and put you in jail with your clients. \" The lawyer was very upset by what he heard.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what would happen if the lawyer tries to sue the resident for defamation based on that phone call. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst off, defamation is when someone makes a false statement that harms another person's reputation. There are two types: libel, which is written, and slander, which is spoken. In this case, it's a phone call, so it's slander.\n\nNow, for defamation to stick, a few things need to be true:\n\n1. The statement has to be false.\n\n2. It has to be communicated to someone else besides the person it's about.\n\n3. It has to be something that harms the person's reputation.\n\n4. And, depending on who the person is, they might need to prove that the speaker was negligent or acted with actual malice.\n\nIn this scenario, the resident calls the lawyer and says some pretty harsh things: calling the lawyer and their clients \"scum,\" suggesting they're conspiring to commit crimes, and saying the police should arrest them and put them in jail.\n\nOption A says the lawyer will succeed because the resident's remarks constitute slander per se. Slander per se is a category of slander where certain types of statements are considered so damaging that you don't need to prove actual harm. These usually include statements about someone's professional competence, serious criminal conduct, having a loathsome disease, or misconduct in sexual matters.\n\nHere, the resident is accusing the lawyer of conspiring to commit crimes and suggests they should be arrested and put in jail. That sounds like accusing them of serious criminal conduct, which could be slander per se in many jurisdictions.\n\nOption B says the lawyer will succeed because the lawyer found the remarks upsetting. But defamation isn't just about being upset; it's about reputation damage. So, while the lawyer was upset, that alone doesn't make it defamation.\n\nOption C says the lawyer won't succeed because the remarks were a matter of personal opinion rather than statements of fact. Well, opinions can be defamatory if they imply the existence of facts that are false and damaging. Here, saying the lawyer is \"scum\" and conspiring with criminals implies that the lawyer is involved in criminal activities, which could be considered statements of fact that are false and damaging.\n\nOption D says the lawyer won't succeed because the remarks weren't published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff. But in defamation, \"publication\" just means that the statement was communicated to at least one person other than the person it's about. In this case, the resident is calling the lawyer, so it's being communicated to the lawyer, but probably also to any staff or anyone else who might be in the office. So, it might qualify as publication.\n\nWait, but if it's just a private call between the resident and the lawyer, maybe no one else heard it. But in defamation, even if it's just the two of them, if the statement is communicated to the plaintiff, that might still count, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nBut in many places, defamation requires communication to a third party. So, if it's just the resident and the lawyer on the call, maybe there's no publication to a third party.\n\nHowever, sometimes, if there are other people present or listening in, that could count as publication.\n\nBut in this scenario, it seems like it's a private call between the two of them. It doesn't mention any others being present.\n\nSo, if publication requires communication to at least one third party, and in this case, there wasn't any, then maybe the lawyer couldn't succeed on a defamation claim.\n\nBut option A suggests that it's slander per se, which might still apply.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about both.\n\nSlander per se is a type of slander where the statements are so harmful that they're presumed to cause damage, but still, there needs to be publication to a third party.\n\nSo, in this case, if the phone call was only between the resident and the lawyer, maybe there's no defamation because there was no publication to a third party.\n\nBut perhaps if there were others in the office who overheard the call, that could count as publication.\n\nThe scenario doesn't specify, so maybe we have to assume it's just the two of them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lawyer could argue that the statement was made to him, but that he then told others about it, thus publishing it further.\n\nBut typically, in defamation, the plaintiff can't be the one to spread the statement.\n\nWait, but in some jurisdictions, if the defendant makes a defamatory statement to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff then repeats it to others, the defendant can still be liable.\n\nIt gets a bit complicated.\n\nBut perhaps the safer assumption is that, in this scenario, since it's just a private phone call between the two, there was no publication to a third party, which would be required for a defamation claim.\n\nTherefore, option D might be correct: the lawyer won't succeed because the resident's remarks weren't published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff.\n\nHowever, I feel like there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider slander per se again.\n\nSlander per se usually includes accusations of criminal behavior, which is the case here.\n\nBut even so, there still needs to be publication to a third party.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lawyer could bring a claim for slander, but would need to show actual damages, which might be difficult.\n\nWait, but slander per se presumes damages, so maybe not.\n\nBut again, the publication requirement seems key here.\n\nGiven that, I think the lawyer would not succeed because there was no communication to a third party.\n\nSo, option D seems most likely correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
