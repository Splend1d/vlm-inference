So the correct answer is A. 1%.\n\nTo provide some context, the agricultural sector in the United States has been becoming increasingly efficient over the years, meaning that it can produce more output with the same or fewer inputs. This has led to a decline in the sector's share of the overall economy. Despite this, agriculture remains a vital part of the US economy, providing food and fibers for both domestic consumption and export.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while the direct contribution of agriculture to GDP is relatively small, its indirect effects can be much larger when considering related industries such as food processing, equipment manufacturing, and retail. These sectors rely on agricultural production and contribute significantly to the economy.\n\nMoreover, agriculture plays a crucial role in employment, particularly in certain regions of the country. While the number of people directly employed in agriculture has decreased over time due to technological advancements and increased productivity, the sector still provides jobs for millions of Americans.\n\nIn summary, although agriculture accounts for only about 1% of US GDP as of 2015, its importance extends beyond this figure due to its connections with other industries and its significance in providing essential goods and supporting rural economies."
