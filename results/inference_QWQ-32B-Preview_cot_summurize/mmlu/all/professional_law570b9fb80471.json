Lot 1 consisted of a single- family house with a yard, garage, and driveway. On May 1, 1999, the boss moved into the house on lot 1. One year later, the co-worker and the boss executed and delivered the following deed instrument to a neighbor \". . . hereby grant to (the neighbor) the northerly 30 feet of lot 1, consisting of the paved driveway now existing, to be used for the ingress and egress of motor vehicles, but should (the neighbor) or his heirs and assigns use said property for any other purpose, all the rights, privileges, and immunities herein granted shall cease and determine. \" In consideration for the said deed, the neighbor paid the co-worker and the boss $2,000 (which they divided equally). The deed was never recorded by the neighbor. Because the boss didn't own a car, she never used the driveway. Similarly, the neighbor never used the driveway because he unexpectedly had his driver's license suspended shortly after executing the above instrument. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. Following her mother's death, the daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. On June 1, 2001 the neighbor sold lot 2 to a professor by a deed that contained no mention of the driveway located on lot 1. The neighbor and the professor assumed that the latter had the right to use the driveway, so they didn't insert any recitations in their deed instrument regarding the driveway. Immediately upon her taking possession of the premises, the daughter began to use the driveway on lot 1. Consequently, she objected to the professor's use of the driveway. After the daughter refused to permit the professor to use the driveway, he brought suit to determine his right to continue use of the driveway. The professor should\n\nA. win, because he acquired an implied easement to use the driveway as owner of the dominant tenement.\nB. win, because the neighbor's easement to use the driveway was conveyed to the professor.\nC. lose, because the Statute of Frauds was not satisfied.\nD. lose, because the neighbor's non-use of the driveway effectuated an abandonment of the easement.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this complex property law scenario. There are a lot of players here: the original landowner, his co-worker and boss who inherited Lot 1, their neighbor who was granted a right to use the driveway, and then a professor who bought Lot 2 from the neighbor. The crux of the issue is whether the professor has the right to use the driveway on Lot 1 after buying Lot 2.\n\nFirst, let's untangle the chain of title and the transactions that took place.\n\n1. **Original Landowner's Death and Devise:**\n\n   - Date: March 1, 1999\n\n   - Lot 1 is devised to both the co-worker and the boss as their community property.\n\n   - Co-worker and boss are siblings, neither married.\n\n2. **Boss Moves In:**\n\n   - Date: May 1, 1999\n\n   - The boss moves into the house on Lot 1.\n\n3. **Deed to Neighbor:**\n\n   - Date: May 1, 2000 (one year later)\n\n   - Co-worker and boss execute and deliver a deed to the neighbor granting the northerly 30 feet of Lot 1 (the driveway) for ingress and egress of motor vehicles.\n\n   - Consideration: $2,000, divided equally.\n\n   - Deed was never recorded.\n\n4. **Boss's Death:**\n\n   - Date: May 1, 2001\n\n   - Boss dies intestate, leaving her daughter as sole heir.\n\n   - Daughter moves into the house on May 2, 2001.\n\n5. **Professor's Purchase of Lot 2:**\n\n   - Date: June 1, 2001\n\n   - Neighbor sells Lot 2 to the professor with no mention of the driveway in the deed.\n\nNow, the daughter starts using the driveway and objects to the professor's use of it. The professor sues to determine his right to continue using the driveway.\n\nWe need to decide which of the options is correct:\n\nA. Professor wins because he acquired an implied easement as the owner of the dominant tenement.\n\nB. Professor wins because the neighbor's easement to use the driveway was conveyed to him.\n\nC. Professor loses because the Statute of Frauds was not satisfied.\n\nD. Professor loses because the neighbor's non-use of the driveway effectuated an abandonment of the easement.\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step.\n\n**Option A: Implied Easement**\n\nAn implied easement typically arises by necessity or prior use when there's a division of a unified estate. However, in this case, Lot 1 and Lot 2 were likely separate parcels already, and there's no indication that the driveway was necessary for the use and enjoyment of Lot 2. The neighbor was granted a specific easement in the deed, but that was from the co-worker and boss to the neighbor, not to Lot 2.\n\nMoreover, the professor bought Lot 2 from the neighbor, and there's no mention of the easement in the deed. So, it's unlikely that an implied easement was created in favor of the professor.\n\n**Option B: Conveyance of Easement**\n\nThis option suggests that the neighbor's easement was conveyed to the professor when the neighbor sold Lot 2 to him. But there are a few issues here.\n\nFirst, the easement was granted to the neighbor personally, not to Lot 2. The deed specifies that it's granted to the neighbor \"and his heirs and assigns,\" which could imply that it's assignable. However, easements are generally appurtenant (benefiting land) or in gross (benefiting a person or entity).\n\nIn this case, the easement seems to be in gross because it's granted to the neighbor personally for the use of ingress and egress, not specifically tied to another piece of land. If it's an easement in gross, it may not pass automatically to the professor upon the sale of Lot 2 unless specifically assigned.\n\nAdditionally, the deed from the neighbor to the professor doesn't mention the easement. Therefore, it's unclear whether the easement was conveyed to the professor.\n\n**Option C: Statute of Frauds**\n\nThe Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts, including interests in real property, to be in writing to be enforceable. The easement was granted via a deed, which is in writing, so the Statute of Frauds should be satisfied.\n\nHowever, the professor is not a party to that deed. So, if the easement was not assigned to him in writing, there might be an argument that the Statute of Frauds bars enforcement against the daughter, who is now the owner of Lot 1.\n\n**Option D: Abandonment**\n\nFor an easement to be abandoned, there must be an intent to abandon and an act consistent with that intent. The neighbor's driver's license was suspended, so he couldn't use the driveway, but that doesn't necessarily constitute an intent to abandon the easement.\n\nMoreover, the daughter started using the driveway after her mother's death, but that doesn't affect the neighbor's easement rights unless there's some action to terminate or abandon the easement.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's think about the professor's position.\n\nWhen the neighbor sold Lot 2 to the professor, did the easement appurtenant to Lot 2 pass to the professor? Well, if the easement was appurtenant to Lot 2, meaning it benefited Lot 2, then it would pass to the new owner, the professor, unless specifically excluded.\n\nHowever, in this case, the easement was granted to the neighbor personally, not to Lot 2. The deed says \"to (the neighbor) ... for ingress and egress of motor vehicles,\" but it doesn't specify that it runs with Lot 2.\n\nFurthermore, the deed from the neighbor to the professor doesn't mention the easement. So, it's possible that the easement wasn't conveyed to the professor.\n\nAlternatively, if the easement was intended to benefit Lot 2 and was appurtenant to it, then it would pass to the professor as the new owner of Lot 2, even if not mentioned in the deed.\n\nBut based on the language of the deed from the co-worker and boss to the neighbor, it seems to grant the easement to the neighbor personally, not to Lot 2.\n\nTherefore, option B might not hold water because the easement wasn't necessarily conveyed to the professor.\n\nOption C could be a possibility if the assignment of the easement to the professor wasn't in writing, violating the Statute of Frauds.\n\nOption D is less likely because there's no clear abandonment by the neighbor.\n\nOption A is also less likely because there's no implied easement created in favor of the professor.\n\nGiven these analyses, it seems that option C is the most plausible: the professor should lose because the Statute of Frauds was not satisfied regarding the conveyance of the easement to him.\n\nHowever, let's consider another angle.\n\nPerhaps the easement was appurtenant to Lot 2, benefiting it, and thus passed to the professor upon the sale of Lot 2, even without a specific mention in the deed.\n\nIf that's the case, then the professor would have the right to use the driveway.\n\nBut based on the deed language, which grants the easement to the neighbor personally, it seems more like an easement in gross, benefiting the neighbor individually, not Lot 2.\n\nEasements in gross are generally not transferable unless the grant expressly provides for assignment.\n\nIn this deed, it says \"to (the neighbor) ... and his heirs and assigns,\" which suggests that it is assignable.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that the neighbor could assign the easement to the professor when selling Lot 2.\n\nHowever, since the deed from the neighbor to the professor doesn't mention the easement, it's unclear whether the assignment occurred.\n\nIf the assignment didn't occur in writing, then the Statute of Frauds might bar enforcement of the easement by the professor.\n\nTherefore, option C seems compelling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the professor acquired an easement by implication when he bought Lot 2, assuming that the driveway was necessary for the use and enjoyment of Lot 2.\n\nBut there's no indication that Lot 2 is landlocked or that the driveway is necessary for access to Lot 2.\n\nMoreover, the daughter started using the driveway after her mother's death, suggesting that the co-worker and boss had rights to use the driveway as well, despite the easement granted to the neighbor.\n\nThis complicates things further.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need to consider multiple legal principles, including the nature of easements, the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, and the rules regarding assignment and conveyance of easements, I think the most accurate answer is C. The professor should lose because the Statute of Frauds was not satisfied in relation to the conveyance of the easement to him.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
