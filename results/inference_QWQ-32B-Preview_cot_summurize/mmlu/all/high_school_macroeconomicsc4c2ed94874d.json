                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about corn prices in a competitive market. We need to figure out which scenario definitely increases the equilibrium price of corn. So, equilibrium price is where supply and demand meet. If something shifts supply or demand, it can change that equilibrium price.\n\nOption A says both supply and demand shift rightward. If both shift to the right, what happens to price? Well, an increase in supply usually lowers price, while an increase in demand usually raises price. So, these two effects are moving in opposite directions. It's unclear which one would prevail, so the price could stay the same, increase, or decrease. So, this doesn't definitely increase the price.\n\nOption B is both supply and demand shift leftward. Decreasing supply typically raises price, and decreasing demand typically lowers price. Again, opposite effects. So, same as A, it's unclear what happens to price.\n\nOption C: supply shifts to the right, demand shifts to the left. Rightward shift in supply lowers price, leftward shift in demand also lowers price. So, both effects are pushing price down. Therefore, this would definitely decrease the equilibrium price, not increase it.\n\nOption D: supply shifts to the left, demand shifts to the right. Leftward shift in supply tends to raise price, and rightward shift in demand also tends to raise price. So, both effects are pushing price up. Therefore, this definitely increases the equilibrium price.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. But let's double-check.\n\nImagine the initial supply and demand curves crossing at some equilibrium price and quantity. If supply shifts left (decreases), the new supply curve is to the left, leading to a higher price and lower quantity, assuming demand stays the same. If, at the same time, demand shifts right (increases), the demand curve moves to the right, which also leads to a higher price and higher quantity, assuming supply stays the same.\n\nSo, both shifts are pushing the price up. As for quantity, one shift wants to decrease it (leftward supply shift) and the other wants to increase it (rightward demand shift), so the effect on quantity is ambiguous, but the price definitely increases.\n\nIn contrast, options A and B have opposing effects on price, making the outcome uncertain, and option C definitely decreases the price.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
