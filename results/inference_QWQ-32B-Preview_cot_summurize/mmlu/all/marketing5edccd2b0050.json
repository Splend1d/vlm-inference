These messages are often promotional in nature or may contain malicious content such as phishing attempts or malware.\n\nTo provide more context:\n\n- **Opt-in email**: This is when users have explicitly agreed to receive emails from a sender. It's a permission-based email marketing practice where subscribers opt to receive communications.\n\n- **Consent marketing**: This approach focuses on getting explicit permission from users before sending them marketing messages. It aligns with data protection regulations like GDPR and emphasizes building relationships based on user consent.\n\n- **Opt-out email**: This refers to emails where recipients are included in a mailing list unless they choose to remove themselves. While opt-out practices were more common in the past, modern email marketing standards increasingly favor opt-in practices to ensure that recipients have actively chosen to receive communications.\n\nGiven these definitions, \"spam\" is the term that specifically refers to unsolicited electronic messages."
