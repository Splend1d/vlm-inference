That means if a prime divides the number, then its square must also divide the number.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 392\n\nFirst, I need to find the prime factors of 392.\n\n392 is even, so 2 is a factor.\n\n392 \u00f7 2 = 196\n\n196 \u00f7 2 = 98\n\n98 \u00f7 2 = 49\n\n49 is 7 squared.\n\nSo, the prime factors are 2 and 7.\n\nNow, check if 2 squared (4) and 7 squared (49) divide 392.\n\n392 \u00f7 4 = 98, which is an integer.\n\n392 \u00f7 49 = 8, which is also an integer.\n\nSo, 392 seems to be a powerful number.\n\nBut let me check the others just to be sure.\n\nOption B: 336\n\nAgain, start with 2.\n\n336 \u00f7 2 = 168\n\n168 \u00f7 2 = 84\n\n84 \u00f7 2 = 42\n\n42 \u00f7 2 = 21\n\n21 is 3 times 7.\n\nSo, prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nCheck if 2 squared (4), 3 squared (9), and 7 squared (49) divide 336.\n\n336 \u00f7 4 = 84, which is an integer.\n\n336 \u00f7 9 = 37.333..., which is not an integer.\n\nSo, 9 does not divide 336, meaning 336 is not a powerful number.\n\nOption C: 300\n\nStart with 2.\n\n300 \u00f7 2 = 150\n\n150 \u00f7 2 = 75\n\n75 \u00f7 3 = 25\n\n25 \u00f7 5 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, prime factors are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nCheck if 4, 9, and 25 divide 300.\n\n300 \u00f7 4 = 75, which is an integer.\n\n300 \u00f7 9 = 33.333..., which is not an integer.\n\nSo, 300 is not a powerful number.\n\nOption D: 297\n\n297 is odd, so start with 3.\n\n297 \u00f7 3 = 99\n\n99 \u00f7 3 = 33\n\n33 \u00f7 3 = 11\n\n11 is a prime.\n\nSo, prime factors are 3 and 11.\n\nCheck if 9 and 121 divide 297.\n\n297 \u00f7 9 = 33, which is an integer.\n\n297 \u00f7 121 = 2.4545..., which is not an integer.\n\nSo, 297 is not a powerful number.\n\nTherefore, the only powerful number among the options is 392.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
