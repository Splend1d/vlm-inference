                    "text": "So I have this genetics problem here. It's asking for the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals. The options are 1/64, 1/32, 1/128, and 1/256. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how Mendelian inheritance works for multiple traits. Each trait is inherited independently according to the law of independent assortment, assuming no linkage between genes. So, for each gene pair, I can consider them separately and then combine the probabilities.\n\nLet's look at one gene at a time.\n\nStarting with gene A:\n\nParents are both Aa. When they mate, the possible gametes are A and a. Each gamete has a 50% chance of getting A or a.\n\nSo, the probability of getting AA in the offspring is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B:\n\nParents are both Bb. Same as above, the probability of getting BB is also 1/4.\n\nAnd for gene C:\n\nParents are both Cc. Again, the probability of getting CC is 1/4.\n\nNow, since these are independent events, the overall probability of getting AABBCC should be the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, (1/4) for A * (1/4) for B * (1/4) for C = 1/64.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing?\n\nLet me double-check. Are there any assumptions I need to consider? The question mentions \"from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals.\" So, each parent is heterozygous for all three genes.\n\nAnd it's asking for the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals, which is AABBCC.\n\nAssuming independent assortment, yes, the probabilities multiply.\n\nSo, 1/4 * 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/64.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1/64 is option A.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the genes are not assorting independently, but the question doesn't mention any linkage or epistasis, so I think independent assortment is a safe assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering something else, like multiple alleles or sex-linked inheritance, but no, it's straightforward Mendelian genetics.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the Punnett square for three genes, but that would be quite large and time-consuming. Instead, multiplying the probabilities is more efficient.\n\nLet me consider if there is any chance that the answer could be different.\n\nSuppose the genes are on the same chromosome and linked, but again, the question doesn't suggest that, so I think independent assortment is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a population frequency rather than a single mating, but it specifies \"from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals,\" so it's about the offspring of these two parents.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 1/64, which is option A.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the expansion of (AaBbCc) x (AaBbCc).\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene to the offspring.\n\nFor gene A: A or a, each with 50% chance.\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nSo, for AABBCC, we need:\n\n- Both parents contribute A for gene A.\n\n- Both parents contribute B for gene B.\n\n- Both parents contribute C for gene C.\n\nEach of these has a probability of (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nAnd since the genes are independent, the combined probability is 1/4 * 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/64.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate the total number of possible genotypes, it would be 2^3 = 8 for each parent, but since we're looking at the combination of both parents' gametes, it would be 8 x 8 = 64 possible combinations, and only one of those is AABBCC.\n\nSo again, 1/64.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 1.0/64.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, it's listed as 1.0/64, 1.0/32, 1.0/128, 1.0/256. The use of \"1.0/\" is a bit unusual; maybe it's meant to represent decimal probabilities, like 1.0/64 = 0.015625, but in fraction terms, it's still 1/64.\n\nI think the answer is indeed A. 1.0/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
