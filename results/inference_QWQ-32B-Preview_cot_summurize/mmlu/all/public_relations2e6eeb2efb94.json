Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"What is right and what is wrong are predetermined.\" Hmm, that sounds more like a deterministic approach or maybe a form of moral absolutism, where right and wrong are set in stone, regardless of the situation. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, is about maximizing happiness or utility, and it's more flexible depending on the circumstances. So, this doesn't seem like utilitarianism.\n\nOption B is, \"People should be treated as an end, not a means to an end.\" That rings a bell; I think that's from Immanuel Kant's deontological ethics. Kant emphasized respecting people's autonomy and not using them merely as tools to achieve your goals. Again, not utilitarianism.\n\nOption C says, \"The greatest good for the greatest number.\" Now, this sounds familiar. Utilitarianism is all about maximizing overall happiness or utility. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the utilitarian idea.\n\nOption D is, \"Those better off should give to people who are not as well off.\" This sounds a bit like a redistributive justice principle or maybe a socialist idea. While utilitarianism might support helping those who are less well off if it increases overall utility, it's not the core principle of utilitarianism. So, maybe not the best fit.\n\nComparing all these options, Option C seems to directly reflect the utilitarian principle of maximizing overall good or happiness. So, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
