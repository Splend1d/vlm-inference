I need to figure out which one makes the most sense in the context of Augustine's thoughts on evil.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Augustine believed about evil. From what I remember, Augustine was a Christian philosopher, and he thought that evil isn't a thing in itself but rather a privation or absence of good. So, according to him, evil doesn't have its own substance; it's more like a lack of goodness.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. hatred.\n\nHatred is certainly a negative emotion and can lead to evil actions, but if Augustine sees evil as the absence of good, then maybe hatred is a manifestation of evil rather than a prerequisite for its existence.\n\nB. greed.\n\nSimilar to hatred, greed is a vice that can cause harm and is generally considered evil. But again, if evil is the absence of good, then greed might be an example of evil rather than a condition necessary for evil to exist.\n\nC. love.\n\nLove is typically considered a positive emotion and is associated with good. So, saying that there can be no evil where there is no love seems counterintuitive. If love is good, then perhaps evil can exist independently of love.\n\nD. good.\n\nThis is interesting. If Augustine says that there can be no evil where there is no good, that aligns with his idea that evil is a privation of good. In other words, evil is only possible in the context of good because it's a departure from what is good.\n\nLet me think about that. If there's no good, then there's nothing to be corrupted or absent, so evil couldn't exist. It's like saying that darkness is only possible because there is light, and where there is no light, there is no darkness to speak of.\n\nSo, in this sense, evil depends on good for its existence, just as darkness depends on light.\n\nTherefore, the answer seems to be D. good.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf I choose A. hatred, that would mean that without hatred, there is no evil. But that doesn't seem right because there are many forms of evil that don't involve hatred, like indifference or apathy.\n\nSimilarly, B. greed, isn't necessarily present in all instances of evil. Evil can manifest in many ways beyond greed.\n\nC. love, as I thought earlier, is more associated with good, so it doesn't make sense to say that evil requires love to exist.\n\nSo, D. good, seems to be the most consistent with Augustine's philosophy.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
