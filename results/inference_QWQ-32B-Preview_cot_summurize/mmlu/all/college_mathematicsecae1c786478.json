                    "text": "Let's tackle this group theory problem step by step. So, we have a finite group \\( G \\) that contains a subgroup of order seven, and no element (except the identity) is its own inverse. We need to find out which of the given options could be the order of \\( G \\): 27, 28, 35, or 37.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic group theory concepts. Since \\( G \\) has a subgroup of order seven, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of this subgroup must divide the order of \\( G \\). So, 7 must divide the order of \\( G \\). Let's check which of the options are divisible by 7.\n\n- 27 \u00f7 7 = 3.857... not an integer, so 27 is not divisible by 7.\n\n- 28 \u00f7 7 = 4, so 28 is divisible by 7.\n\n- 35 \u00f7 7 = 5, so 35 is divisible by 7.\n\n- 37 \u00f7 7 = 5.285..., not an integer, so 37 is not divisible by 7.\n\nSo, we can eliminate options A (27) and D (37) because their orders are not divisible by 7. Now, we're left with B (28) and C (35).\n\nNext, the problem states that no element (other than the identity) is its own inverse. In group theory terms, this means that for any element \\( g \\) in \\( G \\), if \\( g \\neq e \\), then \\( g \\neq g^{-1} \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity element.\n\nThis implies that all non-identity elements are paired with their inverses, and no element is its own inverse. Therefore, the non-identity elements must come in pairs of the form \\( \\{g, g^{-1}\\} \\), where \\( g \\neq g^{-1} \\).\n\nThis has implications for the order of the group. Since elements are paired, the number of non-identity elements must be even. Therefore, the total order of the group, which includes the identity, must be odd plus one, meaning the order of \\( G \\) must be odd.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nIf all non-identity elements are paired with their inverses, and none is its own inverse, then the number of non-identity elements is even (since they come in pairs). Therefore, the total order of the group is even plus one, which is odd.\n\nBut hold on, if the number of non-identity elements is even, then the order of the group is even + 1 = odd.\n\nBut let's check this logic. For example, take the group of order 3: \\( \\{e, a, a^2\\} \\), where \\( a^3 = e \\). Here, \\( a \\) and \\( a^2 \\) are inverses of each other, since \\( a \\cdot a^2 = e \\). So, non-identity elements come in pairs, and the total order is odd.\n\nSimilarly, in a group of order 5, the non-identity elements would pair up, and the order is odd.\n\nWait, but in a group of order 4, like the Klein four-group, every element is its own inverse, which contradicts our condition. So, order must be odd and not divisible by 2 in the way that allows elements to be their own inverses.\n\nBut in our problem, no element except the identity is its own inverse, so the group cannot have elements of order 2.\n\nSo, the group has no elements of order 2.\n\nNow, in group theory, elements of order 2 are precisely those that are their own inverses.\n\nSo, our group has no elements of order 2, except the identity, which has order 1.\n\nBut the identity is always its own inverse, of course.\n\nSo, our group has no elements of order 2.\n\nNow, by Cauchy's theorem, if a prime \\( p \\) divides the order of a group, then the group has an element of order \\( p \\).\n\nIn our case, since the group has a subgroup of order 7, which is prime, by Lagrange's theorem, 7 divides the order of \\( G \\). So, the order of \\( G \\) is a multiple of 7.\n\nBut, since the group has no elements of order 2, by Cauchy's theorem, 2 does not divide the order of \\( G \\). Because if 2 divided the order of \\( G \\), then there would be an element of order 2, which contradicts our condition.\n\nTherefore, the order of \\( G \\) must be odd and divisible by 7.\n\nNow, looking back at our remaining options, B (28) and C (35):\n\n- 28 is even, so it's divisible by 2, which would imply, by Cauchy's theorem, that there is an element of order 2 in \\( G \\), which contradicts our condition.\n\n- 35 is odd and divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the only possible order for \\( G \\) is 35.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. The order of \\( G \\) must be divisible by 7 (from Lagrange's theorem, since it has a subgroup of order 7).\n\n2. The order of \\( G \\) must be odd (since it has no elements of order 2, except the identity).\n\nFrom the options given, only 35 satisfies both conditions.\n\nBut let's consider if there could be a group of order 35 that has a subgroup of order 7 and no elements of order 2.\n\nFirst, note that 35 = 5 \u00d7 7, where 5 and 7 are distinct primes.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we can analyze the possible number of Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups.\n\nLet \\( n_5 \\) be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups. Then \\( n_5 \\) divides 7 and \\( n_5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\). So, \\( n_5 \\) can be 1 or 7.\n\nSimilarly, let \\( n_7 \\) be the number of Sylow 7-subgroups. Then \\( n_7 \\) divides 5 and \\( n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\). So, \\( n_7 \\) can only be 1.\n\nTherefore, there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which must be normal in \\( G \\).\n\nSimilarly, there is either one or seven Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nNow, since the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal and of order 7, which is prime, it is cyclic.\n\nMoreover, since the group has no elements of order 2, it cannot have any subgroups of order 2.\n\nNow, in a group of order 35, the possible structures are:\n\n- A cyclic group of order 35, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{35} \\).\n\n- A semi-direct product of the Sylow 5-subgroup and the Sylow 7-subgroup.\n\nBut since the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal, the semi-direct product is determined by a homomorphism from the Sylow 5-subgroup to the automorphism group of the Sylow 7-subgroup.\n\nThe automorphism group of a cyclic group of order 7 is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\), since \\( \\phi(7) = 6 \\).\n\nSo, we have a homomorphism \\( \\varphi: \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\).\n\nBut \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) is cyclic of order 5, and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\) is cyclic of order 6.\n\nThe possible homomorphisms are determined by where the generator of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) is sent.\n\nThe order of the image must divide both 5 and 6, so the only possibility is that the image is the identity. Therefore, the only homomorphism is the trivial one.\n\nThis means that the semi-direct product is actually a direct product, so \\( G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\), which is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{35} \\), the cyclic group of order 35.\n\nTherefore, up to isomorphism, there is only one group of order 35, which is cyclic.\n\nNow, in a cyclic group of order 35, the elements have orders that divide 35, which are 1, 5, 7, and 35.\n\nSo, there are elements of order 5, 7, and 35, but no elements of order 2.\n\nThis satisfies our condition that no element (except the identity) is its own inverse, since there are no elements of order 2.\n\nAdditionally, it has a subgroup of order 7, namely the subgroup generated by an element of order 7.\n\nTherefore, a group of order 35 satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be a group of order 28 that satisfies the conditions, even though our earlier reasoning suggests it shouldn't.\n\nThe order of G is 28 = 4 \u00d7 7.\n\nBy Cauchy's theorem, since 2 divides 28, there must be an element of order 2 in G, which contradicts the condition that no element (except the identity) is its own inverse.\n\nTherefore, a group of order 28 cannot satisfy the given conditions.\n\nSimilarly, orders 27 and 37 were already eliminated because they are not divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the only possible order for G among the given options is 35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
