                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about measles cases decreasing linearly from 1960 to 1996. In 1960, there were 450,000 cases, and by 1996, that number dropped to 500 cases. I need to find out how many cases there would have been in 1987, assuming this linear decrease.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a linear decrease means. It means that the number of cases decreases by a constant amount each year. So, if I can find the annual rate of decrease, I can apply that to find the number of cases in any year between 1960 and 1996.\n\nLet's start by finding the total decrease in cases over the period from 1960 to 1996. The number of cases went from 450,000 to 500, so the total decrease is:\n\n450,000 - 500 = 449,500 cases\n\nNow, I need to find out over how many years this decrease occurred. From 1960 to 1996 is:\n\n1996 - 1960 = 36 years\n\nSo, the annual decrease in cases would be the total decrease divided by the number of years:\n\n449,500 cases / 36 years = 12,486.111... cases per year\n\nNow, I need to find the number of cases in 1987. First, I'll find out how many years have passed from 1960 to 1987:\n\n1987 - 1960 = 27 years\n\nSo, over 27 years, the decrease in cases would be:\n\n12,486.111... cases/year * 27 years = 337,125 cases\n\nTherefore, the number of cases in 1987 would be the original number in 1960 minus this decrease:\n\n450,000 - 337,125 = 112,875 cases\n\nLooking back at the options, 112,875 is option D.\n\nWait a minute, but option A is 337,125, which is the decrease, not the remaining cases. Option D is 112,875, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Total decrease from 1960 to 1996: 450,000 - 500 = 449,500 cases\n\n2. Number of years: 1996 - 1960 = 36 years\n\n3. Annual decrease: 449,500 / 36 = 12,486.111... cases per year\n\n4. Years from 1960 to 1987: 27 years\n\n5. Decrease over 27 years: 12,486.111... * 27 = 337,125 cases\n\n6. Cases in 1987: 450,000 - 337,125 = 112,875 cases\n\nThis seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach the problem differently.\n\nAnother way to think about linear decrease is to consider it as a straight line on a graph, where the x-axis is the year and the y-axis is the number of cases. The slope of the line is the rate of decrease.\n\nThe general equation of a line is:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nWhere m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nIn this case, y is the number of cases, and x is the year.\n\nI know two points on this line: (1960, 450,000) and (1996, 500).\n\nFirst, I can find the slope m:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (500 - 450,000) / (1996 - 1960) = (-449,500) / 36 = -12,486.111... cases per year\n\nNow, I can use one of the points to find b, the y-intercept. Let's use (1960, 450,000):\n\n450,000 = (-12,486.111...) * 1960 + b\n\nWait, this seems messy. Maybe it's better to set x = 0 as 1960 to simplify calculations.\n\nLet me redefine x as the number of years since 1960.\n\nSo, x = 0 in 1960, x = 36 in 1996.\n\nThen, the two points are: (0, 450,000) and (36, 500).\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nUsing point (0, 450,000):\n\n450,000 = m*0 + b => b = 450,000\n\nUsing point (36, 500):\n\n500 = m*36 + 450,000\n\nSolving for m:\n\nm = (500 - 450,000)/36 = (-449,500)/36 = -12,486.111... cases per year\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\ny = -12,486.111... x + 450,000\n\nNow, to find the number of cases in 1987, which is x = 1987 - 1960 = 27 years:\n\ny = (-12,486.111...) * 27 + 450,000\n\ny = -337,125 + 450,000 = 112,875 cases\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nBut let's check if there's another way to look at this, maybe using proportions or something else.\n\nSince it's a linear decrease, the decrease per year is constant, so my first method should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the percentage decrease, but since it's linear decrease, not exponential, that probably wouldn't apply here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the decrease is truly linear, but the problem states it is, so I can assume that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not missing any units or misplacing decimals, but since we're dealing with whole numbers of cases, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nSo, I think 112,875 is the correct answer, which is option D.\n\nBut why is there an option A with 337,125, which is the total decrease over 27 years? Maybe someone thought that was the number of cases in 1987, but that doesn't make sense because it's greater than the original number in 1960.\n\nWait, no, 337,125 is the decrease over 27 years, so the cases in 1987 should be 450,000 - 337,125 = 112,875, which is option D.\n\nOption A is the decrease, not the remaining cases, so it's a likely mistake for someone to choose A if they misinterpret what the question is asking.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 112,875.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112875} \\]"
