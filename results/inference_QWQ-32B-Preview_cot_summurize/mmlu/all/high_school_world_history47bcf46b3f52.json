But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nThe reference to the \"continual beatings\" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. It's from a speech by Joseph Stalin in 1931, where he talks about Russia's history of being beaten because of its backwardness and how they need to change that. The question is asking which later Soviet foreign policy decision is most directly supported by this reference to \"continual beatings.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Stalin is saying here. He's listing all these instances where old Russia was beaten by various rulers and countries because it was backward in military, culture, politics, industry, and agriculture. He's emphasizing that being backward makes a country vulnerable to being attacked and exploited. So, the main point is that Russia needs to become stronger and less backward to avoid being beaten again.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. This was when the Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan to support the communist government against Mujahideen insurgents. Was this directly related to avoiding being beaten because of backwardness? Hmm, maybe not directly. It was more about extending Soviet influence and supporting a communist ally.\n\nB. The creation of the Warsaw Pact in 1955. This was a military alliance among Eastern European socialist countries, essentially a counter to NATO. Was this about avoiding being beaten? Well, yes, in a way, because it was about collective defense against the Western powers, especially after NATO brought West Germany into the fold. So, perhaps this is related to Stalin's concern about not being vulnerable.\n\nC. The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe, like in Czechoslovakia in 1968. This was about maintaining Soviet control over its satellite states and suppressing any moves towards independence or reform that were against Soviet interests. While this is about maintaining power and influence, it's not directly about avoiding being beaten due to backwardness.\n\nD. The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II in 1945. This was when the Soviet Union entered the war against Japan, after Germany had already been defeated, and took over some Japanese-held territories, including in\u4e1c\u5317 China and Korea. This action can be seen as asserting Soviet power and influence in the Asia-Pacific region, but is it directly related to Stalin's concern about backwardness?\n\nComparing these options, B, the creation of the Warsaw Pact, seems most directly related to Stalin's concern about not being beaten because of backwardness. By forming this military alliance, the Soviet Union was strengthening its defense capabilities and collective security with other socialist countries, which aligns with the idea of not being vulnerable to attacks due to weakness or backwardness.\n\nOption A, the invasion of Afghanistan, was more about extending influence and supporting a ally, not directly about avoiding being beaten.\n\nOption C, the Brezhnev Doctrine, was about maintaining control over satellite states, which is important for Soviet security, but it's more about internal control within the socialist bloc rather than directly addressing external threats based on backwardness.\n\nOption D, the war against Japan, was a strategic move to gain influence in Asia and secure borders, but it's not directly tied to the issue of backwardness that Stalin was addressing in his speech.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B, the creation of the Warsaw Pact. It's the policy that most directly addresses the concern of not being beaten due to backwardness by strengthening military capabilities through alliance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
