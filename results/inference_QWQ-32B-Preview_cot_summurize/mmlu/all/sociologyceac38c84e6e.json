So, maybe he talked about how people learn to use cannabis through social interactions.\n\nOption A says that cannabis use was increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s. Hmm, maybe, but I think Becker was more interested in how people learn to use drugs rather than just reporting on trends.\n\nOption B says that cannabis use was learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career. That sounds familiar. Becker talked about how people become deviant by learning the behaviors and norms of deviant groups. So, perhaps he saw cannabis use as something that is learned through socialization into a group that uses it.\n\nOption C says that cannabis use was a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue. That seems more like a moral statement, not really in line with Becker's sociological approach. He was more about understanding behavior than making judgments.\n\nOption D says that cannabis use was not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested. I don't recall anything about Becker discussing the enjoyment of cannabis use compared to other sociologists.\n\nConsidering Becker's work on deviance and labeling theory, I think option B is the most accurate. He probably saw cannabis use as something that is learned through social processes within a deviant career.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
