                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which proposition would be rejected by critical legal theorists. Let's see what I know about critical legal theory first.\n\nCritical legal theory, or critical legal studies (CLS), is a movement that emerged in the 1970s. It's known for challenging traditional legal doctrines and arguing that law is indeterminate and influenced by social, political, and economic factors. CLS scholars often critique the idea that law is objective or neutral.\n\nOption A says \"Law is politics.\" I think CLS would actually agree with this. They argue that law is not apolitical but is deeply embedded in political struggles and ideologies. So, they wouldn't reject this proposition.\n\nOption B says \"Law is determinate.\" Now, determinacy in law refers to the idea that legal decisions can be derived in a mechanical way from existing legal rules and precedents. CLS scholars famously reject this notion. They argue that law is indeterminate, meaning that there are often multiple plausible interpretations of legal texts, and that decisions are influenced by factors beyond just the law itself, such as the judge's personal beliefs or political considerations. So, they would likely reject this proposition.\n\nOption C says \"Law reflects economic power.\" CLS scholars often analyze how law serves the interests of those in power, which can include economic elites. They might argue that law reinforces existing power structures, including economic ones. So, I think they would agree with this proposition and not reject it.\n\nOption D says \"Law is unstable.\" CLS scholars might argue that law is unstable in the sense that it's open to multiple interpretations and can change based on social and political contexts. However, I'm not sure if this is a core tenet of CLS. Maybe they don't necessarily see law as unstable; perhaps they see it as flexible or indeterminate.\n\nGiven that, I think the proposition that CLS scholars would most likely reject is B: \"Law is determinate.\" Because they argue that law is indeterminate and subject to multiple interpretations.\n\nBut let me double-check. If law is indeterminate, that means it's not determinate. So, rejecting the idea that law is determinate aligns with CLS thought.\n\nOption A, \"Law is politics,\" they would agree with, as they see law as inherently political.\n\nOption C, \"Law reflects economic power,\" they would likely agree with, given their focus on how law serves power structures.\n\nOption D, \"Law is unstable,\" might not be a central claim of CLS, but they might accept that law can be unstable due to its indeterminacy.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: \"Law is determinate.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
