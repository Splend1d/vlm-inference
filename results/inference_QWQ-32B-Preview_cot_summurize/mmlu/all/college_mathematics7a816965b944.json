                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a function \\(f(x)\\) that passes through the origin, which means \\(f(0) = 0\\). The given recurrence relation is \\(f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)]\\) for every integer \\(n\\). We need to find the value of \\(f(8)\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the recurrence relation. It relates the value of the function at \\(2n\\) to the value at \\(2(n - 1)\\), with an added term of \\(n^2\\). Since we're dealing with integer values of \\(n\\), I can try to compute \\(f(8)\\) by working my way up from smaller values of \\(n\\).\n\nLet's start by finding a pattern or expressing \\(f(8)\\) in terms of smaller values. Given that \\(f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)]\\), I can set \\(2n = 8\\), which means \\(n = 4\\). So,\n\n\\[f(8) = 4^2 + f[2(4 - 1)] = 16 + f(6)\\]\n\nNow, I need to find \\(f(6)\\). Using the same recurrence relation with \\(2n = 6\\), so \\(n = 3\\):\n\n\\[f(6) = 3^2 + f[2(3 - 1)] = 9 + f(4)\\]\n\nNext, I need \\(f(4)\\). Setting \\(2n = 4\\), so \\(n = 2\\):\n\n\\[f(4) = 2^2 + f[2(2 - 1)] = 4 + f(2)\\]\n\nAnd now, \\(f(2)\\). With \\(2n = 2\\), so \\(n = 1\\):\n\n\\[f(2) = 1^2 + f[2(1 - 1)] = 1 + f(0)\\]\n\nWe know that \\(f(0) = 0\\) because the function passes through the origin. Therefore:\n\n\\[f(2) = 1 + 0 = 1\\]\n\nNow, substitute back to find \\(f(4)\\):\n\n\\[f(4) = 4 + f(2) = 4 + 1 = 5\\]\n\nThen, \\(f(6)\\):\n\n\\[f(6) = 9 + f(4) = 9 + 5 = 14\\]\n\nFinally, \\(f(8)\\):\n\n\\[f(8) = 16 + f(6) = 16 + 14 = 30\\]\n\nSo, the value of \\(f(8)\\) is 30.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if there's another way to approach this to confirm my answer. Maybe I can try to find a general formula for \\(f(2n)\\) based on the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)]\\]\n\nThis looks like a linear recurrence relation. To find a general formula, I can expand the recurrence a few times to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLet's expand \\(f(2n)\\):\n\n\\[f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)]\\]\n\\[= n^2 + (n - 1)^2 + f[2(n - 2)]\\]\n\\[= n^2 + (n - 1)^2 + (n - 2)^2 + f[2(n - 3)]\\]\n\\[...\\]\n\\[= n^2 + (n - 1)^2 + (n - 2)^2 + \\dots + 1^2 + f(0)\\]\n\\[= n^2 + (n - 1)^2 + (n - 2)^2 + \\dots + 1^2 + 0\\]\n\nSo, \\(f(2n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2\\)\n\nI know that the sum of squares of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is:\n\n\\[\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(f(2n) = \\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}\\)\n\nNow, to find \\(f(8)\\), I need to find \\(n\\) such that \\(2n = 8\\), so \\(n = 4\\).\n\nPlugging in \\(n = 4\\):\n\n\\[f(8) = \\frac{4 \\times 5 \\times 9}{6} = \\frac{180}{6} = 30\\]\n\nThis matches the answer I got earlier by iteratively substituting the values. So, I'm confident that \\(f(8) = 30\\).\n\nLet me just double-check the sum of squares formula to be sure. The formula for the sum of squares of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is indeed \\(\\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}\\). For \\(n = 4\\):\n\n\\[1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 30, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
