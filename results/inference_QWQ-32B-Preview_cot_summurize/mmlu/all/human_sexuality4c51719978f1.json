They are well-known for their research on human sexuality, and they developed a model of the sexual response cycle that includes excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution phases. This model has been widely recognized and used in the field of sexology.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: Henry Havelock Ellis was a pioneer in the study of human sexuality, and he wrote extensively about sexual behavior and attitudes. However, I don't recall him developing a specific model of the physiological response to sexual stimulation.\n\nOption B: Sigmund Freud is famous for his psychoanalytic theory, which includes concepts like the Oedipus complex and the division of the psyche into id, ego, and superego. While he did have theories about sexual development and libido, I don't think he provided a detailed model of the physiological aspects of sexual response.\n\nOption C: Linda George and Stephen Weiler are not as familiar to me. A quick search suggests that they have worked in the area of human sexuality, but I don't know if they developed a specific model of the physiological response.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, I'll go with D. William Masters and Virginia Johnson.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
