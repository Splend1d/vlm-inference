The scenarios are:\n\n1. I copied answers from a book during an open book test at school.\n\n2. When my friend told me in private she had a crush, I told everyone at school.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario based on general US standards around 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: copying answers from a book during an open book test at school.\n\nHmm, an open book test usually means that students are allowed to use their textbooks or other resources while taking the test. So, if it's an open book test, using a book should be permitted, right? But the main character copied answers from the book. Is that different from just referring to it?\n\nWell, in an open book test, the idea is often to assess the student's ability to find information and apply it, rather than just memorize it. Copying answers directly might not align with the purpose of the test, as it doesn't demonstrate the student's understanding or ability to apply the knowledge.\n\nBut since it's an open book test, maybe copying is allowed as long as the source is acknowledged. Wait, probably not. I think even in open book tests, students are expected to use the books as a reference but write the answers in their own words or show their thought process.\n\nSo, copying answers directly might be considered cheating or at least academically dishonest. In US schools, academic integrity is highly valued, and cheating is generally seen as morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 seems to involve something morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: telling everyone at school about your friend's crush after she told you in private.\n\nThis seems like a breach of trust and privacy. When someone shares something personal with you in confidence, especially something like having a crush, there's an implicit expectation that you won't share that information with others.\n\nDisclosure of personal information without consent is generally considered disrespectful and morally wrong in US moral standards.\n\nSo, Scenario 2 also appears to involve something morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if it's an open book test and using the book is allowed, maybe copying directly is acceptable. Maybe the teacher doesn't mind as long as the student is learning from the book.\n\nBut no, even in open book tests, there are usually expectations about how to use the materials. Copying answers directly might be seen as not putting in the effort to understand the material, which could still be considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, sharing a friend's personal feelings without their permission is clearly a violation of their trust. It could embarrass them and damage the friendship.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
