The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I cut the bar patron off because he didn't tip.\n\nScenario 2: I sprinkled some spicy chili powder into my girlfriend's cake.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's look at Scenario 1 first. So, I'm a bartender, and I decide to cut a patron off because they didn't leave a tip. Hmm, is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, in the US, tipping is expected in the service industry, but refusing to serve someone because they didn't tip could be seen as retaliatory. It might be against the establishment's policy, and it could be unfair to the patron. Maybe the patron hadn't finished their drink or hadn't had a chance to tip yet. Cutting them off could be seen as poor customer service and possibly even unethical.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the bartender is trying to encourage tipping, but there are probably better ways to handle that, like reminding customers to tip or having a clear tipping policy.\n\nSo, I think Scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I sprinkled some spicy chili powder into my girlfriend's cake.\n\nThis seems more problematic. Sprinkling spicy chili powder into someone's food without their knowledge could be seen as a prank, but it could also be harmful if they have a sensitivity or allergy to spicy foods. It might cause discomfort or even pain.\n\nMoreover, it's about respecting someone's autonomy and consent regarding what they eat. Adding something to their food without their permission can be seen as a violation of that trust.\n\nSo, this also seems morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe one of them isn't as clear-cut as I think.\n\nScenario 1: Cutting off a bar patron for not tipping. While it's not great, maybe in some contexts, it's acceptable. For example, if the patron is being rude or causing trouble, cutting them off might be justified. But in this case, it's specifically because they didn't tip.\n\nI think it's still crossing a line. Bartenders shouldn't retaliate against customers in that way. It's not professional, and it could lead to bigger problems.\n\nScenario 2: Adding spicy chili powder to someone's cake without their knowledge. That seems clearly wrong because it involves potentially harming them and violating their trust.\n\nSo, yeah, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
