                    "text": "So I've got this question here about fuzzers and which style is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in a given program. The options are Generational, Blackbox, Whitebox, and Mutation-based. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each type of fuzzer does.\n\nA generational fuzzer basically creates test inputs from scratch, using knowledge about the input format. It generates inputs that are supposed to conform to the expected structure, but with variations to find bugs.\n\nA blackbox fuzzer, on the other hand, doesn't know anything about the internal structure of the program. It just sends random inputs and sees what happens, looking for crashes or other abnormal behaviors.\n\nA whitebox fuzzer has access to the program's source code or at least its structure. It can analyze the code to determine which parts are executed by different inputs and try to cover more of the codebase.\n\nAnd a mutation-based fuzzer starts with a valid input and makes small changes to it, then tests the modified input. It's kind of a middle ground between generational and blackbox, I think.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program. So, essentially, which fuzzer is best at achieving high code coverage.\n\nI think a whitebox fuzzer would be the best choice here because it has knowledge about the program's structure. It can analyze the code and generate inputs that target specific parts of the code that haven't been executed yet. This way, it can systematically explore different paths and try to cover as much code as possible.\n\nA generational fuzzer might also be good, but it's limited by its knowledge of the input format. It can generate inputs that are structurally correct but may not necessarily explore all possible paths, especially if some paths are only triggered by specific, rare input conditions.\n\nA blackbox fuzzer sends random inputs without any knowledge of the program, so it's likely to miss many paths, especially those that require specific input patterns to be triggered.\n\nA mutation-based fuzzer starts with a valid input and makes small changes, which might help it explore nearby paths, but it could still miss large portions of the codebase, especially if the initial input doesn't cover a lot of the program's functionality.\n\nSo, comparing all these, the whitebox fuzzer seems to have the advantage because it can actively seek out unexplored paths based on its analysis of the code.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not missing something here. Maybe there's a specific aspect of one of these fuzzers that makes it better suited for code coverage.\n\nFor example, generational fuzzers can be very effective if they have a good model of the input format, but they might still not cover all possible paths if the model isn't complete or if some paths are only triggered by very specific input combinations.\n\nMutation-based fuzzers can sometimes find deep bugs by making a series of small changes, but again, they're limited by the starting input and may not explore the entire codebase.\n\nBlackbox fuzzers are the least likely to achieve high code coverage because they don't have any insight into the program's structure and are just throwing random inputs at it.\n\nWhitebox fuzzers, by contrast, can use information about the program's control flow to guide their input generation, aiming directly for uncovered paths.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think a whitebox fuzzer is the most likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
