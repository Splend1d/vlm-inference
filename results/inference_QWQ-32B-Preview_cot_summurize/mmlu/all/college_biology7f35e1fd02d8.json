                    "text": "So I have this genetics problem here involving garden peas. It's about determining the phenotypic ratio of progeny from a cross between a tall violet plant and a dwarf white plant. The alleles are defined such that tall (D) is dominant over dwarf (d), and violet flower color (W) is dominant over white (w). The tall violet plant has the genotype DDWw, and the dwarf white plant has the genotype ddww, I assume, since it's dwarf and white.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the genotypes of the parents. The tall violet plant is DDWw, meaning it's homozygous dominant for height and heterozygous for flower color. The dwarf white plant is ddww, homozygous recessive for both traits.\n\nSince these are independent traits (assuming they assort independently), I can use the Punnett square method to determine the possible combinations in the offspring.\n\nLet me list the gametes each parent can produce.\n\nFor the tall violet plant (DDWw):\n\n- Since DD is homozygous dominant for height, all gametes will have D.\n\n- For flower color, Ww is heterozygous, so gametes can have either W or w.\n\nTherefore, the possible gametes from the tall violet plant are DW and Dw.\n\nFor the dwarf white plant (ddww):\n\n- It's homozygous recessive for both traits, so all gametes will be dw.\n\nNow, let's set up a Punnett square with these gametes.\n\nParents: DDWw (tall violet) x ddww (dwarf white)\n\nGametes from tall violet: DW and Dw\n\nGametes from dwarf white: dw\n\nLet's cross them:\n\n- DW from tall violet with dw from dwarf white: DdWw\n\n- Dw from tall violet with dw from dwarf white: Ddww\n\nSo, the possible progeny genotypes are:\n\n1. DdWw\n\n2. Ddww\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on the genotypes.\n\n- DdWw: D is dominant for tall, so the plant will be tall. W is dominant for violet, so the flowers will be violet. Therefore, tall violet.\n\n- Ddww: D is dominant for tall, so the plant will be tall. ww is recessive for white flowers, so the flowers will be white. Therefore, tall white.\n\nSo, all progeny will be tall, with half having violet flowers and half having white flowers.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. All tall violet\n\nB. 1 tall violet : 1 dwarf violet\n\nC. 1 tall violet : 1 tall white : 1 dwarf violet : 1 dwarf white\n\nD. 1 tall violet : 1 tall white\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 1 tall violet : 1 tall white.\n\nWait a minute, but in my calculation, all progeny are tall, with half having violet flowers and half having white flowers. So, it's 1 tall violet : 1 tall white.\n\nBut option D says \"1 tall violet : 1 tall white\", which matches my calculation.\n\nHowever, option C has \"1 tall violet : 1 tall white : 1 dwarf violet : 1 dwarf white\", which would be the ratio if both traits were heterozygous in the parents, but in this case, one parent is homozygous dominant for both traits, and the other is homozygous recessive.\n\nSo, yes, D seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nParent 1: DDWw\n\nParent 2: ddww\n\nGametes from Parent 1: DW and Dw\n\nGametes from Parent 2: dw\n\nProgeny:\n\n- DW x dw = DdWw (tall violet)\n\n- Dw x dw = Ddww (tall white)\n\nSo, indeed, all offspring are tall, with half having violet flowers and half having white flowers.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
