                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this law problem about a musician and his neighbor who runs a sand business. So, the neighbor is digging up sand and stuff on his own property, but because of that, a storage building on the musician's property collapsed. Now, if the musician sues for damages, what's likely to happen?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. He'll be successful if he can show the neighbor was negligent in his excavations.\n\nB. He'll be successful because the neighbor is strictly liable for removing lateral support.\n\nC. He won't be successful because the neighbor isn't liable for damage to man-made structures like storage buildings.\n\nD. He won't be successful because a neighboring landowner doesn't have to support his neighbor's land.\n\nHmm. I need to think about property law here, specifically about the duties between adjacent landowners regarding support and excavation.\n\nFirst, I know that when you own land, you have certain rights and responsibilities regarding your property and your neighbor's property. One of those is not to interfere with your neighbor's support. There's something about lateral support, right? I think it has to do with the soil and foundations.\n\nOption B mentions strict liability for removal of lateral support. Strict liability means the neighbor would be responsible regardless of whether he was careful or not. So, if he removed soil in a way that caused the neighbor's building to collapse, he'd be on the hook.\n\nOption A talks about negligence, which means the neighbor had to have been careless or failed to meet a certain standard of care in his excavations. So, if the neighbor didn't follow proper procedures for excavation, like shoring up the sides or something, and that led to the collapse, then the musician could sue for negligence.\n\nOption C says the neighbor isn't liable for damage to artificial structures. But that doesn't sound right. If someone's careless actions cause damage to your building, shouldn't they be responsible?\n\nOption D says there's no affirmative duty to laterally support the neighbor's land. That sounds a bit conflicting. On one hand, you have the right to use your own land, including excavating, but on the other hand, you have to do it in a way that doesn't harm your neighbor's property.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the concept of lateral support. In property law, every landowner has a right to the natural support from the land of his neighbor. So, if the neighbor excavates his land in a way that removes that support, causing the neighbor's land to sink or shift, and that causes damage to structures, there can be liability.\n\nNow, is this liability strict, meaning the neighbor is automatically responsible, or is it based on negligence, meaning the neighbor had to have been careless in some way?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, the rule is strict liability for removal of support, meaning that if you excavate and remove support, causing damage, you're liable, period, without needing to prove negligence. But I'm not entirely sure if that's universal.\n\nAlso, I'm wondering about the type of structure. Is there a difference between natural land and artificial structures like buildings? Option C suggests that there might not be liability for damage to artificial structures, but that seems counterintuitive.\n\nLet me think about real-world implications. If someone digs near a neighbor's property and causes a foundation to crack or a building to collapse, it seems fair that they should be responsible, regardless of whether it's a natural or artificial structure. After all, the damage is to the neighbor's property.\n\nPerhaps there's a legal distinction. Maybe the right to lateral support applies to the land itself, and any structures on it are secondary. But I think the main concern is protecting the neighbor's property from harm caused by your actions.\n\nLooking back at the options, if it's strict liability, then option B would be correct. But if negligence is required, then option A would be right.\n\nOption D says there's no affirmative duty to laterally support the neighbor's land. But that seems contrary to the concept of lateral support. If there's no duty to provide support, then why would the neighbor be liable for removing it?\n\nWait, maybe it's that the neighbor isn't required to prop up the musician's land, but if he does remove support, he has to do it in a way that doesn't harm the neighbor's property. So, it might be a matter of how the excavation is done.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is that the neighbor is strictly liable for any damage caused by the removal of lateral support. So, if the excavation causes the storage building to collapse, the neighbor is liable, regardless of whether he was negligent or not.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there are any exceptions or if artificial structures are treated differently.\n\nI recall that in some cases, the liability might depend on whether the damage is to the land itself or to structures on the land. Maybe there's a difference in how the law treats them.\n\nUpon further thought, it seems that the right to lateral support applies to the land, and any structures on the land would be protected as part of that right. So, if the land collapses, taking the building with it, the neighbor who excavated would be liable.\n\nMoreover, in many jurisdictions, the rule is that a landowner has the right to lateral and subjacent support from the land of his neighbor, and any excavation that interferes with that support can render the excavator liable for any damage caused.\n\nIn some places, this liability is strict, meaning that even if the excavation was done with all possible care, if damage occurs, the excavator is responsible.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions or modifications based on local laws or circumstances. For example, if the building was already in a state of disrepair, or if the excavation was done in a manner that complied with all regulations and standards, there might be defenses available.\n\nBut based on the information given in the question, it seems that the neighbor's excessive excavating directly caused the collapse of the storage building. So, if there's a principle of strict liability for removal of support, then the musician should be successful in recovering damages under option B.\n\nOption A, which requires proving negligence, might also be a path, but if strict liability applies, then negligence doesn't need to be proven.\n\nOption C suggests that there's no liability for damage to artificial structures, but that seems contrary to the general principles I've recalled.\n\nOption D says there's no affirmative duty to laterally support the neighbor's land, but again, that seems to contradict the concept of lateral support rights.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: the musician will be successful because the neighbor would be strictly liable for his removal of lateral support.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
