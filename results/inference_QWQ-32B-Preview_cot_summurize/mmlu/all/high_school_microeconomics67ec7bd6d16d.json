                    "text": "Let's think about this question step by step. I need to understand the relationship between the average total cost (ATC) curve and the marginal cost (MC) curve. There are four options, and I have to determine which one is true.\n\nFirst, I know that ATC is the total cost divided by the quantity of output produced. Marginal cost, on the other hand, is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output.\n\nOption A says that ATC and MC are always equal. I don't think that's true because MC can be higher or lower than ATC depending on the level of production.\n\nOption B says that ATC and MC are never equal. But I recall that there is a point where MC equals ATC, so this can't be correct.\n\nOption C states that the ATC curve intersects the MC curve at the minimum point of the MC curve. I'm not sure about that. I think I've heard something about MC intersecting ATC at the minimum point of ATC, not necessarily at the minimum point of MC.\n\nOption D says that the MC curve intersects the ATC curve at the minimum point of the ATC curve. That sounds familiar. Let me think about why that would be the case.\n\nWhen MC is less than ATC, ATC is decreasing. When MC is greater than ATC, ATC is increasing. Therefore, the point where MC equals ATC should be the point where ATC stops decreasing and starts increasing, which is its minimum point.\n\nSo, option D makes sense based on that logic.\n\nLet me double-check option C. Does ATC intersect MC at the minimum point of MC? I don't think so. The minimum point of MC is where MC is at its lowest, but that doesn't necessarily correspond to where MC equals ATC.\n\nFor example, suppose MC is decreasing, then reaches its minimum, and starts increasing. Meanwhile, ATC is also decreasing initially but at a slower rate than MC, and then starts increasing. The point where MC equals ATC should be where ATC is at its minimum, not necessarily where MC is at its minimum.\n\nSo, option C seems incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: The MC curve intersects the ATC curve at the minimum point of the ATC curve.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
