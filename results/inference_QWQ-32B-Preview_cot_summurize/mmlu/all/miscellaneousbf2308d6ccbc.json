Hmm, I think I know what each of these looks like, but I should double-check to make sure.\n\nFirst, Life Corn\u2014wait, is that even a real cereal? I think maybe it's supposed to be Life Cereal, which is made by General Mills. Life Cereal has those little honey-comb looking pieces, right? Like, they're kind of hexagonal or something. So, not really shaped like an O.\n\nNext, Chex. Chex comes in different shapes\u2014there's square Chex, round Chex, and triangular Chex, right? But the original Chex are square, I believe. So, unless it's the round Chex, which might be shaped like an O, but I think generally, Chex is square.\n\nThen there's Cheerios. Cheerios are famous for being oat-based and shaped like small donuts, with a hole in the middle. So, that sounds a lot like the letter O.\n\nLastly, Raisin Bran. Raisin Bran is a cereal that has bran flakes with raisins in them. Bran flakes are usually rectangular or irregularly shaped, not circular.\n\nSo, between these options, Cheerios seem to be the one shaped like the letter O. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any of the others have O shapes.\n\nLife Cereal doesn't; it's more honeycomb-like.\n\nChex is typically square, although there might be variations.\n\nRaisin Bran has flakes that aren't circular.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Cheerios.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
