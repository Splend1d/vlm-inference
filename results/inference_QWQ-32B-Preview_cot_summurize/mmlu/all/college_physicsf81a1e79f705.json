                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Two students are dropping a ball from a known height and measuring its speed just before it hits the ground. They've estimated that their uncertainty in measuring the speed is 10 percent. The question is asking for the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball, and it assumes that the uncertainty in the ball's mass is negligible. The options are 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20%.\n\nOkay, first things first. Kinetic energy is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nWhere m is the mass and v is the velocity. Since the uncertainty in mass is negligible, we can consider m to be known precisely, which means any uncertainty in kinetic energy will come solely from the uncertainty in velocity.\n\nNow, I need to find out how the uncertainty in velocity affects the kinetic energy. I remember that when you have a quantity that depends on another quantity with some uncertainty, you can use error propagation to find the uncertainty in the dependent quantity.\n\nIn this case, KE depends on v, so I can use the formula for error propagation for a function of one variable. The general formula for the relative uncertainty is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta KE}{KE} = \\left| \\frac{d(KE)}{dv} \\right| \\cdot \\frac{\\delta v}{v} \\]\n\nFirst, I need to find the derivative of KE with respect to v.\n\n\\[ \\frac{d(KE)}{dv} = \\frac{d}{dv} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\right) = m v \\]\n\nSo plugging back into the error propagation formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta KE}{KE} = \\frac{m v}{\\frac{1}{2} m v^2} \\cdot \\delta v \\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{m v}{\\frac{1}{2} m v^2} = \\frac{m v}{m v^2 / 2} = \\frac{m v \\cdot 2}{m v^2} = \\frac{2 m v}{m v^2} = \\frac{2}{v} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.\n\nActually, I think I messed up the error propagation formula. The correct formula for relative uncertainty when KE is a function of v is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta KE}{KE} = \\left| \\frac{\\partial KE}{\\partial v} \\right| \\cdot \\frac{\\delta v}{v} \\]\n\nBut KE is \\( \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\), so \\( \\frac{\\partial KE}{\\partial v} = m v \\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta KE}{KE} = m v \\cdot \\frac{\\delta v}{v} \\]\n\nBut KE is \\( \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\), so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta KE}{KE} = m v \\cdot \\frac{\\delta v}{v} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} m v^2} \\]\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use the logarithmic form for error propagation.\n\nTaking natural logarithms:\n\n\\[ \\ln(KE) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\right) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m \\right) + 2 \\ln v \\]\n\nNow, taking differentials:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d(KE)}{KE} = 0 + 2 \\frac{dv}{v} \\]\n\nSo the relative uncertainty in KE is twice the relative uncertainty in v.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta KE}{KE} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\delta v}{v} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( \\frac{\\delta v}{v} = 10\\% \\), then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta KE}{KE} = 2 \\times 10\\% = 20\\% \\]\n\nSo the uncertainty in kinetic energy is 20%.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 20% seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this approach. I recall that for powers of variables, the relative uncertainty gets multiplied by the power. Since kinetic energy has v squared, the uncertainty should be doubled. That aligns with the result I just got.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of percentage uncertainties. If velocity has a 10% uncertainty, and kinetic energy depends on v squared, then the uncertainty in KE should be approximately 2 times 10%, which is 20%.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider small percentage changes. If v increases by 10%, then v^2 increases by approximately 20%. Similarly, if v decreases by 10%, v^2 decreases by approximately 20%. So the relative uncertainty in KE is twice that of v.\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty in kinetic energy is 20%.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D. 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
