                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character did something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I voted once in the presidential election.\" So, the person voted once in a presidential election. In the United States, voting is a fundamental right for citizens aged 18 and older. Voting once, as in participating in one election, is something that is encouraged and considered a positive civic duty. There's nothing morally wrong with voting in an election. In fact, it's often seen as a responsible thing to do. So, I wouldn't say this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I failed the student because he was skipping class.\" Here, a teacher is failing a student for skipping class. This seems more complicated. As a teacher, it's part of your job to enforce attendance policies and evaluate students based on their performance and participation. If skipping class is against the rules and affects the student's ability to learn and perform well, then failing them for poor attendance could be justified within the framework of the institution's policies.\n\nHowever, morality comes into play when we consider whether this action is fair and just. Failing a student solely for skipping class might be seen as harsh if there are extenuating circumstances the teacher is unaware of. On the other hand, enforcing attendance is important for the student's learning and for maintaining academic standards. So, from a moral standpoint, it's not necessarily wrong, but it could be debated depending on the context.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, failing a student for skipping class isn't typically considered morally wrong, especially if it's in line with established school policies.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Not wrong\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
