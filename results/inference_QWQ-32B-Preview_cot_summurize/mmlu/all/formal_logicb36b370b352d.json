                    "text": "So I have this translation problem here: \"Some athletes don't get injured.\" And I need to pick the best predicate logic translation from these options:\n\nA. ~Ia\n\nB. (\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 ~Ix)\n\nC. ~Ai\n\nD. (\u2203x)(Ix \u2228 ~Ax)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. \"Some athletes don't get injured\" suggests that there exists at least one athlete who does not get injured. So, it's about existence and negation.\n\nLet me assume that:\n\n- A(x): x is an athlete\n\n- I(x): x gets injured\n\nSo, \"some athletes don't get injured\" can be interpreted as \"there exists an x such that x is an athlete and x does not get injured.\"\n\nIn predicate logic, that would be: (\u2203x)(A(x) \u2022 ~I(x))\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. ~Ia\n\nThis seems to say \"not I of a,\" which might mean \"a is not injured.\" But it doesn't specify that a is an athlete. So, it's incomplete.\n\nB. (\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 ~Ix)\n\nThis looks pretty close to what I thought it should be. It says there exists an x that is an athlete and does not get injured.\n\nC. ~Ai\n\nThis seems unclear. If A is a constant, then ~Ai would mean \"not A of i,\" but I'm not sure what i represents here. Maybe I'm misreading it.\n\nD. (\u2203x)(Ix \u2228 ~Ax)\n\nThis says there exists an x such that x gets injured or x is not an athlete. That doesn't seem to capture the idea that some athletes don't get injured.\n\nSo, between these options, B seems to be the correct one: (\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 ~Ix)\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Is there any other way to interpret \"some athletes don't get injured\"?\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use negation with universals. For example, it's not the case that all athletes get injured. That would be ~(\\$x)(A(x) \u2192 I(x)) or (\u2203x)(A(x) \u2022 ~I(x)), which is the same as option B.\n\nSo, yes, B seems correct.\n\nOption A, ~Ia, might be correct if a is a specific athlete, but the statement is about some athletes, not a specific one.\n\nOption C, ~Ai, is unclear. If A is a predicate and i is a constant, then it's similar to A(i), but the tilde is confusing.\n\nOption D, (\u2203x)(Ix \u2228 ~Ax), this says there exists an x that is either injured or not an athlete. That doesn't capture the idea of athletes who aren't injured.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B: (\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 ~Ix)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
