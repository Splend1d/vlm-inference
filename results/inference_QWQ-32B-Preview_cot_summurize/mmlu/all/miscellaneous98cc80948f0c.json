                    "text": "To figure out how fast the Earth's surface is turning at the equator, I need to calculate the rotational speed. The Earth rotates once on its axis every 24 hours, and the equator is the widest part of the Earth, so it has the fastest rotational speed.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius. The Earth is roughly a sphere, so its equator is a big circle.\n\nI need to know the radius of the Earth. I think the average radius of the Earth is about 3,959 miles. So, plugging that into the formula:\n\nC = 2 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 3,959 miles\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2 \u00d7 3.1416 \u00d7 3,959 \u2248 2 \u00d7 3.1416 \u00d7 3,959 \u2248 6.2832 \u00d7 3,959 \u2248 24,901 miles\n\nSo, the circumference of the Earth at the equator is approximately 24,901 miles.\n\nNow, since the Earth rotates once every 24 hours, the rotational speed at the equator would be the circumference divided by the time for one rotation.\n\nSpeed = distance / time\n\nSpeed = 24,901 miles / 24 hours\n\nLet me do that division:\n\n24,901 \u00f7 24 \u2248 1,037.54 miles per hour\n\nSo, the Earth's surface at the equator is turning at approximately 1,037.54 miles per hour.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. about 100 miles per hour\n\nB. about 500 miles per hour\n\nC. about 1,000 miles per hour\n\nD. about 2,000 miles per hour\n\nThe closest option to my calculation is C. about 1,000 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, my calculation gave me about 1,037 mph, which is roughly 1,000 mph. So, C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, does the Earth's rotation speed vary slightly due to geographical location or other factors? I know that the Earth is not a perfect sphere; it's an oblate spheroid, meaning it's slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. However, for this calculation, using the average radius should be sufficient.\n\nAlso, I used the average radius, but some sources might have slightly different values for the Earth's radius. If I use a different value, say 3,963 miles, let's see what happens.\n\nC = 2 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 3,963 \u2248 2 \u00d7 3.1416 \u00d7 3,963 \u2248 6.2832 \u00d7 3,963 \u2248 24,920 miles\n\nThen, speed = 24,920 / 24 \u2248 1,038.33 mph\n\nStill approximately 1,000 mph.\n\nAlternatively, if I use a more precise value for the equatorial radius, which is about 3,963 miles, the calculation remains similar.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the Earth's surface at the equator is turning at about 1,000 miles per hour.\n\nSo, the answer is C. about 1,000 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
