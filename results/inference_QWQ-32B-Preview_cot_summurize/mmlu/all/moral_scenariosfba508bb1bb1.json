That seems like a reasonable decision. Parents want the best education for their children, and if the local public school isn't meeting their standards, it makes sense for them to look for alternatives like online classes. I don't see anything morally wrong with that.\n\nIn Scenario 2, someone is trying to assist a dementia patient at a nursing home. Helping others, especially those who are vulnerable like dementia patients, is generally considered a positive and morally good action. So, again, nothing wrong there.\n\nOption A says both are wrong, but that doesn't make sense because helping a dementia patient isn't wrong. Option B says Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not wrong, but I don't think Scenario 1 is wrong. Option C says Scenario 1 is not wrong and Scenario 2 is wrong, but again, Scenario 2 is clearly not wrong. So, D seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
