                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about intravenous drug administration. So, we have four statements, and we need to figure out which one is true. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"IV administration of a drug will delay its action.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Intravenous administration is one of the fastest ways to get drugs into the bloodstream because they're injected directly into the veins. So, the drug should take effect quickly, not be delayed. Maybe I'm misremembering, but I think IV administration is known for its rapid onset of action. So, probably, A is not the correct statement.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"IV administration carries low risk of bacteraemia.\" Bacteraemia means bacteria in the blood, which can lead to serious infections. Actually, IV administration comes with a higher risk of bacteraemia if proper precautions aren't taken. That's because inserting a needle into a vein can introduce bacteria directly into the bloodstream if the skin isn't properly cleaned or if the IV equipment is contaminated. So, I think B is incorrect because the risk is higher, not lower, compared to other routes like oral administration.\n\nOption C states: \"IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect.\" Titration means adjusting the dose of a drug based on the patient's response. This is indeed a\u4f18\u52bf of IV administration. With IV drugs, healthcare providers can adjust the infusion rate or give additional doses quickly in response to the patient's condition. This level of control isn't as straightforward with other routes like oral or intramuscular administration. So, this seems like a true statement.\n\nLastly, option D says: \"An intravenous cannula should never be used for both drug and fluid administration.\" I'm not sure about this one. Intravenous cannulas are commonly used for both giving fluids and administering drugs. In fact, it's pretty standard practice to administer medications through the same IV line that's delivering fluids, as long as the medications are compatible with the fluids and with each other. There are guidelines for flushing the line between medications to prevent interactions, but overall, using an IV cannula for both purposes is common. So, I think D is false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it seems like option C is the correct statement. IV administration does allow for titration of a drug with its desired effect, providing healthcare providers with the flexibility to adjust doses based on patient response.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
