According to Herzberg, what's the best way to boost this worker's self-motivation?\n\nLet's see, the options are:\n\nA. Offer a raise and incentive pay for greater productivity.\n\nB. Redesign the job to provide a challenge and a sense of accomplishment.\n\nC. Increase opportunities for informed social interaction.\n\nD. Provide the employee with a job title carrying greater prestige.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Herzberg's two-factor theory is all about. I remember that it distinguishes between hygiene factors and motivators.\n\nHygiene factors are things like salary, job security, work conditions, and company policies. These are the basics that need to be satisfied to prevent dissatisfaction, but they don't necessarily motivate people to perform better.\n\nMotivators, on the other hand, are things like achievement, recognition, the work itself, responsibility, and advancement. These are the factors that actually motivate employees to perform at a higher level and feel satisfied with their work.\n\nIn this scenario, the employee is only working for money and not putting in extra effort for quality or quantity. So, they're satisfied with the hygiene factors but lacking in the motivators.\n\nOption A is about offering a raise and incentive pay. That sounds like a hygiene factor\u2014salary and compensation. According to Herzberg, improving hygiene factors can reduce dissatisfaction but won't necessarily increase motivation.\n\nOption B is about redesigning the job to provide a challenge and a sense of accomplishment. That seems to align with the motivators\u2014achievement and the work itself.\n\nOption C is about increasing social interaction. While social aspects can be important, I don't recall them being a key motivator in Herzberg's theory. Maybe it's more related to Herzberg's hygiene factors like interpersonal relations.\n\nOption D is about giving the employee a more prestigious job title. That might relate to recognition or esteem, but I'm not sure if it directly ties into Herzberg's motivators.\n\nGiven that, it seems like option B\u2014redesigning the job to provide a challenge and a sense of accomplishment\u2014would be the best way to increase the worker's self-motivation according to Herzberg's theory.\n\nLet me double-check. Herzberg argued that motivators are intrinsic to the work itself and lead to true satisfaction and motivation, while hygiene factors are extrinsic and only prevent dissatisfaction.\n\nSo, by making the job more challenging and providing a sense of accomplishment, you're addressing the motivators that can lead to higher performance and satisfaction.\n\nOffering a raise and incentives might make the employee stay and perhaps work a bit harder, but it won't truly motivate them in the way that meaningful work does.\n\nSimilarly, social interaction and a better job title might have some positive effects, but they don't directly address the core motivators identified by Herzberg.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: redesign the job to provide a challenge and a sense of accomplishment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
