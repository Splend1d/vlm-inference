                    "text": "So I've got this question here about gesture drawing, and I need to figure out which option is the most characteristic of it. Let's see what each option is:\n\nA. An outline - That sounds like maybe the basic shape or contour of something. Like drawing the outer edge of an object or figure.\n\nB. Action and movement - This seems like it's about capturing motion or the way something is moving.\n\nC. Gradual shading - This might be about adding tones and shadows to give depth and form to the drawing.\n\nD. Carefully observed details - This sounds like paying close attention to small features and accurately representing them.\n\nNow, gesture drawing is something I've heard of, but I need to recall what it's all about. I think gesture drawing is a technique where the artist quickly captures the essence or the pose of a figure, often focusing on the action or movement. It's not so much about detailed rendering or perfect proportions.\n\nSo, considering that, option B, \"Action and movement,\" seems to align best with what I remember about gesture drawing. It's about capturing the dynamic aspect of the subject, maybe in a quick sketch.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure. Option A, \"An outline,\" might be a part of gesture drawing, but it's not the main focus. Gesture drawing is more about the overall pose and movement rather than just the outline.\n\nOption C, \"Gradual shading,\" sounds more like techniques used in more finished drawings to show form and volume. Gesture drawing is usually quicker and less concerned with shading.\n\nOption D, \"Carefully observed details,\" seems more relevant to realistic or detailed drawing, where precision and accuracy are key. Gesture drawing is more about capturing the gist of the pose quickly, not getting bogged down in details.\n\nSo, based on this, I think B. Action and movement is the most characteristic of gesture drawing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
