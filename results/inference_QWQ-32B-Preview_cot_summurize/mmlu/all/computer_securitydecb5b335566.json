It's not about hiding the location or encrypting communications to make the source impossible to determine, although those could be part of stealthy tactics. The key is to perform the test without alerting the target organization's security measures.\n\nOption A, \"Performing the tests from an undisclosed location,\" might be a part of being stealthy, but it's not the full picture. You could be stealthy from a disclosed location if you're careful about how you conduct the test.\n\nOption B, \"Using encryption during tests to make the source of attacks impossible to determine,\" is more about anonymity than stealth. While encryption can help hide the source, being stealthy is broader and includes avoiding detection altogether.\n\nOption C, \"Performing penetration testing without the target organization knowing,\" sounds like an ethical issue. Penetration tests are typically authorized and known to the target organization. Conducting a penetration test without the target's knowledge would be considered an unauthorized intrusion, which is illegal and unethical.\n\nSo, option D seems to capture the essence of being stealthy during a penetration test: avoiding activities that could raise alarms or draw attention to your actions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
