The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?\n\nA. It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language.\nB. It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.\nC. It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.\nD. It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, there's a state statute that requires people who want to write in a candidate in state elections to print the candidate's full name and designate the office they're running for, all in ink, on the ballot. Now, there's a write-in candidate who thinks he needs a lot of German voters to win, but many of them aren't very good at English. So, his campaign manager decides to send out stickers with the candidate's name and the office to all registered German voters, so they can just stick them on their ballots instead of trying to write it themselves.\n\nBut then, five months before the election, an election official says that these stickers don't comply with the state statute because the statute says the name has to be written in ink. So, the candidate sues in federal court, saying that the officials' interpretation violates the U.S. Constitution.\n\nWe need to figure out which argument is the strongest constitutional argument the candidate can make against the officials' interpretation. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack proficiency in English.\n\nB. It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.\n\nC. It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nD. It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.\n\nOkay, let's think about each one.\n\nStarting with A: discrimination against German voters who lack English proficiency. So, the argument here is that by requiring people to write in the candidate's name in ink, it puts German voters who aren't fluent in English at a disadvantage because they might struggle to write the name correctly. The stickers are meant to help them overcome this language barrier. If the officials are saying stickers aren't allowed, that could be seen as discriminating against these voters based on their language skills, which could be related to their national origin.\n\nNow, is this a strong constitutional argument? Well, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying people equal protection of the laws, which includes protection against discrimination based on national origin. So, if the statute as interpreted by the officials is having a discriminatory effect on German voters, that could be a constitutional problem.\n\nBut, is this the strongest argument? Let's look at the other options.\n\nOption B: discrimination against write-in candidates. The argument here is that the statute is unfairly targeting or discriminating against candidates who are running as write-in candidates. But, looking at the statute, it seems to apply to all write-in voters, not specifically to the candidates themselves. The candidates are just the beneficiaries of the voters' choices. So, it might be a stretch to say that the statute discriminates against the candidates themselves.\n\nOption C: interfering with federal election power under the Fifteenth Amendment. The Fifteenth Amendment says that the right to vote shall not be denied or abridged based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It's about protecting voting rights against racial discrimination.\n\nIn this case, the statute is about how write-in votes are cast, not directly about racial discrimination. While language issues can sometimes be related to race, that's not explicitly stated here. So, this might not be the strongest argument.\n\nOption D: interfering with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed literacy tests. The Voting Rights Act was designed to eliminate voting barriers that discriminated on the basis of race or color, such as literacy tests.\n\nHere, the statute requires voters to write in the candidate's name in ink, which could be seen as a type of literacy test, especially for those who aren't proficient in English. If that's the case, then the officials' interpretation of the statute could be violating the Voting Rights Act.\n\nBut wait, the Voting Rights Act is federal law, not part of the Constitution. However, the suit is in federal court, and the argument could be that the state statute, as interpreted, violates federal law, which might implicate constitutional issues related to preemption or something like that.\n\nBut, comparing this to option A, which directly invokes the Constitution through the Equal Protection Clause, option A might be stronger.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe there's an argument under the First Amendment, like freedom of speech or freedom of expression, but that's not listed among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an argument under the Seventeenth Amendment, which deals with the election of senators, but that seems off-track.\n\nWait, the question is about state elections, not federal elections. So, maybe the argument is about state interference with federal election powers, but that doesn't seem directly applicable here.\n\nGoing back to option A, discrimination against German voters based on national origin, that seems like a solid equal protection argument.\n\nOption B, discrimination against write-in candidates, seems weaker because, as I thought earlier, the statute applies to voters, not directly to candidates.\n\nOption C, interfering with federal election power under the Fifteenth Amendment, seems like a stretch because the Fifteenth Amendment is about racial discrimination, not about the mechanics of voting.\n\nOption D, interfering with the Voting Rights Act, is a strong argument, but since the Voting Rights Act is federal law, not part of the Constitution, perhaps it's not as directly constitutional as option A.\n\nHowever, the Voting Rights Act is authorized by the Fifteenth Amendment, so there might be a constitutional basis there.\n\nBut in terms of the strongest constitutional argument, I think option A is better because it directly invokes the Equal Protection Clause, which is part of the Constitution, whereas option D relates to a federal statute authorized by the Constitution.\n\nAdditionally, the scenario emphasizes that many native German people are not proficient in English, which suggests a potential national origin-based discrimination issue.\n\nTherefore, I believe the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make is that the officials' interpretation unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack proficiency in the English language, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
