                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a chemical reaction, A turning into 2B, and a chemist is plotting different graphs to figure out the rate law. The graphs are of [A] versus time, ln[A] versus time, and 1/[A] versus time. According to the problem, the first two give curved lines, but the third one gives a straight line. And we're supposed to figure out what the rate law is based on that.\n\nOkay, so let's recall what rate laws are and how they relate to these graphs. The rate law for a reaction tells us how the rate of the reaction depends on the concentrations of the reactants. For a general reaction like A \u2192 products, the rate law could be Rate = k[A]^n, where n is the order of the reaction with respect to A.\n\nNow, different orders of reactions give different relationships between concentration and time, which can be plotted in different ways to get straight lines. Let's review the common orders and their corresponding graphs:\n\n1. **Zero-order reaction** (n = 0):\n\n- Rate = k[A]^0 = k\n\n- [A] vs. time is a straight line with a negative slope.\n\n- ln[A] vs. time is a curved line.\n\n- 1/[A] vs. time is also a curved line.\n\n2. **First-order reaction** (n = 1):\n\n- Rate = k[A]\n\n- [A] vs. time is a curved line.\n\n- ln[A] vs. time is a straight line with a negative slope.\n\n- 1/[A] vs. time is a curved line.\n\n3. **Second-order reaction** (n = 2):\n\n- Rate = k[A]^2\n\n- [A] vs. time is a curved line.\n\n- ln[A] vs. time is a curved line.\n\n- 1/[A] vs. time is a straight line with a positive slope.\n\nGiven that in this problem, [A] vs. time and ln[A] vs. time are curved, and 1/[A] vs. time is a straight line, this matches the characteristics of a second-order reaction.\n\nLet's double-check this by recalling the integrated rate laws for each order:\n\n- **Zero-order**:\n\n[A] = -kt + [A]\u2080\n\n- **First-order**:\n\nln[A] = -kt + ln[A]\u2080\n\n- **Second-order**:\n\n1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]\u2080\n\nIndeed, for a second-order reaction, the plot of 1/[A] vs. time is a straight line with a slope of k.\n\nSo, based on this, the rate law should be Rate = k[A]^2.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure there aren't any tricks here. The problem says \"the graph of 1/[A] versus time and gives a straight line.\" Is there a possibility of misinterpretation?\n\nLooking back, it seems clear: [A] vs. time is curved, ln[A] vs. time is curved, and 1/[A] vs. time is straight. This is classic for a second-order reaction.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other orders or variations that could give similar graph behaviors.\n\nFor example, fractional orders or higher-order reactions might have different behaviors, but in standard kinetics, for elementary reactions, orders are typically integers from 0 to 2.\n\nGiven that, and based on the standard integrated rate laws, it's safe to conclude that this is a second-order reaction.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Rate = k[A] \u2192 This is first-order.\n\nB. Rate = k[A]^2 \u2192 This is second-order.\n\nC. Rate = k[A]^0 \u2192 This is zero-order.\n\nD. Rate = k[A]^-1 \u2192 This would be a negative first-order, which isn't a standard rate law.\n\nGiven that, the correct answer should be B. Rate = k[A]^2.\n\nBut wait, option D is Rate = k[A]^-1, which is the same as k/[A]. Is there such a thing as a reaction with a negative order?\n\nIn general chemistry, negative orders are possible in some complex reactions, but they're not common, and the integrated rate law for such a case would be different.\n\nFor a rate law Rate = k[A]^-1, the integrated rate law would be [A] = [A]\u2080 + kt, which would mean [A] increases with time, which wouldn't make sense for a reaction where A is being consumed.\n\nWait, in this case, A is turning into B, so [A] should decrease with time. If [A] = [A]\u2080 + kt, that would imply [A] increases, which contradicts the reaction A \u2192 2B.\n\nTherefore, a negative order like Rate = k[A]^-1 doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nThus, the only plausible answer is B. Rate = k[A]^2, which corresponds to a second-order reaction, matching the straight line in the 1/[A] vs. time graph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
