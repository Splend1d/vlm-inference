The widgets had to have the buyer's logo imprinted on them. The manufacturer ordered the raw material and made a new widget mold that contained buyer's logo. The buyer wanted quick delivery of at least 10,000 right away. The manufacturer rushed the order and sent 10,000 conforming widgets two days later. The buyer paid for the widgets but rejected delivery on the remaining 90,000 widgets. The manufacturer filed suit and claimed damages for breach of contract.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this contract law problem. It seems like there's a dispute between a buyer and a manufacturer over a contract to make widgets. The buyer ordered 100,000 widgets for $1,000,000, but then only took delivery of 10,000 and rejected the rest. The manufacturer sued for breach of contract, and the buyer is arguing that the contract shouldn't be enforced because it doesn't comply with the statute of frauds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the statute of frauds is. From what I recall, it's a legal rule that requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. One common trigger is contracts for the sale of goods over a certain value, which in this case seems to be $500.\n\nSo, the buyer is saying that since the contract is for over $500 and it's not in writing, it shouldn't be enforced. But the manufacturer is arguing that the buyer breached the contract.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, the statute of frauds must be enforced when it involves goods over $500.\n\nWell, that seems straightforward. If the statute of frauds applies, then oral contracts for goods over $500 aren't enforceable. But I think there might be exceptions.\n\nB. Yes, the manufacturer did not protect its interests by agreeing to an oral contract and it must pay for its bad business practices.\n\nThis seems a bit harsh. While it's always better to have contracts in writing, especially for large transactions, it might not be entirely the manufacturer's fault. Maybe the buyer pressured for an oral agreement or something.\n\nC. No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\n\nHmm, that sounds familiar. In contract law, particularly under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), there are exceptions to the statute of frauds for specially made goods.\n\nD. No, the law will enforce the \"benefit of the bargain\" rule.\n\nI'm not sure what this means exactly. Maybe it's related to damages, but it doesn't seem directly applicable to the statute of frauds issue.\n\nLet me focus on option C, since it mentions an exception for specially made goods. Under the UCC, specifically section 2-201(3), there's an exception to the statute of frauds for \"goods which are specially manufactured for the buyer and cannot be sold as standard stock items.\"\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer had to make a new widget mold containing the buyer's logo. That sounds like the goods are specially made for this particular buyer and can't be easily sold to someone else.\n\nAlso, the buyer wanted the logo imprinted on them, which suggests customization.\n\nSo, even if the original contract was oral and for goods over $500, the fact that the goods are specially made might allow the manufacturer to enforce the contract despite the statute of frauds.\n\nAdditionally, the manufacturer already delivered 10,000 widgets, and the buyer accepted and paid for them. This might indicate partial performance, which is another exception to the statute of frauds.\n\nBut focusing on the specially made goods exception, it seems like this should apply here.\n\nTherefore, the court likely wouldn't grant the motion to dismiss, because there's an exception for specially made goods.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nOption A is too broad; it doesn't consider exceptions.\n\nOption B is subjective and isn't based on legal principles.\n\nOption D is unclear and doesn't directly address the statute of frauds issue.\n\nHence, the answer should be C. No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
