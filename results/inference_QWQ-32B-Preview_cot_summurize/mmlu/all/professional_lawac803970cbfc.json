                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a debtor, a creditor, and a promissory note with a statute of limitations. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the debtor owed the creditor $12,000 under a promissory note. There's a statute of limitations that says the creditor had to file a suit to collect on the note by September 30 of last year. But the creditor didn't file by that date, which means that, generally speaking, the statute of limitations has expired, and the creditor might not be able to enforce the debt through litigation.\n\nHowever, on June 1 of this year, the debtor sends a letter to the creditor saying, \"I shall pay you $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of what I owe you.\" But the debtor doesn't make the payment on July 1. So, on August 1, the creditor sues the debtor, and the debtor raises the statute of limitations as a defense.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what the creditor's legal rights are against the debtor in this situation. There are four options:\n\nA. On June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only.\n\nB. On July 1, not June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only.\n\nC. On July 1, not June 1, the creditor will be entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $12,000.\n\nD. The creditor is not entitled to anything, on either June 1 or on July 1.\n\nAlright, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, the statute of limitations has expired because the creditor didn't file by September 30 of last year. So, normally, the creditor couldn't sue to enforce the original $12,000 debt.\n\nBut then, the debtor sends a letter offering to pay $5,000 in full satisfaction of the debt. This is interesting because it might be considered a new promise or an offer to settle the debt.\n\nIn contract law, if someone makes a new promise or offers to settle a debt after the statute of limitations has expired, and the other party relies on that, it might restart the statute of limitations or create a new obligation.\n\nHowever, in this case, the debtor didn't actually make the $5,000 payment on July 1. So, the creditor is suing now, and the debtor is raising the statute of limitations as a defense.\n\nI need to consider whether the debtor's letter constitutes a new obligation or if it has any effect on the statute of limitations.\n\nThere's a legal concept called \"revival\" of a debt, where an acknowledgment of the debt or a new promise to pay can revive the statute of limitations. But this can be tricky, and it varies by jurisdiction.\n\nIn some places, if the debtor acknowledges the debt in writing, that can restart the statute of limitations. In other places, it might require more than just an acknowledgment; it might need a new promise to pay or a partial payment.\n\nIn this scenario, the debtor's letter says, \"I shall pay you $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of what I owe you.\" This sounds like an offer to settle the debt for $5,000, which is less than the original $12,000.\n\nNow, if the debtor had paid $5,000 on July 1, that might be considered partial satisfaction, but since they didn't pay, the creditor is suing for the full amount, and the debtor is claiming the statute of limitations as a defense.\n\nI think the key here is whether the debtor's letter is enough to revive the debt or create a new obligation.\n\nIf the letter is considered a novation, where the original debt is replaced with a new agreement to pay $5,000, then perhaps the statute of limitations would start over based on the new agreement.\n\nAlternatively, if it's just an offer that wasn't accepted or acted upon, then maybe the statute of limitations remains expired.\n\nBut since the debtor didn't make the payment, and the creditor is suing, and the debtor is raising the statute of limitations, I need to see if the letter has any effect.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a written acknowledgment of debt can restart the statute of limitations. The letter here is a written communication indicating an intention to pay $5,000, which could be seen as acknowledging the debt.\n\nHowever, because the debtor didn't actually make the payment, it's unclear whether this letter is sufficient to revive the debt.\n\nOption A says that on June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment for $5,000 only. But the payment was supposed to be on July 1, and the creditor is suing on August 1. So, maybe it's more accurate to say that the entitlement arose on July 1.\n\nOption B says that on July 1, not June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment for $5,000 only. This seems plausible if the letter is considered a new promise to pay $5,000, and the date for that promise was July 1.\n\nOption C says that on July 1, the creditor will be entitled to a judgment for $12,000. But if the statute of limitations has expired, and the only thing that's happened is the letter offering to pay $5,000, it's not clear that this revives the full $12,000 debt.\n\nOption D says the creditor is not entitled to anything on either date. This could be the case if the letter doesn't revive the debt or create a new obligation.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is B: On July 1, not June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe letter is an offer to pay $5,000 in full satisfaction on July 1. If the debtor had paid on July 1, that would have been the end of the debt. Since they didn't pay, the creditor can sue for the $5,000 promised in the letter.\n\nMoreover, since the statute of limitations had expired on the original debt, the letter might be seen as creating a new obligation to pay $5,000, with the statute of limitations starting over from July 1.\n\nTherefore, the creditor's rights are limited to the $5,000 promised in the letter, and the entitlement arises on the date the payment was supposed to be made, which is July 1.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
