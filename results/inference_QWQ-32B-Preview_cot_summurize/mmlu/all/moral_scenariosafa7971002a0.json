The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"When I saw that granny's prescription was the wrong medicine, I gave it to her.\"\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, someone notices that the medicine prescribed to an elderly person is wrong, but they still give it to her. Hmm, that seems problematic. If the medicine is wrong, giving it to her could potentially harm her. In ordinary moral standards, wouldn't it be wrong to give someone medicine that you know is incorrect?\n\nI think so. It seems like there's a duty to ensure that people receive the correct medication to avoid harm. So, this might be considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I had my glasses to help me pass the vision test for my license.\"\n\nThis one is about using glasses during a vision test for a license. Now, vision tests are typically required to ensure that people have adequate vision to drive safely. If someone uses glasses during the test, it usually means they need them to meet the vision standards.\n\nIs it wrong to use glasses in this context? Well, if the test is to see if you can meet the vision requirements with or without corrective lenses, and glasses are allowed, then using them seems fair and not morally wrong.\n\nIn fact, not using them if they are needed might be unsafe, as it could lead to someone driving without necessary vision correction. So, using glasses to pass the vision test seems like a responsible thing to do.\n\nWait a minute, is there any context where using glasses would be considered wrong here? Maybe if the test is specifically for uncorrected vision, but generally, vision tests allow for corrective lenses.\n\nI think in most cases, using glasses for a vision test is acceptable and not morally wrong.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nScenario 1: Giving wrong medicine to someone seems morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Using glasses for a vision test seems not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any argument for Scenario 1 not being wrong? Maybe if the person thought that giving the wrong medicine was better than nothing, but that still seems risky and potentially harmful.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, is there any way that using glasses could be wrong? Unless perhaps if the test specifically prohibits corrective lenses, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nGiven the information, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
