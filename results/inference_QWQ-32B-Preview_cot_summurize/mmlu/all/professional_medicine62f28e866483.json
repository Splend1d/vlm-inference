                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 14-year-old boy who's been brought to the doctor because he's been feeling really sick for the past two days. He has a sore throat and a fever that gets worse in the late afternoon. And actually, he's been feeling tired for a whole week now. Oh, and he recently started having unprotected sex with one partner, which is important to note.\n\nFirst, let's list out the main symptoms:\n\n1. Sore throat\n\n2. Fever peaking in the late afternoon\n\n3. Fatigue for a week\n\n4. Cervical lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes in the neck)\n\n5. Pharyngeal erythema with creamy exudate (redness in the throat with a creamy covering)\n\nAnd some background information:\n\n- Age: 14 years old\n\n- Gender: Male\n\n- Sexual activity: Recently started having unprotected sex with one partner\n\nSo, the question is asking for the most likely diagnosis among the options given:\n\nA. Candidiasis\n\nB. Herpangina\n\nC. Infectious mononucleosis\n\nD. Mumps\n\nLet's go through each option one by one and see which one fits best with the symptoms described.\n\n**Option A: Candidiasis**\n\nCandidiasis is a fungal infection caused by Candida species, usually Candida albicans. It can affect different parts of the body, including the mouth (thrush), skin, vagina, etc.\n\nSymptoms of oral candidiasis (thrush) typically include white patches on the tongue or inside the cheeks, which can be scraped off, sometimes leaving red sores. There might be some pain or difficulty swallowing, but it's less likely to cause a sore throat with a creamy exudate as described here. Also, fever and lymphadenopathy are not common in simple oral candidiasis.\n\nMoreover, candidiasis isn't typically associated with sexual activity in this manner, although it can be transmitted sexually.\n\nSo, while possible, it doesn't seem to fit as well as some of the other options.\n\n**Option B: Herpangina**\n\nHerpangina is usually caused by Coxsackievirus and is common in children, typically between the ages of 3 and 10. It presents with small blister-like ulcers on the back of the throat, tongue, or soft palate, along with sudden fever, sore throat, and sometimes headache and nausea.\n\nThe exudate mentioned in the case might not fit perfectly with herpangina, which usually has ulcers rather than a creamy exudate. Also, herpangina doesn't typically cause significant lymphadenopathy or prolonged fatigue like what's described here.\n\nAdditionally, herpangina is usually a self-limiting illness without long-term complications, and it's not directly related to sexual activity.\n\nSo, this seems less likely.\n\n**Option C: Infectious Mononucleosis**\n\nInfectious mononucleosis, often called mono, is usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and is common in adolescents and young adults.\n\nSymptoms typically include:\n\n- Sore throat\n\n- Fever\n\n- Fatigue\n\n- Swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck\n\n- Sometimes, swollen spleen or liver involvement\n\nThe sore throat in mono is often severe and can have an exudate, similar to what's described in the case. The fever that peaks in the late afternoon or early evening is also consistent with mono.\n\nMoreover, fatigue is a hallmark of mono and can last for several weeks.\n\nRegarding the sexual activity, EBV is primarily transmitted through saliva (hence the nickname \"kissing disease\"), but it can also be transmitted through sexual contact, although it's not considered a typical sexually transmitted infection (STI). However, the fact that the patient is having unprotected sex might increase the risk of contracting EBV if he hasn't been exposed before.\n\nSo, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\n**Option D: Mumps**\n\nMumps is caused by the mumps virus and is known for causing parotitis, which is inflammation of the parotid salivary glands, leading to swelling in the cheeks and jaw area.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n- Fever\n\n- Muscle aches\n\n- Loss of appetite\n\n- Swollen parotid glands\n\n- Sore throat\n\nHowever, mumps doesn't typically cause cervical lymphadenopathy or a creamy exudate in the throat like what's described here. Also, mumps is less common now due to vaccination, but it's still possible.\n\nFurthermore, mumps can be transmitted through saliva and respiratory droplets, and it can be acquired through sexual contact as well, but it's not as strongly associated with sexual activity as some other infections.\n\nComparing to mono, mumps seems less likely given the symptoms.\n\n**Comparing Options**\n\nBetween candidiasis, herpangina, infectious mononucleosis, and mumps, infectious mononucleosis seems to fit the symptoms best.\n\nThe sore throat with exudate, fever peaking in the late afternoon, fatigue, and cervical lymphadenopathy are all classic signs of mono. Additionally, the patient's age and recent initiation of sexual activity (which could involve exposure to saliva) make it a likely diagnosis.\n\nWhile candidiasis and herpangina are possible, they don't match the symptom profile as well as mono does. Mumps could be a consideration, but the specific symptoms described align more closely with mono.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is infectious mononucleosis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
