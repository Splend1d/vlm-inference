                    "text": "So I've got this question about double-slit interference, and I need to figure out which change would increase the widths of the fringes on the screen. Let's see what options I have:\n\nA. Use light of a shorter wavelength.\n\nB. Move the screen closer to the slits.\n\nC. Move the slits closer together.\n\nD. Use light with a lower wave speed.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the fringe width in a double-slit experiment is determined. I remember that the fringe width (\u03b2) is given by the formula:\n\n\u03b2 = (D * \u03bb) / d\n\nWhere:\n\n- D is the distance between the slits and the screen.\n\n- \u03bb is the wavelength of the light.\n\n- d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nSo, the fringe width is directly proportional to the wavelength (\u03bb) and the distance from the slits to the screen (D), and inversely proportional to the slit separation (d).\n\nLet's analyze each option one by one:\n\nA. Use light of a shorter wavelength.\n\nAccording to the formula, \u03b2 is directly proportional to \u03bb. So, if \u03bb decreases (shorter wavelength), \u03b2 should also decrease. That means the fringes would become narrower, not wider. So, this option would not increase the fringe widths.\n\nB. Move the screen closer to the slits.\n\nIn this case, D decreases. Since \u03b2 is directly proportional to D, decreasing D should decrease \u03b2, leading to narrower fringes. Again, this doesn't help in increasing the fringe widths.\n\nC. Move the slits closer together.\n\nHere, d decreases. According to the formula, \u03b2 is inversely proportional to d. So, if d decreases, \u03b2 increases. That means the fringes would become wider. This seems like a possible answer.\n\nD. Use light with a lower wave speed.\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. I know that wave speed (v) is related to frequency (f) and wavelength (\u03bb) by the equation v = f * \u03bb. In a double-slit experiment, the medium between the slits and the screen is usually air, and the speed of light in air is more or less constant. However, if we consider light traveling through a medium with a higher refractive index, its speed would decrease, and its wavelength would also decrease proportionally, assuming the frequency remains the same.\n\nWait a minute, if v = f * \u03bb, and f remains constant, then decreasing v would require decreasing \u03bb proportionally. So, if \u03bb decreases, according to the formula, \u03b2 would decrease, leading to narrower fringes.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps the question is considering light with a lower wave speed but the same wavelength as in air. In that case, the wavelength in the new medium would be different. Let me think about this.\n\nSuppose we have light with wavelength \u03bb in vacuum, and it enters a medium with refractive index n, so its wavelength becomes \u03bb' = \u03bb / n. If we use this light in the double-slit experiment, then \u03b2 = (D * \u03bb') / d = (D * \u03bb / n) / d.\n\nComparing this to the original fringe width in air, \u03b2_air = (D * \u03bb) / d, the new fringe width would be \u03b2 = \u03b2_air / n.\n\nSince n > 1 for any medium other than vacuum, \u03b2 would be smaller than \u03b2_air. So, using light with a lower wave speed (higher n) would actually decrease the fringe width, leading to narrower fringes.\n\nTherefore, this option would not increase the fringe widths.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, only option C seems to increase the fringe widths.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that I'm not missing anything. Let's double-check.\n\nOption A: shorter wavelength decreases \u03b2.\n\nOption B: smaller D decreases \u03b2.\n\nOption C: smaller d increases \u03b2.\n\nOption D: lower wave speed likely means smaller \u03bb, which decreases \u03b2.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C: Move the slits closer together.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\n"
