                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about religious movements and their views on holy images, based on some passages from the 8th century. The question is asking which of the options\u2014Sunni Islam, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, or Jainism\u2014was ideologically opposed to the use of holy images as reflected in these passages.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the passages are saying about holy images. From Source 1 by John of Damascus, it seems that holy images are seen as important for teaching and understanding, especially for those who can't read. He compares images to words for the illiterate, suggesting that they help convey religious messages visually.\n\nSource 2 from the Second Council of Nicaea emphasizes the importance of images in showing the incarnation of the Word of God as real, not just imaginary. It also mentions that images have mutual indications and significations, which likely means they are symbolic and carry deeper meanings.\n\nSo, both sources are strongly in favor of using holy images in religion, seeing them as essential tools for teaching and reinforcing the faith.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of the given religious movements would have been opposed to this view. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Sunni Islam: I know that Islam, particularly Sunni Islam, has historically had reservations about depicting living beings, especially prophets and religious figures, due to concerns about idolatry. This is based on certain interpretations of the Quran and Hadith, which discourage the creation of graven images that could be worshipped instead of God. So, Sunni Islam might be opposed to the use of holy images in religion.\n\nB. Buddhism: Buddhism has a rich tradition of religious art, including statues of the Buddha, bodhisattvas, and other figures. These images are used for veneration and meditation, so Buddhism generally accepts and even encourages the use of religious images. Therefore, it's unlikely that Buddhism would be opposed to the sentiments in the passages.\n\nC. Zoroastrianism: Zoroastrianism is an ancient Persian religion that predates Islam and has its own traditions. I'm not entirely sure about their stance on religious images, but I believe that Zoroastrianism does not prohibit images and may have used symbols and icons in their religious practices. So, they might not be opposed to holy images.\n\nD. Jainism: Jainism is an Indian religion that emphasizes non-violence and the equality of all living beings. I don't recall any specific prohibition against religious images in Jainism. In fact, Jain temples often contain statues of Tirthankaras and other spiritual figures, which are worshipped by devotees. So, Jainism seems to accept religious images.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Sunni Islam is the most likely candidate to be ideologically opposed to the use of holy images, based on the general prohibition against depicting living beings in religious art.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if other options might also be opposed to religious images. For example, in Buddhism, there are different schools, and perhaps some branches might have objections to images. However, overall, Buddhism is known for its rich iconography.\n\nSimilarly, in Zoroastrianism, while I think images were used, I'm not entirely sure about their stance. Maybe I should look that up.\n\nAlso, in Jainism, while images are used, perhaps there are sects that are more iconoclastic.\n\nBut based on my general knowledge, Sunni Islam stands out as the most likely to be opposed to holy images.\n\nAdditionally, considering the time period of the sources\u2014around the 8th century CE\u2014this was a time when Islam was expanding and encountering other religions, including Christianity, which used images. The iconoclastic controversies in Christianity during this period might have been influenced by Islamic views on images, although that's a complex historical topic.\n\nIn any case, given the options provided, Sunni Islam seems to be the most ideologically opposed to the use of holy images as described in the passages.\n\nSo, my answer would be A. Sunni Islam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
