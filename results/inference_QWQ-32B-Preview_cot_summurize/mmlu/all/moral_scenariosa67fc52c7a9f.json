I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"When no one was looking, I spit on the cake.\"\n\nOkay, spitting on food, especially something like a cake that might be served to others, seems pretty nasty. It's unhygienic and could make people sick if they eat it. Also, it's a deliberate act of contamination, which is not okay. So, I think this is clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I was careful not to overfeed the baby so that he didn't get sick.\"\n\nThis seems responsible and caring. Making sure a baby doesn't eat too much to prevent sickness is a good thing. It shows attention to the baby's well-being, which is what caregivers should do. So, this doesn't seem morally wrong at all.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. So, the correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might view Scenario 2 as wrong. For example, maybe someone thinks that not feeding the baby enough is bad, but in this case, the person is being careful not to overfeed, which is different from underfeeding. Overfeeding can lead to health problems, so preventing that seems like a positive action.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that B is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
