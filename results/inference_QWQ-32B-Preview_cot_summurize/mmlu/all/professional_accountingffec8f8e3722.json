                    "text": "So Skytop Co., which is a nonprofit, is thinking about buying a machine that costs $80,000. This machine will give them $25,000 in cash every year for four years. They use a 10% cost of capital to evaluate such projects. We have some present and future value tables here, and we need to decide whether they should acquire the machine or not, and choose the right reason from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. They're giving me cash inflows over four years and the initial cost, and I need to see if the project is worthwhile based on the net present value or something similar.\n\nLet me list out the cash flows:\n\n- Initial outlay: -$80,000\n\n- Annual cash inflows: $25,000 for four years\n\nThe cost of capital is 10%, and we have present value factors for $1 and for an ordinary annuity.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the project. NPV is the sum of the present values of all cash inflows minus the initial investment.\n\nFrom the table, the present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% is $3.170. Since the annual cash inflow is $25,000, the present value of these inflows would be $25,000 multiplied by 3.170.\n\nSo, PV of inflows = $25,000 * 3.170 = $79,250\n\nNow, the initial outlay is $80,000, so NPV = PV of inflows - initial outlay = $79,250 - $80,000 = -$750\n\nA negative NPV means the project's return is less than the cost of capital, so it shouldn't be accepted.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, net cash flow is $20,000\n\nWait, net cash flow isn't considered in NPV analysis in this way. The total cash inflows over four years would be $25,000 * 4 = $100,000, minus the initial $80,000, which is $20,000. But that doesn't consider the time value of money, which is what NPV does.\n\nB. Yes, net future value is $36,025\n\nI'm not sure what net future value is in this context. Maybe it's the future value of the inflows minus the future value of the outlay. But let's check.\n\nFuture value of inflows: $25,000 * future value factor for an ordinary annuity, which is 4.641, so $25,000 * 4.641 = $116,025\n\nFuture value of outlay: $80,000 * future value of $1 for 4 years at 10%, which is $80,000 * 1.464 = $117,120\n\nSo, net future value would be $116,025 - $117,120 = -$1,095\n\nThat's negative, so the project shouldn't be accepted based on this. But the option says yes with $36,025, which doesn't match my calculation.\n\nC. No, net present value is ($750)\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nD. No, net present value is ($8,750)\n\nThat doesn't match my calculation.\n\nSo, it seems like C is the correct answer. But let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to use the present value of the inflows and compare it to the outlay. I already did that and got NPV = -$750, which is option C.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the internal rate of return (IRR) to see if it's above or below the cost of capital.\n\nThe IRR is the discount rate where NPV = 0.\n\nSo, set up the equation:\n\n$25,000 * PV annuity factor - $80,000 = 0\n\nPV annuity factor = $80,000 / $25,000 = 3.2\n\nLooking at the present value of $1 ordinary annuity table, at 10% it's 3.170, and at 9% it's 3.239 (I think, but it's not in the table).\n\nSince 3.2 is between 9% and 10%, the IRR would be between 9% and 10%. Since the cost of capital is 10%, the IRR is less than that, so the project should be rejected.\n\nThis again supports option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect us to use the net future value, but my calculation shows a negative net future value, which would suggest not acquiring the machine, but option B says yes with a positive value, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the net cash flow without discounting, which would be $20,000, as in option A, but that doesn't consider the time value of money, which is important in discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my NPV calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the PV of inflows.\n\nPV factor for 4 years at 10% is 0.683, but that's for a single payment. Since we have an annuity, we should use the PV annuity factor, which is 3.170.\n\nSo, $25,000 * 3.170 = $79,250\n\nNPV = $79,250 - $80,000 = -$750\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect us to calculate the NPV differently.\n\nWait, perhaps they want us to consider the present value of each cash flow separately.\n\nYear 0: -$80,000\n\nYear 1: $25,000 * 0.909 (PV factor for 1 year) = $22,725\n\nYear 2: $25,000 * 0.826 = $20,650\n\nYear 3: $25,000 * 0.751 = $18,775\n\nYear 4: $25,000 * 0.683 = $17,075\n\nTotal PV of inflows = $22,725 + $20,650 + $18,775 + $17,075 = $79,225\n\nNPV = $79,225 - $80,000 = -$775\n\nClose to my earlier calculation of -$750, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they use a different PV annuity factor, but the table provides 3.170, which is what I used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they expect us to use the future value approach, but as I calculated earlier, the net future value is negative, which doesn't align with option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the net cash flow without discounting, which is $20,000, but that's not a proper discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the table provided. Let me check the PV annuity factor for 4 years at 10%. Yes, it's 3.170, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect us to use the present value of each cash flow individually, but I already did that and got a similar NPV of -$775.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the machine has no residual value, which is already assumed in the ordinary annuity calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to see if the payback period is acceptable, but that's not mentioned in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to calculate the profitability index or something else, but the question specifies based on discounted cash flows at 10% per year, which suggests NPV is the primary metric.\n\nGiven that, and my calculation of NPV being negative $750, I think the correct answer is C: No, net present value is ($750).\n\nOption D has NPV as ($8,750), which doesn't match my calculation, so I think C is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nc"
