The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage.\nB. Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Military action always results from a failure of negotiations and from a shift from the diplomatic to the military sphere.\nC. The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed.\nD. The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.\n"

This seems to suggest a sequential approach where limited force is used first, and if that doesn't work, full-scale force is employed. However, it doesn't clearly define what limited force and full-scale force are, just that there's a sequence in their application.\n\nOption B states that the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible and that resort to air or sea power is equal to a conventional ground offensive in terms of coercive capacity. It also says that military action always results from failed negotiations and a shift from diplomacy to military means. This option seems to downplay the distinction between different levels of force, suggesting that any military action is a failure of diplomacy and that different types of military action are equally coercive.\n\nOption C proposes that the distinction is important because the amount of force used determines the type of outcome achieved. It suggests that if a positive policy outcome is achieved, limited force was employed. This seems to link the effectiveness of the force used to the outcome, implying that limited force is proportional to achieving the desired policy without escalating to full-scale war.\n\nOption D emphasizes that the distinction is crucial because resort to brute force means diplomacy has failed. It states that the distinction isn't based on the amount or type of force but on the purpose and the element of choice left to the adversary. It defines limited force as a bargaining tool, implying that it's used to influence the adversary's decisions without completely defeating them.\n\nLet me think about this. Coercive diplomacy is about using the threat of force to get the adversary to comply with your demands. Limited force would be a measured use of military power to signal intent and increase pressure without fully engaging in war. Full-scale force or brute force would be a total military engagement aimed at defeating the adversary.\n\nOption A seems to view it as a step-by-step process, but it doesn't clearly define the distinction. Option B downplays the distinction, which doesn't seem right because in practice, there is a significant difference between a surgical strike and a full-blown invasion.\n\nOption C links the type of force to the outcome, which makes sense, but it might be too simplistic. Not all uses of limited force lead to positive outcomes, and sometimes full-scale force might be necessary to achieve certain goals.\n\nOption D seems the most comprehensive. It suggests that the distinction isn't about the scale or type of force but about the purpose and the impact on the adversary's decision-making. Limited force is used to influence their choices without forcing total submission, whereas brute force is used when diplomacy has failed and complete defeat is sought.\n\nI think Option D best captures the essence of the distinction between limited force and full-scale force in coercive diplomacy. It aligns with the idea that limited force is a tool in the bargaining process, allowing the adversary some room to choose to comply or face further escalation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
