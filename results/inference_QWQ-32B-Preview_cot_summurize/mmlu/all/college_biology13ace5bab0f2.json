                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this theory about asthma attacks after thunderstorms. It says that pollen grains, which are 5 microns and too big to enter airways, release smaller starch granules when exposed to water during a thunderstorm. These starch granules can enter the lower airways and cause asthma attacks. The key here is osmotic shock.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what osmotic shock is. Osmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration. Osmotic shock occurs when a cell is placed in a solution that has a different osmotic pressure than its interior, causing the cell to either swell or shrink.\n\nIn this case, pollen grains are exposed to water during a thunderstorm. So, if there's a lot of water outside the pollen grain, and the inside has more solutes, water would move into the grain, potentially causing it to swell or even burst.\n\nOption A says: \"The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\" Hypotonic means that the solution has a lower osmotic pressure, so water would move into the pollen grain. But if the interior is hypotonic, that means the outside is hypertonic, which wouldn't cause the grain to take in water. Wait, no, hypotonic means the interior has less solutes, so water would move in from the higher solute outside. But in this case, during a thunderstorm, there's a lot of water outside, so maybe the outside is hypotonic.\n\nOption B says: \"The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\" Higher osmotic pressure inside would mean that the interior has higher solute concentration, so water would move into the grain, potentially causing it to burst.\n\nOption C says: \"The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\" Plasmolysis is when a cell loses water and the plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall. But if the pollen grain is taking in water, it would be the opposite, possibly cytolysis.\n\nOption D says: \"The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\" Shrinking would suggest water leaving the grain, but in a thunderstorm, water is abundant outside.\n\nLet me think again. During a thunderstorm, there's a lot of water in the air and on the ground. Pollen grains are exposed to this water. If the pollen grains have a higher solute concentration inside, water would move in, increasing the internal pressure until the grain bursts, releasing the starch granules.\n\nSo, if the interior has a higher osmotic pressure, that matches option B.\n\nBut wait, if the interior has higher osmotic pressure, that means it has higher solute concentration, so water moves in. That makes sense for the grain to swell and possibly burst.\n\nOption A says the interior is hypotonic, meaning less solutes inside, so water would move in, but that would also cause swelling and possible rupture. But according to the answer, that's not correct.\n\nMaybe I need to consider what actually happens in osmotic shock. If the pollen grain is in a hypotonic external environment (lots of water, few solutes), water moves into the grain, increasing internal pressure, leading to lysis.\n\nSo, in this case, the external environment is hypotonic compared to the pollen grain's interior.\n\nWait, no. If the external environment has more water, it's hypotonic to the grain, assuming the grain has higher solute concentration.\n\nSo, external hypotonic to internal, water moves in, causing swelling and potential rupture.\n\nBut option A says the interior is hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment. That would mean the interior has less solutes, which doesn't make sense for osmotic shock leading to rupture.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing hypotonic and hypertonic.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- Hypotonic: solution with lower osmotic pressure, more water.\n\n- Hypertonic: solution with higher osmotic pressure, more solutes.\n\nSo, if the external environment is hypotonic (more water, less solutes) compared to the pollen grain's interior, water will move into the grain, causing it to swell and possibly rupture.\n\nTherefore, the interior of the pollen grain has a higher osmotic pressure than the surrounding environment.\n\nThat matches option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests the interior is hypotonic, meaning less solutes, which wouldn't lead to water influx and rupture.\n\nOption C, plasmolysis, is when the plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall due to water loss, which is the opposite of what's happening here.\n\nOption D says the pollen grains underwent shrinking before rupturing, but actually, they're taking in water and swelling before bursting.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is option B: The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
