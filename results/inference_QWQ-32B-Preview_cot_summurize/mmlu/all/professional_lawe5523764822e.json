                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out what happens when a grantor conveys her mansion and property to her nephew \"for life, remainder after (the nephew's) death to his heirs.\" Then, two years later, the nephew tries to sell the property to his brother, but the brother backs out, saying the nephew can't convey a fee simple. The jurisdiction has abolished the Rule in Shelley's Case, and I need to decide whether the nephew's prayer for specific performance would be granted or denied. The options are a bit confusing, so let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the original conveyance means. The grantor gave the property to her nephew \"for life, remainder after (the nephew's) death to his heirs.\" So, the nephew has a life estate, meaning he owns the property for his lifetime, and after he dies, the property goes to his heirs. Now, the Rule in Shelley's Case is abolished here, which is important because that rule used to merge certain interests in land, but since it's abolished, maybe that changes things.\n\nNext, the nephew tries to sell the property to his brother in a fee simple absolute, which means complete ownership with no limitations. But the brother says he can't do that because the nephew only has a life estate, not a fee simple. So, the nephew is probably suing for specific performance, which would force the brother to go through with the sale.\n\nOption A says the prayer would be denied because the Rule wouldn't be triggered, creating only a life estate in the nephew. Wait, but the Rule is abolished, so it's not being triggered anyway. So, the nephew only has a life estate, and can't convey a fee simple, which is what the brother is arguing. So, maybe the court would deny specific performance because the nephew can't deliver what he promised.\n\nOption B says it would be granted because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. The remainder is to his heirs after his death, but the nephew is trying to sell the property now. His heirs aren't determined yet; they're only identified at his death. So, I don't think the remainder becomes a vested fee simple in the heirs now.\n\nOption C says it would be granted because the nephew's heirs receive a vested indefeasible interest in the property. Again, the heirs aren't known yet, and the interest is remainderman's interest, which is contingent on the nephew's death. So, it's not a vested interest now.\n\nOption D says it would be denied because under the Doctrine of Worthier Title, at the termination of the nephew's life estate, the grantor has a reversionary interest. Now, the Doctrine of Worthier Title is related to who gets the property after the life estate ends. Normally, in a conveyance like this, the grantor has a reversionary interest, meaning after the life estate ends, the property reverts back to the grantor or the grantor's heirs, not necessarily to the nephew's heirs. But in this case, the conveyance specifies \"remainder after (the nephew's) death to his heirs,\" which might override the Doctrine of Worthier Title.\n\nWait, but the Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished, which might affect this. Normally, the Rule would merge the fee simple in the grantee, but since it's abolished, maybe the Doctrine of Worthier Title applies differently.\n\nLet me try to think differently. The grantor conveyed the property to the nephew for life, with a remainder to the nephew's heirs. Since the Rule in Shelley's Case is abolished, perhaps the remainder to the heirs is treated separately from the life estate, and the nephew can't convey more than his life estate.\n\nIn that case, the nephew can't convey a fee simple absolute to his brother because he only owns a life estate. So, if he tries to sell a fee simple, he can't deliver it, and the brother is right in backing out.\n\nTherefore, the court would likely deny specific performance because the nephew can't perform the condition of conveying a fee simple absolute; he can only convey his life estate.\n\nLooking back at the options, Option A says denied because the Rule wouldn't be triggered, creating only a life estate in the nephew. That seems correct because the Rule is abolished, so it doesn't merge any interests, and the nephew only has a life estate.\n\nOption B says granted because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs. That doesn't make sense because the heirs aren't determined yet, and the remainder is still contingent.\n\nOption C says granted because the nephew's heirs receive a vested indefeasible interest. Again, the heirs' interest is contingent and not vested yet.\n\nOption D says denied because of the Doctrine of Worthier Title, with the grantor having a reversionary interest. But in this conveyance, the grantor has already given the remainder to the nephew's heirs, so maybe the reversionary interest doesn't apply here.\n\nI think Option A is the correct answer: the prayer would be denied because the Rule wouldn't be triggered, thus creating only a life estate in the nephew.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
