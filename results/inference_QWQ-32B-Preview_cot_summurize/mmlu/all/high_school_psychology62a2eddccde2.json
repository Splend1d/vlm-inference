The question is: \"According to Erikson, those who look back at the end of their lives with regrets and the feeling that their lives have lacked fulfillment evidence unsuccessful resolution of the challenge of...\" and then it gives options A through D.\n\nSo, I need to recall Erikson's stages and what each one is about, especially focusing on the later stages of life since it's about looking back at the end of their lives.\n\nErikson proposed eight stages of psychosocial development, each with its own challenge that people must resolve to move forward successfully. The stages are:\n\n1. Trust vs. Mistrust (infancy)\n\n2. Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt (toddlerhood)\n\n3. Initiative vs. Guilt (preschool)\n\n4. Industry vs. Inferiority (school age)\n\n5. Identity vs. Role Confusion (adolescence)\n\n6. Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adulthood)\n\n7. Generativity vs. Stagnation (middle adulthood)\n\n8. Integrity vs. Despair (late adulthood)\n\nThe question is talking about people looking back on their lives towards the end, so it's likely referring to the last stage, which is Integrity vs. Despair.\n\nIn the Integrity vs. Despair stage, according to Erikson, individuals reflect on their lives and either achieve a sense of fulfillment and wisdom (integrity) or feel that their life has been unfulfilling and filled with regret (despair).\n\nSo, if someone looks back with regrets and feels that their life lacked fulfillment, that would indicate they didn't resolve the Integrity vs. Despair challenge successfully.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Intimacy vs. Isolation\n\nThis is the stage in young adulthood where people seek close relationships and intimacy. Unsuccessful resolution here might lead to feelings of isolation, but it's not directly about looking back on life with regrets.\n\nB. Identity vs. Role Confusion\n\nThis is the adolescent stage where individuals struggle to form a sense of identity. Again, while important, it's not specifically about the reflection at the end of life.\n\nC. Integrity vs. Despair\n\nThis matches what I just explained. It's about the reflection on one's life in late adulthood.\n\nD. Generativity vs. Stagnation\n\nThis is the stage in middle adulthood where people focus on contributing to the next generation, whether through career, family, or community. Unsuccessful resolution might lead to feelings of stagnation or lack of productivity, but it's not specifically about the retrospective feelings of regret and fulfillment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Integrity versus Despair.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider why the other options don't fit:\n\n- Intimacy vs. Isolation is about relationships in young adulthood.\n\n- Identity vs. Role Confusion is about finding one's identity in adolescence.\n\n- Generativity vs. Stagnation is about contributing to society and feeling productive in middle adulthood.\n\nOnly Integrity vs. Despair deals with the reflection on one's life as one approaches the end of their life span, which aligns with the description in the question.\n\nSo, I'm confident that C is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
