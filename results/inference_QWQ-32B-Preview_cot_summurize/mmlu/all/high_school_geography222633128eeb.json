                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which type of city model has a distinct residential spine that extends outward from the center city along the main boulevard. The options are European, Muslim, Sub-Saharan African, and Latin American. I'm not super familiar with all these city models, so I need to think this through.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a \"residential spine\" means. It sounds like a main strip or axis where residential areas are built, extending out from the city center along a main boulevard. So, it's like a linear development pattern where homes are arranged along a central road leading away from the downtown area.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with European city models. European cities are known for their historic centers, often with a grid pattern or organic growth based on medieval layouts. Many European cities have radiating avenues from a central point, like Paris with its boulevards extending from the Arc de Triomphe. However, these avenues often have a mix of residential, commercial, and cultural uses, not necessarily a distinct residential spine.\n\nNext, Muslim city models. Islamic cities often have a central mosque or medina, with streets radiating out or organizing around it. The layout can be more organic and less planned than some other models. I'm not sure if there's a specific tradition of a residential spine along a main boulevard in Muslim city planning.\n\nSub-Saharan African city models might have their own unique characteristics, often influenced by colonial planning or traditional settlement patterns. I don't know much about this, but I'll keep it in mind.\n\nFinally, Latin American city models. Many Latin American cities were founded during the colonial period and often follow a grid pattern with a central plaza. As cities grew, expansion might have followed main avenues leading out from the center. Maybe in some Latin American cities, there are distinct residential areas developing along these main boulevards.\n\nWait, I remember that in some Latin American cities, like Buenos Aires, there are wide boulevards with residential areas developing along them. For example, Avenida Cabildo or Avenida de Mayo in Buenos Aires have both commercial and residential buildings along them.\n\nBut I need to think about whether this is a common feature across Latin American cities or if it's more specific to certain places.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is Sub-Saharan African city models. I recall that in some African cities, especially those that grew around trade routes, there might be a main street or boulevard with residential areas developing along it.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should look up some examples.\n\nLet me think about European cities again. In many European cities, especially those planned in the baroque period, like Vienna or St. Petersburg, there are grand boulevards with important buildings and residences along them. But again, these often mix residential and other functions.\n\nMaybe the term \"residential spine\" is more specific to certain city planning traditions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's related to the \"finger plan\" or linear expansion along transportation corridors.\n\nLet me consider the Latin American context more deeply. In many Latin American cities, the expansion has followed major thoroughfares, with residential areas developing along these roads. For example, in Mexico City, there are major avenues like Paseo de la Reforma where you can find both residential and commercial developments.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure if this is unique to Latin American cities or if it's a common feature in other parts of the world as well.\n\nMaybe I should consider the concept of \"linear cities\" or \"axial cities,\" where development follows a main axis or spine.\n\nIn some Muslim cities, like Isfahan in Iran, there are long boulevards with important buildings and residences along them, such as the Naqsh-e Jahan Square. But again, this seems more about the arrangement of public buildings rather than a distinct residential spine.\n\nPerhaps Sub-Saharan African cities have a tradition of linear development along main roads due to colonial planning or geographical constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a specific type of urban form that is more characteristic of one of these regions.\n\nI think I need to make an educated guess here. Given that Latin American cities often have wide boulevards radiating from the central plaza, and residential areas have developed along these boulevards as cities expanded, I'm going to go with D. Latin American.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this. Maybe I should look up some urban planning literature or city examples to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is A. European, considering the baroque city planning traditions.\n\nHowever, I think I'll stick with D. Latin American for now.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
