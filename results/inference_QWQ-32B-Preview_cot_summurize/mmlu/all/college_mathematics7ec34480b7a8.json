Then, \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} s_n t_n = st\\).\n\nThis statement is about the limit of the product of two sequences of complex numbers. In real analysis, we have a similar theorem for real sequences: if two sequences converge, then their product converges to the product of their limits. The same principle extends to complex sequences.\n\nIn complex analysis, the limit laws for sequences are analogous to those in real analysis. Specifically, if \\(\\{s_n\\}\\) converges to \\(s\\) and \\(\\{t_n\\}\\) converges to \\(t\\), then \\(\\{s_n + t_n\\}\\) converges to \\(s + t\\), \\(\\{s_n t_n\\}\\) converges to \\(st\\), and if \\(t \\neq 0\\), \\(\\{s_n / t_n\\}\\) converges to \\(s / t\\), provided that \\(t_n \\neq 0\\) for all \\(n\\) sufficiently large.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** There exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence.\n\nThis statement is about sequences in real analysis, specifically concerning bounded sequences and their subsequences.\n\nIn real analysis, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem states that every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence. This is a fundamental result in real analysis and is often used to establish the compactness of closed and bounded intervals in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nGiven this theorem, Statement 2 contradicts the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct choice is:\n\n**B. True, False**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
