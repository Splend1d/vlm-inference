Sustainability is a big deal these days, and it's important to understand what it really means.\n\nFirst, option A says sustainability is the short-term maintenance of systems according to environmental, economic, and social considerations. Hmm, but I've always heard that sustainability is about the long term, right? Like, ensuring that our actions today don't harm future generations. So, the \"short-term\" part here seems off.\n\nOption B says it's the long-term maintenance of processes according to environmental, economic, and cultural considerations. This one switches \"systems\" to \"processes\" and includes \"cultural\" instead of \"social\" considerations. I think sustainability encompasses social considerations, not just cultural ones. Also, is it more about systems or processes? Maybe both, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption C is similar to A, but it replaces \"environmental, economic, and social considerations\" with \"environmental, political, and social considerations.\" So, it's trading economic for political. But sustainability typically includes economic factors because economic viability is crucial for maintaining environmental and social health over the long term.\n\nOption D says it's the long-term maintenance of systems according to environmental, economic, and social considerations. This seems to hit all the right notes: long-term focus, systems approach, and considering environment, economy, and society.\n\nLet me think about this more deeply. The concept of sustainability is often linked to the idea of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. That definitely sounds like a long-term perspective.\n\nAlso, the three main pillars of sustainability are often cited as environmental, economic, and social sustainability. So, having all three of these considerations is important.\n\nNow, between options B and D, B includes \"cultural considerations\" instead of \"social considerations.\" While culture is an important aspect of social considerations, I think social considerations encompass more than just culture. Social sustainability would include things like equity, health, education, and community well-being, not just cultural aspects.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most comprehensive and accurate definition among the choices given.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be less suitable.\n\nOption A's short-term focus is inconsistent with the long-term nature of sustainability. We're not just maintaining systems for a little while; we're thinking about sustaining them indefinitely.\n\nOption C again has the short-term focus and replaces economic with political considerations. While politics can influence sustainability, the economic aspect is fundamental because it drives many of the decisions and actions that affect the environment and society.\n\nOption B's inclusion of cultural considerations is good, but as I mentioned, social considerations are broader and more inclusive.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe option D is the best answer: Sustainability can broadly be defined as the long-term maintenance of systems according to environmental, economic, and social considerations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
