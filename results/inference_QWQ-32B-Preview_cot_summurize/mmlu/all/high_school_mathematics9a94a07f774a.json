                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Bob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning. The die has numbers 1 through 6. Among these, 1 is neither prime nor composite, 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers, and 4 and 6 are composite numbers.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n- If Bob rolls a composite number (4 or 6), he eats sweetened cereal.\n\n- If he rolls a prime number (2, 3, or 5), he eats unsweetened cereal.\n\n- If he rolls a 1, he rolls again.\n\nWe need to find out the expected number of times Bob will roll his die in a non-leap year.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"expected value\" means in this context. Expected value is a measure of the average result if an experiment is repeated many times. It's calculated by summing all possible values, each multiplied by the probability of occurrence.\n\nIn this problem, the experiment is Bob rolling the die each morning, with the possibility of rolling again if he gets a 1.\n\nLet's denote the expected number of rolls per morning as E.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible outcomes of a single roll:\n\n- With probability 1/6, Bob rolls a 1 and has to roll again. So, in this case, he has already rolled once, and he expects to roll E more times. Therefore, the total expected rolls in this case are 1 + E.\n\n- With probability 4/6 (rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6), Bob stops rolling after the first roll. So, the expected rolls here are just 1.\n\nWait a minute, but according to the problem, 1 is the only number that makes him roll again. So, rolling any other number (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) makes him stop. Therefore, the probability of stopping after the first roll is 5/6, and the probability of rolling again is 1/6.\n\nSo, the expected number of rolls E can be expressed as:\n\nE = (1/6) * (1 + E) + (5/6) * 1\n\nThis equation says: there's a 1/6 chance that he rolls a 1 and has to roll again, adding one roll to the expected number of rolls, and a 5/6 chance that he rolls something else and stops after one roll.\n\nNow, let's solve for E:\n\nE = (1/6)(1 + E) + (5/6)(1)\n\nE = (1/6) + (1/6)E + 5/6\n\nE = (1/6 + 5/6) + (1/6)E\n\nE = 1 + (1/6)E\n\nNow, subtract (1/6)E from both sides:\n\nE - (1/6)E = 1\n\n(5/6)E = 1\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 6/5:\n\nE = 6/5\n\nSo, the expected number of rolls per morning is 6/5.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many mornings there are in a non-leap year. A non-leap year has 365 days.\n\nTherefore, the total expected number of rolls in a non-leap year is:\n\nTotal Expected Rolls = 365 * E = 365 * (6/5)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n365 * (6/5) = (365 * 6) / 5 = 2190 / 5 = 438\n\nSo, the expected number of times Bob will roll his die in a non-leap year is 438.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 5/8\n\nB. 1825/4\n\nC. 5/4\n\nD. 438\n\nThe correct answer is D. 438.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{438} \\]"
