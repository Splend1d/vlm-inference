                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a litigation where the Secretary of Commerce tried to stop someone from sending advertising brochures through the mail because they contained obscene photographs and sexually suggestive language. The Secretary was acting based on Section 1123(b) of a state statute that allowed him to prohibit such mailings if they were inappropriate for minors.\n\nThe case went to the highest court in the state, and that court held that the statute was unconstitutional, violating both the commerce clause and the supremacy clause. Now, the question is about how this case would reach the U.S. Supreme Court if it's reviewed there.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. by appeal.\n\nB. by certiorari.\n\nC. if five justices vote to review it.\n\nD. despite the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between appeal and certiorari. In the U.S. legal system, the Supreme Court is primarily an appellate court, but it doesn't have to hear every appeal that comes its way. Instead, it has discretion over which cases it wants to review, and it uses a process called certiorari to select cases.\n\nSo, typically, cases reach the Supreme Court not by automatic appeal, but by the Court granting certiorari, which is like permission to hear the case. That means option A, \"by appeal,\" is probably not correct.\n\nOption B, \"by certiorari,\" seems more accurate because that's how the Supreme Court usually accepts cases for review.\n\nOption C says, \"if five justices vote to review it.\" Well, that's part of the process for granting certiorari. The Supreme Court has a rule that at least four justices need to vote to grant certiorari for a case to be heard. So, if five justices vote to review it, that would certainly meet that threshold. But the question is about how the case reaches the Court, which seems more directly related to certiorari than to the specific number of votes.\n\nOption D says, \"despite the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds.\" This refers to a principle in Supreme Court practice where if a state court decides a case based on an independent and adequate state ground, the Supreme Court will not review the federal issues in the case. However, sometimes the Supreme Court might still choose to review a case even if there are adequate and independent state grounds, but that seems tangential to how the case reaches the Court.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the most direct answer is B, \"by certiorari.\" The Supreme Court doesn't automatically hear appeals from state courts; it selects which cases to hear through certiorari.\n\nBut let's think about the context. The state court held that the statute was unconstitutional under both the commerce clause and the supremacy clause, which are federal issues. So, there are federal questions involved here.\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, the Supreme Court has mandatory jurisdiction over state court decisions that involve federal questions and have been reviewed by the state's highest court. However, even in those cases, the Supreme Court can exercise discretion and choose not to hear the case.\n\nBut in practice, for most state court decisions involving federal questions, the Supreme Court reviews them by certiorari.\n\nWait, actually, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, the Supreme Court has discretionary review of state court decisions involving federal questions. So, it's still by certiorari.\n\nOption A says \"by appeal,\" which might be misleading because in some contexts, \"appeal\" is used more broadly, but in the U.S. Supreme Court, review is generally by certiorari for state court decisions.\n\nOption C, \"if five justices vote to review it,\" is related because four votes are needed to grant certiorari, but as I said earlier, that seems more about the process once the petition for certiorari is filed, rather than how the case reaches the Court.\n\nOption D seems off because the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds is about whether the Supreme Court will choose to review the federal issues when the state court has based its decision on state grounds.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best answer is B, \"by certiorari.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where the Supreme Court would have mandatory jurisdiction over this case.\n\nLooking back at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, it provides that the Supreme Court may review final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had, if the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question or the validity of a state statute is adjudged on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States.\n\nIn this case, the state court held that the state statute was unconstitutional under the commerce clause and supremacy clause, which are federal issues. So, this would fall under the category where the Supreme Court has discretionary review.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions and nuances. For example, if the state court's decision rests independently on adequate state grounds, the Supreme Court might choose not to review the federal issues.\n\nBut the question here is about how the case reaches the Supreme Court, not about whether the Court will choose to review it.\n\nSo, regardless of the adequacy of state grounds, if the Supreme Court chooses to review the case based on the federal issues, it would do so by certiorari.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, \"by certiorari.\"\n\nOption D says \"despite the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds.\" This might suggest that even if there are adequate state grounds, the Supreme Court might still choose to review the federal issues, but again, that's more about whether they choose to review, not how the case reaches them.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the case would reach the U.S. Supreme Court by certiorari.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
