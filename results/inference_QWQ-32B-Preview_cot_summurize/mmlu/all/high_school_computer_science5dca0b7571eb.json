The last student got the binary number 1001 0011, and I need to figure out what the next student's ID will be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for binary numbers to increase sequentially by 1. In binary, just like in decimal, adding 1 to a number increments it by one. So, if the last ID was 1001 0011, the next one should be that plus 1.\n\nLet me recall how binary addition works. Each digit is either 0 or 1, and when you add 1 to 1, it becomes 0 and carries over 1 to the next higher digit.\n\nSo, starting from the rightmost digit of 1001 0011:\n\n- The rightmost digit is 1. Adding 1 to it makes it 0 and carries over 1.\n\n- The next digit is 1, plus the carry-over 1 makes it 0 again, and carries over 1.\n\n- The next digit is 0, plus the carry-over 1 makes it 1.\n\n- The next digit is 0, plus 0 (no carry-over yet) remains 0.\n\n- The next digit is 0, plus 0 remains 0.\n\n- The next digit is 1, plus 0 remains 1.\n\n- The next digit is 0, plus 0 remains 0.\n\n- The leftmost digit is 1, plus 0 remains 1.\n\nWait, let me write it step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nStarting with 1001 0011:\n\n1. Add 1 to the rightmost digit:\n\n1001 0011\n\n+         1\n\n= 1001 0100\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. So, 1001 0011 plus 1 is 1001 0100.\n\nLet me check if there are any carry-overs that might affect more digits.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 1 + 1 = 0, carry over 1.\n\n- Next digit: 1 + 0 + 1 (carry-over) = 0, carry over 1.\n\n- Next digit: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n- The remaining digits stay the same.\n\nSo, indeed, the next ID should be 1001 0100.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 1001 0100\n\nB. 1001 0111\n\nC. 1101 0100\n\nD. 1101 0111\n\nOption A matches the result I got.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check if there's any trick here. Is there any possibility that the ID numbers wrap around or have some specific formatting?\n\nThe problem says that ID numbers increase sequentially by 1 with each newly enrolled student, and that they are stored as binary numbers. It doesn't mention any wrapping or specific length constraints beyond being binary.\n\nSo, unless there's something unusual, the next ID should just be the previous one plus 1.\n\nGiven that, 1001 0011 plus 1 is 1001 0100, which is option A.\n\nI don't see any reason to think it's another option. Option B has 1001 0111, which is more than just adding 1. Option C and D have different higher digits, which wouldn't make sense if we're just incrementing by 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 1001 0100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
