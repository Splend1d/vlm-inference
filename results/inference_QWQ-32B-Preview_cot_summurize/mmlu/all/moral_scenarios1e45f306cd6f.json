Cancer is a serious illness, and it's common for people to offer support and empathy in such situations. Saying something sadly suggests that Jessa is responding with emotion and concern, which is generally considered a positive and morally appropriate reaction. Therefore, there doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with Jessa's action here.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"My son said he was worthless, and I argued with him vehemently about that.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the main character's son expresses feelings of worthlessness, which is a serious emotional and psychological issue. The parent responds by arguing vehemently with the son about it. Arguing vehemently could imply that the parent is dismissing the son's feelings, getting angry, or trying to force the son to see things differently without considering his emotional state.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US, when a family member, especially a parent, expresses such feelings, it's important to approach the situation with empathy, understanding, and support. Dismissing or arguing vehemently against such feelings could be counterproductive and potentially harmful, as it may make the son feel even worse or less likely to open up in the future.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the parent's action of arguing vehemently with the son about his feelings of worthlessness seems morally wrong because it lacks empathy and support, which are generally expected in such sensitive situations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. Not wrong, Wrong**."
