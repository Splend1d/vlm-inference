I remember learning that after the French and Indian War, which was part of the larger Seven Years' War, Britain had accumulated a lot of debt. So, to help pay for that debt and the costs of maintaining the colonies, they started imposing new taxes on the American colonists. This included taxes like the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts. The other options don't seem as accurate. Option A about increasing the wealth of King George III isn't really the main reason; it was more about covering national debt. Option C about anger at America's growing prosperity doesn't make much sense because Britain probably saw the colonies' growth as beneficial. And option D about pressure from rich merchants might have been a factor, but I think the primary driver was the need to manage war debts. So, I'll go with B."
