This is one of the fundamental rules of the game, as outlined by the Laws of the Game established by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).\n\nHere's a brief overview of why this is the case and some additional context:\n\n1. **Role of the Goalkeeper**: The goalkeeper has a unique role in the team, primarily responsible for preventing the opposing team from scoring. Their ability to handle the ball with their hands allows them to make saves and control the flow of the game from their defensive position.\n\n2. **Penalty Area**: The goalkeeper is only permitted to handle the ball within their own penalty area. This area is specifically designated for this purpose and is marked on the field. Outside of this area, the goalkeeper must follow the same rules as the other players and cannot handle the ball.\n\n3. **Restrictions on Handling**: Even within the penalty area, there are restrictions on when the goalkeeper can handle the ball. For instance, they cannot handle the ball if it is deliberately kicked to them by a teammate or if they receive it directly from a throw-in taken by a teammate. These rules are in place to prevent time-wasting and to maintain the balance of the game.\n\n4. **Other Players**: All other players on the field are not allowed to handle the ball deliberately. If they do so, it results in a direct free kick for the opposing team, and in some cases, more severe penalties such as yellow or red cards, depending on the severity of the offense.\n\n5. **Positions Mentioned in the Question**:\n   - **Midfielder**: Plays in the middle of the field, involved in both attacking and defending.\n   - **Center**: This term is not standard in soccer positions. It might refer to a central defender or a central midfielder, but it's not a recognized position.\n   - **Sweeper**: A former defensive position that had more freedom to organize the defense and sometimes act as a secondary goalkeeper. However, this position is less common in modern soccer.\n   - **Goalkeeper**: As explained, the only player allowed to handle the ball within their penalty area.\n\nUnderstanding these roles and rules is essential for anyone playing or watching soccer, as it helps in appreciating the strategies and skills involved in the game."
