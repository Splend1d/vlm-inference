A map showing Atlanta as a hub for Delta Airlines\n\nB. An article describing the region referred to as the South\n\nC. A map showing North Carolina's one hundred counties\n\nD. An essay explaining the region known as the Bible Belt\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a functional region is. From what I remember, a functional region is an area organized around a node or focal point, and it's defined by the interactions and connections to that central point. So, it's like everything revolves around that main hub.\n\nOption A is about a map showing Atlanta as a hub for Delta Airlines. That sounds like Atlanta is the central point, and maybe the region includes all the areas served by Delta Airlines from there. That seems like it could be a functional region because it's organized around the hub of Atlanta.\n\nOption B is an article describing the region referred to as the South. Now, the South is more of a cultural or geographical region, not necessarily organized around a single focal point. So, I don't think this fits the definition of a functional region.\n\nOption C is a map showing North Carolina's one hundred counties. This seems like just an administrative division, not organized around a central node or hub. So, probably not a functional region.\n\nOption D is an essay explaining the region known as the Bible Belt. The Bible Belt is again a cultural region defined by religious practices and beliefs, not by a central hub or node. So, this doesn't seem to fit the definition either.\n\nComparing all these options, option A seems to be the best illustration of a functional region because it's centered around Atlanta as a hub for Delta Airlines, and likely includes areas that are connected to or served by this hub.\n\nI think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
