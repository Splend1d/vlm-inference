I remember that chemical changes involve making or breaking bonds between atoms, which means new substances are formed. Physical changes, on the other hand, are just changes in shape or state without forming new substances.\n\nOption A is tearing up a piece of paper. That's just changing the size and shape of the paper, but it's still paper. So, that's probably a physical change.\n\nOption B is melting ice. Ice melting turns into water, but it's still H2O. Just a change in state from solid to liquid, so that should be a physical change too.\n\nOption C is mixing vinegar with baking soda. I know that when you mix those two, you get a fizzy reaction and it bubbles. I think something new is being formed there, like carbon dioxide. So, that sounds like a chemical change.\n\nOption D is filling a balloon with air. That's just expanding the balloon with gas, no new substances are being created. So, that's a physical change.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C, mixing vinegar with baking soda, because it's a chemical change where new substances are formed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
