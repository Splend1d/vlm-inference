                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which fallacy is referred to as \"evading burden of proof.\" The options are extension, appeal to ignorance, complex question, and complex proposition. I think I need to understand what each of these terms means to determine which one matches the description.\n\nFirst, let's consider \"appeal to ignorance.\" I know that this fallacy occurs when someone argues that something must be true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. For example, \"Since you can't prove that extraterrestrials don't exist, they must exist.\" That seems related to burden of proof because it's shifting the responsibility to disprove something onto the opponent.\n\nNext, \"complex question\" is another term I'm familiar with. This is when a question is asked in a way that presupposes something that hasn't been established yet. A classic example is the loaded question: \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" This assumes that you were beating your wife in the first place, which may not be true. While this is a fallacy, it doesn't seem directly related to evading burden of proof.\n\n\"Extension\" isn't a term I associate with fallacies off the bat. Maybe it's referring to something else in this context. I'll need to look that up or consider if it's related to extending an argument in an invalid way, but I'm not sure.\n\n\"Complex proposition\" sounds like it might be related to logical statements that combine multiple assertions, but again, I don't immediately see its connection to evading burden of proof.\n\nGiven that, I think \"appeal to ignorance\" is the most likely candidate because it directly involves shifting the burden of proof onto the opponent. Let me see if I can find more information to confirm this.\n\nLooking back at the definition of burden of proof, it's the responsibility to provide evidence for a claim. Evading this responsibility would mean avoiding or shifting that responsibility, which is exactly what appeal to ignorance does. It says, \"You don't have evidence against my claim, so it must be true.\"\n\nLet me consider if any of the other options could also be considered as evading burden of proof. For \"complex question,\" while it's a fallacy, it's more about manipulating the question to trap the respondent rather than directly evading the burden of proof.\n\n\"Extension\" is unclear to me in this context. Maybe it's a less common term for a fallacy, but I'm not familiar with it.\n\n\"Complex proposition\" seems more related to logic and constructing compound statements rather than a fallacy.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding, I believe that \"evading burden of proof\" is another name for the fallacy of appeal to ignorance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
