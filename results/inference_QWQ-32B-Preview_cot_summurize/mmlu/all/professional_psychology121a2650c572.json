                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which psychological theory believes that a child's misbehavior has one of four goals: attention, revenge, power, or to display inadequacy. The options are Beck\u2019s cognitive-behavioral therapy, Adler\u2019s individual psychology, Perls\u2019s Gestalt therapy, or Mahler\u2019s object relations theory.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories is about.\n\nAlbert Ellis and Aaron Beck are associated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT focuses on changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It's more about identifying and modifying dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs that lead to emotional distress.\n\nAdler\u2019s individual psychology, on the other hand, was developed by Alfred Adler. He emphasized the importance of feelings of inferiority and the striving for superiority or perfection. Adler also talked about social interest and lifestyle, and he did discuss concepts related to childhood behavior and misbehavior.\n\nFrederick Perls is known for developing Gestalt therapy, which focuses on awareness and the present moment. It\u2019s about experiencing and expressing feelings and needs directly, rather than avoiding them.\n\nMahler\u2019s object relations theory is associated with Margaret Mahler, who worked on the separation-individuation process in child development. Her theory is about how infants develop a sense of self in relation to others, particularly their caregivers.\n\nNow, considering the options, the one that seems most aligned with the idea that misbehavior has specific goals like attention, revenge, power, or displaying inadequacy is Adler\u2019s individual psychology.\n\nAdler talked about misbehavior in children and identified four possible reasons or goals behind it: attention, power, revenge, and displaying inadequacy. He believed that understanding these motives could help educators and parents guide children better.\n\nIn contrast, Beck\u2019s CBT is more about cognitive distortions and maladaptive thought patterns, not specifically about misbehavior goals in children.\n\nGestalt therapy is about awareness and direct experience, not categorizing misbehavior into specific goals.\n\nMahler\u2019s theory is about the development of self and relationship with others, but not specifically about classifying misbehavior into these four goals.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Adler\u2019s individual psychology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
