This fallacy happens when someone uses a word or phrase in different ways within an argument, changing its meaning without making it clear. This can lead to confusion and invalid conclusions because the terms aren't being used consistently.\n\nLet me think about the other options to make sure:\n\nA. Special pleading: This is when someone applies rules or criteria to others but makes exceptions for themselves without proper justification. It doesn't directly relate to changing the meaning of words.\n\nB. Hypostatization: This is a type of fallacy where abstract concepts are treated as concrete things. For example, saying \"Freedom died today\" personifies freedom as if it were a living being.\n\nC. Question begging epithets: This involves using loaded language that presumes the truth of a particular viewpoint. It's like using pejorative terms to influence the argument.\n\nSo, compared to these, equivocation seems to fit best with the description of changing the meaning of a word or phrase within an argument.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
