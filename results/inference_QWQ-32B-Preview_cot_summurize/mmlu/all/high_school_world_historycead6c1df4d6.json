                    "text": "Let's see what Gibbon is saying here. He mentions that the decline of Rome was a natural and inevitable effect of its immoderate greatness. So, basically, because Rome became so big and prosperous, that prosperity itself contained the seeds of its own decay.\n\nThe specific part you're asking about is: \"Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest.\" So, Gibbon is suggesting that as Rome prospered and expanded through conquest, the very factors that led to its greatness also started to cause its downfall.\n\nOption A says: \"The rulers became too rich and thus were overthrown.\" Well, Gibbon does talk about the emperors and their concerns for personal safety and public peace, but the statement is more about the general prosperity leading to decay, not specifically about rulers becoming too rich.\n\nOption B is: \"The empire became too large to control effectively.\" That seems plausible. As Rome expanded, managing such a vast territory would become increasingly difficult. Gibbon mentions that the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest, which aligns with the idea that the larger the empire, the harder it is to maintain control.\n\nOption C: \"Decay begins the minute something begins to grow.\" This seems a bit too general and not directly supported by Gibbon's words. He's talking about prosperity leading to decay, not that growth inherently leads to decay immediately.\n\nOption D: \"Conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive.\" Gibbon actually suggests that conquest leads to prosperity, but that prosperity then leads to decay. So, they're not mutually exclusive; in fact, they're connected in a cause-and-effect manner, but with negative consequences down the line.\n\nSo, considering these options, B seems the most accurate. The empire became too large to control effectively, and this lack of control contributed to its decline.\n\nBut let's look back at the passage to see if there's more support for this.\n\nGibbon mentions that the victorious legions, who acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic and then violated the majesty of the purple. This suggests that the military, which was crucial for conquest, started to behave in ways that were detrimental to the state.\n\nFurthermore, the emperors resorted to corrupting the military discipline to ensure their own safety and public peace. This indicates that maintaining control over the vast empire required compromises that weakened the very institution\u2014 the military\u2014 that was necessary for defending the empire.\n\nAlso, the vigour of the military was relaxed, and eventually, the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of barbarians. So, the extent of conquest led to an overstretch, where the empire became too large to defend effectively with the existing military structure.\n\nTherefore, the author is arguing that the extensive conquests led to an empire that was too large to manage, and the prosperity that came with conquest contained within it the seeds of decay, primarily through the corruption of the military and the difficulty in maintaining control over such a vast territory.\n\nSo, the best answer is B: The empire became too large to control effectively.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
