That seems strange because if someone has been taking care of your kids for a long time, you should know who they are. Maybe the person is trying to hide something or avoid responsibility. That could be considered morally wrong because they're being dishonest.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person tosses a ball at a catcher's mitt. That sounds like a normal part of playing a sport, maybe baseball. There's nothing inherently wrong with that action; it's pretty standard and expected in the game.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 seems morally wrong because of the dishonesty, while Scenario 2 is just a regular sports activity.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
