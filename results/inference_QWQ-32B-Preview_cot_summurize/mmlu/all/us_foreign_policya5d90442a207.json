                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to figure out what was unique about the NATO intervention in Kosovo. There are four options here:\n\nA. It was the first time the US became involved in the Balkans\n\nB. It was the first time NATO used military force\n\nC. It was the first war won by airpower alone\n\nD. It was the first war to employ 'smart weapons'\n\nOkay, first, I need to recall when the NATO intervention in Kosovo took place. I think it was in 1999, during the Kosovo War. Now, let's evaluate each option one by one.\n\nOption A says it was the first time the US became involved in the Balkans. Hmm, I know that the Balkans have been a trouble spot for a long time, and the US has been involved in the region before 1999. For example, during the Bosnian War in the early 1990s, the US was involved in peacekeeping efforts and even conducted airstrikes as part of NATO operations. So, I don't think this is the correct answer because the US had already been involved in the Balkans before the Kosovo intervention.\n\nOption B claims it was the first time NATO used military force. I need to think about when NATO was first established and when it first used military force. NATO was founded in 1949, and its initial purpose was for collective defense against the Soviet Union. The first time NATO used military force was actually during the Bosnia conflict in the 1990s, specifically in 1995 with Operation Deliberate Force. So, by the time of the Kosovo intervention in 1999, NATO had already used military force before. Therefore, option B doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says it was the first war won by airpower alone. Now, this is interesting. In the Kosovo intervention, NATO conducted a major aerial bombing campaign against Yugoslavia without deploying ground troops. The war lasted for about two months, and eventually, Yugoslavia agreed to withdraw its forces from Kosovo. So, it seems like NATO achieved its objectives primarily through airpower. But was this the first time in history that a war was won by airpower alone? I need to think about other conflicts.\n\nFor example, during the Gulf War in 1991, there was a significant aerial bombing campaign followed by a ground assault that drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. So, in that case, airpower was used extensively, but ground forces were also involved. Another example is the Falklands War in 1982, where the UK used a combination of naval and air power, along with ground forces, to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentina.\n\nI can also think of the Kosovo intervention itself, where NATO used airpower extensively without deploying ground troops. So, perhaps this was the first time that a war was won solely through airpower, without the use of ground troops. But I need to confirm if there were any previous instances where airpower alone achieved strategic objectives.\n\nLooking back, during the 1991 Gulf War, although there was a massive aerial campaign, the ground assault was what ultimately forced the Iraqis out of Kuwait. In the Kosovo intervention, NATO conducted a 78-day bombing campaign that led to Yugoslavia agreeing to withdraw its forces from Kosovo. So, in this case, airpower seemed to have been sufficient to achieve the strategic goal.\n\nAnother example that comes to mind is the NATO intervention in Libya in 2011, where aerial bombardment played a key role in helping the rebel forces overthrow Gaddafi's regime. However, that was after the Kosovo intervention, so it's not the first instance.\n\nTherefore, it seems plausible that the Kosovo intervention was the first war won by airpower alone, without the need for ground troops.\n\nOption D states it was the first war to employ 'smart weapons.' Smart weapons, or precision-guided munitions, have been used in various conflicts before Kosovo. For instance, during the Gulf War in 1991, the US and its allies extensively used smart bombs and missiles. Similarly, in the Afghanistan campaign in 2001, smart weapons were also employed.\n\nSo, if smart weapons were already used in earlier conflicts, then the Kosovo intervention wouldn't be the first to employ them.\n\nTherefore, considering all the options, I think the correct answer is C: It was the first war won by airpower alone.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
