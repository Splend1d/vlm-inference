                    "text": "I've come across this question about brain scans and the myth that people only use 10% of their brains. The question is asking which type of brain scan would be most useful to disprove that statement. The options are CAT, MRI, EEG, and PET scans. I need to think about what each of these scans measures and how that relates to the myth.\n\nFirst, let's recall what the myth is: \"Most people only use 10 percent of their brains.\" This suggests that the majority of the brain remains unused or inactive most of the time. If this were true, we should see a lot of inactive areas in brain scans.\n\nNow, let's consider each type of scan:\n\nA. CAT (Computed Tomography): CAT scans use X-rays to create images of the brain's structure. They're good for showing anatomical details, like tumors or blood clots, but they don't show functional activity\u2014that is, they don't show which parts of the brain are active at any given time.\n\nB. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): MRI scans use magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain's structure. Like CAT scans, they're excellent for showing anatomical details but don't typically show real-time brain activity.\n\nC. EEG (Electroencephalography): EEG measures electrical activity in the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. It provides information about brain activity in real time and is used to diagnose conditions like epilepsy. However, its spatial resolution is limited, meaning it's not very good at pinpointing exactly which areas of the brain are active.\n\nD. PET (Positron Emission Tomography): PET scans measure metabolic activity in the brain by tracking the consumption of radioactive substances, often glucose, which is a primary energy source for brain cells. Active neurons consume more glucose, so PET scans can show which areas of the brain are metabolically active during specific tasks or states.\n\nGiven that the myth is about brain usage or activity, we need a scan that can show which parts of the brain are active and which are not. CAT and MRI are more suited for showing structural details rather than functional activity. EEG does measure activity but with limited spatial resolution, making it less precise for this purpose. PET scans, on the other hand, directly measure metabolic activity, which correlates with neuronal activity.\n\nIf we were to disprove the 10% myth, we'd want to show that more than 10% of the brain is active during various tasks or even at rest. PET scans can provide maps of brain activity that would demonstrate that a much larger portion of the brain is metabolically active.\n\nAdditionally, there's a related technique called functional MRI (fMRI), which measures changes in blood flow in the brain, indicating active areas. However, fMRI isn't one of the options listed.\n\nConsidering the options provided, PET scans seem to be the most appropriate choice for disproving the myth because they can show that a significant portion of the brain is metabolically active, far more than just 10%.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. PET.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
