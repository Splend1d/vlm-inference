                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here about an astronaut landing on a different planet. The planet has both mass and radius that are twice that of Earth. The astronaut weighs 800 N on Earth, and I need to find out how much he'll weigh on this new planet. The options are 200 N, 400 N, 800 N, or 1600 N.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how weight is calculated. Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity, and it's given by the formula:\n\n\\[ w = m \\cdot g \\]\n\nwhere \\( w \\) is the weight, \\( m \\) is the mass of the object, and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nOn Earth, the astronaut weighs 800 N, so:\n\n\\[ w_{\\text{Earth}} = m \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}} = 800 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nNow, I need to find the weight on the new planet, which has a mass twice that of Earth and a radius twice that of Earth. Let's denote the mass of the Earth as \\( m_{\\text{Earth}} \\) and the radius of the Earth as \\( r_{\\text{Earth}} \\). Therefore, the mass of the planet is \\( 2 \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}} \\) and the radius is \\( 2 \\cdot r_{\\text{Earth}} \\).\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity on a planet is given by:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{G \\cdot m}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( m \\) is the mass of the planet, and \\( r \\) is the radius of the planet.\n\nSo, for Earth:\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{Earth}} = \\frac{G \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} \\]\n\nAnd for the new planet:\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{G \\cdot (2 \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}})}{(2 \\cdot r_{\\text{Earth}})^2} \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot G \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}}}{4 \\cdot r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{G \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}}}{2 \\cdot r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} \\]\n\nComparing this to \\( g_{\\text{Earth}} \\):\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{g_{\\text{Earth}}}{2} \\]\n\nSo, the acceleration due to gravity on the new planet is half that of Earth's.\n\nNow, the weight of the astronaut on the new planet would be:\n\n\\[ w_{\\text{planet}} = m \\cdot g_{\\text{planet}} = m \\cdot \\left( \\frac{g_{\\text{Earth}}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{m \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}}}{2} = \\frac{w_{\\text{Earth}}}{2} \\]\n\nSince \\( w_{\\text{Earth}} = 800 \\, \\text{N} \\), then:\n\n\\[ w_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{800 \\, \\text{N}}{2} = 400 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there's anything I'm missing. The mass of the planet is twice that of Earth, and the radius is twice that of Earth. In the formula for gravity, mass is directly proportional to \\( m \\), and radius is inversely proportional to \\( r^2 \\). So, doubling the mass would double \\( g \\), but doubling the radius would quarter \\( g \\), because it's squared in the denominator. Therefore, the net effect is that \\( g \\) on the new planet is \\( \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) of \\( g_{\\text{Earth}} \\).\n\nSo, yes, \\( g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{g_{\\text{Earth}}}{2} \\), and thus the weight on the planet is half the weight on Earth, which is 400 N.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Perhaps using the concept of gravitational force directly.\n\nThe gravitational force between two masses is given by:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{G \\cdot m_1 \\cdot m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nIn this case, \\( m_1 \\) is the mass of the planet, \\( m_2 \\) is the mass of the astronaut, and \\( r \\) is the radius of the planet.\n\nSo, on Earth:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{Earth}} = \\frac{G \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}} \\cdot m_{\\text{astronaut}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = 800 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nOn the new planet:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{G \\cdot (2 \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}}) \\cdot m_{\\text{astronaut}}}{(2 \\cdot r_{\\text{Earth}})^2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot G \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}} \\cdot m_{\\text{astronaut}}}{4 \\cdot r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{G \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}} \\cdot m_{\\text{astronaut}}}{2 \\cdot r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{f_{\\text{Earth}}}{2} = 400 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nAgain, I get 400 N. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the gravitational acceleration formula and see if there's a different perspective.\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{f}{m} \\]\n\nSo, on Earth:\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{Earth}} = \\frac{800 \\, \\text{N}}{m_{\\text{astronaut}}} \\]\n\nOn the planet:\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{f_{\\text{planet}}}{m_{\\text{astronaut}}} \\]\n\nBut we already determined that \\( g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{g_{\\text{Earth}}}{2} \\), so:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{planet}} = m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\cdot \\frac{g_{\\text{Earth}}}{2} = \\frac{m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}}}{2} = \\frac{800 \\, \\text{N}}{2} = 400 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nOnce more, 400 N.\n\nI should consider if the mass and radius both being doubled would have another effect that I'm not considering. For example, does the density of the planet play a role here? Wait, density is mass divided by volume, and volume is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\). So, if mass is doubled and radius is doubled, density would be:\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{m}{v} = \\frac{2 \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}}}{\\frac{4}{3} \\pi (2 \\cdot r_{\\text{Earth}})^3} = \\frac{2 \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}}}{8 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r_{\\text{Earth}}^3} = \\frac{m_{\\text{Earth}}}{4 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r_{\\text{Earth}}^3} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{Earth}}}{4} \\]\n\nSo, the density of the planet is one-fourth that of Earth. But I'm not sure if that affects the weight calculation directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the concept of escape velocity or something else, but I don't think that's relevant here. The question is specifically about weight, which is dependent on the gravitational acceleration at the surface.\n\nLet me try another approach using the concept of gravitational potential.\n\nThe gravitational potential \\( \\phi \\) at a distance \\( r \\) from a mass \\( m \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\phi = -\\frac{G \\cdot m}{r} \\]\n\nThe gravitational acceleration \\( g \\) is the negative gradient of the potential, so:\n\n\\[ g = -\\frac{d\\phi}{dr} = \\frac{G \\cdot m}{r^2} \\]\n\nWhich brings us back to the same formula we started with.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I keep arriving at the conclusion that the weight on the new planet is half that of on Earth, which is 400 N.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the mass of the astronaut.\n\nFrom the weight on Earth, \\( w_{\\text{Earth}} = m \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}} = 800 \\, \\text{N} \\), so:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{800 \\, \\text{N}}{g_{\\text{Earth}}} \\]\n\nAssuming \\( g_{\\text{Earth}} = 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\), then:\n\n\\[ m \\approx \\frac{800}{9.8} \\approx 81.63 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nNow, on the new planet:\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{G \\cdot (2 \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}})}{(2 \\cdot r_{\\text{Earth}})^2} = \\frac{G \\cdot 2 \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}}}{4 \\cdot r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{G \\cdot m_{\\text{Earth}}}{2 \\cdot r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{g_{\\text{Earth}}}{2} \\]\n\nSo, \\( g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{9.8}{2} = 4.9 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)\n\nTherefore, the weight on the planet is:\n\n\\[ w_{\\text{planet}} = m \\cdot g_{\\text{planet}} = 81.63 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 4.9 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\approx 400 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nAgain, 400 N.\n\nI can't see any mistake in this reasoning. Therefore, the correct answer should be 400 N, which corresponds to option B.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some similar problems, the mass and radius changes can affect weight differently, so I want to make sure I'm not missing a trick here.\n\nLet me consider if the planet's mass being twice that of Earth and radius twice that of Earth would mean that the gravitational force is different than what I've calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the planet has a different composition, but the problem doesn't specify that, so I have to assume it's a uniform mass distribution.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should consider the concept of gravitational acceleration inside a planet. But since we're considering the surface gravity, that shouldn't be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the planet is not spherical, but again, without specification, I think it's safe to assume it's spherical, like Earth.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mass distribution is different, but again, without additional information, I think my approach is correct.\n\nI think I've considered all possible angles, and consistently arrived at 400 N as the answer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 400 N.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400 \\, \\text{N}} \\]"
