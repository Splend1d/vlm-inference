                    "text": "So I've got this break-even problem here, and I need to figure out how many DVD players the company needs to sell to break even, given the sales mix and all the costs. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that break-even analysis is about finding the point where total revenue equals total cost, so the company isn't making a profit or a loss. The total cost includes both fixed costs and variable costs.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- DVD players sell for $200 each, with a variable cost of $160 each.\n\n- Home entertainment systems sell for $600 each, with a variable cost of $460 each.\n\n- For every four DVD players sold, one home entertainment system is sold.\n\n- Fixed costs are $90,000.\n\nSo, the sales mix is 4 DVD players to 1 home entertainment system. That means for every group of 5 products sold (4 DVD + 1 home system), there's a certain combined revenue and variable cost.\n\nI think I need to calculate the combined contribution margin for this sales mix and then use that to find out how many such mixes are needed to cover the fixed costs.\n\nLet me calculate the contribution margin per DVD player and per home entertainment system.\n\nContribution margin per DVD player = Selling price - Variable cost = $200 - $160 = $40.\n\nContribution margin per home entertainment system = $600 - $460 = $140.\n\nNow, for every mix of 4 DVD players and 1 home system, the total contribution margin is:\n\n(4 DVD players * $40) + (1 home system * $140) = $160 + $140 = $300.\n\nSo, each sales mix brings in $300 in contribution margin.\n\nNow, to find out how many mixes are needed to cover the fixed costs of $90,000:\n\nNumber of mixes = Fixed costs / Contribution margin per mix = $90,000 / $300 = 300 mixes.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of DVD players needed to be sold, not the number of mixes. Since each mix consists of 4 DVD players, the total number of DVD players needed to be sold is:\n\n300 mixes * 4 DVD players per mix = 1,200 DVD players.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1,200 DVD players.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the weighted average contribution margin per unit.\n\nFirst, find the sales mix ratio: 4 DVD players for every 1 home system, so total units in the mix are 5.\n\nContribution margin per DVD player: $40.\n\nContribution margin per home system: $140.\n\nWeighted average contribution margin = (4/5)*$40 + (1/5)*$140 = (0.8)*40 + (0.2)*140 = 32 + 28 = $60.\n\nNow, break-even point in units = Fixed costs / weighted average contribution margin per unit = $90,000 / $60 = 1,500 units.\n\nBut this gives the total number of units needed to be sold, which includes both DVD players and home systems.\n\nGiven the sales mix, for every 5 units sold, 4 are DVD players and 1 is a home system.\n\nSo, out of 1,500 total units, the number of DVD players is (4/5)*1,500 = 1,200 DVD players.\n\nSo, again, I get 1,200 DVD players.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate it in terms of sales revenue.\n\nBut I think the previous methods are correct.\n\nTherefore, the company needs to sell 1,200 DVD players to break even.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 1,200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
