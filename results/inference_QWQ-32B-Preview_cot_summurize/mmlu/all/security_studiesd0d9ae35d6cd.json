                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about securitization. So, securitization is a concept in security studies that explains how certain issues are constructed as existential threats requiring extraordinary measures. It was developed by Barry Buzan and Ole W\u00e6ver, among others. The process involves a securitizing actor who frames an issue as a security threat to convince an audience that exceptional measures are necessary to address it.\n\nOption A says: \"Securitization reveals the power of the securitizing actor.\" This seems accurate because the ability to frame an issue as a security threat and mobilize resources accordingly is indeed a sign of power. So, this statement appears to be applicable to the securitization process.\n\nOption B: \"Where the securitizing actor is a democratic state, the relevant audience is usually the wider population who have the right to reject the speech act.\" In democratic societies, the audience for securitization includes the general public, as they have the power to influence policy through elections and other forms of participation. So, this also seems consistent with securitization theory.\n\nOption C: \"The adoption of extraordinary measures can retrospectively convince an audience of the existential threat.\" This is interesting. Typically, in securitization, the extraordinary measures are justified because of the existential threat, not the other way around. However, it's possible that the implementation of such measures could later persuade the audience of the threat's severity. But according to the standard securitization model, the threat should be established first to justify the measures. So, this might be a less conventional way of looking at it.\n\nOption D: \"Within authoritarian and other undemocratic regimes, the relevant political decision-making is often dominated by the military and political elite.\" This seems plausible because in authoritarian systems, decision-making is concentrated among a small group of leaders, often including the military. So, in such contexts, the audience for securitization would be this elite group rather than the general population.\n\nNow, considering which of these statements is not applicable to the securitization process, I think Option C might be the one. The standard securitization model, as proposed by Buzan and W\u00e6ver, emphasizes that the securitizing actor frames an issue as an existential threat to convince an audience that extraordinary measures are necessary. The sequence is: frame the threat, justify the exceptional measures. Option C suggests that adopting extraordinary measures can then convince the audience of the threat retrospectively, which seems to invert this sequence. While it might happen in practice, it doesn't align with the core logic of securitization theory.\n\nTherefore, I would choose Option C as the statement not applicable to the securitization process.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
