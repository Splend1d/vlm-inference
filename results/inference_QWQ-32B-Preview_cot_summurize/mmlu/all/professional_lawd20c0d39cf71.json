Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries. As a result, the distributor was not able to acquire the cymbidium for the woman. Which of the following best states the legal relationship at this point between the distributor the woman?\n\nA. The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution.\nB. The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages because of the distributor's prospective inability to perform.\nC. The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages, provided she waits until the date performance was due before filing suit.\nD. Both parties are excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and neither can recover from the other.\n"

                    "text": "So here's this scenario involving a woman who wants a specific type of cymbidium for her Japanese-style garden, and a distributor who agrees to get it for her from Japan, plant it in her garden, all for $5,000. She pays $1,000 upfront, promising the rest upon completion. But then, there's this beetle issue that leads to a government ban on importing cymbidiums from foreign countries, which means the distributor can't get the plant as agreed.\n\nNow, the question is about the legal relationship between the distributor and the woman at this point. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that best describes their situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happened. There's a contract between the woman and the distributor. The distributor promises to get the cymbidium from Japan, ship it to the US, plant it in her garden within six months, for $5,000, with $1,000 paid upfront and $4,000 upon completion.\n\nThen, due to the beetle problem, the US government bans importing cymbidiums from foreign countries, making it impossible for the distributor to fulfill the contract.\n\nSo, the key issue here is impossibility of performance due to a new law or regulation, which is often referred to as \"supervening illegality.\"\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution.\n\nThis seems plausible. If performance is impossible due to new laws, the distributor might be excused from having to perform. However, the woman might still be able to seek restitution for any benefits she conferred on the distributor, which in this case is the $1,000 she already paid.\n\nBut I need to think about whether the impossibility really excuses the distributor's performance. Is it true impossibility, or just illegal to perform?\n\nB. The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages because of the distributor's prospective inability to perform.\n\nThis suggests that the distributor is still on the hook, despite the new law, and the woman can recover damages for breach of contract.\n\nBut I thought that if performance becomes illegal due to new laws, it might be considered frustration of purpose or impossibility, excusing performance.\n\nC. The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages, provided she waits until the date performance was due before filing suit.\n\nThis is similar to option B, but adds that the woman has to wait until the performance date to file suit.\n\nD. Both parties are excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and neither can recover from the other.\n\nThis suggests that neither party is at fault; the contract is voided due to the new law, and no one can recover from the other.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about the legal principles here.\n\nThere's the concept of \"impossibility of performance\" in contract law, which can excuse performance when something occurs after the contract is formed that makes performance objectively impossible, and this isn't due to the fault of either party.\n\nThen there's \"frustration of purpose,\" which applies when the central purpose of the contract is destroyed by an unexpected event, again without fault of either party.\n\nIn this case, the government ban on importing cymbidiums from foreign countries makes it illegal to import the specific cymbidium the woman wants from Japan. So, it's not that performance is impossible in the literal sense, but it's illegal to perform the contract as agreed.\n\nIs illegal performance considered impossible performance in contract law?\n\nI think so. If it's illegal to do something, then requiring someone to do it would be against public policy. So, in such cases, performance is often treated as excused.\n\nBut, in option A, it says the distributor's performance is excused, but the woman can seek restitution. Restitution would typically be for any benefits she has conferred on the distributor, which in this case is the $1,000 she paid upfront.\n\nOption B says the distributor's performance was not excused, and the woman can recover damages. But if performance is excused due to impossibility, why would the distributor be liable for damages?\n\nOption C is similar to B but adds that she has to wait until the performance date to file suit. Again, if performance is excused, this might not hold.\n\nOption D says both parties are excused, and neither can recover from the other. This seems plausible if performance is excused due to impossibility or illegality.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider the $1,000 she already paid. If the contract is voided due to impossibility, she might be entitled to get her money back, but is that considered restitution or damages?\n\nRestitution is meant to restore the parties to their pre-contract position, whereas damages are meant to compensate for losses incurred due to the breach.\n\nIn this case, since the contract is voided due to impossibility, and neither party is at fault, it might be that the woman can get her $1,000 back, and that's the end of it.\n\nBut option A specifically says she can seek restitution, which aligns with getting her money back.\n\nOption D says neither can recover from the other, which might suggest that the woman doesn't have a claim against the distributor, but that seems unfair because she did pay $1,000 upfront.\n\nWait, maybe the woman can get her $1,000 back as restitution, but can't claim any further damages because the distributor isn't at fault.\n\nWhereas option D might imply that neither can recover anything, including the $1,000 she already paid.\n\nThat doesn't seem right.\n\nLooking back at option A, it seems to capture both aspects: the distributor is excused from performance due to impossibility, and the woman can seek restitution for the $1,000 she paid.\n\nOption B and C suggest that the distributor is still liable, which seems inconsistent with the concept of impossibility excusing performance.\n\nOption D might be too broad, as it suggests neither can recover from the other, but in reality, the woman should probably get her $1,000 back.\n\nTherefore, option A seems the most accurate.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any reason why the woman couldn't seek restitution in this scenario?\n\nWell, restitution is generally allowed when performance is excused due to impossibility, to return any benefits conferred.\n\nIn this case, the woman gave $1,000 to the distributor, who couldn't perform due to no fault of either party.\n\nSo, it makes sense that she can seek restitution to get her $1,000 back.\n\nTherefore, option A is likely the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA) The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution."
