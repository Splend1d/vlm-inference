The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment.

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Mahatma Gandhi in 1921, and he's talking about a boycott of foreign cloth and promoting spinning and weaving as part of the Swadeshi movement. He's also mentioning the arrest of Maulana Mohamed Ali and the importance of remaining non-violent and maintaining Hindu-Muslim unity.\n\nThe question is asking which historical development most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph. The options are:\n\nA. Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies\n\nB. The Great Depression that started in 1929\n\nC. The decolonization process already underway in Africa\n\nD. World War II\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the boycott. Gandhi is advocating for the use of handmade cloth instead of imported British textiles as a form of protest against British rule. This is part of the larger Indian independence movement.\n\nOption A mentions pressure from the Soviet Union. While the Soviet Union did support some nationalist movements, especially those with socialist leanings, I'm not sure how directly this impacted the textile boycott in India. The Soviet Union's influence on decolonization might have been more significant in later decades.\n\nOption B is the Great Depression starting in 1929. Economic downturns can affect trade and production, which might have influenced the demand for British textiles in India. However, I need to think about whether the depression would have helped or hindered the boycott.\n\nOption C refers to decolonization in Africa. While decolonization was happening in Africa, especially after World War II, I'm not sure how that directly assisted the textile boycott in India, which was ongoing since before World War I.\n\nOption D is World War II. This is a significant event that had profound impacts on colonial empires, including Britain's. I need to consider how the war might have affected the boycott and the independence movement in India.\n\nLet me think about the timeline. The passage is from 1921, and the boycott was part of a larger movement that continued until Indian independence in 1947. World War II was from 1939 to 1945, so it falls within this period.\n\nDuring World War II, Britain was heavily engaged in the war effort and had to divert resources away from maintaining its colonies. This weakness in the British Empire's control over its colonies likely emboldened nationalist movements, including in India.\n\nMoreover, during the war, the Indian National Congress launched the Quit India Movement in 1942, demanding immediate independence. This movement was a direct challenge to British rule and was met with a strong response from the British authorities.\n\nThe war also highlighted the contributions of Indian soldiers and the Indian economy to the Allied cause, which put pressure on the British government to consider granting more autonomy or even independence to India.\n\nAfter the war, Britain was financially weakened and faced with growing nationalist movements in its colonies. This made it increasingly difficult for Britain to maintain its empire, leading to a wave of decolonization in the following decades.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that World War II had a significant impact on weakening the British Empire and accelerating the process of decolonization, including in India.\n\nNow, specifically regarding the textile boycott, the war might have disrupted trade routes and affected the supply of British textiles to India, making the boycott more effective. Additionally, the war effort might have diverted British attention and resources away from enforcing their economic policies in India, including the production and sale of textiles.\n\nFurthermore, the war highlighted the importance of self-sufficiency and local production, which aligns with the Swadeshi ideals promoted by Gandhi.\n\nOption B, the Great Depression, could have had some economic impacts, but compared to the profound changes brought about by World War II, it might be less significant in this context.\n\nOption C, decolonization in Africa, was more of a post-World War II phenomenon and likely had less direct impact on the Indian textile boycott.\n\nOption A, pressure from the Soviet Union, might have had some indirect influence, but it's not as directly relevant as World War II.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D, World War II, as it most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott by weakening the British Empire and accelerating the decolonization process.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
