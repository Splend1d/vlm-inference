Yes, there is clearly no diversity in that the construction company LLC and the landscaper corporation were both registered and filed in New York, making them citizens of the same state.\nB. Yes, because diversity must be between natural citizens and business entities are not entitled to diversity but must find some other reason for federal jurisdiction.\nC. No, the motion to dismiss is premature and must wait until all discovery is completed before it will be considered.\nD.

                    "text": "I've got this legal scenario here involving a contract dispute between a construction company and a landscaping firm. The landscaping firm is incorporated in New York and does all its business there, while the construction company is an LLC filed in New York, but its members live in Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia. The landscaper sues in federal court in New York for breach of contract, claiming diversity jurisdiction because the amount in dispute exceeds $100,000. The construction company moves to dismiss, saying there's no diversity jurisdiction. I need to figure out whether the court will likely grant that motion to dismiss.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what diversity jurisdiction is. Diversity jurisdiction allows federal courts to hear cases where the parties are citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy exceeds a certain threshold, which is $100,000 in this case. So, the key here is whether the parties have diverse citizenship.\n\nNow, the landscaping firm is incorporated in New York and does all its business there, so its citizenship is New York. The construction company is an LLC filed in New York, but its members are from Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia. For an LLC, citizenship is determined by the citizenship of its members. So, since the members are from different states, the LLC is a citizen of Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia.\n\nSo, the plaintiff is a New York citizen, and the defendant is a citizen of Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia. That means there's no shared citizenship between the plaintiff and the defendant, right? The plaintiff is from New York, and the defendant is from other states.\n\nBut wait, the construction company was filed in New York. Does that affect its citizenship? I think for diversity purposes, an LLC's citizenship is based on the citizenship of its members, not where it was formed. So, since the members are from Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia, the LLC is a citizen of those states.\n\nSo, in this case, the plaintiff is a New York citizen, and the defendant is a citizen of Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia. That seems like there's diversity because their citizenships are different.\n\nBut the motion to dismiss claims that there's no diversity jurisdiction. Maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, there is clearly no diversity because both the construction company LLC and the landscaper corporation were both registered and filed in New York, making them citizens of the same state.\n\nWait, the landscaper is incorporated in New York, and the LLC is filed in New York, but the LLC's members are from other states. So, for the LLC, citizenship is based on the members' citizenship, not where it was filed. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nB. Yes, because diversity must be between natural citizens and business entities are not entitled to diversity but must find some other reason for federal jurisdiction.\n\nHmm, I don't think that's correct. Business entities can certainly be parties in diversity jurisdiction cases. Diversity jurisdiction applies to cases between citizens of different states, whether they're individuals or business entities.\n\nC. No, the motion to dismiss is premature and must wait until all discovery is completed before it will be considered.\n\nI don't think that's right. Motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction can be brought early in the case, and courts typically decide them before proceeding with the case.\n\nD. No, the plaintiff is a citizen of New York and the three members of the LLC are each from different states, which gives complete diversity of citizenship.\n\nThis seems correct. The plaintiff is from New York, and the defendant LLC is from Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia. No overlapping citizenship, so there's diversity.\n\nBut let me double-check. In diversity jurisdiction cases involving LLCs, the citizenship is determined by the citizenship of all its members. Here, the members are from different states, none of which is New York, where the plaintiff is from. So, it seems like there is diversity.\n\nWait, but I recall that for diversity jurisdiction, all plaintiffs have to be citizens of different states than all defendants. So, if the plaintiff is from New York, and the defendant LLC is from Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia, there's no overlap, so diversity exists.\n\nHowever, I've heard of something called \"diversity destruction\" where if any member of an LLC is from the same state as the plaintiff, that destroys diversity. But in this case, none of the LLC's members are from New York.\n\nSo, it seems like diversity jurisdiction applies here.\n\nBut the construction company is arguing that there's no diversity. Maybe they're arguing that since the LLC was filed in New York, it's a New York citizen, regardless of where its members are from.\n\nLet me check that. I think generally, for diversity purposes, an LLC takes the citizenship of its members. So, if the members are from Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia, the LLC is a citizen of those states.\n\nI found that in the case of LLCs, for diversity jurisdiction, you look at the citizenship of all its members. So, in this case, since the members are from different states, none of which is New York, there's diversity.\n\nTherefore, the court is unlikely to grant the motion to dismiss based on lack of diversity jurisdiction.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. No, the plaintiff is a citizen of New York and the three members of the LLC are each from different states, which gives complete diversity of citizenship.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
