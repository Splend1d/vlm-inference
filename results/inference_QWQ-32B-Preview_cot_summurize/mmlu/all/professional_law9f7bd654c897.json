The host supplied the bats, balls and gloves. An argument arose at home plate after a controversial call by the umpire, who was inebriated like all of the other participants. The host of the party became enraged at the umpire's decision and hit him in the face, breaking his nose. The umpire pressed charges when he became sober, and the authorities charged the host with criminal battery. At trial, the defense raised the defense of voluntary intoxication, arguing that the host lacked the mentality to form an intent to commit a criminal battery. Will the defense of voluntary intoxication be successful under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, criminal battery is a specific intent crime to which voluntary intoxication may be asserted as a defense.\nB. Yes, voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense to any crime that requires mens rea.\nC. No, the host was grossly negligent in allowing a group of drunk men to play a dangerous game of hardball, which precluded him from the benefit of the defense.\nD. No, criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available.\n"

The host is being charged with criminal battery, and the defense is raising the defense of voluntary intoxication. I need to determine whether this defense will be successful based on the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what voluntary intoxication means in a legal context. Voluntary intoxication is when a person consumes alcohol or drugs by their own choice, leading to impairment. In some jurisdictions, this can be used as a defense to certain crimes, especially those that require specific intent.\n\nNow, the question is whether voluntary intoxication is a defense in this case of criminal battery. To answer this, I need to know whether criminal battery is a specific intent crime or a general intent crime.\n\nFrom my legal knowledge, criminal battery is generally considered a general intent crime. This means that the perpetrator intends to make physical contact with the victim, and the contact is harmful or offensive. The intent required is the intent to make the contact, not necessarily the intent to cause specific harm.\n\nOption A says yes, criminal battery is a specific intent crime, but I believe that's incorrect because battery is typically a general intent crime.\n\nOption B says yes, voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense to any crime that requires mens rea. Mens rea refers to the mental state required for a crime. However, this is too broad because, in many jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication is not a defense for general intent crimes.\n\nOption C says no, the host was grossly negligent, which precluded him from the benefit of the defense. While the host may have been negligent in allowing drunk people to play a dangerous game, I'm not sure if this directly affects the admissibility of the voluntary intoxication defense.\n\nOption D says no, criminal battery is a general intent crime, and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available. This aligns with my understanding that voluntary intoxication is not a defense for general intent crimes.\n\nGiven this, it seems that option D is the correct answer. But let me double-check.\n\nIn many legal systems, voluntary intoxication can be used as a defense only for specific intent crimes, not for general intent crimes. Since criminal battery is a general intent crime, the defense of voluntary intoxication should not be available.\n\nAdditionally, in this scenario, the host was intoxicated, but the act of hitting the umpire seems to be an intentional act of making physical contact, which is the essence of battery. The fact that he was intoxicated might not excuse his conduct because battery doesn't require premeditation or specific intent to cause particular harm.\n\nTherefore, I believe the defense of voluntary intoxication will not be successful in this case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) No, criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available."
