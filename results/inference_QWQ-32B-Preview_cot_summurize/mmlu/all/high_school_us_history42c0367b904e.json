                    "text": "So I've got this question about the Treaty of Versailles, and it's asking which statement about it is true. There are four options:\n\nA. The United States Senate rejected it because it treated Germany too leniently.\n\nB. The United States Senate rejected it because it required increased American involvement in European affairs.\n\nC. The United States Senate approved it, with reservations concerning the division of Eastern Europe.\n\nD. It was never voted on by the United States Senate.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about the Treaty of Versailles. I remember that it was the peace treaty that ended World War I, and it was signed in 1919. President Woodrow Wilson was a key figure in drafting the treaty, especially with his Fourteen Points plan for peace.\n\nOption A says that the Senate rejected it because it treated Germany too leniently. Hmm, that seems off. From what I remember, one of the main criticisms was that the treaty was too harsh on Germany, not too lenient. So maybe A isn't correct.\n\nOption B says the Senate rejected it because it required increased American involvement in European affairs. That rings a bell. I think one of the main issues was that the treaty included the League of Nations, and many in the Senate were isolationists who didn't want the U.S. to get entangled in European conflicts again. So perhaps B is a possible answer.\n\nOption C says the Senate approved it with reservations about the division of Eastern Europe. I don't think that's accurate. I believe the Senate never approved the treaty.\n\nOption D says it was never voted on by the Senate. But I think it was actually voted on, and it didn't pass.\n\nLet me double-check. Woodrow Wilson did present the Treaty of Versailles to the Senate for ratification, but it faced significant opposition, mainly from Republicans led by Henry Cabot Lodge. They had several concerns, including the provisions related to the League of Nations, which they felt would compromise American sovereignty.\n\nWilson had incorporated some of his Fourteen Points into the treaty, but there were parts that were not aligned with his initial proposals. The treaty imposed heavy reparations on Germany and created a League of Nations, which Wilson saw as a way to prevent future wars.\n\nHowever, many in the Senate were skeptical of the League, fearing it would drag the U.S. into European conflicts. There were also those who thought the treaty was too punitive towards Germany, potentially leading to future resentment and conflict.\n\nGiven that, option A seems incorrect because the criticisms were more about the treaty being too harsh on Germany, not too lenient.\n\nOption B seems plausible because opposition to the treaty was partly based on concerns about increased involvement in European affairs through the League of Nations.\n\nOption C is likely wrong because the Senate did not approve the treaty, with or without reservations.\n\nOption D says it was never voted on, but I believe it was brought to a vote and failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority for ratification.\n\nSo, considering that, the correct answer should be B: The United States Senate rejected it because it required increased American involvement in European affairs.\n\nWait a minute, let's think about this again. While increased involvement in European affairs was a concern, was that the primary reason for the rejection?\n\nI recall that the Senate did propose a number of reservations to the treaty, many of which were aimed at limiting the U.S. obligations under the League of Nations. Wilson, however, was unwilling to accept these reservations, preferring the treaty as it was. This led to a standoff, and the treaty was not ratified.\n\nSo, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the Senate rejected the treaty because of concerns about the League of Nations and potential loss of American autonomy, rather than just increased involvement in European affairs.\n\nBut among the given options, B seems to be the closest match.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it was indeed voted on.\n\nOption C is wrong because the Senate did not approve it.\n\nOption A is unlikely because the complaints were more about the treaty being too harsh, not too lenient.\n\nTherefore, B is probably the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there's any aspect of the treaty that specifically required increased American involvement in European affairs beyond the League of Nations. I don't recall any specific provisions that mandated such involvement, other than the League.\n\nPerhaps the peace treaty established various commissions and bodies that involved member countries, including the U.S., in decision-making processes related to Europe. But the core concern was indeed the League of Nations.\n\nIn conclusion, I think B is the correct answer: The United States Senate rejected it because it required increased American involvement in European affairs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
