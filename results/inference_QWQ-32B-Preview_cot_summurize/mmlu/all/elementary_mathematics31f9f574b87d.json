I need to find the exact answer.\n\nFirst, I should probably just add 110 and 70 together. That seems straightforward. So, 110 plus 70.\n\nLet me think about this. 100 plus 70 is 170, and then there's an extra 10 in 110, so 170 plus 10 is 180. So, 110 plus 70 equals 180.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 18\n\nB. 81\n\nC. 180\n\nD. 810\n\nOption C is 180, which matches my calculation. So, the answer should be C. 180.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in adding.\n\nStarting over: 110 plus 70.\n\nI can break it down further. 110 is 100 plus 10, and 70 is 70. So, 100 plus 70 is 170, plus the remaining 10 makes it 180. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of tens. 110 is 11 tens, and 70 is 7 tens. So, 11 tens plus 7 tens is 18 tens, which is 180.\n\nWait a minute, option A is 18, which is 18 units, not tens. So, that's different.\n\nOption B is 81, which is not matching my calculation.\n\nOption C is 180, which aligns with my calculation.\n\nOption D is 810, which is way higher.\n\nSo, unless I made a mistake in my addition, the correct answer should be C. 180.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Is there a possibility that it's not a straightforward addition? Maybe it's a trick question, but I don't see how.\n\n110 plus 70 should just be 180. Therefore, the answer is C. 180.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
