There are a few options here, and I need to figure out which one is the main criticism or if it's a combination of them.\n\nOption A says that realist opposition is based on assumptions that states will protect their citizens. Hmm, realism in international relations is all about states looking out for their own interests. So, realists might argue that states should mind their own business and not intervene in others' affairs, even if there are human rights abuses. But criticizing them for assuming that states will protect their citizens seems a bit off. Actually, realists might not necessarily assume that states are benevolent; they might just prioritize non-intervention based on national interest.\n\nOption B mentions that the realist position overlooks the responsibilities that are inherent to sovereignty. This sounds more accurate. The idea is that with sovereignty comes responsibilities, one of which is to protect your own citizens. So, if a state fails to do that, perhaps the international community has a role to play. Realists might downplay this aspect and focus more on respecting state sovereignty regardless of how the state treats its people.\n\nOption C talks about critics of humanitarian intervention overlooking international law and consensus on grave crimes like genocide. This seems to be directing the criticism at those who oppose humanitarian intervention, suggesting that they are ignoring established legal frameworks that condemn such atrocities. So, it's arguing that those against intervention are somehow turning a blind eye to international laws and norms.\n\nOption D is a catch-all, saying that all of the above options are correct.\n\nI think the main criticisms of realist arguments against humanitarian intervention would include points B and C. Realists are critiqued for overlooking the responsibilities of sovereignty and for not sufficiently considering the international legal obligations to prevent crimes like genocide. Option A seems less accurate because realists might not necessarily assume that states will protect their citizens; they might just prioritize non-intervention based on other considerations.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is D, all of these options, because each one presents a different angle of criticism, even if some are stronger than others.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
