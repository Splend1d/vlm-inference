Instead of sharing or considering her sister's desires, the character tells her to go away. Now, morally, this seems somewhat selfish, but is it clearly morally wrong?\n\nIn many cultures, especially in the US, there's an expectation of kindness and consideration towards family members, especially younger siblings. However, telling a sister to go away once or twice might not be seen as a grave moral wrongdoing; it could be viewed as a minor instance of selfish behavior. But according to ordinary moral standards, it's probably not considered a serious moral transgression.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2, the main character is a landlord who has elderly tenants whom they want to replace with new tenants because the current ones are feeble. This seems more problematic.\n\nFirstly, there's the issue of age discrimination. In the US, there are laws protecting against discrimination based on age, especially in housing. So, wanting to replace tenants solely because of their age could be illegal, which would also make it morally wrong.\n\nSecondly, there's the ethical consideration of treating people with respect and dignity, regardless of their age or physical abilities. Elderly tenants may require more assistance or have different needs, but that doesn't justify replacing them solely based on their frailty.\n\nMoreover, there might be implications of exploiting vulnerable individuals. Elderly people might be more susceptible to being mistreated or taken advantage of, so having a landlord who wants to get rid of them because of their age could be seen as morally reprehensible.\n\nConsidering these points, Scenario 2 seems clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1, while not ideal, might not be considered clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the action is telling a baby sister to go away when she wants some ice cream. While it's not nice, it's not necessarily a clear moral wrong. Maybe the ice cream was the child's, and they had the right to decide who gets to eat it. However, given that it's a family member and especially a younger sibling, there might be an expectation to share or be more considerate.\n\nIn contrast, Scenario 2 involves age discrimination and potentially exploiting vulnerable tenants, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, overall, C seems the appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
