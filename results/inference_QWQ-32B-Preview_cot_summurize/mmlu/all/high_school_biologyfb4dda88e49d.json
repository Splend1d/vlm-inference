                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about enzyme-catalyzed reactions and equilibrium. The reaction is A + B \u2192 C, catalyzed by enzyme K. It says the reaction is at equilibrium, and I need to figure out which option would allow more product C to be produced. The options are:\n\nA. removing some of reactant A\n\nB. removing some of reactant C\n\nC. adding more enzyme K\n\nD. increasing the temperature of the system\n\nFirst, I need to recall what equilibrium means in a chemical reaction. At equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, so there's no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products. But in this case, it's an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, which means it's a biochemical reaction, and enzymes lower the activation energy, speeding up the reaction.\n\nOption A is removing some of reactant A. If I remove reactant A, according to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will try to counteract that by shifting the equilibrium to produce more A, which would mean shifting towards the left, favoring the reverse reaction. That would decrease the amount of product C, which is the opposite of what we want. So option A is not good.\n\nOption B is removing some of reactant C. Again, applying Le Chatelier's principle, if I remove product C, the system will shift to produce more C to counteract the removal. That means shifting towards the right, which is what we want to produce more C. So option B seems promising.\n\nOption C is adding more enzyme K. Enzymes are catalysts, and catalysts increase the rate at which equilibrium is reached, but they don't change the equilibrium position itself. So adding more enzyme would speed up the reaction, but since it's already at equilibrium, it won't shift the equilibrium to produce more C. It might reach equilibrium faster, but the amount of C won't increase. So option C isn't the answer.\n\nOption D is increasing the temperature of the system. Temperature affects equilibrium positions, especially in exothermic or endothermic reactions. However, the problem doesn't specify whether this reaction is exothermic or endothermic. Generally, increasing temperature favors endothermic reactions and disfavors exothermic ones. Without knowing the nature of the reaction in terms of heat, I can't confidently say how temperature will affect the equilibrium position. So option D is uncertain.\n\nComparing all the options, option B makes the most sense because removing some of the product C would shift the equilibrium to produce more C, according to Le Chatelier's principle. Options A and C would not increase the amount of C, and option D is unclear without more information.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
