                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which type of selection is being described here with the average birth weight for human babies being about 3 kg. Let's see what each option means.\n\nFirst, artificial selection. That's when humans breed animals or plants for specific traits they desire. Like breeding dogs to have certain characteristics. But in this case, it's about human babies, so I don't think that's it.\n\nNext, directional selection. That's when one extreme of a trait is favored over others, causing the population's average for that trait to shift over time. For example, if larger size gives an advantage, then the average size of the population would increase over generations. But here, the birth weight is averaging around 3 kg, which seems like it's staying around a certain value, not shifting in one direction.\n\nStabilizing selection is when the average trait is favored, and extremes are selected against. So, in the case of birth weight, babies that are too light or too heavy might have lower survival rates, while those around 3 kg have higher survival rates. This would keep the average birth weight around 3 kg over time.\n\nDisruptive selection is the opposite of stabilizing selection. It favors the extremes of a trait over the average. So, in this case, if babies that are very light or very heavy had higher survival rates than those around 3 kg, that would be disruptive selection. But that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nGiven this, it sounds like stabilizing selection is the best fit for describing why human babies have an average birth weight of about 3 kg. The population is selecting for babies around that weight because they have better survival rates.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about why the other options don't fit.\n\nArtificial selection isn't applicable here because it involves human intervention in breeding, which isn't the case for human babies in a natural context.\n\nDirectional selection would imply that birth weights are changing over time towards a higher or lower average, but the question states that the average is about 3 kg, suggesting stability.\n\nDisruptive selection would suggest that extremely low and extremely high birth weights have advantages over average weights, which isn't supported by what we know about infant health and survival.\n\nTherefore, stabilizing selection is the most appropriate term to describe this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
