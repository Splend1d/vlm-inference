                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Altman's view on speech codes and what kinds of harm justify their use. The options are causal harm, expressive harm, both causal and expressive harm, or auxiliary harm. I need to figure out which one Altman thinks has the best prospects for success in justifying speech codes.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Altman's stance is on speech codes. I remember that he discusses the ethical considerations of restricting speech in order to prevent harm. He argues that not all harms are equal when it comes to justifying speech restrictions.\n\nCausal harm refers to direct, tangible harm that results from speech, like incitement to violence or defamation that leads to loss of reputation and opportunities. Expressive harm, on the other hand, is about the message itself being harmful, even if it doesn't cause direct tangible harm. For example, hate speech might cause psychological distress or create a hostile environment without leading to physical harm.\n\nAuxiliary harm isn't a term I'm familiar with in this context, so I might need to look that up or consider if it's a typo or misremembered term.\n\nAltman, in his analysis, likely considers that justifications based on causal harm are stronger because they involve concrete, measurable damage. Expressive harm is more abstract and subjective, which makes it harder to justify restrictions based solely on that.\n\nHowever, I think Altman might argue that a combination of both causal and expressive harm provides the best prospects for justifying speech codes. This way, the restrictions are not only based on tangible harm but also take into account the broader social and psychological impacts of certain types of speech.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. Maybe Altman prioritizes one over the other. Perhaps he believes that only causal harm is sufficient for restricting speech, whereas expressive harm is not enough on its own due to the importance of free expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he considers expressive harm as a valid concern, especially in contexts where speech contributes to systemic oppression or creates an environment that harms certain groups.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the principle of harm in liberal political theory. Classical liberals like John Stuart Mill argue that speech should only be restricted to prevent direct harm to others. In his harm principle, only harms that are tangible and invasive justify limiting individual liberties.\n\nHowever, contemporary discussions, including those by Altman, might expand on this to include expressive harm, recognizing that speech can have profound effects on group identities and social cohesion.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Altman argues that both causal and expressive harm should be considered when justifying speech codes, acknowledging the multifaceted ways in which speech can be harmful.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the answer is simply \"causal harm\" because that aligns with traditional liberal views on harm and speech restrictions.\n\nAlternatively, if \"auxiliary harm\" is a term used by Altman to describe some specific type of harm, I should consider that option as well. Maybe it refers to indirect harms that result from speech, such as creating a culture that tolerates violence.\n\nWait, perhaps \"auxiliary harm\" is a misinterpretation, and it's actually \"collateral harm\" or something similar. I need to double-check the term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"auxiliary harm\" is not the right term, and it's actually \"instrumental harm\" or another similar concept.\n\nGiven that I'm not sure about \"auxiliary harm,\" I'll focus on the other options.\n\nBetween causal and expressive harm, perhaps Altman\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5206\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86 speech codes \u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\u3002Causal harm \u5173\u6ce8\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0c\u800c expressive harm \u5173\u6ce8\u8a00\u8bed\u8868\u8fbe\u672c\u8eab\u6240\u4f20\u8fbe\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\u6027\u3002\n\n\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f88\u591a speech codes \u90fd\u662f\u8bd5\u56fe\u5e73\u8861\u8fd9\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8003\u8651\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5927\u5b66\u6821\u56ed\u91cc\u7684 speech codes \u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u7981\u6b62\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u8d77\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0c\u5982\u6b67\u89c6\u6216\u66b4\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u8868\u8fbe\u4e86\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u8d2c\u4f4e\u548c\u6392\u65a5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9020\u6210\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8 Altman \u8ba4\u4e3a\u7ed3\u5408 causal \u548c expressive harm \u7684\u8003\u91cf\u80fd\u4e3a speech codes \u7684\u6b63\u5f53\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u7531\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u50f9\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9650\u5236 speech \u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u540e\u679c\u3002Altman \u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f3a\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u6743\u8861 harm \u548c free speech \u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u3002\n\n\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4ed6\u4e3b\u5f20\u53ea\u6709\u5728 harm \u7279\u522b\u4e25\u91cd\u6216\u8005\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u624d\u5e94\u8be5\u9650\u5236 speech\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f causal \u8fd8\u662f expressive harm\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4ed6\u8fd8\u4f1a\u8003\u8651 speech codes \u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u662f\u5426\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b harm\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u9650\u5236 speech\u3002\n\n\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u6211\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8ba4\u4e3a Altman \u8ba4\u4e3a\u7ed3\u5408 causal \u548c expressive harm \u7684\u8003\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a speech codes \u7684\u6b63\u5f53\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u7406\u7531\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u80fd\u662f C. both causal and expressive harm\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u8ba4\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u67e5\u9605 Altman \u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8457\u4f5c\u6216\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u4ed6\u5982\u4f55\u8bba\u8ff0\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
