A. 700 B. 794 C. 800 D. 894\"\n\nAlright, I need to round 794 to the nearest hundred. I remember that when rounding to the nearest hundred, I should look at the tens digit to decide whether to round up or down.\n\nLet me look at the number 794. The digit in the hundreds place is 7, the digit in the tens place is 9, and the digit in the ones place is 4.\n\nSo, the rule is that if the tens digit is 5 or greater, I round up the hundreds digit by one. If it's less than 5, I keep the hundreds digit the same.\n\nIn this case, the tens digit is 9, which is greater than 5, so I should round up the hundreds digit from 7 to 8.\n\nThat means 794 rounded to the nearest hundred is 800.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 700\n\nB. 794\n\nC. 800\n\nD. 894\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 800.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again. Rounding to the nearest hundred means I'm trying to find the multiple of 100 that 794 is closest to.\n\nThe multiples of 100 around 794 are 700 and 800.\n\n794 is closer to 800 than to 700, because 794 - 700 = 94, and 800 - 794 = 6. So, indeed, 800 is closer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is definitely C. 800.\n\nWait a minute, but option B is 794, which is the exact number. But the question asks for 794 rounded to the nearest hundred, so it shouldn't be 794 itself.\n\nOption D is 894, which is more than 800, but that doesn't make sense because 894 is actually closer to 900 than to 800.\n\nBut in this case, since we're only considering rounding 794, option D doesn't apply.\n\nSo, yes, the correct answer is C. 800.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
