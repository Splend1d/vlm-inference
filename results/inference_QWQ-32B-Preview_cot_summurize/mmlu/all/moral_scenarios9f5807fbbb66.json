                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"I like to go to church because it makes me feel supremely close to God.\"\n\nFirst, I need to think about whether going to church and feeling close to God is morally wrong. In the US, there's a lot of religious freedom, and people are encouraged to practice their religion as they see fit, as long as it doesn't harm others. Going to church is a common religious practice for many people, especially those who identify as Christian. It's a way for them to connect with their faith, community, and God. So, personally attending church for spiritual reasons doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nMoreover, feeling close to God is a personal and subjective experience. If someone finds comfort and meaning in their religious practices, that's generally considered positive and acceptable. There's nothing inherently wrong with seeking spiritual fulfillment.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any potential negative aspects. For example, if someone forces others to attend church against their will, that would be wrong. But in this scenario, it's about the individual's own choice to go to church. So, based on ordinary moral standards, this seems not wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I looked at my neighbor's test to get a good grade.\"\n\nThis one seems more straightforward. Looking at someone else's test during an exam is considered cheating. Cheating violates the rules and principles of fair play in academic settings. It's unfair to other students who study and take the test honestly, and it undermines the integrity of the educational system.\n\nIn the US, academic integrity is highly valued, and cheating is generally condemned. Students are expected to do their own work and not gain an unfair advantage over others. So, looking at a neighbor's test to get a good grade is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there might be any other perspectives.\n\nFor Scenario 1, some might argue that certain religious practices could be harmful or unethical, but in this case, simply attending church for personal spiritual reasons doesn't seem to fit that category. It's a private and personal act without direct harm to others.\n\nFor Scenario 2, there might be situations where cheating is justified in someone's mind, perhaps if they felt unprepared or under pressure. However, according to ordinary moral standards, cheating is still considered wrong, regardless of the reasons behind it.\n\nSo, I think option C is the right choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
