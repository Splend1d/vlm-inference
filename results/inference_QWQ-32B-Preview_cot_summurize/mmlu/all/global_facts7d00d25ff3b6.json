                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about Ross Perot and his performance in the presidential race. So, Ross Perot was a third-party candidate, and apparently, he led the presidential race briefly in June with 39% in the polls. But then it says he wound up with _% of the popular vote, and I have to choose between 1, 7, 13, or 19 percent.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Ross Perot is. I think he ran for president a few times, but specifically, I think he was a significant third-party candidate in the 1992 election. Yeah, that sounds right. He was the Reform Party candidate, or maybe it was called something else back then.\n\nNow, the question mentions that he led the polls briefly with 39%. That's a pretty high percentage for a third-party candidate. Usually, third-party candidates don't get that much support. So, it's interesting that he was leading at some point.\n\nBut then, it says he wound up with _% of the popular vote. So, I need to know what percentage he actually received in the election.\n\nLet me think about what I know about the 1992 election. There was Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and Ross Perot. I remember Perot had a significant impact on the race, but I'm not sure exactly what percentage he got.\n\nI think Perot got around 19% of the popular vote. Let me see, that would be option D. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider the other options.\n\nOption A is 1%, which seems too low because if he led the polls with 39%, it's unlikely he would drop that much to just 1%.\n\nOption B is 7%, which is possible, but still seems low considering his poll numbers.\n\nOption C is 13%, and D is 19%. I think 19% sounds more plausible.\n\nWait, I recall that in the 1992 election, Perot did quite well, and he did get a significant portion of the popular vote. I think he did get around 19%.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I should think about how the votes were distributed. Bill Clinton won with around 43% , George H.W. Bush had about 38%, and Perot had around 19%. That adds up to 100%, more or less.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, if Perot had 19% of the popular vote, then the correct answer should be D. 19%.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there was another election where Perot ran and got a different percentage.\n\nWait, Perot also ran in 1996, but I think he did worse in that election. In 1992, he was more successful.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe the answer is D. 19%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
