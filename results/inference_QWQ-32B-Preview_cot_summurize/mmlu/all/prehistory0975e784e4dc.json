The options are A. a mode of locomotion, B. a reliance on brachiation, C. a lack of sexual dimorphism, and D. all of the above. I need to decide which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic facts about both species. Homo sapiens are modern humans, and Australopithecus afarensis is an extinct hominin that lived around 3 to 4 million years ago. One of the most famous A. afarensis fossils is Lucy.\n\nOption A mentions \"a mode of locomotion.\" I know that both Homo sapiens and A. afarensis are bipedal, meaning they walk on two legs. This is a key feature that sets them apart from many other primates that rely on quadrupedalism or brachiation. So, it seems like they share bipedalism as a mode of locomotion.\n\nOption B talks about \"a reliance on brachiation.\" Brachiation is arm swinging, a form of movement used by some primates like gibbons. I don't think either Homo sapiens or A. afarensis relied on brachiation. Humans walk upright, and while A. afarensis could probably climb trees, their primary mode of locomotion was bipedalism. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption C is \"a lack of sexual dimorphism.\" Sexual dimorphism refers to differences between males and females of the same species, such as size or appearance. In humans, there is some sexual dimorphism, with males generally being larger than females. In A. afarensis, there is evidence of greater sexual dimorphism, with males being significantly larger than females. So, they don't share a lack of sexual dimorphism; in fact, A. afarensis seems to have more pronounced sexual dimorphism than modern humans.\n\nOption D, \"all of the above,\" can't be right because option B is incorrect.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be A. a mode of locomotion, since both species are bipedal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
