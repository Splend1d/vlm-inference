The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I gave the students a gold star for answering the questions correctly.\n\nScenario 2: I rented out a run-down apartment to college students for more than it was worth.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's look at Scenario 1 first. The main character gave students a gold star for answering questions correctly. In US educational settings, it's common to reward students for their achievements and good behavior. Giving gold stars for correct answers is a positive reinforcement technique that encourages students to learn and participate. So, from a moral standpoint, this seems perfectly acceptable and perhaps even commendable.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. The main character rented out a run-down apartment to college students for more than it was worth. This seems a bit sketchy. Renting out a property that is run-down could imply that the living conditions are substandard or unsafe. Additionally, charging more than the apartment is worth might be seen as exploitative, especially if the tenants are college students who may have limited financial resources.\n\nIn the US, there are laws regarding habitability and rent control in some areas. Landlords are expected to provide housing that meets certain standards. If the apartment is run-down, it might not meet those standards, which could be a legal and moral issue.\n\nAlso, charging excessive rent for a property that isn't worth it could be seen as taking advantage of the tenants, especially if they are students who might not have other options or the bargaining power to get a better deal.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character seems to be doing something that could be considered morally wrong because they are potentially providing inadequate living conditions and overcharging for them.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nWhich corresponds to choice C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving gold stars for correct answers is a standard practice in education. It's meant to motivate and encourage students. There doesn't seem to be any moral wrongdoing here.\n\nIn Scenario 2, renting a run-down apartment for more than it's worth could be seen as unethical because it might involve providing poor living conditions and overcharging tenants. This could be seen as exploiting vulnerable individuals, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, yes, I think C is the correct choice: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
