                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about migration trends, and I need to choose the correct term that describes how migration decreases with distance. The options are push factors, pull factors, distance decay, and migration selectivity. I think I need to understand what each of these terms means to pick the right one.\n\nFirst, I know that push factors are the reasons why people leave their original location. These could be things like poverty, war, or natural disasters that compel people to move away. Pull factors, on the other hand, are the attractions of the destination, such as better job opportunities, political stability, or a higher standard of living. So, both push and pull factors influence why people migrate, but they don't directly explain how migration rates change with distance.\n\nNext, there's \"distance decay.\" I've heard this term in geography class. It refers to the idea that the interaction or relationship between two places tends to decrease as the distance between them increases. In the context of migration, this would mean that the farther away a potential destination is, the less likely people are to migrate there. That sounds pretty relevant to the question.\n\nThen there's \"migration selectivity,\" which I'm less familiar with. I think it has something to do with the characteristics of migrants compared to the non-migrants in their origin population. Maybe it refers to how certain types of people are more likely to migrate than others, but again, I'm not sure how directly it relates to the distance aspect.\n\nGiven these definitions, I think \"distance decay\" is the most appropriate choice here because it specifically addresses how migration tends to decrease with increasing distance. Push and pull factors explain why people move, but not the relationship between migration and distance. Migration selectivity seems more about the characteristics of migrants rather than the distance they travel.\n\nTo confirm, I can think about real-world examples. For instance, people are more likely to move to a nearby city than to one that's across the country or in another continent, all else being equal. This aligns with the concept of distance decay in migration patterns.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is C. distance decay.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
