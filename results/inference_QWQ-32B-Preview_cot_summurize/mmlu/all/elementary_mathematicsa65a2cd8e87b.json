                    "text": "So I have this problem here: At West Elementary School, there are 20 more girls than boys. If there are 180 girls, how can you find the number of boys? And there are options A through D to choose from. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is saying. It says there are 20 more girls than boys, and there are 180 girls. I need to find out how many boys there are.\n\nLet me think about this. If there are 20 more girls than boys, that means the number of girls is the number of boys plus 20. So, girls = boys + 20. And I know that girls = 180. So, 180 = boys + 20.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many boys there are. To do that, I can rearrange the equation: boys = 180 - 20.\n\nSo, boys = 160.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. add 20 to 180\n\nB. subtract 20 from 180\n\nC. multiply 180 by 20\n\nD. divide 180 by 20\n\nBased on my calculation, I need to subtract 20 from 180 to find the number of boys. So, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I add 20 to 180, that would give me 200, which is more than the number of girls, which doesn't make sense for the number of boys. So, A is not right.\n\nOption C is to multiply 180 by 20, which would be 3600, that's way too big and doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption D is to divide 180 by 20, which is 9, again, that doesn't make sense because if there are 180 girls and 9 boys, that's a huge discrepancy and doesn't align with the \"20 more girls than boys\" statement.\n\nSo, definitely, option B is the correct choice: subtract 20 from 180 to find the number of boys.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I should consider that the number of boys is less than the number of girls by 20. So, again, subtracting 20 from the number of girls would give me the number of boys. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I let the number of boys be B, then girls = B + 20. Given girls = 180, then B + 20 = 180, so B = 180 - 20 = 160.\n\nNo matter how I approach it, subtracting 20 from 180 gives me the number of boys.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other interpretation. Suppose they meant that the girls are 20 more than twice the number of boys or something like that, but no, the problem clearly states \"20 more girls than boys,\" which directly translates to girls = boys + 20.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
