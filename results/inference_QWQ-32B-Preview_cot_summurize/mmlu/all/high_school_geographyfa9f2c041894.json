The question is: \"The world systems theory divides the world into...\" and then it gives four options: A. core, periphery, and semi-periphery; B. rich and poor; C. developed and undeveloped; D. haves and have-nots.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what world systems theory is. I think it's a sociological theory that looks at the global division of labor and how different countries are interconnected through economic relationships. It was developed by Immanuel Wallerstein and others.\n\nAccording to world systems theory, the world is divided into different parts based on their position in the global economy. The main divisions are the core, the periphery, and sometimes the semi-periphery. The core countries are the ones that are more developed, have more industrialization, and hold more power in the global economy. The periphery countries are less developed, often provide raw materials to the core, and are dependent on them. The semi-periphery is in between, with some characteristics of both core and periphery.\n\nSo, option A seems to be directly in line with what I remember about world systems theory.\n\nOption B, \"rich and poor,\" is too general. While it's true that core countries are generally richer and periphery countries are poorer, the theory is more about the economic relationships and divisions of labor between countries, not just their wealth.\n\nOption C, \"developed and undeveloped,\" is similar to B. It refers to the level of economic development but doesn't capture the nuanced relationships described in world systems theory.\n\nOption D, \"haves and have-nots,\" is again a general way of describing wealth distribution but doesn't specifically address the economic structures and relationships that world systems theory focuses on.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer should be A. core, periphery, and semi-periphery.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should make sure that world systems theory doesn't categorize countries in any other way. I recall that sometimes satellite states are mentioned, but that seems more related to political alliances rather than economic roles.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any other theories that use similar classifications. For example, dependency theory also looks at the relationship between developed and developing countries, but it's not the same as world systems theory.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my understanding, option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
