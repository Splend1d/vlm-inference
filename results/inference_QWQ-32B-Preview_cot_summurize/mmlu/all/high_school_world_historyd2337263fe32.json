                    "text": "Let's see what this passage is about. It's from some testimony given before Parliament in 1831-32, and it's about a guy named Joshua Drake who's being asked questions, probably about working conditions or something related to labor.\n\nSo, the first question is: \"You say you would prefer moderate labor and lower wages; are you pretty comfortable upon your present wages?\" And Joshua says, \"I have no wages, but two days a week at present; but when I am working at some jobs we can make a little, and at others we do very poorly.\" Okay, so he's not getting regular wages; he's only working two days a week, which isn't enough to really support his family, I suppose.\n\nThen, \"When a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its subsistence?\" He says, \"No, it will not keep it as it should do.\" So, 3 shillings a week isn't enough for a child to live on properly.\n\nNext question: \"Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?\" And his answer is, \"Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.\" So, it's because he has to; he doesn't have enough income, so he has to send his children to work.\n\nThen, \"Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system, if it was not from necessity?\" And he says, \"No.\" So, clearly, he doesn't think it's ideal for his children to work in these factories, but he feels he has no choice.\n\nNow, the question is asking according to the passage, why does the witness allow his children to work in a place where they will be ill-treated? And we have four options:\n\nA. A factory owner is forcing him to do so.\n\nB. He doesn\u2019t earn enough on his own.\n\nC. The children need discipline.\n\nD. Their labor is only moderately difficult.\n\nFrom what Joshua says, it's clear that he's sending his children to work out of necessity because he doesn't earn enough on his own. He says, \"Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.\" So, it's not that the factory owner is forcing him; it's that he can't support his family without his children's income.\n\nOption C, about the children needing discipline, isn't mentioned at all in the passage. And option D says their labor is only moderately difficult, but actually, the passage suggests that the children are being overworked and ill-treated, which implies that the work is more demanding than just moderately difficult.\n\nSo, the best answer is B: He doesn\u2019t earn enough on his own.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's look back at the text.\n\nHe says he's only working two days a week and sometimes makes a little, sometimes not so much. And when asked about his children's wages, he says 3 shillings a week isn't enough for subsistence. So, clearly, the family needs the children's earnings to make ends meet, hence the necessity to send them to work, despite the poor conditions.\n\nYes, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
