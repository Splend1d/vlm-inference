                    "text": "Cepheid stars are particularly important to astronomers because they serve as standard candles for measuring cosmic distances. These stars pulsate in a regular rhythm, and there is a direct relationship between the period of their pulsation and their intrinsic brightness. This period-luminosity relationship was first discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt in the early 20th century.\n\nBy observing the period of a Cepheid variable star, astronomers can determine its intrinsic brightness. Then, by comparing this intrinsic brightness with its observed brightness in the sky, they can calculate the distance to the star using the inverse square law. This method has been crucial for establishing the scale of the universe, including determining distances to nearby galaxies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. To measure galactic distances.\n\nThe other options are not primary uses of Cepheid variables:\n\nA. To measure interstellar mass: Cepheids are not typically used for measuring interstellar mass. Mass measurements often involve techniques like gravitational lensing or measuring the velocities of stars in a galaxy.\n\nC. To measure galactic energy-density: Energy density in galaxies is usually measured through observations of radiation at different wavelengths, such as infrared, X-ray, or radio emissions, rather than through Cepheid variables.\n\nD. To measure interstellar density: Interstellar density is often measured by observing the extinction or scattering of starlight, or through the emission and absorption lines in spectra caused by interstellar medium components.\n\nIn summary, Cepheid stars are most relevant for measuring distances in the universe due to their period-luminosity relationship, making option B the correct choice."
