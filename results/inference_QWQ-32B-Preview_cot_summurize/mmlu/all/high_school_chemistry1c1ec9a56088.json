                    "text": "Let's see which of these chemical names is incorrect. I need to check each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: CaCl2 is named calcium chloride. I know that calcium is Ca, and chloride is Cl-, so calcium chloride makes sense because calcium typically forms a +2 ion, and chloride is -1, so CaCl2 would be the formula to balance the charges. So, this seems correct.\n\nNext, option B: Fe(NO3)3 is named iron(III) nitrate. Iron can have different oxidation states, like +2 and +3. In this case, since there are three nitrate ions (NO3-), which are -1 each, the iron must be +3 to balance the charges. So, iron(III) nitrate is the correct name.\n\nOption C: AlBr3 is named aluminum tribromide. Aluminum is Al, and bromide is Br-. Aluminum typically forms a +3 ion, and bromide is -1, so AlBr3 makes sense. The \"tri-\" prefix indicates three bromide ions, which is correct. So, this name seems accurate.\n\nFinally, option D: K2Cr2O7 is named potassium dichromate. Potassium is K+, and chromate is Cr2O7^2-. So, two potassium ions would balance the -2 charge of the dichromate ion. Potassium dichromate is indeed the correct name for this compound.\n\nWait a minute, all of these seem to be correctly named. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each one.\n\nOption A: CaCl2 - calcium chloride. Yes, that's correct.\n\nOption B: Fe(NO3)3 - iron(III) nitrate. Correct.\n\nOption C: AlBr3 - aluminum tribromide. Correct.\n\nOption D: K2Cr2O7 - potassium dichromate. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is testing something else. Maybe one of these names is not the most conventional or there's an alternative name that's more commonly used.\n\nLet me think about option C again: AlBr3 - aluminum tribromide. I've also heard it called aluminum bromide. Is \"aluminum tribromide\" incorrect? Maybe the \"tri-\" is unnecessary, or perhaps it's a less common way to name it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Roman numeral in option B is unnecessary because nitrate always has a -1 charge, so perhaps just \"iron nitrate\" would be sufficient, but according to IUPAC rules, specifying the oxidation state is correct, especially since iron can have multiple charges.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is with option D: K2Cr2O7 - potassium dichromate. I've also heard it called dipotassium dichromate. Maybe that's the more correct name?\n\nSimilarly, for option A: CaCl2 - calcium chloride. Sometimes it's called calcium(II) chloride, but usually, since calcium only forms +2 ions, the Roman numeral is omitted.\n\nMaybe the incorrect name is aluminum tribromide for AlBr3, and it should just be called aluminum bromide.\n\nLet me check some references.\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature, binary compounds like AlBr3 are named by stating the metal first, followed by the nonmetal with an -ide suffix. So, aluminum bromide is correct. The \"tri-\" prefix is used in some contexts, like in organic chemistry, but for inorganic compounds, it's not typically necessary.\n\nTherefore, aluminum tribromide might be considered incorrect or at least less conventional than aluminum bromide.\n\nSo, the answer is C. AlBr3 should be named aluminum bromide, not aluminum tribromide.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
