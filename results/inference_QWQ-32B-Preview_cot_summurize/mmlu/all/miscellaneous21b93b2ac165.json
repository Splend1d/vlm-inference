Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these terms means, especially in the context of vision. I know that vision problems are pretty common, and there are different types, like being able to see close up but not far away, or vice versa.\n\nStarting with option A, \"farsighted.\" I think farsighted means someone can see things that are far away more clearly than things that are close up. So, if someone is farsighted, they might have trouble reading a book held right in front of them, but they can see signs or objects in the distance just fine. Wait, but the question is about difficulty seeing objects in the distance, so that doesn't seem to match.\n\nOption B is \"nearsighted.\" Okay, nearsighted should be the opposite of farsighted, right? So, nearsighted people can see things that are close to them clearly, but have trouble seeing things that are far away. Like, they might be great at reading a book but struggle to read road signs while driving. That seems to align with the question's description of difficulty seeing objects in the distance.\n\nOption C is \"hindsighted.\" I'm not sure what this means in the context of vision. I've heard the phrase \"hindsight is 20/20,\" which means looking back, you can see things more clearly, but I don't think that relates to actual vision problems. Maybe it's a trick option here.\n\nOption D is \"hypermetropic.\" I think hypermetropic is another term for farsightedness. I recall that hyperopia is the medical term for farsightedness, so hypermetropic would describe someone with hyperopia. Again, that's about seeing distant objects clearly but having trouble with close ones.\n\nSo, if I put this all together, the question is asking for the common term for someone who has difficulty seeing objects in the distance. That sounds like nearsightedness, where close objects are clear, but distant ones are blurry.\n\nWait, but option D says hypermetropic, which is farsightedness, and farsightedness is about having trouble with close objects, not distant ones. So, that wouldn't fit the question.\n\nOption A, farsighted, again, is about trouble with close objects, not distant ones.\n\nOption C, hindsighted, doesn't seem relevant to vision problems.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be B, nearsighted.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll think about the definitions again. Nearsighted: good at seeing near objects, bad at seeing distant objects. Farsighted: good at seeing far objects, bad at seeing near objects. Hypermetropic is farsighted. Hindsighted doesn't relate to vision in this context.\n\nSo, yes, the common term for someone who has difficulty seeing objects in the distance is nearsighted.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
