                    "text": "So I've got this question about IFRS and error correction in financial statements. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nThe company is preparing its first IFRS statement of financial position for the year ended December 31, year 2. They've discovered that in previous reporting, they didn't record a $90,000 loss accrual. This accrual consists of two parts: $40,000 related to a year 1 event and $50,000 related to a year 2 event.\n\nNow, the question is asking what amount of this loss accrual should be reported in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between GAAP and IFRS, especially regarding error correction and retrospective application.\n\nUnder IFRS, when a company transitions to IFRS from another accounting framework, it's required to apply IFRS retrospectively, unless specific exemptions are granted. This means that the opening IFRS statement of financial position should be adjusted for any differences that arise from initial application of IFRS.\n\nIn this case, the company is preparing its first IFRS financial statements for year 2, which means they need to present comparative information for year 1 as well, but under IFRS.\n\nNow, regarding the error: a $90,000 loss accrual was not recorded, with $40,000 relating to year 1 and $50,000 to year 2.\n\nSince this is an error, I need to consider how to correct it in the IFRS financial statements.\n\nUnder IFRS, prior period errors should be corrected retrospectively, which means adjusting the opening balances of the earliest period presented in the financial statements.\n\nIn this scenario, since the company is preparing its first IFRS statements, the opening balance as of the beginning of year 1 needs to be adjusted for the error relating to year 1.\n\nSo, the $40,000 loss accrual related to year 1 should be recognized in the December 31, year 1, statement of financial position.\n\nAs for the $50,000 related to year 2, that would be recognized in the year 2 financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the amount of loss accrual that should be reported in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position is $40,000.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure about this. Let's think again.\n\nWhen the company is preparing its first IFRS financial statements for year 2, it needs to present the statement of financial position as of the beginning of year 1 (retrospectively adjusted to IFRS), then the statements for year 1 and year 2 under IFRS.\n\nThe error relates to a $90,000 loss accrual that should have been recorded, with $40,000 pertaining to year 1 and $50,000 to year 2.\n\nSince the year 1 statement is being restated under IFRS, any error relating to year 1 should be corrected in the opening balance of the year 1 IFRS statement.\n\nTherefore, the $40,000 loss accrual should be recognized in the year 1 statement, reducing the opening equity as of the beginning of year 1.\n\nSimilarly, the $50,000 loss accrual related to year 2 should be recognized in the year 2 statement.\n\nSo, in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position, the company should report a loss accrual of $40,000.\n\nBut let me check if there's any IFRS standard that specifically addresses this situation.\n\nIFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards provides guidance for entities preparing their first IFRS financial statements.\n\nAccording to IFRS 1, an entity is required to present an opening IFRS statement of financial position at the date of transition to IFRS, which should be prepared by applying IFRS retrospectively.\n\nAny adjustments arising from initial application of IFRS should be recognized in the opening IFRS statement of financial position.\n\nIn this case, the error relates to a prior period (year 1), and since the company is transitioning to IFRS in year 2, they need to adjust the opening IFRS statement of financial position for year 1 by recognizing the $40,000 loss accrual related to year 1.\n\nTherefore, the amount to be reported in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position is $40,000.\n\nBut wait, the options include $0, $40,000, $50,000, and $90,000.\n\nIf I choose $40,000, that seems logical based on my understanding.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider if the entire $90,000 should be recognized in the opening statement because it's part of the transition adjustment.\n\nBut no, that doesn't seem right because the $50,000 relates to year 2, which is already within the IFRS reporting period.\n\nHence, only the $40,000 pertaining to year 1 should be adjusted in the opening IFRS statement of financial position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company needs to recognize the entire $90,000 in the opening statement, but that would be double-counting since the $50,000 relates to year 2.\n\nNo, that can't be right.\n\nI think the correct approach is to recognize the $40,000 loss accrual in the year 1 statement and the $50,000 in the year 2 statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $40,000.\n\nBut let me look at the wording of the question again to make sure.\n\n\"It is preparing the year 2 statement of financial position.\"\n\n\"And management identified an error in which a $90,000 loss accrual was not recorded. $40,000 related to a year 1 event and $50,000 to a year 2 event.\"\n\n\"What amount of loss accrual should the company report in its December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position?\"\n\nSo, it's specifically asking for the year 1 statement.\n\nGiven that, and considering the retrospective application of IFRS, the answer should be $40,000.\n\nBut perhaps there's a\u9677\u9631 here.\n\nWait, maybe the company needs to adjust the opening balance of year 1 for the entire $90,000, and then recognize the $50,000 in year 2.\n\nBut that would mean the opening balance is reduced by $90,000, and then year 2 recognizes $50,000, which doesn't make sense.\n\nNo, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $90,000 is a cumulative error, and they need to adjust the opening balance by $90,000.\n\nBut again, that doesn't align with the events in year 1 and year 2.\n\nI think the most logical approach is to recognize the $40,000 in year 1 and the $50,000 in year 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $40,000.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the IFRS 1 requirements again.\n\nIFRS 1 paragraph 10 states that an entity shall prepare an opening IFRS statement of financial position at the date of transition.\n\nAny differences between the carrying amounts under previous GAAP and IFRS should be adjusted in the opening IFRS statement of financial position.\n\nIn this case, the error is a prior period error, and it should be corrected retrospectively.\n\nTherefore, the $40,000 relating to year 1 should be recognized in the year 1 statement, and the $50,000 relating to year 2 should be recognized in the year 2 statement.\n\nHence, the amount to report in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position is $40,000.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nB"
