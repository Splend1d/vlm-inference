                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a 1-kg object being released from rest at the top of a rough-surfaced incline. It slides without rotating to the bottom. I need to figure out what happens to its kinetic energy at the bottom compared to its gravitational potential energy at the top.\n\nFirst, I know that gravitational potential energy is given by mgh, where m is the mass, g is gravity, and h is the height. Since the object is released from rest, its initial kinetic energy is zero.\n\nAs it slides down the incline, gravity is pulling it down, but the surface is rough, so there's friction acting against the motion. Friction does negative work on the object, which means it takes away some of the energy.\n\nSo, total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. At the top, it's all potential energy because kinetic energy is zero. At the bottom, all that potential energy should have turned into kinetic energy, but since there's friction, some of it is lost to heat.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy at the bottom should be less than the potential energy at the top because some energy is converted to thermal energy due to friction.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA says the kinetic energy at the bottom is equal to the block's gravitational potential energy when released because total mechanical energy must be conserved.\n\nBut wait, if there's friction, mechanical energy isn't conserved because some energy is lost to heat. So A seems incorrect.\n\nB says it's equal because the gain in kinetic energy compensates for the mechanical energy lost to thermal energy.\n\nHmm, this seems contradictory. If energy is lost to thermal energy, then the kinetic energy should be less, not equal.\n\nC says it's less than the block's gravitational potential energy because the gravitational potential energy was converted both to thermal energy and to kinetic energy.\n\nThis makes sense. Some potential energy goes to kinetic, some to thermal due to friction.\n\nD says it's less than the block's gravitational potential energy because the work done by the friction force must be greater than the block's gain in kinetic energy.\n\nWait, is that right? The work done by friction is negative, meaning it removes energy from the system. The gain in kinetic energy is positive.\n\nI think D is a bit confusing. The work done by friction is equal to the force of friction times the distance traveled in the direction of the force, which is negative because it's opposite to the motion.\n\nSo, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the net work done on the object, which is the work done by gravity minus the work done by friction.\n\nTherefore, kinetic energy at the bottom is equal to the potential energy at the top minus the work done by friction.\n\nSince work done by friction is positive (it's energy lost to heat), kinetic energy is less than potential energy.\n\nSo, C seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nLet's consider energy conservation:\n\nInitial mechanical energy = mgh\n\nFinal mechanical energy = (1/2)mv^2 + 0 (since at bottom, height is zero)\n\nWork done by non-conservative forces (friction) = -f*d, where f is friction force and d is distance along the incline.\n\nAccording to the work-energy theorem:\n\nChange in kinetic energy = work done by all forces\n\nSo, (1/2)mv^2 - 0 = mgh - f*d\n\nTherefore, (1/2)mv^2 = mgh - f*d\n\nThis shows that kinetic energy at the bottom is less than mgh by the amount f*d.\n\nSo, yes, C is correct.\n\nD says it's less than the block\u2019s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the work done by the friction force must be greater than the block\u2019s gain in kinetic energy.\n\nWait, according to the equation, (1/2)mv^2 = mgh - f*d\n\nSo, f*d = mgh - (1/2)mv^2\n\nThe work done by friction is equal to the difference between potential energy and kinetic energy.\n\nIt's not necessarily greater than the gain in kinetic energy. In fact, it's less than or equal to the initial potential energy.\n\nSo, D seems incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
