                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to determine whether each statement is true or false, given that H is a subgroup of G, and G is a group.\n\n**Statement 1:** If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then |aH| = |Ha|.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what aH and Ha represent. aH is the left coset of H in G with respect to a, and Ha is the right coset of H in G with respect to a. The notation |aH| and |Ha| refers to the number of elements in these cosets.\n\nI remember that in group theory, all left cosets of a subgroup H in G have the same number of elements, and the same is true for all right cosets. This is because the operation of multiplying by a group element is a bijection within the group.\n\nSo, for any a in G, aH and Ha are both cosets of H in G, and since all left cosets have the same order and all right cosets have the same order, it must be that |aH| = |Ha|.\n\nWait a minute, but I also recall that in general, left cosets and right cosets may not be the same unless H is a normal subgroup of G. However, the orders of left and right cosets should still be equal, regardless of whether H is normal or not.\n\nLet me think about this. If H is a subgroup of G, then for any a in G, the function that maps h in H to a*h in aH is a bijection between H and aH. Similarly, the function that maps h in H to h*a in Ha is a bijection between H and Ha. Therefore, |aH| = |H| = |Ha|.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH and Hb are identical or disjoint.\n\nThis statement is about the relationship between left and right cosets of H in G.\n\nFirst, I know that for left cosets, either aH = bH or aH and bH are disjoint. This is a standard property of left cosets in a group. Similarly, for right cosets, either Ha = Hb or Ha and Hb are disjoint.\n\nHowever, the statement here is talking about a left coset aH and a right coset Hb, and whether these two are identical or disjoint.\n\nI need to think carefully about this. In general, left cosets and right cosets are different unless H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nLet me consider an example. Take G to be the symmetric group S3, and H to be a subgroup of order 2, say H = {e, (12)}. Let's take a = (123) and b = (13).\n\nThen, aH = (123)H = {(123), (123)(12)} = {(123), (132)}.\n\nSimilarly, Hb = H(13) = {e*(13), (12)*(13)} = {(13), (12)(13)} = {(13), (132)}.\n\nSo, aH = {(123), (132)} and Hb = {(13), (132)}. These two sets are not identical, but they are not disjoint because they both contain (132).\n\nTherefore, in this case, aH and Hb are neither identical nor disjoint.\n\nThis counterexample shows that Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
