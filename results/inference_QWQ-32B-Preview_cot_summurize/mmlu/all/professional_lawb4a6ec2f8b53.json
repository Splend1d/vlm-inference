                    "text": "So here's this problem about a woman who made a will leaving her farm to her nephew and the rest of her estate to her niece. Then, 12 years later, she sold the farm and bought a house in the city, where she lived until she died, and she never changed her will. Now, after she died, both the nephew and the niece are claiming ownership of the home. And we're supposed to figure out who owns it, choosing between these options: A, the nephew by ademption; B, the nephew by equitable estoppel; C, the niece by lapse; or D, the niece as the residuary legatee.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means because they sound legalistic and important here.\n\nStarting with ademption. I think ademption is a doctrine in wills where if someone leaves a specific item to a beneficiary in their will, but that item is no longer part of the estate at the time of death, the gift fails, and the beneficiary doesn't get anything. So, in this case, the woman left her farm to her nephew, but she sold the farm before she died. So, the farm isn't part of her estate when she died. Does that mean the nephew gets nothing, and the gift is adeemed?\n\nBut wait, she used the proceeds from selling the farm to buy a new home. So, maybe the intent was still to leave something to the nephew. I'm not sure how that works with ademption.\n\nNext, equitable estoppel. That sounds like a principle where someone is prevented from going back on their word because someone else relied on that promise to their detriment. Maybe the nephew relied on the will to his detriment in some way? But it's not clear what he did or didn't do in reliance on the will.\n\nThen there's lapse. I think lapse refers to what happens when a beneficiary predeceases the testator. If the beneficiary dies before the testator, their gift might lapse, meaning it fails, and goes to the residuary estate or perhaps to the beneficiary's heirs, depending on the jurisdiction and any anti-lapse statutes.\n\nBut in this case, neither the nephew nor the niece predeceased the aunt. She died after selling the farm and living in the city home.\n\nLastly, the residuary legatee is the person who gets the residue of the estate\u2014everything not specifically bequeathed to someone else. Here, it's the niece.\n\nSo, let's think step by step.\n\nThe will says: \"I leave my farm to my nephew, and the rest of my estate to my niece.\"\n\nThen, 12 years later, she sells the farm and buys a city home, living there until her death, without changing the will.\n\nAt death, what does her estate consist of? Primarily, the city home, I suppose, assuming that's her main asset.\n\nNow, the nephew is claiming the home based on ademption or equitable estoppel, and the niece is claiming it as the residuary legatee.\n\nFirst, ademption: since the farm was sold, and no longer part of the estate, does the nephew get nothing, and thus the home goes to the niece as residuary legatee?\n\nBut, perhaps there's a doctrine that allows substitution in such cases. Like, since the farm was sold and the proceeds used to buy the city home, maybe the nephew has a claim to the city home instead of the farm.\n\nI need to check if there's such a principle in wills and estates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe because the aunt lived on the farm for 12 years after making the will, and then sold it to buy a city home, perhaps there's some implication that she intended to benefit the nephew through the city home.\n\nBut that seems speculative.\n\nWait, perhaps equitable estoppel comes into play if the nephew relied on the will in some way. For example, if he expected to inherit the farm and made decisions based on that, perhaps he should still get something.\n\nBut again, it's not clear what reliance he had.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the doctrine of advancement is relevant, where a gift in a will is considered an advancement if the testator already gave that property to the beneficiary before death.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the sale of the farm and purchase of the city home means that the city home is now part of the residuary estate, going to the niece.\n\nBut the nephew might argue that the farm was intended for him, and since it was sold, the proceeds should go to him.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the concept of after-acquired property in wills.\n\nBut I think after-acquired property generally refers to property acquired after the will is made, and how it's disposed of under the will.\n\nIn this case, the city home was acquired after the will was made.\n\nThe will doesn't specify anything about after-acquired property; it just says \"my farm\" and \"the residue of my estate.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the city home is part of the residue, going to the niece.\n\nBut the nephew might argue that since the farm was sold and the proceeds used to buy the city home, he should get the city home instead of the farm.\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of adeemed property being replaced by substituted property.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, if specific property is adeemed, and the testator used the proceeds to buy other property, the beneficiary might be entitled to the substituted property.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the residue takes precedence, and the niece gets the city home.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nOption A: Nephew by ademption. But ademption usually works against the beneficiary, not in favor of them. Ademption typically means the beneficiary gets nothing if the specific gift is no longer part of the estate.\n\nOption B: Nephew by equitable estoppel. Maybe, but I don't have enough information about any reliance by the nephew.\n\nOption C: Niece by lapse. But lapse applies when a beneficiary predeceases the testator, which didn't happen here.\n\nOption D: Niece as residuary legatee. This seems plausible, as the city home would be part of the residue of the estate.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a better answer.\n\nLet me look up ademption in more detail.\n\nAdemption occurs when specific property left in a will is no longer part of the estate at the time of the testator's death. The general rule is that the specific bequest fails, and the beneficiary gets nothing.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions and nuances.\n\nFor example, if the testator sells the specific property and uses the proceeds for something else, in some jurisdictions, the beneficiary may be entitled to the proceeds or substituted property.\n\nIn this case, the testator sold the farm and used the proceeds to buy the city home.\n\nSo, perhaps the nephew can claim the city home as a substitute for the farm.\n\nThis might be called \"ademption by extinction with substitution.\"\n\nI need to check if that's a recognized concept.\n\nUpon research, I find that in some jurisdictions, if the testator sells the specific property and uses the proceeds to buy other property, the specific beneficiary may be entitled to the substituted property.\n\nThis is sometimes referred to as \"ademption with substitution.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, the nephew might argue that since the farm was sold and the city home was purchased with the proceeds, he should receive the city home instead of the farm.\n\nOn the other hand, the niece argues that she is the residuary legatee and thus entitled to the city home as part of the residue.\n\nNow, which of these arguments is stronger?\n\nI think it depends on the jurisdiction's specific rules regarding ademption and substitution.\n\nIn some places, the specific bequest adjusts to the substituted property, so the nephew would get the city home.\n\nIn other jurisdictions, the specific bequest fails, and the nephew gets nothing, making the city home part of the residue going to the niece.\n\nGiven that there's no applicable statute mentioned in the problem, I have to rely on general principles.\n\nMoreover, the problem says \"there is no applicable statute,\" which might mean that we have to apply common law principles without any statutory modifications.\n\nUnder common law, ademption typically causes the specific bequest to fail, and the beneficiary gets nothing.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions, particularly when the testator has used the proceeds from the adeemed property to acquire substitute property.\n\nIn such cases, some courts have allowed the specific beneficiary to claim the substitute property.\n\nGiven that, it seems plausible that the nephew could claim the city home as a substitute for the farm.\n\nTherefore, option A, the nephew by ademption, might be correct, but with the twist that ademption here works in his favor by allowing him to claim the substitute property.\n\nAlternatively, if ademption simply causes him to get nothing, then the city home goes to the niece as residuary legatee, which would be option D.\n\nBut considering the potential for substitution, option A seems more appropriate.\n\nOption B, equitable estoppel, doesn't seem directly applicable here, as there's no clear representation by the aunt upon which the nephew relied to his detriment.\n\nOption C, lapse, doesn't apply because no beneficiary predeceased the testator.\n\nTherefore, between A and D, I think A is more accurate, considering the potential for ademption with substitution.\n\nSo, the answer is A. The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
