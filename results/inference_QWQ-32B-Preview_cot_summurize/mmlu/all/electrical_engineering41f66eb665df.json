B. it provides smooth and easy control. C. it is cheaper in cost. D. it is simple and reliable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an electric drive is. I know that an electric drive is a system used to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy to power machines, vehicles, or other devices. So, it's basically the motor and the control systems that make it work.\n\nNow, the question is asking why electric drives are becoming more popular. There are several reasons for this, and the options provided seem to cover some of them.\n\nOption B says, \"it provides smooth and easy control.\" I know that electric drives can offer precise speed control and smooth operation, which is advantageous in many applications, like in elevators, industrial machinery, and electric vehicles. So, this seems like a valid reason.\n\nOption C states, \"it is cheaper in cost.\" Hmm, is that always true? While electric drives can be cost-effective in the long run due to lower operating costs and maintenance, the initial investment might be higher compared to some traditional drive systems. So, I'm not sure if \"cheaper in cost\" is universally accurate.\n\nOption D says, \"it is simple and reliable.\" Electric drives can be simpler in design compared to, say, internal combustion engines, and they can be very reliable with fewer moving parts. So, this also seems like a valid point.\n\nOption A says, \"all of below.\" That would mean that all of B, C, and D are correct reasons for the increasing popularity of electric drives.\n\nBut considering my earlier thoughts, option C might not always be accurate. Maybe in specific applications, electric drives are cheaper, but it's not a universal truth.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is that electric drives are becoming more popular because they provide smooth and easy control and are simple and reliable. These are indeed significant advantages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects \"all of below\" as the answer, assuming that electric drives are cheaper in cost, which might be the case in specific scenarios but not universally.\n\nI think the most accurate answer would be A. all of below, assuming that in the context of the question, electric drives are indeed cheaper in cost, provide smooth control, and are simple and reliable.\n\nSo, I'll go with A. all of below.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
