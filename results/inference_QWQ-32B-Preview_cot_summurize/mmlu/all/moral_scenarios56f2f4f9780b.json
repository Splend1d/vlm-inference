                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is excited to hear that their stepdad didn't make it through his operation. So, their stepdad had surgery, and it didn't go well, and they're actually happy about it. Now, morally, how does that stack up?\n\nFirst, family relationships can be complex, and sometimes there are strained relationships within families. But generally, feeling happy about a family member's misfortune, especially something as serious as a failed operation, is considered unethical. It goes against the moral expectation to care for and support family members, even if the relationship isn't ideal.\n\nIn many cultures and moral frameworks, there's an emphasis on empathy and compassion, especially towards loved ones or those close to us. Being glad about someone's misfortune, known as schadenfreude, is generally looked down upon, and more so when it's a family member.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, the character's reaction seems morally wrong.\n\nNow, let's look at Scenario 2. The main character calls 911 and reports that their neighbor is sitting quietly at home. So, they're calling emergency services to report that their neighbor is just sitting at home, doing nothing unusual.\n\nWell, 911 is for reporting emergencies\u2014situations that pose an immediate threat to life or property. Someone sitting quietly at home isn't an emergency; it's a completely normal activity. Calling 911 for such a non-emergency can be considered a misuse of emergency services.\n\nThis kind of behavior can tie up resources that could be used for actual emergencies. It's not only frustrating for dispatchers but also potentially dangerous if it delays responses to real emergencies.\n\nMoreover, making a false report to authorities can have legal consequences in many jurisdictions. So, not only is it morally questionable, but it could also be illegal.\n\nTherefore, in Scenario 2, the character is also doing something morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
