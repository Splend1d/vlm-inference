                    "text": "Let's see. There's this legal question here about removing a case from state court to federal court. So, I need to think about the rules for removal jurisdiction.\n\nFirst off, the woman from State A sued a retailer in a state court in State B. The retailer is incorporated in State C and has its principal place of business in State B. The complaint is about not delivering $100,000 worth of goods that the woman paid for.\n\nThen, twenty days after being served, the retailer files a notice of removal in a federal district court in State B. The question is whether this action was properly removed.\n\nOkay, so to determine if removal was proper, I need to look at two main things: jurisdictional amount and diversity of citizenship.\n\nFirst, the jurisdictional amount. For federal diversity jurisdiction, the amount in controversy has to exceed $75,000. Here, the complaint is for $100,000 worth of goods, so that seems to meet the amount requirement.\n\nNext, diversity of citizenship. For diversity jurisdiction, all plaintiffs have to be citizens of different states than all defendants. The plaintiff is from State A, and the defendant retailer is incorporated in State C with its principal place of business in State B.\n\nNow, for a corporation, its citizenship is deemed to be the state where it is incorporated and the state where it has its principal place of business. So, the retailer is a citizen of both State C and State B.\n\nThe plaintiff is from State A, which is different from State C and State B. So, there is diversity of citizenship because the plaintiff and the defendant are citizens of different states.\n\nWait, but one of the options says that the retailer is a citizen of State B, and that's why removal isn't proper. But according to the general rule, a corporation is a citizen of both the state of incorporation and the state of its principal place of business.\n\nSo, the retailer is a citizen of State C and State B. The plaintiff is from State A, which is different from both.\n\nSo, diversity exists because no party shares the same state citizenship.\n\nBut, I recall that for diversity jurisdiction, complete diversity is required, meaning no plaintiff shares citizenship with any defendant.\n\nHere, the plaintiff is from State A, and the defendant is from State C and State B. Since State A is different from both State C and State B, diversity exists.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the retailer's citizenship in State B doesn't somehow affect diversity.\n\nWait, perhaps if the retailer is considered a citizen of State B, and the case is being filed in State B, there might be some issue with removing a case from the forum state.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nActually, under the diversity jurisdiction rule, as long as the plaintiff and defendant are citizens of different states, it doesn't matter if the case is filed in one of the defendant's forum states.\n\nSo, in this case, since the plaintiff is from State A and the defendant is from State C and State B, and the case is filed in State B, diversity still exists.\n\nTherefore, the case can be removed to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.\n\nNow, another factor is the timing of the removal. The retailer filed the notice of removal twenty days after being served.\n\nI need to check if that was timely.\n\nI think the rule is that the notice of removal must be filed within 30 days after the defendant receives the summons and complaint, or any time before a federal defense is due, whichever is earlier.\n\nIn this case, 20 days is less than 30 days, so it seems timely.\n\nBut, I should confirm the exact rule.\n\nAccording to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b), the notice of removal must be filed within 30 days after the receipt of the summons and complaint.\n\nSo, 20 days is within that period, so it's timely.\n\nTherefore, the removal was timely.\n\nSo, looking back at the options:\n\nA. No, because the notice of removal was not timely filed.\n\nBut, it was filed within 20 days, which is timely.\n\nSo, A is incorrect.\n\nB. No, because the retailer is a citizen of State B.\n\nBut, even though the retailer is a citizen of State B, the plaintiff is from State A, which is different.\n\nSo, diversity still exists.\n\nTherefore, B is incorrect.\n\nC. Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy.\n\nThis seems correct. Diversity exists, and the amount is over $75,000.\n\nD. Yes, because the retailer is a citizen of both State B and State C.\n\nWell, the retailer is a citizen of both State B and State C, but the relevant point is that the plaintiff is from State A, which is different from both.\n\nSo, while D is stating a fact, it's not the complete reason for removal.\n\nTherefore, C seems to be the best answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nIs there any rule that says a case can't be removed if the defendant is a citizen of the forum state?\n\nI think in some cases, like in cases where the case could have been filed in federal court originally, but I believe that's for cases like federal question jurisdiction.\n\nIn diversity cases, as long as complete diversity exists, and the amount is met, removal is permitted, regardless of the defendant's citizenship in the forum state.\n\nSo, even though the retailer is a citizen of State B, where the case was filed, removal is still allowed because diversity exists.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C: Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy.\n\nOption D is somewhat misleading because it only mentions the retailer's citizenship without referring to the plaintiff's citizenship.\n\nSo, I think C is the better answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
