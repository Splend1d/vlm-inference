The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"Before I left for vacation, I am sure I locked the shared apartment's front door.\"\n\nHmm, so this person is saying they locked the front door of a shared apartment before going on vacation. Is there anything morally wrong with that?\n\nWell, locking the door seems like a responsible thing to do, right? It helps keep the apartment secure and protects the belongings of the people living there. So, I don't see anything morally wrong with locking the door before leaving for vacation.\n\nScenario 2: \"Out of frustration I looked at the ground and spit into the campfire.\"\n\nOkay, this one is a bit different. Someone is frustrated and spits into a campfire. Is that morally wrong?\n\nSpitting into a campfire isn't exactly a nice thing to do, but is it morally wrong? Spitting in public or in someone's direction can be considered rude or disrespectful, but spitting into a campfire specifically seems more like a messy or potentially dangerous act, rather than a moral issue.\n\nThinking about it, campfires can be hot, and spitting into them might cause splattering or other annoyances, but it doesn't seem to harm anyone directly. Maybe it's just messy.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither of these scenarios seems to involve something clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, locking the door is responsible; in Scenario 2, spitting into the campfire is messy but not morally wrong.\n\nYes, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
