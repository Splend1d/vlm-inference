Message Confidentiality, B. Message Integrity, C. Message Splashing, D. Message Sending.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The key phrase here is \"must arrive at the receiver exactly as they were sent.\" So, it's about ensuring that the data doesn't change in any way during transmission.\n\nOption A is \"Message Confidentiality.\" I know that confidentiality is about keeping the data secret and only accessible to authorized parties. So, it's more about who can see the data, not so much about whether the data itself changes during transmission.\n\nOption B is \"Message Integrity.\" Integrity in data terms usually means that the data has not been altered or corrupted in some way. So, this seems pretty close to what the question is asking for\u2014ensuring that the data arrives exactly as it was sent, without any changes.\n\nOption C is \"Message Splashing.\" I'm not familiar with this term in the context of data transmission. It might be a made-up option to distract from the correct answer. I'll keep it in mind just in case, but for now, I'll assume it's not the right choice.\n\nOption D is \"Message Sending.\" Well, that's just the act of transmitting the message. It doesn't specify anything about the state of the message upon arrival, so it doesn't seem to fit the requirement of ensuring the data arrives unchanged.\n\nBetween these options, B. Message Integrity seems to be the most appropriate answer. To double-check, let's consider what message integrity entails. Message integrity mechanisms, such as checksums or hashes, are used to detect any changes to the data during transmission. If the data is altered in any way, these mechanisms can identify that something has changed, thus ensuring that the receiver gets the exact data that was sent.\n\nOn the other hand, message confidentiality is about privacy, making sure that only the intended recipient can read the message. Message splashing doesn't seem to be a standard term in data communication, and message sending is too general.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. Message Integrity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
