This is a common substitution in baseball, especially in crucial situations where a team wants to bring in a batter with specific skills or who is better suited for the situation at hand.\n\nLet's briefly look at the other options to understand why they are not correct:\n\nA. Switch hitter: This term refers to a batter who is skilled at batting from both sides of the plate, meaning they can bat left-handed or right-handed depending on the situation or the pitcher they are facing.\n\nB. Shadow hitter: This isn't a standard term in baseball. It might be used colloquially in some contexts, but it's not recognized in official baseball terminology.\n\nC. Clip hitter: Again, this isn't a standard term in baseball. It's possible that someone might use this term informally, but it's not part of the official vocabulary of the sport.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Pinch hitter.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nIn baseball, substitutions, including pinch hitters, are subject to certain rules. For example, once a batter has been substituted for, they cannot return to the game. This is known as the \"once removed, forever removed\" rule. However, there are some exceptions and nuances to this rule, depending on the specific circumstances and the league's regulations.\n\nPinch hitters are often used in critical situations, such as when a team needs a specific type of hitter to face a particular pitcher, or when the regular batter is struggling at the plate. Managers will sometimes keep certain players in the game as pinch hitting options, even if they aren't starting in the field, to have versatile batting options available.\n\nUnderstanding the roles and terminology in baseball is essential for both players and fans to appreciate the strategic depth of the game."
