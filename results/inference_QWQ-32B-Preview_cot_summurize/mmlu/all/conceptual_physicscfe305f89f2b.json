I need to figure out what the period is for a wave that has a frequency of 10 Hz.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what frequency and period mean. Frequency is the number of cycles or waves that pass a point per second, and it's measured in Hertz (Hz). So, 10 Hz means there are 10 waves per second.\n\nThe period, on the other hand, is the time it takes for one complete wave to pass a point. It's the reciprocal of the frequency. So, if frequency is cycles per second, period is seconds per cycle.\n\nThe formula that relates frequency (f) and period (T) is:\n\nT = 1 / f\n\nGiven that the frequency f is 10 Hz, I can plug that into the formula:\n\nT = 1 / 10 Hz\n\nNow, 1 divided by 10 is 0.1, and since Hz is cycles per second, the unit for period is seconds.\n\nSo, T = 0.1 seconds\n\nBut looking at the options, option A is 1/10 s, which is the same as 0.1 seconds. Option B is 1.0 s, option C is 10 s, and option D is None of these.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A, 1/10 s.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Frequency is 10 Hz, which means 10 cycles per second. So, the time for one cycle should indeed be 1 divided by 10, which is 0.1 seconds.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the period is 0.1 seconds, which is equivalent to 1/10 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 1/10 s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
