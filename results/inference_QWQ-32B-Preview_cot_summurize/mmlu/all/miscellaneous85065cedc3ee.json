                    "text": "Let's think about this question: \"When born, a Dalmatian puppy is always?\" and the options are A. Black, B. black with white spots, C. white, D. white with black spots.\n\nI know that Dalmatians are known for their spotted coats, usually with black or liver-colored spots on a white background. But I'm not sure what they look like when they're first born.\n\nI remember that some dog breeds are born with a different coat color that changes as they grow. For example, Golden Retrievers are born with darker fur that lightens as they mature.\n\nSo, maybe Dalmatians are born with a different coat and develop spots later. Let me think about that.\n\nI've seen pictures of Dalmatian puppies, and sometimes they look almost entirely white with just a few spots or none at all. Maybe they are born white and the spots develop as they get older.\n\nWait, but option C is white, and D is white with black spots. If they are born mostly white, maybe with some spots, then D might be the answer.\n\nBut the question says \"always,\" so I need to make sure that all Dalmatian puppies are like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are born with black fur and the spots appear as they grow, but that doesn't make sense because spots are areas of different color.\n\nLet me try to recall if I've read anything about Dalmatian puppies before.\n\nI think I read that Dalmatian puppies are born with pure white coats and their spots develop within a few weeks after birth. If that's the case, then the answer would be C. white.\n\nBut I need to confirm that.\n\nAnother thought: maybe they are born with black fur and white spots appear later. But that seems less likely because spots are usually areas of lighter color.\n\nWait, no, Dalmatians have dark spots on a white background, so it makes sense that they are born white and the spots develop over time.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, if they are born completely white and then develop spots as they get older, then the answer should be C. white.\n\nBut let me check if there are any exceptions to this.\n\nI recall that Dalmatians are born with a pure white coat and their spots become apparent within a few weeks. The spots are formed as the black or liver pigment develops in their skin.\n\nAlso, I think their skin has pigmented spots even before the fur changes color, so you can see where the spots will be if you look closely.\n\nTherefore, at birth, they are entirely white.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. white.\n\nBut let's consider option D: white with black spots. If they are born with some spots already visible, then this could be a possibility.\n\nHowever, from what I remember, they are born completely white, and the spots develop gradually over the first few weeks of life.\n\nTherefore, option C seems more accurate.\n\nTo be thorough, I should consider if there are any Dalmatians that are born with spots right away.\n\nI don't think so; I believe they are all born white.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. white.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
