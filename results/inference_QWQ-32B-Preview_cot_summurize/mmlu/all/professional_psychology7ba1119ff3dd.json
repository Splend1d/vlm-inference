This style is characterized by a child who is initially hesitant or cautious in new situations but eventually adapts and participates with some encouragement. In this scenario, the child holds onto her mother's hand and observes the other children before gradually engaging in an activity with some coaxing from the teacher. This behavior aligns with the slow-to-warm-up temperament, where children take time to adjust to new environments and social interactions.\n\nOption A, \"Easy,\" typically describes children who adapt quickly to new situations, are sociable, and have a positive disposition. Option B, \"Difficult,\" refers to children who may be irritable, have irregular routines, and are resistant to change. Option D, \"Secure,\" is more related to attachment styles rather than temperament styles, describing children who feel safe and confident exploring their environment with a trusted caregiver nearby.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C. Slow to warm up."
