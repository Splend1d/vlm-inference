The question is: \"According to Butler, the degree to which one acts compassionately depends on:\n\nA. the strength of his affection of compassion.\n\nB. the strength of his other affections besides compassion.\n\nC. both a and b.\n\nD. neither a nor b.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what Butler says about compassion and how it influences our actions. Butler is a moral philosopher, and he has some specific ideas about morality and human nature.\n\nFirst, I remember that Butler believes in the concept of conscience, which he sees as the supreme governor of our actions. He also discusses various affections that humans have, and compassion is one of them.\n\nAffections, in Butler's terminology, are natural dispositions or inclinations that humans possess. Compassion is an affection that moves us to feel for the suffering of others and motivates us to help them.\n\nNow, the question is about the degree to which we act compassionately. So, it's not just whether we have compassion or not, but how strongly we act on it.\n\nOption A says it depends on the strength of his affection of compassion. That makes sense. If someone has a strong sense of compassion, they are more likely to act compassionately.\n\nOption B says it depends on the strength of his other affections besides compassion. This also seems plausible because other affections, like self-interest or ambition, might compete with compassion and influence how much we act compassionately.\n\nOption C combines both A and B, suggesting that both the strength of compassion and the strength of other affections affect the degree of compassionate action.\n\nOption D says neither A nor B, which would mean that the degree of compassionate action doesn't depend on the strength of affections at all. That seems unlikely given Butler's emphasis on affections in moral decision-making.\n\nLooking back at Butler's text, I recall that he discusses how different affections can conflict with each other. For example, self-love might sometimes conflict with benevolence or compassion. So, the strength of compassion versus the strength of self-love would determine how one acts in a given situation.\n\nTherefore, it seems that both the strength of compassion and the strength of other affections play a role in determining the degree to which one acts compassionately.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. both a and b.\n\nBut let me double-check. If someone has a very strong affection of compassion and weak other affections, they are likely to act very compassionately. Conversely, if their other affections are strong and compete with compassion, their compassionate actions might be less pronounced.\n\nYes, that aligns with Butler's view on the interaction between different affections.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. both a and b.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
