                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about how Humanism (HM) has developed during and since the Cold War. The options are a bit confusing, but I'll break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Humanism in security studies is. I think Humanism focuses on the value and dignity of individuals, and in security studies, it might emphasize protecting people and their rights rather than just focusing on state security or military power.\n\nNow, during the Cold War, the security paradigm was mostly about the balance of power between the US and the Soviet Union, right? It was a time of nuclear deterrence and proxy wars. So, I imagine that Humanism might not have been a central concern in security studies at that time because the focus was more on state survival and power politics.\n\nOption A says that after the Cold War, there's been a growing disparity between security studies and Humanism, sidelining Humanism. That doesn't sound right to me because after the Cold War, there was a broadening of the security agenda to include things like human security, which is closely related to Humanism.\n\nOption B says that Humanism was popular during the Cold War and has been gradually included in security dialogue, now being one of the main paradigms. But I don't think Humanism was that popular during the Cold War, given the context I just mentioned.\n\nOption C says that Humanism was restricted and excluded during the Cold War due to negativity towards it, but after the Cold War, as the security studies agenda broadened, Humanism has been included more. This seems plausible because after the Cold War, there was more attention to issues like human rights, ethnic conflicts, and humanitarian intervention, which align with Humanism.\n\nOption D says that Humanism was developed as an approach to security studies following the Cold War and has flourished since then, thanks to its affiliation with prominent actors during the Cold War. This seems a bit confusing because it suggests that Humanism was developed after the Cold War but was affiliated with prominent actors during it. Maybe some Humanist ideas were present during the Cold War, but they became more prominent afterward.\n\nConsidering these options, I think Option C makes the most sense. Humanism was likely sidelined during the Cold War because of the focus on state security and deterrence, but after the Cold War, as security studies expanded to include more non-traditional threats and human-centric issues, Humanism has gained more inclusion and recognition.\n\nTo confirm this, maybe I should think about some key developments in security studies post-Cold War. For example, the concept of human security was promoted by the United Nations in the 1990s, which emphasizes protecting individuals from a range of threats, including poverty, disease, and political violence. This seems aligned with Humanist values.\n\nAlso, the rise of critical security studies and the Copenhagen School's broadening of security to include more than just military threats could be seen as incorporating Humanist perspectives.\n\nOn the other hand, during the Cold War, security studies were more dominated by realist perspectives, focusing on state survival and power politics, which might have marginalized Humanist approaches.\n\nTherefore, I believe that Option C accurately describes the development of Humanism in security studies during and since the Cold War.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
