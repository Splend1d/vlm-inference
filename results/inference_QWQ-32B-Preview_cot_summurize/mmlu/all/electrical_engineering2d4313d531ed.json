It is designed to generate a specific frequency and waveform, typically a sine wave, which is essential in many electronic applications such as radio communications, signal generation, and testing equipment.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. LC oscillator: LC oscillators use an inductor (L) and a capacitor (C) in their tank circuit to determine the frequency of oscillation. They are known for producing high-quality sine waves and are commonly used in radio frequency (RF) applications. Therefore, LC oscillators are sinusoidal oscillators.\n\nB. RC phase shift oscillator: This type of oscillator uses resistors (R) and capacitors (C) to create a phase shift necessary for oscillation. By properly designing the phase shift network, it can produce a sine wave output. Hence, RC phase shift oscillators are also sinusoidal oscillators.\n\nC. Relaxation oscillator: Relaxation oscillators produce non-sinusoidal waves, such as square waves or sawtooth waves, through the charging and discharging of a capacitor between two threshold levels. They are not designed to produce sine waves but are used in applications requiring periodic non-sinusoidal signals, such as timing circuits and switching power supplies. Therefore, relaxation oscillators are not sinusoidal oscillators.\n\nD. Crystal oscillator: Crystal oscillators use the mechanical resonance of a quartz crystal to generate a highly stable and accurate frequency. They are widely used in clocks, computers, and other electronic devices that require a precise time base. Crystal oscillators produce sinusoidal outputs, making them sinusoidal oscillators.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Relaxation oscillator\n\nRelaxation oscillators are not sinusoidal oscillators because they produce non-sinusoidal waveforms such as square waves or sawtooth waves, rather than the smooth sine waves generated by LC, RC phase shift, and crystal oscillators.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
