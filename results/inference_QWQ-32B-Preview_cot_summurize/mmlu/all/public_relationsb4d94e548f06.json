Let's see what each option means and which one fits best.\n\nOption A is \"public issues.\" I think this refers to broader problems or concerns that the public has, which a PR campaign might address. But the question is about proactively planning for and managing crises, which seems more specific than just dealing with public issues.\n\nOption B is \"crisis management.\" That sounds right because crisis management is all about preparing for and responding to crises. The description in the question matches exactly with what crisis management entails: planning a response strategy, implementing it during a crisis, evaluating it afterward, and revising it for future improvements.\n\nOption C is \"consumer relations.\" This seems more about maintaining relationships with customers, handling their complaints, and improving customer satisfaction. While crisis management can involve consumer relations, especially if the crisis affects customers, the core of consumer relations isn't about crisis response.\n\nOption D is \"community relations.\" This is about building and maintaining relationships with the local community. Again, while community relations can be impacted by crises and might need to be managed during such times, it's not specifically about crisis response planning and management.\n\nSo, based on this, I believe the correct answer is B, crisis management. It directly aligns with the activities described in the question: planning, implementing, evaluating, and revising response strategies for crises.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
