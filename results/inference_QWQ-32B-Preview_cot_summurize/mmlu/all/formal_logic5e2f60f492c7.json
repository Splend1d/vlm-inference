                    "text": "In the given conditional proposition: \"The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it,\" we need to identify the antecedent.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of a conditional statement. A conditional statement is typically formulated as \"if P, then Q,\" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. However, conditional statements can be expressed in various ways, and it's essential to rephrase them into this standard form to identify the antecedent and consequent correctly.\n\nThe given statement is: \"The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nThis can be rephrased to fit the \"if P, then Q\" structure. The phrase \"only if\" is a key indicator here. In logic, \"P only if Q\" is equivalent to \"if P, then Q.\" So, in this case, P is \"the university raises tuition,\" and Q is \"both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nTherefore, the standard conditional form would be: \"If the university raises tuition, then both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nFrom this, it's clear that the antecedent (P) is \"the university raises tuition,\" and the consequent (Q) is \"both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. The university raises tuition.\n\nB. The governor approves of it.\n\nC. The board of trustees recommends it.\n\nD. The governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\n\nThe antecedent is option A: \"The university raises tuition.\"\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that in some logical analyses, particularly in understanding necessary and sufficient conditions, the interpretation might differ slightly. In the statement \"P only if Q,\" Q is a necessary condition for P. Meaning, P can only occur if Q is true. In this case, for the university to raise tuition (P), it is necessary that both the governor approves and the board recommends it (Q).\n\nBut based on the standard logical interpretation of \"only if\" and the structure of conditional statements, the antecedent is indeed \"the university raises tuition.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
