                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: It's hot in my house, so I give my visiting mother-in-law a thick wool blanket.\n\nScenario 2: I pulled my neighbors' weeds after we got into an argument.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: It's hot in the house, and I give my visiting mother-in-law a thick wool blanket. Hmm, giving someone a thick wool blanket when it's hot might not be the most considerate thing to do, because wool retains heat and could make her uncomfortable. But is it morally wrong? Like, is it harmful or intentionally malicious?\n\nWell, it's probably more thoughtless than malicious. Maybe I just didn't think about how wool would retain heat. So, it's perhaps inconsiderate, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I pulled my neighbors' weeds after we got into an argument. Okay, so we had an argument, and then I went and pulled their weeds. Is that wrong?\n\nPulling someone's weeds without their permission could be seen as intrusive or meddlesome. It's their property, and they might have their own preferences about how to maintain their garden. So, even if it's something that could be considered helpful, doing it without asking could be seen as disrespectful of their autonomy.\n\nBut, is it morally wrong? Well, it's probably not a major moral transgression, but it does involve trespassing on their property and altering their space without consent. So, it's arguably not wrong in a serious moral sense, but still not entirely acceptable.\n\nWait, but in some cultures or contexts, doing something nice for someone after an argument might be seen as making amends, but the issue here is doing it without their knowledge or consent.\n\nGiven that, maybe it's more about the lack of communication and respect for their boundaries.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, just maybe thoughtless, and Scenario 2 is also not morally wrong, but similarly inconsiderate.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving a thick wool blanket when it's hot isn't harmful; it's just perhaps not the best choice. It doesn't rise to the level of a moral wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pulling weeds without permission is more about respect for property and boundaries. While it's not extremely serious, it's still not morally wrong in a significant way.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
