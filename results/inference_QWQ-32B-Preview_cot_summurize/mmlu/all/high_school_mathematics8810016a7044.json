                    "text": "To find out how many diagonals are in a regular octagon, we can use a formula that applies to any polygon. The general formula for the number of diagonals in an n-sided polygon is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{n(n - 3)}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of sides (or vertices) of the polygon.\n\nAn octagon has 8 sides, so \\( n = 8 \\). Plugging this into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{8(8 - 3)}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, a regular octagon has 20 diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it by considering that each vertex connects to every other vertex except itself and its two adjacent vertices. So, for each vertex, there are \\( n - 3 \\) diagonals. Since there are \\( n \\) vertices, this would initially suggest \\( n(n - 3) \\) diagonals. However, this counts each diagonal twice (once from each end), so we divide by 2 to get the correct number.\n\nLet's verify this with a smaller polygon to ensure the formula makes sense. Take a quadrilateral (4 sides):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{4(4 - 3)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 1}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\nIndeed, a quadrilateral has 2 diagonals, which matches our formula.\n\nApplying this to an octagon:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{8(8 - 3)}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 5}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
