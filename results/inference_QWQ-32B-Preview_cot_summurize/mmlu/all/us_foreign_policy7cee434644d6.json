These include the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel (which has a policy of nuclear ambiguity but is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons). Therefore, the correct answer would be A. Fewer than 7, but this seems incorrect because nine is more than seven. It's possible there might be a mistake in the options provided or in the current count. However, based on the most widely accepted information, there are nine nuclear-armed states."
