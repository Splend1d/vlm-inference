                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about strong organizational culture. So, the question is: \"Which of the following is true of strong organizational culture?\" and we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what a strong organizational culture means. A strong organizational culture refers to a situation where the company's values, beliefs, and ways of doing things are clearly defined and widely shared among its members. It's like everyone in the organization is on the same page about how things should be done and what's important.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"It can facilitate cultural and other types of change.\" Hmm, that sounds interesting. Usually, when we think about change in organizations, we might think that a strong culture could resist change because things are already set in a particular way. But on the other hand, if the culture is strong and everyone is aligned, maybe it can also help drive change effectively, especially if the change is aligned with the organization's core values. So, this could be possible.\n\nOption B states: \"It is correlated with low levels of job commitment.\" This seems counterintuitive. If an organization has a strong culture, you might expect that employees who identify with that culture would have higher job commitment because they feel a sense of belonging and purpose. So, low job commitment doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says: \"It is correlated with high levels of job performance.\" This makes sense. When there's a strong culture, employees are likely to be more clear about expectations, more motivated, and more aligned in their efforts, which could lead to better performance.\n\nOption D claims: \"It is correlated with high levels of voluntary job turnover.\" Again, this seems contradictory. If the culture is strong and positive, employees are likely to be more satisfied and committed, which should lead to lower turnover rates, not higher.\n\nSo, based on this initial thoughts, options B and D seem less likely, while options A and C seem more plausible.\n\nLet me think deeper about option A. Can a strong organizational culture facilitate change? Well, change in organizations can be challenging because it often requires shifting existing behaviors and beliefs. However, if the culture is strong and there's a shared understanding of the need for change, perhaps it can make the change process smoother. For example, if the organization values innovation and adaptation, then introducing new practices might be more accepted.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes strong cultures can be resistant to change because they are so entrenched in certain ways of doing things. So, maybe it's not always facilitative.\n\nComparing that to option C, which links strong culture to high job performance, this seems more straightforward. When employees are aligned with the organization's values and goals, they are likely to be more engaged and perform better.\n\nLet me consider some research on this topic. I recall that studies have shown a positive correlation between strong organizational culture and various positive outcomes, including employee satisfaction, commitment, and performance. So, option C seems consistent with that.\n\nHowever, I also remember that in some cases, a strong culture can lead to groupthink or resistance to external ideas, which might not always be beneficial. But in general, a strong culture is seen as advantageous.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is the most accurate statement among the ones provided.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's quickly revisit option A. While it's possible that a strong culture could facilitate change if the change is congruent with the existing values, it's not necessarily always the case. Maybe a strong culture can either facilitate or hinder change, depending on the situation.\n\nTherefore, stating that it \"can\" facilitate change is perhaps accurate, but it's not as directly correlated as the relationship between strong culture and job performance.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe that option C, \"It is correlated with high levels of job performance,\" is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
