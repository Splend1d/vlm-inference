                    "text": "So I've got this biology question here. It says, \"Imagine an organism whose 2n = 96. Meiosis would leave this organism\u2019s cells with how many chromosomes?\" And there are options: A. 192, B. 96, C. 48, D. 24. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"2n\" refers to the diploid number of chromosomes in an organism. Diploid means that the organism has two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. So, if 2n = 96, that means the organism has 96 chromosomes in its somatic (body) cells.\n\nNow, meiosis is the type of cell division that produces gametes, like sperm or eggs, which have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This process reduces the chromosome number from diploid to haploid.\n\nHaploid is denoted by \"n,\" which would be half of 2n. So, if 2n = 96, then n should be 48. Wait, but let me make sure. Diploid is 2n, so haploid is n. Therefore, n = 96 / 2 = 48.\n\nSo, after meiosis, the resulting cells should have n = 48 chromosomes.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 192 \u2013 that's 2 times 96, which would be tetraploid or something, but that's not what meiosis does.\n\nB. 96 \u2013 that's the starting number, the diploid number. Meiosis should reduce it.\n\nC. 48 \u2013 that matches my calculation for haploid number.\n\nD. 24 \u2013 that's half of 48, which would be n/2, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Meiosis has two divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II. In meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes separate, reducing the chromosome number by half. So, starting with 96 chromosomes, after meiosis I, we should have cells with 48 chromosomes.\n\nThen, in meiosis II, the sister chromatids separate, but the chromosome number remains the same, at 48.\n\nSo, at the end of meiosis, we have haploid cells with n = 48 chromosomes.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps the organism has more than two sets of chromosomes. But the question specifies \"2n = 96,\" which indicates it's diploid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a polyploid organism, but the notation 2n usually implies diploid.\n\nWait, perhaps the organism is tetraploid, and 2n = 96 means n = 48, so 4n = 96. But that wouldn't make sense with the standard notation. Typically, n is the haploid number, and 2n is diploid.\n\nLet me look up quickly how chromosome notation works.\n\nOkay, standard notation: n is haploid number, 2n is diploid, 3n is triploid, 4n is tetraploid, and so on.\n\nSo, if 2n = 96, then n = 48.\n\nMeiosis reduces 2n to n.\n\nTherefore, meiosis would produce cells with n = 48 chromosomes.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 48.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any misunderstanding here.\n\nPerhaps the organism has 2n = 96, meaning it's diploid with 96 chromosomes, but maybe meiosis works differently in some organisms.\n\nWait, in some organisms, like plants, polyploidy is common. For example, wheat is hexaploid, with 6n = 42, so n = 7.\n\nBut in this case, it's clearly stated \"2n = 96,\" which points to diploid with 96 chromosomes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the organism is tetraploid, and 2n = 96 means 4n = 96, so n = 24.\n\nWait, that would make it tetraploid, with 4n = 96, so n = 24.\n\nBut the notation \"2n = 96\" suggests that 2n equals 96, meaning n = 48.\n\nUnless the organism is tetraploid and 2n = 96 means it has four sets of chromosomes.\n\nWait, in that case, n would be 24, and 2n would be 48, but that contradicts the given 2n = 96.\n\nSo, perhaps it's 4n = 96, meaning n = 24.\n\nBut the question says \"2n = 96,\" which typically indicates diploid with 96 chromosomes.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try to clarify:\n\n- Diploid: 2n\n\n- Haploid: n\n\n- Tetraploid: 4n\n\nIf 2n = 96, then n = 48.\n\nBut if the organism is tetraploid, then 4n = 96, meaning n = 24.\n\nBut the question says \"2n = 96,\" which seems to indicate diploid with 96 chromosomes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the organism is hexaploid, with 6n = 96, so n = 16.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no. If 2n = 96, then n = 48, regardless of the ploidy level.\n\nUnless the notation is being used differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider that in some contexts, 2n refers to the total number of chromosomes in a haploid set.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me think differently. Meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half.\n\nSo, starting with 2n = 96, meiosis should produce cells with n = 48 chromosomes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 48.\n\nBut perhaps the question is tricky and is considering something else, like the number of chromosomes after both meiosis I and meiosis II.\n\nWait, meiosis consists of meiosis I and meiosis II.\n\nAfter meiosis I, the chromosome number is reduced to n, which is 48.\n\nThen, in meiosis II, the sister chromatids separate, but the chromosome number remains at n = 48.\n\nSo, at the end of meiosis, we have haploid cells with 48 chromosomes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 48.\n\nMaybe the other options are there to confuse me:\n\n- A. 192: that's 2 times 96, which would be unlikely.\n\n- B. 96: that's the starting number, not after meiosis.\n\n- C. 48: correct, as it's n.\n\n- D. 24: that would be n/2, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, if the organism is tetraploid, with 4n = 96, then n = 24, and meiosis would produce diploid cells with 2n = 48, which contradicts the initial assumption.\n\nBut the question specifies \"2n = 96,\" which suggests diploid with 96 chromosomes.\n\nTherefore, meiosis would produce haploid cells with n = 48 chromosomes.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 48.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
