Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\n\"On the 4th of March next this party [the Republican party] will take possession of the government. It has announced that the South shall be excluded from the common territory, that the judicial tribunal shall be made sectional, and that a war must be waged against slavery until it shall cease throughout the United States.

Southern Democrats appealed to the powers of Congress to stop military action against South Carolina.\n\nB. Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nC. Other Southern states seceded from the Union, forming the Confederacy.\n\nD. Jefferson Davis drafted Confederate soldiers into war, defending the siege on Fort Sumter.\n\nAlright, so South Carolina seceded, and I need to figure out what happened right after that. Let's think about the sequence of events during that time.\n\nFirst, South Carolina seceded in December 1860. Now, what happened immediately after that?\n\nOption A says that Southern Democrats appealed to Congress to stop military action against South Carolina. Hmm, I don't recall any immediate military action against South Carolina right after secession. The first military action was more related to Fort Sumter, which was later on.\n\nOption B says Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. I know that the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863, which is a few years after South Carolina seceded. So that can't be immediate.\n\nOption C says other Southern states seceded, forming the Confederacy. That does sound plausible. After South Carolina seceded, other states did follow suit and eventually formed the Confederacy.\n\nOption D mentions Jefferson Davis drafting soldiers to defend Fort Sumter. Again, Fort Sumter was besieged in 1861, after several states had already seceded.\n\nSo, considering the timeline, the immediate consequence would likely be other states seceding. Let me confirm that.\n\nSouth Carolina seceded on December 20, 1860. Then, in the following months, several other states seceded: Mississippi on January 9, 1861; Florida on January 10; Alabama on January 11; Georgia on January 19; Louisiana on January 26; and Texas on February 1. These seven states formed the Confederate States of America on February 8, 1861.\n\nSo, indeed, other Southern states seceded shortly after South Carolina, leading to the formation of the Confederacy.\n\nOption A doesn't seem accurate because there wasn't immediate military action against South Carolina right after secession. Option B is incorrect due to the timing of the Emancipation Proclamation. Option D is also not immediate, as Fort Sumter was besieged in April 1861, after the Confederacy was formed and after Lincoln's inauguration.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C: Other Southern states seceded from the Union, forming the Confederacy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\n"
