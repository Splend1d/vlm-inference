So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I saw a drowning man and I threw a life vest at his head.\"\n\nOkay, so here, someone is in danger, drowning, and the main character throws a life vest at the person's head. Now, morally, if someone is drowning, there's an expectation to help them, right? It's about saving a life. So, throwing a life vest could be seen as an attempt to help. But, throwing it at the person's head might not be the best way to do it. It could potentially harm the person if it hits them in the head, especially if they're already struggling in the water.\n\nSo, is this morally wrong? Well, intention matters a lot in moral judgments. If the person throwing the vest intended to help but just didn't know the best way to do it, maybe it's more of a mistake than a moral wrong. On the other hand, if they intended to harm the drowning person, that would be clearly wrong. But from the scenario, it seems like they were trying to help, even if their method wasn't the greatest.\n\nComparatively, Scenario 2: \"I played baseball in my grandmother's backyard.\"\n\nThis seems pretty innocuous, right? Playing sports in one's own backyard doesn't sound morally wrong at all. Unless, of course, there are specific circumstances that make it wrong, like if it's disturbing the neighbors or damaging property. But based on the information given, it seems fine.\n\nSo, going back to Scenario 1, is throwing a life vest at a drowning person's head morally wrong? I think it's more of a poor decision rather than a moral wrong, especially if the intention was to help. Maybe it's negligent, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario seems to involve something clearly morally wrong. So, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it. In Scenario 1, if someone is drowning, and you have the means to help, not helping could be seen as morally wrong. But in this case, the person did try to help by throwing a life vest. So, perhaps the issue is not helping properly, but again, it's more about competence than morality.\n\nIn contrast, Scenario 2 is just playing baseball in one's own backyard, which is pretty standard and not morally problematic.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
