                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the European Court of Human Rights and positive obligations of states. The question is asking which of the options hasn't been developed by the court as a situation where the state has a positive obligation to protect. Let's go through each option one by one to see which one doesn't fit.\n\nOption A is \"when the applicant is in the custody of the state.\" I know that when someone is in state custody, like in prison or under some form of detention, the state has a clear responsibility to ensure their safety and well-being. The European Court of Human Rights has definitely recognized that the state has positive obligations in these situations to protect the rights of those in their care. So, this seems like it's established.\n\nOption B is \"where the state must investigate claims against it.\" Again, this sounds familiar. The court has held that states have a duty to protect individuals' rights, which includes investigating allegations of rights violations. This is especially true in cases involving allegations of torture or ill-treatment by state officials. So, it seems like this is another established positive obligation.\n\nOption C is \"the development of a legal framework to protect those within the state.\" This makes sense too. The state has to put in place laws and institutions that protect the rights of its citizens and residents. The European Court of Human Rights has emphasized the importance of a proper legal framework to safeguard human rights. So, this is probably also an established positive obligation.\n\nOption D is \"to provide housing for all those homeless within a state.\" Hmm, this one seems different from the others. While housing is certainly an important social issue, I'm not sure if the European Court of Human Rights has established a general positive obligation on states to provide housing for all homeless people. I think housing falls more under social and economic rights, which are often considered more programmatic and less immediately enforceable compared to civil and political rights.\n\nLet me think about this again. Maybe I should look back at some key cases or principles from the European Court of Human Rights to confirm.\n\nI recall that the European Convention on Human Rights mostly focuses on civil and political rights, and while it does recognize certain social rights, they are perhaps not as extensively developed as the core civil and political rights.\n\nIn terms of positive obligations, the court has indeed recognized that states have duties to act positively in order to ensure rights are protected, beyond just abstaining from interference.\n\nFor example, in the case of De Smith and Others v. United Kingdom, the court found that the state has a positive obligation to protect property rights, which is covered under Article 1 of Protocol 1.\n\nSimilarly, in cases like Osman v. United Kingdom, the court held that there is a positive obligation on states to protect individuals from violence, even when the threat comes from private individuals.\n\nBut regarding housing, I'm not sure. Maybe there are specific circumstances where the court has required states to take positive measures to ensure adequate housing, but not necessarily a blanket obligation to provide housing for all homeless people.\n\nPerhaps it's more accurate to say that the court may require states to take certain steps to prevent homelessness or to ensure that homeless people have access to basic necessities, but not to provide housing for everyone who is homeless.\n\nI think option D is the one that hasn't been developed as a general positive obligation by the European Court of Human Rights. It's possible that in specific cases, housing issues have been addressed, but not to the extent of requiring states to provide housing for all homeless individuals.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. To provide housing for all those homeless within a state.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
