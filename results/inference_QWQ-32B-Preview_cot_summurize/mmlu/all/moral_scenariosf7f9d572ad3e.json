This seems problematic because withholding help from someone in need, especially something as basic as a blanket for warmth, could be seen as morally wrong. It's expected in many moral frameworks to assist those who are suffering or in distress, and hiding a blanket suggests intentional prevention of that assistance.\n\nIn Scenario 2, there isn't enough food for everyone at the dinner table, but the main character ensures their kids get something to eat. This seems like a protective and caring action, prioritizing the needs of their children, which is generally considered acceptable and even commendable in many cultures. Parents are often expected to look after their children's well-being, sometimes at the expense of their own needs.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1 appears to be morally wrong because it involves withholding help from someone in need.\n\n- Scenario 2 does not appear to be morally wrong; in fact, it seems like a responsible and caring action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
