                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving three parcels of land\u2014A, B, and C\u2014on a mountain, with different ownership histories and a shared drainage system. The question is about how the drainage system would most likely be defined from the standpoint of the friend and the cousin who own parcels B and C, respectively.\n\nLet me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original owner owned all three parcels and built a private drainage system that ran across all of them, draining sewage from parcel A to a municipal sewer at the bottom of the mountain. Then, in 2005, he sold parcel B to his friend, and in 2006, sold parcel C to his cousin. The deeds for both sales didn't mention the drainage system.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the most likely definition of this drainage system from the perspective of the friend and the cousin.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Easement appurtenant.\n\nB. Easement by implication.\n\nC. Prescriptive easement.\n\nD. Express easement.\n\nOkay, let's understand what each of these means.\n\nAn easement is a nonpossessory interest in land that allows the holder to use another's property for a specific purpose.\n\n1. **Easement appurtenant**: This is an easement that benefits one piece of land (the dominant estate) and is burdened by another piece of land (the servient estate). It typically transfers with the land automatically when the land is sold.\n\n2. **Easement by implication**: This arises when there is a necessity or a clear indication that an easement was intended, even if not expressly stated. For example, if a landowner sells a parcel that has no access to a road except through another parcel he owns, there might be an implied easement for access.\n\n3. **Prescriptive easement**: This is acquired through continuous and open use of another's property for a statutory period, similar to adverse possession but for a right of use rather than ownership.\n\n4. **Express easement**: This is explicitly granted in a deed or other legal document.\n\nIn this scenario, the drainage system was built by the original owner when he owned all three parcels. Then he sold parcels B and C separately, with deeds that didn't mention the drainage system.\n\nFrom the friend's and cousin's perspective, they bought their parcels without any mention of the drainage system in the deeds. So, it's not an express easement because it wasn't explicitly granted.\n\nIs it an easement appurtenant? Well, if the drainage system benefits parcel A (where the sewage originates) and runs across parcels B and C, then parcel A is the dominant estate, and parcels B and C are the servient estates. If this easement appurtenant was created when the original owner owned all parcels, and it benefits parcel A, then when parcels B and C were sold, the easement should run with the land, binding the new owners.\n\nBut the deeds didn't mention it. Does that matter? Typically, an easement appurtenant is binding on subsequent owners, even if not mentioned in the deed, as long as it's apparent or the buyer had notice of it.\n\nIn this case, the drainage system is underground, so it might not be immediately apparent, but the friend and cousin are presumably aware of its existence since it's a necessary part of the sewage drainage.\n\nAlternatively, could it be an easement by implication? Maybe when the original owner sold parcel B to his friend, there was an implication that the drainage system would continue to function as it had, especially if it was necessary for the reasonable use of parcel A.\n\nSimilarly, when the cousin bought parcel C, the same logic might apply.\n\nPrescriptive easement seems less likely because it requires continuous use without the owner's permission for a statutory period. Here, the original owner built the system and owned all parcels at the time, so it wasn't without permission.\n\nExpress easement was not granted explicitly in the deeds.\n\nGiven that, I think the most likely definition is an easement appurtenant. It benefits parcel A and burdens parcels B and C, and it should run with the land even upon sale, especially if it's necessary for the use of parcel A.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because the deeds didn't mention it. Maybe I need to consider whether the lack of mention in the deed affects the continuation of the easement.\n\nIn property law, an easement appurtenant is not defeated by the sale of the servient estate unless the new owner was unaware of the easement and it wasn't apparent. In this case, the drainage system is underground, so it might not be obvious, but the friend and cousin might have known about it, especially if they inspected the property before buying.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's an easement by implication because when the original owner sold parcel B, there was an implication that the drainage system would continue to operate as it had, being necessary for the use of parcel A.\n\nSimilarly, when parcel C was sold, the same implication might apply.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the specific legal definitions to be sure.\n\nLet me consider that when the original owner sold parcel B to his friend in 2005, the drainage system was already in place. If the friend knew about it or should have known about it, then an easement appurtenant might still bind the friend's parcel B.\n\nThen, when the cousin bought parcel C in 2006, the same logic might apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the drainage system creates an easement by implication because it's necessary for the reasonable use of parcel A.\n\nWait, but parcel A is still owned by the original owner, at least based on the information given. He sold B and C but retained A.\n\nSo, from the friend's and cousin's perspective, they bought their parcels subject to an existing easement that benefits parcel A.\n\nIn that case, even if the deeds didn't mention the drainage system, the easement appurtenant might still be binding on them, especially if it's necessary for the use of parcel A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an argument for an easement by implication here.\n\nLet me think about the elements required for an easement by implication.\n\nGenerally, there are two types: easement by implication from prior use and easement by necessity.\n\nEasement by implication from prior use requires that at the time of severance (when the original owner sold parcel B), the servient estate (parcel B) was being used to benefit the dominant estate (parcel A), and the use was apparent, continuous, and necessary.\n\nIn this case, the drainage system was built in 2000 when the original owner owned all three parcels, and he sold B in 2005 and C in 2006. So, at the time of selling B, the drainage system was already in place and in use.\n\nWas the use apparent? The pipeline is underground, so maybe not obvious, but perhaps the effects or connections would be known upon inspection.\n\nWas it continuous? Presumably, if it's a drainage system, it's in continuous use.\n\nWas it necessary for the use and enjoyment of parcel A? Well, it drains sewage to the municipal sewer, so likely yes, it's necessary.\n\nSimilarly, when parcel C was sold, the same considerations would apply.\n\nTherefore, from the friend's and cousin's standpoint, the drainage system might be considered an easement by implication, as it was in continuous and apparent use at the time of severance, and necessary for the use of parcel A.\n\nAlternatively, it could be seen as an easement appurtenant that automatically transferred with the land upon sale, binding the new owners.\n\nGiven that, I think the most accurate answer is B. easement by implication.\n\nBut I'm still a bit uncertain because I feel like easement appurtenant also fits.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the difference between the two.\n\nAn easement appurtenant is typically created when there's a need for access or something similar between two parcels owned by different owners.\n\nIn this case, the drainage system was built when all parcels were owned by the same person, so perhaps an easement appurtenant wasn't formally created at that time.\n\nThen, when the original owner sold parcels B and C, the drainage system continued to operate, potentially creating an easement by implication because it's necessary for the use of parcel A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original owner retained the easement appurtenant when he sold parcels B and C, especially if the deeds didn't mention it.\n\nI'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nLet me consider that in the deeds for parcels B and C, there was no mention of the drainage system.\n\nDoes that mean the easement appurtenant doesn't bind the new owners?\n\nGenerally, an easement appurtenant runs with the land and binds subsequent owners, even if not mentioned in the deed, provided that the easement is apparent or the buyer had notice of it.\n\nIn this case, the drainage system is underground, so it might not be immediately apparent, but if the friend and cousin knew about it or should have known about it upon inspection, they may be bound by the easement.\n\nAlternatively, the lack of mention in the deeds might be interpreted as releasing the new owners from any easement that wasn't expressly noted.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider the intentions of the original owner.\n\nHe built the drainage system when he owned all parcels, and then sold B and C separately without mentioning the drainage system in the deeds.\n\nPerhaps he intended for the drainage system to continue operating across all parcels, benefiting parcel A.\n\nIn that case, an easement by implication makes sense, as it would imply that the new owners of B and C are subject to the existing use of the drainage system.\n\nAlternatively, if the original owner intended to release parcels B and C from any such easement, then perhaps it's not binding on the new owners.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems that the drainage system was in place and necessary for parcel A, and the friend and cousin were aware of it or should have been aware upon purchasing their parcels.\n\nTherefore, from their standpoint, the drainage system would most likely be defined as an easement by implication.\n\nSo, the answer is B. easement by implication.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
