                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about ethical theories, specifically about how objective moral principles are determined rationally under one theory, and how morality becomes context-dependent and subjective under another. The options are A. Normativity, Relativism; B. Absolutism, Relativism; C. Relativism, Absolutism; D. Absolutism, Normativity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means. \"Ethical normativity\" refers to the study of what ought to be, the norms that guide moral behavior. \"Absolutism\" in ethics suggests that there are universal moral principles that apply to everyone, regardless of context. \"Relativism\" holds that moral truths are not absolute but are relative to cultural, individual, or situational contexts.\n\nThe question is asking under which ethical framework objective moral principles can be rationally determined, and under which framework morality is both context-dependent and subjective.\n\nSo, for the first part: \"under ethical ________ objective moral principles can be rationally determined.\" I think this is referring to a framework where moral principles are universal and can be discovered through reason. That sounds like ethical absolutism, where there are objective moral laws that apply to all people, and these can be known through rational inquiry.\n\nThe second part is: \"while ethical under ________ morality is both context-dependent and subjective.\" This seems to describe relativism, where moral judgments are based on individual or cultural perspectives and can vary from one context to another. In relativism, there are no objective moral truths that apply universally; instead, morality is subjective and depends on the situation or the beliefs of the individuals involved.\n\nSo, putting it together, it seems that under absolutism, objective moral principles can be rationally determined, whereas under relativism, morality is context-dependent and subjective.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Normativity, Relativism\n\nB. Absolutism, Relativism\n\nC. Relativism, Absolutism\n\nD. Absolutism, Normativity\n\nOption B matches my reasoning: Absolutism for the first blank and Relativism for the second.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe normativity fits better in one of the blanks.\n\nNormativity is about norms or standards that prescribe how one ought to act. Ethical normativity is concerned with what is right or good, and it can be associated with both absolutism and relativism, depending on how norms are established and applied.\n\nHowever, in the context of the question, it seems that normativity is being contrasted with relativism, suggesting that under normativity, there are objective moral principles, whereas under relativism, morality is subjective and context-dependent.\n\nBut according to my initial understanding, absolutism is more directly associated with objective, universal moral principles, while relativism is associated with context-dependent and subjective morality.\n\nOption A has normativity and relativism, which might not accurately capture the distinction being made.\n\nOption C has relativism and absolutism, which would reverse the positions in the statement.\n\nOption D has absolutism and normativity, which doesn't align with the description of the second blank.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps normativity encompasses both absolutism and relativism, but in this specific question, it seems to be set against relativism.\n\nWait, maybe normativity is being used here to refer to a approach where moral norms are established through rational means, leading to objective principles, whereas relativism rejects such universal norms.\n\nIn that case, normativity could be synonymous with absolutism in this context.\n\nBut given that absolutism is specifically mentioned in option B, and normativity isn't as clearly defined in ethical terms, perhaps absolutism is a better fit for the first blank.\n\nMoreover, ethical relativism is a well-established term, whereas ethical normativity might not be as clearly contrasted with relativism in standard ethical discussions.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. Absolutism, Relativism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
