                    "text": "I'm going to take a shot at this question about Sartre. So, Sartre is a philosopher, and he's associated with existentialism. I remember that existentialism is all about individual existence and freedom, and that there's this idea of \"existence precedes essence.\" \n\nLet me think about what that means. Essence is like the nature or the definition of something, and existence is that it actually exists. So, when we say existence precedes essence, it means that something exists first, and then its nature or definition comes after. It's different from, say, Plato's idea where essence comes before existence.\n\nNow, the question is asking about a being in whom existence precedes essence, and the options are God, man, primitive man, and future man.\n\nI think Sartre was an atheist, so God might not fit into his philosophy in the way this question is phrasing it. Maybe I should look at \"man.\" Existence precedes essence could mean that a person exists first, and then defines their own essence through their choices and actions. That sounds like something Sartre would say.\n\nWhat about primitive man? Maybe he's referring to early humans or something, but I don't recall Sartre specifically talking about primitive man in that context.\n\nFuture man sounds like it could be a concept, but again, I don't think that's directly related to the existence precedes essence idea in the way this question is phrased.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. man. Sartre emphasizes that humans exist first and then define themselves through their actions and choices, which aligns with existence preceding essence.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check. Let me recall some of Sartre's key ideas. He wrote a book called \"Existentialism is a Humanism,\" where he talks about humans being condemned to be free, meaning that they have to make choices and those choices define them.\n\nAlso, he has the famous quote, \"Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.\" This seems to support the idea that man exists first and then creates his own essence.\n\nIn contrast, traditional essentialism holds that essence comes before existence, like in the idea that there is an essential human nature or that God defines our essence before we exist.\n\nSince Sartre was an existentialist and an atheist, he would likely reject the idea that essence precedes existence, especially in the context of God defining essence.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. man.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
