Let's examine each option to determine which ones are correct alternative names for the dependent variable.\n\nOption (i): The regressand\n\nIn regression analysis, the term \"regressand\" refers to the variable being predicted or explained by the model. This is indeed another name for the dependent variable. So, (i) is correct.\n\nOption (ii): The regressor\n\nThe term \"regressor\" actually refers to the independent variables in the regression model, which are used to predict the dependent variable. Therefore, regressors are not the same as the dependent variable. So, (ii) is incorrect.\n\nOption (iii): The explained variable\n\nThe dependent variable is often called the \"explained variable\" because it is the outcome that the model aims to explain or predict based on the independent variables. Hence, (iii) is correct.\n\nOption (iv): The explanatory variable\n\nExplanatory variables are synonymous with independent variables or predictors in regression analysis. They are used to explain variations in the dependent variable. Therefore, explanatory variables are not the same as the dependent variable. So, (iv) is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct choices are (i) and (iii) only.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. (i) and (iii) only."
