                    "text": "So I've got this question here from the WHO, about the maximum intake of free sugars for individuals in a population. The options are:\n\nA. Less than 5%\n\nB. 5-10%\n\nC. Less than 10%\n\nD. More than 10%\n\nI need to figure out what the WHO recommends. I remember that the WHO has guidelines on sugar intake, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. I think they suggest limiting added sugars, but I'm not sure about the percentage of total calorie intake.\n\nFirst, I should clarify what \"free sugars\" are. I believe free sugars refer to sugars that are added to foods by manufacturers, cooks, or consumers, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices. So, it's not including the sugars inherent in whole fruits and vegetables.\n\nNow, regarding the recommended intake. I seem to recall that the WHO recommends that free sugar intake should not exceed 10% of total energy intake. In fact, they also mention that reducing it to below 5% would have additional health benefits. Let me see if I can recall the exact figures.\n\nOption A is less than 5%. Option C is less than 10%. Option B is 5-10%, and Option D is more than 10%. If I'm remembering correctly, the WHO suggests that free sugars should be less than 10% of total calories, and that below 5% would be even better.\n\nBut the question is about the maximum intake. So, perhaps the strong recommendation is for less than 10%, with a further target of less than 5%. Looking back, I think the WHO has a definitive stance on this.\n\nLet me try to recall the WHO guideline. I think in 2015, the WHO published guidelines on sugar intake for adults and children. They recommended that:\n\n1. Reducing the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake is part of a healthy diet.\n\n2. A further reduction to below 5% of total energy intake would have additional health benefits.\n\nSo, based on this, the strong recommendation is that free sugars should be less than 10% of total energy intake.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Less than 5% - This seems too low for the maximum intake, although it's the further target.\n\nB. 5-10% - This could be a range, but I think the maximum is less than 10%.\n\nC. Less than 10% - This aligns with the WHO's strong recommendation.\n\nD. More than 10% - This seems too high and contradicts the WHO's recommendation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Less than 10%.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check. The WHO does recommend reducing free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake, with additional benefits for reducing to less than 5%. So, the maximum intake, according to their strong recommendation, is less than 10%.\n\nOption A is less than 5%, which is more of an ideal target, but the question is about the maximum intake. So, less than 10% seems to be the upper limit recommended.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer should be C. Less than 10%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
