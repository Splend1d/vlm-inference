                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about confidence intervals. I need to figure out which statement must be true based on the information given.\n\nSo, the registrar is taking a random sample of 150 students to check how many have the correct addresses on record. Then, he's going to use this sample to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of students with correct addresses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a confidence interval really means. A 95% confidence interval means that if we were to take many, many samples and construct confidence intervals from each of them, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter. In this case, the parameter is the true proportion of students with correct addresses.\n\nNow, let's look at each statement one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\"\n\nThis is tempting because it sounds similar to the definition of a confidence interval. However, the key point is that the confidence interval is constructed from a single sample, and there's a 95% chance that this interval contains the true proportion. But once the interval is constructed, the true proportion is either in it or not. We don't know for sure, but we are 95% confident that it is.\n\nSo, strictly speaking, it's not that the true proportion is within the interval constructed; it's that the process used to construct the interval will capture the true proportion 95% of the time in the long run.\n\nOption B says: \"Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.\"\n\nThis is directly stating that 95% of students have correct addresses. But the confidence level of 95% is about the confidence in the interval estimating the true proportion, not about the proportion itself. The sample proportion might be different, and the confidence interval gives a range for the true proportion, not a fixed value.\n\nOption C says: \"The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.\"\n\nThis is similar to option A but adds that it's within the interval 95% of the time. However, the true proportion is a fixed but unknown value. The confidence interval is random because it depends on the sample. So, it's not that the true proportion is within the interval 95% of the time; rather, the process of constructing the interval will include the true proportion 95% of the time in repeated samples.\n\nOption D says: \"The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.\"\n\nThis one is interesting. The sample proportion is a point estimate and is used to construct the confidence interval. Typically, the sample proportion should be at the center of the confidence interval for proportions. So, it should always be within the confidence interval, assuming the interval is constructed correctly.\n\nWait a minute, for proportions, the confidence interval is calculated as the sample proportion plus or minus a margin of error. So, the sample proportion is indeed always inside the confidence interval.\n\nBut let's confirm this. The formula for a confidence interval for a proportion is:\n\n\\[ \\hat{p} \\pm z^* \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion,\n\n- \\(z^*\\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level,\n\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\nSo, the sample proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the center of the interval, and the margin of error is \\(z^* \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\\). Therefore, the interval is \\(\\hat{p} - \\text{margin of error}\\) to \\(\\hat{p} + \\text{margin of error}\\), which means \\(\\hat{p}\\) is always inside the interval.\n\nTherefore, option D must be true.\n\nNow, considering the other options again:\n\nOption A is close but not precisely correct because the true proportion is either in the interval or not; it's not a probability statement once the interval is constructed.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the 95% confidence level doesn't tell us that 95% of students have correct addresses; it's about the confidence in the interval estimating the true proportion.\n\nOption C is similar to A but phrased in a way that suggests the true proportion is moving, which it's not; it's fixed, and the interval is random.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is option D: The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
