F. Skinner, and Carl Rogers. I think this has to do with behaviorism, where actions are shaped by consequences like rewards and punishments.\n\nWilliam James was more into functionalism and the purpose of consciousness. Wilhelm Wundt is known for founding structuralism, which is about breaking down mental processes into their basic elements. Carl Rogers is associated with humanistic psychology, focusing on self-actualization and personal growth. So, none of these seem directly related to reinforcers and punishers.\n\nB. F. Skinner, on the other hand, is a key figure in behaviorism, especially known for his work on operant conditioning. Operant conditioning is all about how behaviors are influenced by consequences\u2014specifically, reinforcers and punishers. Reinforcers are stimuli that increase the likelihood of a behavior being repeated, while punishers decrease that likelihood.\n\nSo, Skinner's theory aligns closely with the statement that behavior is a result of the combination of reinforcers and punishers. He conducted experiments with animals, like his famous Skinner Box, to demonstrate how behaviors could be shaped through reinforcement and punishment.\n\nTherefore, the psychologist who would most likely agree with that statement is B. F. Skinner.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
