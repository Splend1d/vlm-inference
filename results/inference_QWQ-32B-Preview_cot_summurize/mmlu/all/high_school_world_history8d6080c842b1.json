                    "text": "So I've got this quote from Kwame Nkrumah about neo-colonialism and his views on how less developed countries should handle foreign investment. He's talking about non-alignment and having a national plan that's in the best interest of the country, not just catering to foreign investors. The question is asking which ideology most inspired this national plan that Nkrumah is advocating for in the second paragraph. The options are fascism, social Darwinism, classical liberalism, or socialism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these ideologies stands for:\n\n1. **Fascism**: This is an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing ideology. It emphasizes the subordination of the individual to the needs of the state and typically involves strong centralized power and suppression of opposition.\n\n2. **Social Darwinism**: This is a theory that applies the concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest to human society. It suggests that certain people or groups are naturally superior and should dominate others.\n\n3. **Classical liberalism**: This is an ideology that advocates for individual liberty, political freedom, and free markets. It emphasizes minimal government intervention in economic affairs.\n\n4. **Socialism**: This is an economic and political system where the means of production are owned and controlled by the community as a whole. It aims for greater equality and often involves significant government intervention in the economy.\n\nNow, looking back at Nkrumah's quote:\n\n- He talks about struggling against neo-colonialism to prevent the financial power of developed countries from impoverishing less developed ones.\n\n- He supports non-alignment, meaning his country won't side with either the capitalist or socialist blocs during the Cold War.\n\n- He mentions co-operation with all states, regardless of their economic system.\n\n- He emphasizes that foreign investment should be in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government, prioritizing the country's own interests.\n\n- He stresses that the issue is about power and a state's autonomy over its own destiny.\n\nGiven these points, let's see which ideology aligns best with his views:\n\n- **Fascism**: This seems unlikely because fascism is authoritarian and nationalistic, often involving suppression of individual liberties and a strong central government. Nkrumah's approach, while emphasizing national sovereignty, doesn't seem to align with the authoritarian aspects of fascism.\n\n- **Social Darwinism**: This ideology seems contrary to Nkrumah's views. He's advocating for less developed countries to resist being exploited by more developed ones, whereas social Darwinism might suggest that stronger (more developed) nations have a right to dominate weaker ones.\n\n- **Classical liberalism**: This ideology favors free markets and minimal government intervention. However, Nkrumah is proposing a national plan drawn up by the government to guide foreign investment, which suggests a more interventionist approach than classical liberalism typically endorses.\n\n- **Socialism**: This seems the most aligned with Nkrumah's views. He mentions co-operation with socialist countries and emphasizes government control over the national plan to serve the country's interests. Socialism often involves significant government control over the economy to promote equality and national development.\n\nMoreover, Kwame Nkrumah was known for his socialist leanings. He was a key figure in the Pan-Africanism movement and advocated for African unity and socialism as a way to achieve economic independence and development.\n\nTherefore, the ideology that most inspired the national plan advanced by Nkrumah in the second paragraph is socialism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
