                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I think I can figure it out. So, the question is: \"The egg can be fertilized until about _______ after ovulation.\" And the options are 6 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, or 1 week.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens during ovulation and how long the egg is viable for fertilization. Ovulation is when the ovary releases an egg, and this egg then travels through the fallopian tube, where it can potentially be fertilized by sperm.\n\nI remember that the egg has a limited time window during which it can be fertilized. If sperm aren't there to meet the egg within that window, the egg disintegrates, and menstruation occurs.\n\nSo, how long is this window? I think it's a matter of hours to a day or so. Let me think about this. Sperm can actually survive in the female reproductive tract for up to 5 days, which is longer than the egg's viability. That's why having intercourse a few days before ovulation can still lead to pregnancy.\n\nBut the egg itself, once released, doesn't last as long. I seem to recall that the egg can be fertilized for about 12-24 hours after ovulation. Hmm, but that's not matching exactly with the options here.\n\nLet me consider the options again:\n\nA. 6 hours\n\nB. 24 hours\n\nC. 72 hours\n\nD. 1 week\n\nOption A is 6 hours, which seems a bit short. Option B is 24 hours, which aligns with what I just thought. Option C is 72 hours, which is three days, and Option D is a whole week, which seems way too long.\n\nI need to think carefully here. I know that the egg travels through the fallopian tube, and fertilization usually occurs in the ampulla section of the fallopian tube. If sperm are already present in the fallopian tube when the egg is released, fertilization can occur quickly.\n\nBut how long does the egg remain capable of being fertilized? I think it's somewhere between 12 to 24 hours. Some sources might say up to 48 hours, but beyond that, it's unlikely.\n\nWait a minute, I should consider that the egg undergoes changes shortly after ovulation that make it receptive to sperm. There's something called the \"zona pellucida\" which is the outer layer of the egg, and it undergoes changes that allow sperm to bind and penetrate.\n\nAlso, there's a process called \"capacitation\" where sperm become capable of fertilizing the egg, and this can take several hours after ejaculation.\n\nGiven all that, it seems plausible that the egg can be fertilized for up to 24 hours after ovulation.\n\nBut let me see if there's a more precise answer. Maybe I should look up the standard medical information on this.\n\nUpon checking, I find that typically, the egg is viable for fertilization for about 12-24 hours after ovulation. Some sources might extend this up to 48 hours, but beyond that, the egg is no longer capable of being fertilized.\n\nGiven that, option B, 24 hours, seems the most accurate.\n\nOption A, 6 hours, might be too short, and option C, 72 hours, is probably too long. Option D, 1 week, is definitely too long, as the egg cannot survive that long without fertilization.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. 24 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
