                    "text": "Let's see what this excerpt is saying about the 1864 election. So, Lincoln was reelected with 78% of the Union electorate casting ballots. That's a pretty high turnout. He won the Electoral College 212 to McClellan's 21, which is a landslide. Popular vote was 55% for Lincoln, which was the third largest in the nineteenth century, only behind Jackson in 1828 and Grant in 1872. McClellan only won New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky.\n\nLooking at the support bases: Republicans got votes from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, New England descent folks, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in cities and among Irish and German-Americans, who were the most populous immigrant groups at the time.\n\nThere's an interesting statistic that Lincoln received 78% of the vote from Union soldiers and sailors, which is said to be of great symbolic value and perhaps made a difference in a few close states.\n\nAlso, Republicans gained seats in Congress, ending up with 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate. They took back several state legislatures but lost only the governorship of New Jersey, which was McClellan's home state.\n\nNow, the question is asking which conclusion is best supported by this excerpt. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Lincoln received more votes in the heavily populated states of the North, while McClellan won more sparsely populated states.\n\nWell, the excerpt mentions that Republicans were strong in the North, especially among native-born farmers and in New England descent areas. Democrats were strong in cities, which could be in both North and South, but in this context, probably the Union states since it's the Union election. McClellan won New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. New Jersey and Delaware are small states, while Kentucky is larger. So, this option might be partially supported, but the excerpt doesn't explicitly state population densities of the states won by each candidate.\n\nB. Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War.\n\nThis one is tempting because often military success can boost a incumbent's chances. The excerpt mentions that Lincoln received 78% of the Union soldiers' vote, which might suggest that Union successes swayed the military vote in his favor. However, the excerpt doesn't directly link his victory to Union successes in the war. It just states the election results and the voting patterns.\n\nC. The Emancipation Proclamation mobilized black voters in the South to vote for Lincoln in the Election of 1864.\n\nHmm, this is interesting. The Emancipation Proclamation declared slaves in Confederate-held areas to be free, but voting rights weren't granted by it. Also, in 1864, the South was still largely under Confederate control, and black voters wouldn't have been able to vote in the Union election. The election was primarily in the Union states, and the South had limited participation. So, this option seems unlikely based on the information provided.\n\nD. Republicans managed to gain control of Congress through the efforts of Lincoln to campaign on their behalf.\n\nThe excerpt does say that Republicans gained seats in Congress and retained control, but it doesn't specify that this was due to Lincoln's campaigning on their behalf. It mentions that Republicans drew support from various groups, and Lincoln received a large portion of the military vote, but it doesn't directly link Lincoln's campaigning to the Republican gains in Congress.\n\nAmong these options, B seems the most plausible because of the high support from Union soldiers and sailors, which might have been influenced by Union successes in the war. However, it's not explicitly stated in the excerpt.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that the military vote was a significant factor, and if Union successes had boosted morale and support for Lincoln, that could have translated into votes, especially among soldiers.\n\nBut let's look again. The excerpt says, \"the figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value.\" So, while the military vote was significant, it wasn't the deciding factor overall, but it might have made a difference in some states.\n\nOption A is about the population density of the states won by each candidate. McClellan won New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. New Jersey and Delaware are small states, but Kentucky is larger. However, the excerpt doesn't provide data on population densities of these states.\n\nOption C is about black voters in the South mobilized by the Emancipation Proclamation. But given that the South was largely not participating in the Union election, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption D suggests that Republicans gained control of Congress due to Lincoln's campaigning on their behalf. While Lincoln might have had some influence, the excerpt doesn't specify that.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is B, that Lincoln won due to Union successes in the war, as suggested by the high military vote in his favor. But I'm not entirely sure because the excerpt doesn't directly state that Union successes led to his victory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe none of the options are strongly supported by the excerpt, but among them, B seems the most plausible.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the war was still ongoing in 1864, and if the Union was not doing well, perhaps people would be more inclined to elect McClellan, a Democrat, who might have had different approaches to the war. But again, this is speculative based on the given excerpt.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to recognize that the excerpt provides information about the election results and voting patterns but doesn't explicitly support any of the conclusions A through D directly. However, since I have to choose the best-supported conclusion, I'll go with B, that Lincoln won due to Union successes in the war, given the high support from Union soldiers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
