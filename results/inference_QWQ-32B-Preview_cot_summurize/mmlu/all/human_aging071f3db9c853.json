The question is: \"A problem in comparing older adults' memory for recent events and events that happened a long time ago is that recent events...\" and then it gives four options:\n\nA. May be very well rehearsed\n\nB. Are far more meaningful\n\nC. Have no denominator to help in computing an average\n\nD. Can be verified while older events often cannot\n\nOkay, so I need to think about what makes comparing recent and older memories tricky in older adults. Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"May be very well rehearsed.\" Hmm, that makes sense. Recent events might have been discussed or thought about more often, so they've been rehearsed more, which could make them easier to remember. So, when comparing to older events that might not have been rehearsed as much, it's hard to tell if the difference in memory is due to the age of the memory or the amount of rehearsal. So, this seems like a valid problem in comparison.\n\nOption B says, \"Are far more meaningful.\" Well, meaning can certainly affect memory. Maybe recent events are more meaningful because they're more relevant to the present, or maybe older events are more meaningful because they have more personal significance over time. But I'm not sure if recent events are universally more meaningful than older ones. Maybe this is too subjective to be a general problem in comparison.\n\nOption C says, \"Have no denominator to help in computing an average.\" I'm not sure what this means. Denominator in computing an average would be the number of events, I guess. But I don't see why recent events would lack a denominator. This option seems unclear to me, so maybe it's not the best answer.\n\nOption D says, \"Can be verified while older events often cannot.\" Verification could be important for comparing memory accuracy. If recent events can be checked against records or other people's memories, but older events can't, that might make comparison difficult. However, I think verification issues affect the accuracy of the memory rather than the comparison between recent and older memories themselves.\n\nComparing options A, B, C, and D, option A seems to directly address a problem in comparison by pointing out that recent memories might be better due to more rehearsal, which could confound the results when comparing to older memories.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. May be very well rehearsed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
