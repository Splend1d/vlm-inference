The teacher wants to divide all these stickers equally among 27 students. I need to figure out how many stickers each student will get.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of stickers. To do that, I'll add up the stickers from all three packages.\n\n56 + 48 + 58\n\nLet me add 56 and 48 first. 56 plus 40 is 96, and then plus 8 is 104. So, 56 + 48 = 104.\n\nNow, add 104 + 58. 104 plus 50 is 154, and then plus 8 is 162. So, the total number of stickers is 162.\n\nNext, I need to divide this total number of stickers equally among 27 students. So, I'll divide 162 by 27.\n\n162 \u00f7 27\n\nI know that 27 times 6 is 162 because 20 times 6 is 120, and 7 times 6 is 42. Add them up: 120 + 42 = 162.\n\nSo, 27 \u00d7 6 = 162, which means 162 \u00f7 27 = 6.\n\nTherefore, each student will receive 6 stickers.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6 stickers\n\nB. 9 stickers\n\nC. 54 stickers\n\nD. 81 stickers\n\nThe correct answer is A. 6 stickers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
