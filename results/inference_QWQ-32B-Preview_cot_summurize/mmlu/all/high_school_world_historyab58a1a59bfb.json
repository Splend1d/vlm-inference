A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nFrom the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore\n\nA. seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race.\nB. should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.\nC. can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.\nD. was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this question here that's referencing two different texts about the Cawnpore massacres during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The question is asking for the perspective of the first passage regarding the death of British citizens at Cawnpore. The options are:\n\nA. seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race.\n\nB. should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.\n\nC. can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.\n\nD. was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.\n\nFirst, I need to look back at the first passage to understand the author's perspective. The passage is from a British journalist named William Howard Russell, and it's from his book \"My Indian Mutiny Diary\" published in 1860. So, this is a primary source from someone who was likely contemporary with the events.\n\nLet's see what Russell says:\n\n\"In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race \u2014 by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\"\n\nOkay, so Russell is describing the Cawnpore massacres as particularly aggravating because it was perpetrated by a subject race against their British masters, including innocent women and children. He characterizes it as a servile war, meaning a slave rebellion, and also as a war of religion, race, revenge, and national aspiration to overthrow foreign rule and restore native leadership and religions.\n\nHe acknowledges that there were causes for the mutiny and revolt but focuses on the method used by the leaders to achieve their goal, which was the destruction of all British people, regardless of age or gender, who fell into their hands.\n\nFrom this, it seems that Russell is portraying the massacres as a betrayal by an inferior race against their superiors, emphasizing the racial and religious dimensions of the conflict.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race.\n\nThis aligns closely with Russell's description of the subject race betraying their masters, with implications of racial superiority.\n\nB. should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.\n\nRussell doesn't present it as a mistake but as a deliberate act in a rebellion.\n\nC. can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.\n\nWhile Russell mentions that there were causes for the mutiny, he doesn't explicitly say that the British brought it on themselves.\n\nD. was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.\n\nRussell does mention that it was a war of religion, but he's describing the perspective of the British, not necessarily that of the perpetrators.\n\nSo, based on the content of the first passage, option A seems to be the most accurate reflection of Russell's perspective: that the deaths at Cawnpore marked a betrayal by a lesser race against a higher one.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the second passage as well, even though the question is only about the first passage.\n\nThe second passage is by Rudrangshu Mukherjee, written in 1990, and it provides a different perspective, critiquing the British monopoly on violence and the hierarchical racial structure they imposed in India. Mukherjee argues that the revolt shattered the British monopoly on violence and that the bodies of the British were treated with certain dignities based on their race and skin color, which was a manifestation of their domination and superiority.\n\nThis passage offers a more critical view of British rule and suggests that the violence was a challenge to the existing power dynamics.\n\nHowever, since the question is specifically about the perspective of the first passage, I should focus on Russell's account.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
