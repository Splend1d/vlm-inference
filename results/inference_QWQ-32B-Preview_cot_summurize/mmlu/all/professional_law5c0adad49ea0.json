Then, two years later, the friend mortgages the property to a bank to secure a loan. One year after that, the friend dies intestate, leaving his uncle as the only heir. The jurisdiction follows a title theory of mortgages, and we need to figure out who owns the property and whether it's subject to the mortgage.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key elements:\n\n1. **Conveyance to Joint Tenants:** The professor conveys the land to both the friend and the co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. This means that both hold equal undivided interests in the entire property, and upon the death of one, their interest passes to the surviving joint tenant.\n\n2. **Mortgage by One Joint Tenant:** The friend mortgages the property to a bank. In a title theory jurisdiction, the mortgagee (bank) temporarily holds legal title to the property, while the mortgagor (friend) retains equitable title.\n\n3. **Death of One Joint Tenant:** The friend dies intestate, meaning he didn't leave a will. His only heir is his uncle.\n\nNow, we need to determine who owns the property and whether it's subject to the mortgage.\n\nLet's consider the implications step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship**\n\nIn joint tenancy with right of survivorship, when one joint tenant dies, their interest automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s). So, when the friend dies, his interest in the property should pass to the co-worker.\n\n**Step 2: Mortgage in a Title Theory Jurisdiction**\n\nIn a title theory jurisdiction, the mortgage transfers legal title to the mortgagee (bank) until the mortgage is paid off. The mortgagor (friend) retains equitable title. So, when the friend mortgaged the property, legal title was transferred to the bank, and the friend retained equitable title.\n\n**Step 3: Death of the Mortgagor who is a Joint Tenant**\n\nWhen the friend dies, his equitable title in the property passes to his heir, which is his uncle. However, because the property is held as joint tenants with right of survivorship, his interest should pass to the surviving joint tenant, the co-worker.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let's dig deeper.\n\n**Step 4: Conflict Between Joint Tenancy and Mortgage**\n\nThe issue here is that the friend's interest is subject to the mortgage. So, when he dies, does his interest pass to the co-worker free of the mortgage, or does the mortgage encumber the property?\n\nIn joint tenancy, the right of survivorship typically allows the surviving joint tenant to take the deceased's interest free of any encumbrances created by the deceased. However, this can be affected by local laws and the type of mortgage.\n\nGiven that this is a title theory jurisdiction, the mortgagee holds legal title, and the mortgagor holds equitable title. When the mortgagor dies, his equitable title passes to his heir, but the mortgagee still holds legal title.\n\n**Step 5: Determining Ownership After Death**\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- Legal title is held by the bank due to the mortgage.\n\n- Equitable title was held by the friend and the co-worker as joint tenants.\n\n- Upon the friend's death, his equitable title passes to the co-worker by right of survivorship.\n\nSo, the co-worker now holds the entire equitable title, and the bank holds legal title.\n\n**Step 6: Resolving the Title**\n\nIn a title theory jurisdiction, when the mortgage is paid off, the mortgagee reconveys legal title back to the mortgagor. Here, since the co-worker now holds the entire equitable title, and the bank holds legal title, the property is effectively owned by the co-worker, subject to the mortgage.\n\nIf the mortgage is not paid, the bank can foreclose and sell the property.\n\n**Step 7: Considering the Heir**\n\nThe friend's uncle is his heir, but in the context of joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the uncle does not inherit the friend's interest in the property because it passes to the co-worker. However, if there are any equitable interests or claims, it might be complex.\n\nGiven the options, it seems that the co-worker holds the entire interest, subject to the mortgage.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.\n\nB. in the co-worker, free and clear of the mortgage.\n\nC. half in the co-worker and half in the uncle, with both subject to the mortgage.\n\nD. half in the co-worker, free of the mortgage, and half in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A seems correct: the co-worker holds the entire interest, subject to the mortgage.\n\nHowever, let's consider if the uncle has any claim. Since the friend died intestate, and the property was held as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the uncle would not inherit the friend's interest in the property; it passes to the co-worker. Therefore, the uncle has no interest in the property.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A: in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
