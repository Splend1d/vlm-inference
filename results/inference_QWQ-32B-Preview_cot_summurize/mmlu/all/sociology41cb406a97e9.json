The options are convergence, emergent-norm, contagion, and value-added. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, convergence theory suggests that collective behavior happens because people are similarly situated and have similar interests. So, in this case, maybe everyone stops because they're all drivers who can relate to being in an accident. That makes sense, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit.\n\nNext, emergent-norm theory proposes that in unusual situations, people look to others for cues on how to behave because norms aren't clear. Here, maybe the initial person who stops sets a norm for others to follow. That seems plausible.\n\nContagion theory is older and suggests that crowds can spread emotions and behaviors rapidly, almost like a disease. So, seeing one person stop might trigger others to do the same out of emotion or impulse.\n\nLastly, value-added theory is about how social movements develop through a series of stages, each adding more commitment from participants. That doesn't seem directly applicable here, as this is a single incident, not a developing movement.\n\nComparing these, contagion seems to fit well because it explains how behavior can spread quickly through a group in response to an initial action. Emergent-norm also makes sense because people might be unsure about what to do in an accident and look to others for guidance.\n\nMaybe I should consider both. But since the question asks for the best explanation, I need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps contagion is more about the spread of emotion and behavior, while emergent-norm is about establishing a new norm in an unclear situation.\n\nIn this scenario, the initial act of helping sets a norm for others to follow, especially if they were unsure about what to do. So, emergent-norm might be the better choice.\n\nBut contagion also explains why people quickly follow the first person's action. It's possible that both are at play, but I have to pick one.\n\nMaybe I should look up brief definitions to confirm.\n\nConvergence: People with shared interests come together in collective action.\n\nEmergent-norm: In ambiguous situations, people look to others to define appropriate behavior.\n\nContagion: Behaviors and emotions spread through a group like a contagion.\n\nValue-added: A model for the development of social movements through cumulative stages.\n\nGiven these, emergent-norm seems to fit best because the situation is ambiguous (what to do after an accident), and people are looking to others for cues on how to behave.\n\nConvergence is more about shared interests leading to collective action, which might not capture the immediate response in this scenario.\n\nContagion is about the spread of behavior, but it doesn't account for the norm-setting aspect as clearly as emergent-norm theory.\n\nValue-added isn't relevant here.\n\nTherefore, I think the emergent-norm theory best explains why people stop to help after seeing the first person do so.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
