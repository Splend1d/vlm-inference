So, it's about using popularity or common belief as evidence for the truth of the claim.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Poisoning the well - I think this is when someone discredits an opponent in advance, like saying bad things about them so that anything they say is automatically doubted. That doesn't seem to match here.\n\nB. Common person appeal - This sounds promising. I think it's similar to appealing to the masses or saying something is true because it's what ordinary people believe.\n\nC. Ad numerum - I'm not sure about this one. It sounds like appealing to numbers, meaning that something is true because many people believe it. That seems similar to the common person appeal.\n\nD. Suppressed evidence - This is when someone presents only part of the story, hiding evidence that goes against their argument. That doesn't seem directly related to using popular belief as evidence.\n\nSo, between B and C, I need to decide which one fits best. Common person appeal seems to be about appealing to what regular people believe, while ad numerum is about the number of people believing something. Maybe they're similar, but ad numerum focuses more on the quantity of believers.\n\nBut in the question, it says \"some regular people believe the claim,\" which emphasizes that it's ordinary people, not necessarily a large number. So, perhaps common person appeal is more about the type of people (ordinary folks) rather than the number of people.\n\nWait, maybe both B and C are similar fallacies, but with slightly different focuses. Ad numerum is like the bandwagon fallacy, where the majority's belief is taken as evidence for the truth of the claim. Common person appeal might be more about appealing to what normal, everyday people think, perhaps suggesting that experts might think differently.\n\nGiven that, perhaps B, the common person appeal, is the better answer here because the question emphasizes that it's some regular people who believe the claim, not necessarily a large number.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppressed evidence could be a possibility if the argument is ignoring evidence against the claim, but that's not directly stated in the question. The focus is on using the belief of some regular people as evidence in favor.\n\nPoisoning the well doesn't seem relevant here, as it's about discrediting an opponent beforehand.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B, common person appeal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
