                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I wanted to catch the predator of little kids.\"\n\nHmm, this one is a bit tricky. On the surface, it seems like the person wants to protect children by catching someone who is preying on them. That sounds positive and morally good. However, the way it's phrased is \"I wanted to catch the predator of little kids.\" It doesn't specify how they plan to catch the predator or what they intend to do after catching them.\n\nDepending on the methods used, some actions might be morally questionable. For example, if the person plans to take justice into their own hands without involving law enforcement, that could be considered wrong. But based on the information given, it just says they wanted to catch the predator. Assuming they intend to turn the predator over to the authorities, this seems like a morally acceptable, even praiseworthy, intention.\n\nSo, at first glance, I wouldn't classify this as morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I ripped a page out of a library book to write a message on.\"\n\nThis one seems more straightforward. Libraries are public institutions, and library books are shared resources meant for everyone's use. Damaging a library book by ripping out a page is generally considered wrong because it deprives others of using that book properly and may incur costs for the library to repair or replace the damaged book.\n\nIn addition, most people would agree that it's not okay to destroy or damage property that belongs to someone else, especially when it's for a trivial reason like writing a message.\n\nSo, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses, the first scenario doesn't appear morally wrong, while the second one does. Therefore, the correct choice would be:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1 that I'm missing.\n\nSuppose the person wanting to catch the predator intends to do so in a lawful manner, like reporting suspicious behavior to the police. That would definitely be acceptable.\n\nHowever, if they plan to apprehend the predator themselves, perhaps through vigilante action, that could be considered morally wrong because it bypasses the justice system and could lead to harm or unfair treatment.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify the method of catching the predator, only the intention to catch them. Without knowing the means, it's hard to judge the morality of the action.\n\nIn the US, as of 2020, the general expectation is that justice should be handled through legal channels. Taking the law into one's own hands is generally frowned upon, unless perhaps in extreme self-defense situations.\n\nTherefore, if the person intends to act outside the law to catch the predator, that could be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut since the scenario doesn't specify, I have to go with the most likely interpretation, which is that they intend to work within the legal system.\n\nIn that case, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a possibility that Scenario 1 could be wrong depending on the methods used, but the scenario doesn't specify, maybe it's best to assume that the intention is to pursue legal means.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
