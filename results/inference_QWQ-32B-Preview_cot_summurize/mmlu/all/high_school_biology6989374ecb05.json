So, the scenario is that in a population, really tall and really short individuals are decreasing in number compared to those of medium size, because of a change in resource availability. I need to decide which type of selection this represents: directional, stabilizing, disruptive, or sympatric speciation.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these selection types means:\n\n1. **Directional selection** occurs when one extreme of a trait is favored over the others, causing the population's average trait value to shift over time in that direction. For example, if taller individuals have higher fitness, the population would become taller over generations.\n\n2. **Stabilizing selection** happens when the intermediate traits are favored, and both extremes are selected against. This reduces variation in the population around the optimal trait value.\n\n3. **Disruptive selection** is the opposite of stabilizing selection; it favors the extremes and selects against the intermediate traits. This can lead to the population splitting into two or more distinct groups.\n\n4. **Sympatric speciation** is a process where new species evolve from a single ancestral species while living in the same geographic area. It's not a type of selection but rather a mode of speciation.\n\nGiven these definitions, the scenario describes a situation where both really tall and really short individuals are decreasing in frequency compared to medium-sized individuals. This sounds like stabilizing selection because it's favoring the\u4e2d\u95f4 traits and selecting against the extremes.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about why this might be happening. The change in resource availability likely makes medium-sized individuals more fit or better adapted to the new conditions. Maybe the resources are now more accessible to medium-sized individuals, or perhaps being too tall or too short confers some disadvantage in the new environment.\n\nDirectional selection would involve a shift towards one extreme, say favoring taller or shorter individuals, but that's not the case here. Disruptive selection would favor the extremes and disadvantage the intermediates, which is the opposite of what's described. Sympatric speciation isn't a type of selection, so it doesn't fit the context of the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. stabilizing selection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
