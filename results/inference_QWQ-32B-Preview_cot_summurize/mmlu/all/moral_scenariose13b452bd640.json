The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"When I play cards, I palm the aces.\"\n\nOkay, so palming cards, especially aces, in a card game is basically cheating. In most contexts, cheating is considered morally wrong because it involves deception and unfair advantage over others. It breaks the trust among players and undermines the spirit of fair play. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, this would likely be seen as wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I filled up the gas tank with gasoline.\"\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. Filling up a gas tank with gasoline is what you're supposed to do. It's the normal and expected action. There's nothing morally wrong with doing that. In fact, it's necessary to operate a vehicle that runs on gasoline. So, this should be considered not wrong.\n\nPutting it together, the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong. Looking back at the options, that corresponds to option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there might be any nuances I'm missing.\n\nFor scenario 1, maybe in some contexts, palming cards could be acceptable, like in a friendly game where everyone knows it's just for fun and no one cares about winning fairly. However, generally speaking, cheating in games is considered wrong, especially if it's done secretly without the knowledge or consent of the other players.\n\nFor scenario 2, there might be situations where filling up a gas tank with gasoline could be wrong, for example, if it's not your car and you don't have permission to fill it up, or if you're doing it to sabotage someone's vehicle by using the wrong type of fuel. But in the way it's phrased here, it seems like a routine action with no moral implications.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
