Availability is a measure of the probability that a system is functioning properly at a given time.\n\nThe formula for availability (A) is:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{MTBF}{MTBF + MTTR} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) is the average time between failures.\n\n- MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) is the average time to repair the system after a failure.\n\nGiven:\n\n- MTBF = 10,000 hours\n\n- MTTR = 20 hours\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{10,000}{10,000 + 20} = \\frac{10,000}{10,020} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the fraction:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{10,000}{10,020} \\approx 0.9980 \\]\n\nTo express this as a percentage:\n\n\\[ A \\approx 0.9980 \\times 100\\% = 99.80\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the availability of the software product is approximately 99.80%.\n\nIt's important to note that the number of customers using the product (100 customers in this case) does not affect the availability calculation directly, as availability is a property of the system itself and not dependent on the number of users. However, in practical scenarios, the number of users could indirectly affect availability if, for example, increased usage leads to more frequent failures or longer repair times, but in this problem, we are to assume that the MTBF and MTTR remain constant regardless of the number of users.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 99.80%\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
