                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal scenario. So, we've got a defendant on trial for robbery, and he's taken the stand to testify on his own behalf. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asks him if he committed false pretenses by making unauthorized long-distance phone calls using someone else's credit card number. The defendant denies it, saying it's a lie and that he never did it.\n\nThen, in rebuttal, the prosecutor calls the court officer to testify that the defendant actually admitted to committing false pretenses. Moreover, the court officer says that the defendant was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony against others.\n\nNow, the question is about the admissibility of the court officer's testimony. The options are:\n\nA. Admissible, as bearing on the defendant's credibility.\n\nB. Admissible, as bearing on the defendant's guilt.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because the testimony is extrinsic evidence.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the court order is the best evidence.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what the court officer is testifying about. The officer says that the defendant admitted to committing false pretenses and was granted immunity in exchange for testimony against others.\n\nLet's consider why the prosecutor is bringing this up. The defendant just denied making unauthorized phone calls using a credit card number, which seems related to false pretenses. So, the prosecutor is trying to impeach the defendant's credibility by showing that he has a history of lying or engaging in similar misconduct.\n\nIn criminal trials, impeaching the credibility of a witness, including the defendant if he testifies, is allowed. One way to do this is by introducing evidence that the witness has lied or has a history of untruthfulness.\n\nNow, option A says the testimony is admissible as bearing on the defendant's credibility. That seems plausible because the prosecutor is trying to show that the defendant is not being truthful.\n\nOption B says it's admissible as bearing on the defendant's guilt. Hmm, that might be stretching it. The defendant is on trial for robbery, and the prosecutor is trying to introduce evidence of another crime, false pretenses. Generally, evidence of other crimes is not admissible to prove guilt of the current crime, unless it falls under certain exceptions, like intent, knowledge, or identity.\n\nBut in this case, it seems the prosecutor is using it to impeach credibility, not to prove guilt of the robbery. So, option A seems more appropriate than B.\n\nOption C says the testimony is inadmissible because it's extrinsic evidence. Extrinsic evidence typically refers to evidence that is offered to prove something outside of what's already been presented in the trial. In the context of impeaching a witness's credibility, extrinsic evidence is generally not allowed to prove specific acts of misconduct.\n\nWait a minute, this is getting tricky. Let's recall the rules of evidence regarding impeachment.\n\nGenerally, when impeaching a witness's credibility, you can introduce evidence of specific acts of misconduct, but there are restrictions. For defendants, it's more restrictive because introducing evidence of other crimes can be prejudicial.\n\nIn federal courts, under Rule 608(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, extrinsic evidence of specific instances of a witness's conduct is not admissible to attack or support the witness's character for truthfulness. However, you can ask questions about those specific instances on cross-examination, and if the witness denies them, you can't then introduce extrinsic evidence to prove them.\n\nBut in this case, the defendant was asked about committing false pretenses, and he denied it. Then, in rebuttal, the prosecutor calls the court officer to testify about the admission.\n\nThis seems like an attempt to introduce extrinsic evidence to prove the specific instance that was denied on cross-examination, which is generally not allowed under Rule 608(b).\n\nSo, based on that, option C might be correct: the testimony is inadmissible because it's extrinsic evidence.\n\nBut there's more to consider. The court officer also testifies that the defendant was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony against others. This could be relevant for impeachment purposes because it shows that the defendant has a motive to lie or has a history of untruthfulness.\n\nHowever, granting immunity doesn't necessarily mean that the defendant committed perjury or lied under oath. It just means that he was given immunity in exchange for testimony.\n\nMoreover, the court officer testifies that the defendant admitted to committing false pretenses. If this is true, it could be used to impeach the defendant's credibility by showing that he has a history of lying or engaging in dishonest acts.\n\nBut again, under Rule 608(b), extrinsic evidence of specific instances of conduct is not admissible to attack credibility, unless it's for impeachment by contradiction.\n\nImpeachment by contradiction allows introducing extrinsic evidence to contradict the witness's denial of a specific act, but it's limited to instances that are probative of the witness's character for truthfulness.\n\nIn this case, the specific act is committing false pretenses, which involves deceit or misrepresentation. That could be relevant to the defendant's character for truthfulness.\n\nHowever, there's also the issue of the court order granting immunity. Is that relevant? Well, it might suggest that the defendant has a reason to lie or has lied in the past, but it's a bit tangential.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Admissible, as bearing on the defendant's credibility.\n\nB. Admissible, as bearing on the defendant's guilt.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because the testimony is extrinsic evidence.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the court order is the best evidence.\n\nOption D seems off. The best evidence rule generally applies to the production of original documents or recordings when their contents are at issue. Here, it's not clear that the court order itself is at issue, so this option might not be applicable.\n\nGiven the analysis above, option C seems the most accurate: the testimony is inadmissible because it's extrinsic evidence. The prosecutor can't introduce extrinsic evidence to prove the specific instance of misconduct that was denied by the defendant on cross-examination.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that there might be exceptions or specific circumstances where such evidence could be admitted, but based on the standard rules of evidence, particularly Rule 608(b), option C appears to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
