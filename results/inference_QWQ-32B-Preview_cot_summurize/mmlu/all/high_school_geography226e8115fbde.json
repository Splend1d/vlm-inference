                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the characteristic that belongs to a developed country from this list. Let me think about what I know about developed countries.\n\nFirst, option A says \"over 50% of the workforce engaged in agriculture.\" I recall that in developed countries, the economy is more diversified, and a smaller percentage of the population works in agriculture. In fact, agriculture usually employs a smaller fraction of the workforce in developed nations because industries and services are more prominent. So, this seems unlikely for a developed country.\n\nOption B mentions \"women held in an inferior place in society.\" Developed countries generally have better records on gender equality. They often have laws and social norms that promote equal rights for women. So, this doesn't sound like a characteristic of a developed country.\n\nOption C says \"main disease related to age and lifestyle.\" In developed countries, people generally have access to better healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions. This often leads to longer lifespans and diseases associated with aging, such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, which are lifestyle and age-related. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D is \"high birth and death rates.\" I think in developed countries, both birth and death rates are typically lower compared to developing countries. Lower death rates are due to better healthcare, and lower birth rates often result from education and family planning options.\n\nComparing all these options, option C seems to be the most accurate characteristic of a developed country. Diseases related to age and lifestyle are more common in developed nations where people live longer and face different health challenges than in developing countries, where infectious diseases might be more prevalent.\n\nSo, I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
