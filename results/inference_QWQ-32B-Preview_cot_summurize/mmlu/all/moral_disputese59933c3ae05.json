                    "text": "So I've got this question here about rule consequentialism, and I need to figure out what it says about the rightness or wrongness of an action. The options are:\n\nA. That it depends on the action's relationship to the operative rules of law.\n\nB. That it depends on the logical consistency behind the motive of actions of the same type.\n\nC. That it depends on whether a virtuous person would endorse a rule requiring, permitting, or prohibiting that action.\n\nD. That it depends on whether that action is required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule whose consequences are best.\n\nHmm, rule consequentialism sounds like a type of ethical theory, right? I think it's related to consequentialism, which is about looking at the outcomes or consequences of actions to determine their moral value. But rule consequentialism specifically considers rules and their consequences.\n\nOption A mentions operative rules of law. That sounds more like legalism or something, where actions are judged based on their compliance with laws. But rule consequentialism is about rules whose consequences are best, not necessarily about legal rules. So maybe A isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B talks about logical consistency behind motives of actions of the same type. That sounds a bit like Kant's categorical imperative, where you look at the consistency of your motives. But I don't think that's specifically what rule consequentialism is about. It seems more focused on consequences than on the logical consistency of motives.\n\nOption C mentions whether a virtuous person would endorse a rule. That sounds more like virtue ethics or perhaps a hybrid approach. Rule consequentialism, as I understand it, is more about the consequences of following certain rules rather than what a virtuous person would do.\n\nOption D says that the rightness or wrongness depends on whether the action is required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule whose consequences are best. That sounds directly in line with rule consequentialism. It's saying that we should follow rules that lead to the best overall consequences.\n\nLet me think about this a bit more. In rule consequentialism, the idea is to adopt rules that, if followed by everyone, would lead to the best outcomes. So, the morality of an individual action is determined by whether it conforms to these optimal rules.\n\nOption D seems to capture that idea because it links the morality of an action to whether it is required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule that has the best consequences.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, focuses on the relationship to operative rules of law, which isn't necessarily about the consequences of following those rules. It's more about legal compliance.\n\nOption B is about logical consistency in motives, which again doesn't directly relate to consequences.\n\nOption C brings in the concept of a virtuous person endorsing a rule, which is more aligned with virtue ethics than with consequentialism.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: whether that action is required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule the consequences of which are best.\n\nJust to make sure, let me see if there's any overlap or if I'm missing something.\n\nRule consequentialism evaluates actions based on their conformity to rules that, when generally followed, produce better consequences compared to other possible rules. So, the key is the consequences of the rules themselves.\n\nOption D explicitly mentions \"a rule the consequences of which are best,\" which aligns perfectly with this idea.\n\nOption C, about a virtuous person endorsing a rule, might be similar in some ways, but it's not specifically about the consequences of the rule. It's more about what a virtuous person would think is appropriate.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
