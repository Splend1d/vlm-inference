                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick which statement is often true about memory recall. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"People are more likely to recall information that is congruent with their prior schemas.\" Hmm, schemas are like mental frameworks that organize our knowledge and experiences. So, if new information fits into our existing schemas, it should be easier to remember because it makes sense in the context of what we already know. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption B: \"People will not recall information unless it is stored in working memory.\" Working memory is where we hold temporary information for current tasks. But recall can also come from long-term memory, right? For example, remembering your childhood friend or an event from years ago\u2014that's not in working memory. So, this seems too restrictive.\n\nOption C: \"People have no ability to recall information that has been extinguished.\" Extinguished information\u2014does that mean forgotten or erased? Well, in psychology, extinction refers to the process where a learned response is reduced when the stimulus is no longer paired with the original outcome. But people can sometimes recall extinct memories under certain conditions, like through retrieval cues or therapy. So, saying people have no ability to recall extinct information might not be accurate.\n\nOption D: \"People will recall nonsense syllables more rapidly than they will sets of numbers.\" Nonsense syllables are meaningless combinations of letters, like \"dax\" or \"tiv.\" Sets of numbers could be sequences like phone numbers or dates. I think numbers have more structure and can be organized into patterns, which might make them easier to recall than random syllables that don't mean anything. So, this option seems counterintuitive.\n\nBased on this reasoning, Option A seems the most accurate. It aligns with the idea that our prior knowledge and expectations help us remember new information that fits into our existing schemas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
