                    "text": "Let's see. I remember Albert Bandura from my psychology class. He did some famous studies with kids and how they learn by watching others. So, the question is about children imitating aggressive behavior they see adults doing. The options are instrumental learning, modeling, the copycat effect, and thanatos.\n\nFirst, instrumental learning sounds familiar. I think that's when behavior is learned through rewards and punishments. Like, if a child does something and gets a treat, they're more likely to do it again. But in this case, the children are just watching adults be aggressive, not getting rewarded for anything themselves. So, maybe not instrumental learning.\n\nNext, modeling. I think that's exactly what Bandura's studies were about. He did the Bobo doll experiment, where kids watched adults hit a inflatable doll and then later imitated that behavior. So, modeling seems like a strong candidate. It's about learning by observing and copying others' behaviors.\n\nThen, the copycat effect. That sounds similar to modeling, but I'm not sure if it's the same thing or something different. Maybe it's a more general term for imitating others, not specifically in a psychological context.\n\nLastly, thanatos. I think that's related to Freud's concept of the death drive, something about inherent aggression or destructiveness in human nature. But in Bandura's work, it's more about learning through observation, not about innate aggression.\n\nSo, comparing these options, modeling seems to be the most accurate term for what Bandura found. It's about children learning and imitating behaviors they see in others, specifically aggressive behaviors in this case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
