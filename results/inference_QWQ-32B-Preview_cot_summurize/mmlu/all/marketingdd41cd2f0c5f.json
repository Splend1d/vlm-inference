When one channel member feels that another is hindering their ability to achieve their goals, it leads to stress and tension, which is essentially what conflict is. Let me see why the other options might not fit as well.\n\nOption A, channel communication, is about how information is exchanged between channel members. While poor communication can lead to conflict, the statement is specifically about the perception of goal impediment causing stress, which seems more directly related to conflict itself.\n\nOption C, channel relationships, refers to the ties and interactions between different channel members. Relationships can be good or bad, and conflict can certainly affect them, but again, the core issue here seems to be the conflict arising from perceived impediments to goal attainment.\n\nOption D, customer conflict, seems to focus on conflicts with customers rather than between channel members. The statement is about perceptions between channel members, not between a channel member and its customers.\n\nSo, overall, B. Channel conflict appears to be the most appropriate answer because it directly addresses the stress and tension resulting from one channel member perceiving that another is hindering its goal achievement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
