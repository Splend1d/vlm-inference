It shows a big jump in literacy, especially after the Russian Revolution in 1917. A historian who likes Soviet communism would use this to support one of these propositions. Let's see which one makes the most sense.\n\nOption A says that the ideals of the Russian Revolution were betrayed by Leninist and Stalinist regimes. But if the historian is sympathetic to communism, they probably wouldn't think that the regimes betrayed the revolution's ideals. So maybe not A.\n\nOption B is about Lenin and Stalin improving military preparedness. The chart is about literacy, not military stuff, so that doesn't seem directly related.\n\nOption C compares communism in Russia and China, saying it worked more efficiently in Russia. Again, the chart is about literacy in Russia, not a comparison with China.\n\nOption D says that despite some abuses by Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet regime achieved significant things. Well, the literacy rates did go up a lot under Soviet rule. So even if there were abuses, which we know there were, the regime still managed to educate more people, which is a big achievement.\n\nSo, if I were that sympathetic historian, I'd probably pick D. It acknowledges that there were problematic aspects to Lenin and Stalin's rule but also highlights positive accomplishments like improving literacy.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's a better fit.\n\nA is about ideals being betrayed, which doesn't align with a sympathetic view.\n\nB is about military preparedness, which isn't shown in the literacy rates.\n\nC is comparing Russia and China, which isn't relevant here.\n\nD seems to be the only option that connects the literacy rates improvement with the Soviet regime's achievements, while also acknowledging that there were abuses.\n\nYeah, I think D is the one.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
