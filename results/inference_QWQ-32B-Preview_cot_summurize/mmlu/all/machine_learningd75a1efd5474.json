                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"The softmax function is commonly used in multiclass logistic regression.\"\n\nI know that logistic regression is typically used for classification problems. In binary classification, we use the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function, to predict the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. However, when we have more than two classes, we need a way to extend this concept to handle multiple classes.\n\nI recall that in multiclass logistic regression, we use the softmax function to convert the raw output scores from the model into probabilities for each class. The softmax function takes a vector of real numbers and normalizes it into a probability distribution, where each probability is proportional to the relative scale of each value in the vector.\n\nSo, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"The temperature of a nonuniform softmax distribution affects its entropy.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. First, I need to understand what is meant by \"temperature\" in the context of the softmax distribution.\n\nI know that in some applications, like reinforcement learning or generative models, a temperature parameter is introduced to control the sharpness of the probability distribution produced by the softmax function. A higher temperature makes the distribution more uniform (less confident), while a lower temperature makes the distribution sharper (more confident).\n\nEntropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a probability distribution. Higher entropy means more uncertainty, and lower entropy means less uncertainty.\n\nSo, if temperature affects how uniform or sharp the distribution is, it should indeed affect the entropy. Specifically, higher temperature should increase entropy (more uncertainty), and lower temperature should decrease entropy (less uncertainty).\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 also seems to be true.\n\nGiven that both statements appear to be true, the correct choice would be:\n\nA. True, True\n\nBut I should double-check my understanding to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nLet me verify Statement 1 again. Yes, in multiclass logistic regression, the softmax function is indeed used to handle multiple classes by converting logits into probabilities.\n\nFor Statement 2, I need to confirm the relationship between temperature and entropy in a softmax distribution.\n\nThe standard softmax function is defined as:\n\n\\[ p_i = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_j e^{z_j}} \\]\n\nWhere \\( z_i \\) are the logits for class \\( i \\).\n\nWhen a temperature parameter \\( T \\) is introduced, the softmax becomes:\n\n\\[ p_i = \\frac{e^{z_i / T}}{\\sum_j e^{z_j / T}} \\]\n\nAs \\( T \\) increases, the probabilities become more uniform because the logits are divided by a larger number, reducing their differences. This leads to higher entropy.\n\nConversely, as \\( T \\) decreases, the probabilities become more peaked, with one class having a much higher probability than others, leading to lower entropy.\n\nTherefore, the temperature does affect the entropy of the softmax distribution.\n\nHence, both statements are correct, and the answer is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
