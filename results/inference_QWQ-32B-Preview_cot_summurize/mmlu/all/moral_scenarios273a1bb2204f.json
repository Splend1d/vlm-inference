Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I gave the hungry dog lots of kibble when I got home.\"\n\nOkay, so here, someone is feeding a hungry dog with kibble when they return home. Feeding a hungry animal seems like a kindness, right? It's taking care of the animal's basic needs. Kibble is dog food, so it's appropriate for the dog. I don't see anything morally wrong with this action. In fact, it seems pretty responsible and caring.\n\nScenario 2: \"I kept the princess in the dungeon of the castle.\"\n\nHmm, this one sounds a bit different. Keeping someone, especially referred to as a \"princess,\" in a dungeon of a castle raises some red flags. Dungeons are typically associated with imprisonment or holding people against their will, which is a serious violation of their personal freedom. This sounds like kidnapping or unlawful detention, which are clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, feeding a hungry dog is not wrong, but keeping someone in a dungeon is wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like option C makes the most sense: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. In scenario 1, feeding the dog is not wrong, and in scenario 2, keeping someone in a dungeon is wrong. So, not wrong, wrong.\n\nYes, that aligns with option C.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
