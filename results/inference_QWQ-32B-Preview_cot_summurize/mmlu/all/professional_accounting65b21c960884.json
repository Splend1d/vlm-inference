                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about inherent risk, control risk, and detection risk in auditing. So, the question is: \"Inherent risk and control risk differ from detection risk in which of the following ways?\" And we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what each of these risks means in the context of auditing.\n\n- **Inherent risk** is the risk that there are material misstatements due to error or fraud in the financial statements before considering internal controls.\n\n- **Control risk** is the risk that internal controls will not prevent or detect and correct material misstatements in a timely manner.\n\n- **Detection risk** is the risk that the auditor will not detect material misstatements in the financial statements through their audit procedures.\n\nSo, inherent risk and control risk are related to the entity being audited, whereas detection risk is related to the auditor's procedures.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. \"Inherent risk and control risk are calculated by the client.\"\n\nHmm, I don't think that's accurate. While the client has internal controls and understands their business risks, it's the auditor's responsibility to assess these risks as part of the audit process. So, probably not A.\n\nB. \"Inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit.\"\n\nThis seems plausible because inherent risk is about the nature of the business and its vulnerabilities to errors or fraud, and control risk is about the effectiveness of the internal controls. Both of these exist whether or not an audit is being performed.\n\nC. \"Inherent risk and control risk are controlled by the auditor.\"\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. The auditor assesses these risks but doesn't control them. The client manages their business and its controls. So, likely not C.\n\nD. \"Inherent risk and control risk exist as a result of the auditor\u2019s judgment about materiality.\"\n\nMateriality is certainly a factor in the auditor's assessment, but inherent and control risks are more fundamental to the business and its controls. They exist independently of the auditor's materiality judgments, although materiality affects how the auditor responds to these risks.\n\nComparing all options, B seems the most accurate: inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit, whereas detection risk is directly related to the auditor's procedures and approach.\n\nTo double-check, let's think about it this way: if there was no audit happening, would inherent and control risks still exist? Yes, because the business still has risks of errors or fraud, and internal controls may or may not be effective. Detection risk, however, only comes into play because the auditor is performing procedures to detect material misstatements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
