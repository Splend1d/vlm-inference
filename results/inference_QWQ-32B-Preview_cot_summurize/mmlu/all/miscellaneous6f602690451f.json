                    "text": "I'm trying to remember which college was the first to have both men and women studying together. I think it was one of these options: Oberlin College, Dartmouth College, Grinnell College, or Antioch College. I remember something about Oberlin being pioneering in education, but I'm not sure if it was the first to be coeducational. Maybe I should look into when each of these colleges started accepting both genders.\n\nLet me start with Oberlin College. I believe Oberlin was founded in Ohio and had a reputation for being progressive, especially in terms of education for African Americans and women. I think it might have been one of the first to admit women, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNext, Dartmouth College. That's in New Hampshire, right? I don't think Dartmouth was one of the early adopters of coeducation. I believe it's a more traditional Ivy League school, and maybe it took longer for them to become coeducational.\n\nThen there's Grinnell College in Iowa. I've heard of Grinnell, but I don't know much about its history regarding coeducation. Maybe it was later than Oberlin?\n\nAnd Antioch College in Ohio as well. I know Antioch is known for its cooperative education program, but I'm not sure about its role in coeducation.\n\nI think I need to look up when each of these colleges started admitting both men and women. Let's see:\n\n- Oberlin College: According to my research, Oberlin College became the first college in the United States to regularly admit women in 1837. So that's over 180 years ago!\n\n- Dartmouth College: Dartmouth was founded in 1769 and was originally an all-male institution. It didn't become coeducational until much later, in the mid-20th century, I believe.\n\n- Grinnell College: Grinnell was founded in 1846 and admitted women from its inception. So, it was coeducational from the start, but Oberlin was earlier.\n\n- Antioch College: Antioch was founded in 1850 and also admitted women from the beginning. Again, later than Oberlin.\n\nSo, based on this information, Oberlin College seems to be the first American college to become coeducational, starting in 1837.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there were any other colleges that might have admitted women earlier. For example, there were some women who attended colleges disguised as men before Oberlin's founding. Sarah Pierpont, for instance, attended a seminary that later became part of Yale University, but that was still before Oberlin.\n\nHowever, in terms of officially admitting women, Oberlin seems to be the pioneer. There might be some other institutions that admitted a few women earlier, but Oberlin was the first to have a regular admission of women as students.\n\nLet me check if there were any seminaries or institutes that preceded Oberlin in admitting women. For example, there was the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania, which was established in 1850, but that's for medical education, not a full college.\n\nAlternatively, there was the Troy Female Seminary, founded in 1821, but it was specifically for women, not coeducational.\n\nSo, it seems that Oberlin College was indeed the first American college to become coeducational, starting in 1837.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Oberlin College.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
