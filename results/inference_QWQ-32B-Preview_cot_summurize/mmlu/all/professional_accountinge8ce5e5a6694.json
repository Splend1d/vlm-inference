                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Brown cosigning Royal's $50,000 note to State Bank and what happens if Royal is found mentally incompetent. We need to figure out Brown's liability in this scenario.\n\nFirst off, let's clarify some terms. A cosigner, like Brown, is someone who signs a loan agreement along with the main borrower, Royal, to guarantee the loan. This means that if Royal can't pay back the loan, Brown is responsible for paying it.\n\nNow, the twist here is that Royal is later adjudicated mentally incompetent. That means a court has determined that Royal is not capable of managing their own affairs due to mental incapacity.\n\nSo, the question is, how does Royal's mental incompetence affect Brown's liability on the note?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Liable to pay State on the due date of the note.\n\nB. Liable to pay State only if State first seeks payment from Royal.\n\nC. Not liable to pay State because Royal's incompetency discharges Royal as a surety.\n\nD. Not liable to pay State unless Brown was a compensated surety.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, since Brown is a cosigner, he's essentially a guarantor of the loan. In guarantee agreements, the guarantor promises to pay the debt if the primary borrower defaults.\n\nNow, Royal's mental incompetence might affect his legal capacity to enter into contracts, including the loan agreement. If Royal was incompetent at the time the note was signed, that could potentially make the contract voidable or void.\n\nHowever, in this case, Royal was adjudicated incompetent after the note was signed, so the contract was likely valid at the time it was made.\n\nThe key here is to understand how Royal's subsequent incompetence affects the liability of the cosigner, Brown.\n\nOption A says Brown is liable to pay State on the due date of the note. This seems straightforward, but is there something about Royal's incompetence that changes this?\n\nOption B says Brown is liable only if State first seeks payment from Royal. This touches on the concept of \"defense of surety,\" where a guarantor can sometimes insist that the creditor first try to collect from the primary borrower.\n\nOption C says Brown is not liable because Royal's incompetency discharges Royal as a surety. This is interesting because it suggests that Royal's incompetence affects his status as a party to the contract.\n\nOption D says Brown is not liable unless he was a compensated surety. This introduces the idea that compensation might affect liability, which seems less relevant here.\n\nLet's consider the principles of guarantee and suretyship.\n\nIn suretyship, the surety (Brown) is secondarily liable, meaning the creditor (State Bank) must first seek payment from the principal debtor (Royal) before coming to the surety.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions where the surety's liability can be accelerated, such as if the principal debtor becomes insolvent or, in this case, incompetent.\n\nNow, Royal's incompetence might be considered an event that impairs his ability to fulfill his obligations, which could trigger Brown's liability sooner.\n\nBut, in general, the surety's liability isn't automatically discharged because the principal debtor becomes incompetent. Instead, the surety might still be liable, but the creditor may need to take certain steps, like appointing a guardian for Royal or dealing with his estate.\n\nOption C suggests that Royal's incompetency discharges him as a surety, but actually, Royal is the principal debtor, not the surety. Brown is the surety.\n\nSo, there might be some confusion in the wording here.\n\nMoreover, in many jurisdictions, the surety remains liable even if the principal debtor is discharged due to incapacity, unless there's a specific provision in the guarantee agreement that addresses this situation.\n\nOption D mentions whether Brown was a compensated surety. In some cases, a surety who receives compensation might have different rights or liabilities compared to an uncompensated surety, but this isn't directly relevant to the issue of the principal debtor's incompetence.\n\nGiven all this, option B seems the most plausible: Brown is liable to pay State only if State first seeks payment from Royal.\n\nThis aligns with the general principle that sureties have a right of exoneration or a right to require the creditor to pursue the principal debtor first.\n\nHowever, Royal's incompetence might complicate this, as the creditor might have to deal with a guardian or executor for Royal.\n\nBut, unless there's a specific provision in the guarantee agreement that addresses the principal debtor's incompetence, Brown's liability as a surety likely remains, subject to the standard rights of a surety.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be B: Liable to pay State only if State first seeks payment from Royal.\n\nThis respects the secondary nature of the surety's liability while acknowledging that Royal's incompetence might require the bank to take additional steps to seek payment from him.\n\nOptions A, C, and D don't accurately capture the interplay between suretyship principles and the principal debtor's incompetence.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
