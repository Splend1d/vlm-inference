                    "text": "So I've got this question here: If nominal GDP equals $6000 and the GDP deflator equals 200, then real GDP equals... and there are a few options. I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what nominal GDP and real GDP are. Nominal GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year, evaluated at current prices. Real GDP, on the other hand, is the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year, evaluated at constant prices. The GDP deflator is a measure that relates nominal GDP to real GDP. It's like an inflation gauge.\n\nThe formula that connects these three is:\n\nNominal GDP = Real GDP \u00d7 (GDP deflator / 100)\n\nSo, if I have nominal GDP and the GDP deflator, I can solve for real GDP.\n\nGiven:\n\nNominal GDP = $6000\n\nGDP deflator = 200\n\nI need to find real GDP.\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\n6000 = Real GDP \u00d7 (200 / 100)\n\nSimplify the deflator part:\n\n200 / 100 = 2\n\nSo, 6000 = Real GDP \u00d7 2\n\nNow, to find real GDP, I just need to divide both sides by 2:\n\nReal GDP = 6000 / 2 = $3000\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $30\n\nB. $3,000\n\nC. $12,000\n\nD. $1,200\n\nSo, $3,000 is option B.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. The formula is Nominal GDP equals real GDP times the deflator divided by 100. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nLet me see, if the deflator is 200, that means prices are twice as high as the base year. So, real GDP should be half of nominal GDP, because nominal GDP is inflated by prices being twice as high.\n\nSo, $6000 nominal divided by 2 (since deflator is 200, meaning 2 times the base year prices) should give $3000 real GDP. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the deflator as a price index. If the deflator is 200, that means prices have increased by 100% from the base year. So, to find real GDP, I need to adjust nominal GDP for inflation.\n\nThe formula I used seems correct, and my calculation shows real GDP is $3000.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to look at it. Sometimes I get confused with the deflator.\n\nAnother formula I've seen is:\n\nReal GDP = Nominal GDP / (GDP deflator / 100)\n\nSo, using that:\n\nReal GDP = 6000 / (200 / 100) = 6000 / 2 = 3000\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the deflator is expressed differently, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nI think option B, $3,000, is correct.\n\nWait, but option A is $30, which seems too low, and option C is $12,000, which would make no sense because if prices are higher, real GDP should be lower than nominal GDP. Option D is $1,200, which is also not matching my calculation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that $3,000 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n**Step-by-step explanation**\n\n1. **Understand the given values:**\n   - Nominal GDP: \\$6000\n   - GDP deflator: 200\n\n2. **Recall the relationship between nominal GDP, real GDP, and the GDP deflator:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Nominal GDP} = \\text{Real GDP} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{GDP deflator}}{100} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Plug in the given values into the formula:**\n   \\[\n   6000 = \\text{Real GDP} \\times \\left( \\frac{200}{100} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the deflator ratio:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{200}{100} = 2\n   \\]\n   So the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   6000 = \\text{Real GDP} \\times 2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for real GDP:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Real GDP} = \\frac{6000}{2} = 3000\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verify the calculation using an alternative formula:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Real GDP} = \\frac{\\text{Nominal GDP}}{\\left( \\frac{\\text{GDP deflator}}{100} \\right)} = \\frac{6000}{2} = 3000\n   \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   The real GDP is \\$3,000, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
