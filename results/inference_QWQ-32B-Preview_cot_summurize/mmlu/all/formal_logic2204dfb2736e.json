The sentence is \"Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy.\" And I'm given some symbols: i for Italy, m for Marco, s for Spain, and Mxyz means \"x moves to y from z.\" I need to pick the best translation into predicate logic from the options provided.\n\nLet me first understand the sentence clearly. It says that Marco does not move from Spain to Italy. So, in other words, it's negating the idea that Marco is moving from Spain to Italy.\n\nGiven that Mxyz means \"x moves to y from z,\" so Mmis would mean \"Marco moves to Italy from Spain,\" because m is Marco, i is Italy, and s is Spain.\n\nNow, since the sentence is saying that this doesn't happen, I need to negate that statement. So, it should be \"~Mmis,\" which means \"it is not the case that Marco moves to Italy from Spain.\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. ~Mmsi\n\nB. M~mis\n\nC. ~Mmis\n\nD. M~msi\n\nOption C matches what I think it should be, which is ~Mmis.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: ~Mmsi. This would be negating Mmsi, but according to the ordering, Mxyz is x moves to y from z. So Mmsi would be \"Marco moves to Spain from Italy,\" which is not what the original sentence is saying. It's about moving to Italy from Spain, not to Spain from Italy.\n\nOption B: M~mis. This seems odd because the negation symbol is inside the predicate. In standard predicate logic, negation applies to the entire predicate, so this doesn't make much sense. It's probably not the correct choice.\n\nOption D: M~msi. Again, the negation is placed inside the predicate, which isn't standard. So, this also seems incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option C, ~Mmis, appears to be the correct translation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other ways to interpret the sentence.\n\nAnother way to say \"Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy\" could be \"It is not the case that Marco moves to Italy from Spain,\" which is exactly what ~Mmis expresses.\n\nAlternatively, if there were a way to express that Marco stays in Spain or something like that, but the sentence specifically mentions moving from Spain to Italy and negating that action.\n\nSo, I think ~Mmis is indeed the best translation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
