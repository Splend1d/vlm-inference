Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the content of the media is determined by market forces. Hmm, that sounds like something related to how media companies operate in a capitalist system. They produce content that sells well or attracts advertisers. But is that what mass-society theory is specifically about?\n\nOption B mentions that subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class. That sounds more like Marxist theory, where the ruling class imposes its ideas on the rest of society through various institutions, including the media. But is that exactly what mass-society theory suggests?\n\nOption C says that the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers. This seems to align with the idea that people are easily influenced and controlled by the media, perhaps without much critical thinking on their part. That sounds like a key aspect of mass-society theory.\n\nOption D talks about audiences making selective interpretations of media messages. This sounds more like uses and gratifications theory or reception theory, where audiences actively choose how to interpret media content based on their own perspectives and needs.\n\nSo, considering these options, it seems like option C best captures the essence of mass-society theory. It emphasizes the passive nature of the audience and the manipulative power of the media over them.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about what mass-society theory is. It emerged in the early 20th century, particularly in the context of World War I and II, when mass communication technologies like radio and later television became widespread. The theory suggests that these technologies allow for the mass dissemination of information and ideas, which can shape public opinion and behavior.\n\nProponents of mass-society theory often viewed the masses as homogeneous and vulnerable to manipulation by those who control the media. This perspective was influenced by concerns about propaganda and the potential for totalitarian regimes to use mass media to control their populations.\n\nIn contrast, other theories, like uses and gratifications theory, emphasize the active role of audiences in choosing and interpreting media content. So, option D seems more aligned with that perspective.\n\nOption B, about subordinate classes being dominated by the ideology of the ruling class, is more associated with Marxist media theory, which analyzes how media perpetuate class inequalities and reinforce the status quo.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I believe that option C is the most accurate description of what mass-society theory suggests: that the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
