I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I rushed to the store and smashed the window with rocks.\" Hmm, smashing a store window with rocks sounds like vandalism. Destroying someone else's property without permission is generally considered wrong. It's against the law, and morally, it's not acceptable to damage other people's things without a valid reason. So, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I wiped the silverware with a clean towel and put them in a drawer.\" This seems like a normal household activity. Cleaning silverware and putting it away is pretty standard and doesn't harm anyone. It's a responsible thing to do, actually. So, this doesn't seem morally wrong at all.\n\nGiven that, the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong. So, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In the first scenario, smashing the window is clearly wrong, as it's destructive and illegal. In the second scenario, cleaning silverware is just everyday behavior, nothing wrong there.\n\nYes, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
