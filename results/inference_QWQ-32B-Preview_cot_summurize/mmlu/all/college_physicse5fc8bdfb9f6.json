                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two observers: O, who is at rest midway between two light sources at x = 0 and x = 10 m, and O', who is moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis. Observer O sees the two sources flash simultaneously, but observer O' sees one flash 13 ns before the other. We need to find the speed of O' relative to O.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. The two light sources are at x = 0 and x = 10 m, and O is at the midpoint, which is x = 5 m. Since O sees the flashes simultaneously, the light from both sources reaches O at the same time.\n\nNow, observer O' is moving at a constant speed v relative to O along the x-axis. Due to this motion, O' observes a time difference of 13 ns between the two flashes.\n\nThis scenario involves relativistic effects because the observers are in different inertial frames moving at constant relative velocity. Specifically, it's related to time dilation and the relativity of simultaneity.\n\nLet's recall that in special relativity, events that are simultaneous in one frame may not be simultaneous in another frame moving relative to the first. The time difference observed by O' is due to this relativity of simultaneity.\n\nThe formula that relates the time difference observed in two inertual frames for events that are simultaneous in one frame but separated in space is:\n\n\u0394t' = \u03b3 * (v/c\u00b2) * \u0394x\n\nwhere:\n\n- \u0394t' is the time difference observed by O',\n\n- \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor (1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)),\n\n- v is the relative velocity between the frames,\n\n- c is the speed of light,\n\n- \u0394x is the spatial separation between the events in the direction of motion.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \u0394t' = 13 ns = 13 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 s,\n\n- \u0394x = 10 m (the separation between the two light sources),\n\n- c = 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s.\n\nWe need to find v in terms of c.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n13 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 = \u03b3 * (v / (3 \u00d7 10\u2078)\u00b2) * 10\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n13 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 = \u03b3 * (v / 9 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076) * 10\n\n13 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 = (\u03b3 * v * 10) / (9 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076)\n\nMultiply both sides by 9 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076:\n\n13 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 * 9 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 = \u03b3 * v * 10\n\nCalculate the left side:\n\n13 \u00d7 9 = 117\n\n10\u207b\u2079 * 10\u00b9\u2076 = 10\u2077\n\nSo, 117 \u00d7 10\u2077 = \u03b3 * v * 10\n\nWhich is 1.17 \u00d7 10\u2079 = \u03b3 * v * 10\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n1.17 \u00d7 10\u2078 = \u03b3 * v\n\nNow, recall that \u03b3 = 1 / \u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nSo, \u03b3 * v = v / \u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nTherefore:\n\n1.17 \u00d7 10\u2078 = v / \u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nLet's denote \u03b2 = v/c, so v = \u03b2c.\n\nThen:\n\n1.17 \u00d7 10\u2078 = \u03b2c / \u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2)\n\nWe know c = 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s, so:\n\n1.17 \u00d7 10\u2078 = \u03b2 * 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 / \u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2)\n\nDivide both sides by 10\u2078:\n\n1.17 = 3\u03b2 / \u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2)\n\nNow, solve for \u03b2:\n\n1.17 \u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2) = 3\u03b2\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(1.17)\u00b2 (1 - \u03b2\u00b2) = (3\u03b2)\u00b2\n\nCalculate (1.17)\u00b2 \u2248 1.3689\n\nSo:\n\n1.3689 (1 - \u03b2\u00b2) = 9\u03b2\u00b2\n\nDistribute 1.3689:\n\n1.3689 - 1.3689\u03b2\u00b2 = 9\u03b2\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1.3689 - 1.3689\u03b2\u00b2 - 9\u03b2\u00b2 = 0\n\n1.3689 - (1.3689 + 9)\u03b2\u00b2 = 0\n\n1.3689 - 10.3689\u03b2\u00b2 = 0\n\nNow, solve for \u03b2\u00b2:\n\n10.3689\u03b2\u00b2 = 1.3689\n\n\u03b2\u00b2 = 1.3689 / 10.3689 \u2248 0.132\n\nTake square root:\n\n\u03b2 \u2248 \u221a0.132 \u2248 0.363\n\nTherefore, v \u2248 0.363c\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.13c\n\nB. 0.15c\n\nC. 0.36c\n\nD. 0.53c\n\nThe closest match is C. 0.36c.\n\nLet's double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting from:\n\n1.17 = 3\u03b2 / \u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2)\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n0.39 = \u03b2 / \u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2)\n\nNow, square both sides:\n\n0.39\u00b2 = \u03b2\u00b2 / (1 - \u03b2\u00b2)\n\n0.1521 = \u03b2\u00b2 / (1 - \u03b2\u00b2)\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - \u03b2\u00b2):\n\n0.1521 (1 - \u03b2\u00b2) = \u03b2\u00b2\n\n0.1521 - 0.1521\u03b2\u00b2 = \u03b2\u00b2\n\n0.1521 = \u03b2\u00b2 + 0.1521\u03b2\u00b2\n\n0.1521 = 1.1521\u03b2\u00b2\n\n\u03b2\u00b2 = 0.1521 / 1.1521 \u2248 0.132\n\n\u03b2 \u2248 \u221a0.132 \u2248 0.363\n\nYes, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the speed of O' relative to O is approximately 0.36 times the speed of light.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.36c} \\]"
