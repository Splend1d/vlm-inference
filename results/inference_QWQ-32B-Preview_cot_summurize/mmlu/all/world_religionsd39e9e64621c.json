Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"It was visited by Moses.\" Hmm, Moses is a prophet in Islam, but I'm not sure if there's any specific mention of him visiting the Ka'ba. I think the Ka'ba was built by Abraham and his son Ishmael, but I'm not sure about Moses. Maybe I need to look into that.\n\nOption B says, \"It is a haram.\" I believe \"haram\" in this context means a sacred place, and yes, the area around the Ka'ba is considered sacred, known as the Haram Sharif. So this seems correct.\n\nOption C says, \"It was built by Abraham.\" Yeah, that's a fundamental belief in Islam. Abraham and Ishmael are said to have rebuilt the Ka'ba, which\u636e\u8bf4\u662f\u6700\u521d\u7531\u4e9a\u5f53\u5efa\u9020\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u540e\u6765\u6bc1\u574f\u4e86\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4ed6\u4eec\u91cd\u65b0\u5efa\u9020\u4e86\u5b83\u3002\n\nOption D says, \"It is a square building.\" I know that the Ka'ba is a cube-shaped structure, so it's essentially square in shape. So that seems accurate too.\n\nSo, between these options, A seems a bit iffy because I don't recall any specific mention of Moses visiting the Ka'ba. Whereas the other options seem to be correctly describing aspects of the Ka'ba.\n\nMaybe I should double-check about Moses and the Ka'ba. I know that Moses is revered in Islam, and he had many encounters with God, but I don't think visiting the Ka'ba is one of them, especially since it was rebuilt by Abraham much later. So, probably, that's the incorrect statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. It was visited by Moses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
