                    "text": "To find the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 231, I need to convert 231 from base 10 to base 16. Hexadecimal is base 16, which means it uses 16 symbols: 0-9 and A-F, where A represents 10, B represents 11, C represents 12, D represents 13, E represents 14, and F represents 15 in decimal.\n\nThe process involves dividing the decimal number by 16 and keeping track of the remainders. Each remainder corresponds to a hexadecimal digit, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\nLet's start with 231 divided by 16:\n\n231 \u00f7 16 = 14 with a remainder of 7.\n\nSo, the least significant digit (rightmost) is 7.\n\nNow, take the quotient, which is 14, and divide it by 16:\n\n14 \u00f7 16 = 0 with a remainder of 14.\n\nSince 14 in hexadecimal is E, the next digit is E.\n\nSo, reading from most significant to least significant, the hexadecimal representation of 231_{10} is E7_{16}.\n\nLet me verify this by converting E7_{16} back to decimal:\n\nE in decimal is 14, and 7 is 7.\n\nSo, E7_{16} = (14 \u00d7 16^1) + (7 \u00d7 16^0) = (14 \u00d7 16) + (7 \u00d7 1) = 224 + 7 = 231_{10}.\n\nIt matches the original decimal number, so the conversion is correct.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 17_{16} = (1 \u00d7 16) + 7 = 16 + 7 = 23_{10}\n\nB. E4_{16} = (14 \u00d7 16) + 4 = 224 + 4 = 228_{10}\n\nC. E7_{16} = (14 \u00d7 16) + 7 = 224 + 7 = 231_{10}\n\nD. F4_{16} = (15 \u00d7 16) + 4 = 240 + 4 = 244_{10}\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. E7_{16}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
