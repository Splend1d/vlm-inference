                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 60-year-old man who had a total thyroidectomy and excision of enlarged left jugular lymph nodes for follicular carcinoma. The operation went smoothly, and he's on some IV fluids with dextrose, saline, and potassium. Twelve hours post-op, he starts feeling numbness around his mouth and in his fingertips, and he's getting really anxious. His vitals are a bit elevated, but not too bad: temp 37.6\u00b0C, pulse 90, respirations 16, blood pressure 140/90. The neck dressing is dry, no stridor, and his extremities are warm with good capillary refill.\n\nSo, the question is asking what additional physical examination finding is most likely in this scenario. The options are:\n\nA. Babinski sign present bilaterally\n\nB. Chvostek sign\n\nC. Deviation of the tongue to the left side\n\nD. A drooping left shoulder\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on with this patient. He had a total thyroidectomy, which means his entire thyroid gland was removed. Follicular carcinoma is a type of thyroid cancer, and removing the thyroid is a common treatment. Additionally, they removed enlarged lymph nodes in the left jugular area, which suggests there might be metastasis to those nodes.\n\nNow, 12 hours post-op, he's developing circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he's anxious. Numbness around the mouth and in the fingertips can be signs of low calcium levels, or hypocalcemia. This is a known complication after thyroid surgery, especially a total thyroidectomy, because the parathyroid glands, which regulate calcium levels, can be accidentally damaged or removed during the procedure.\n\nParathyroid glands are four tiny glands usually located behind the thyroid gland, and they produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates blood calcium levels. During thyroid surgery, there's a risk of injuring or removing these glands, leading to hypoparathyroidism and subsequently hypocalcemia.\n\nSymptoms of hypocalcemia include:\n\n- Circumoral and acral paresthesias (numbness around the mouth and in the extremities)\n\n- Muscle cramps or tetany\n\n- Anxiety and irritability\n\n- Chvostek sign and Trousseau sign (more on these later)\n\nGiven that the patient is experiencing numbness and anxiety, hypocalcemia is a strong possibility here.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Babinski sign present bilaterally\n\nThe Babinski sign is a neurological finding where the big toe extends upward and the other toes fan out when the sole of the foot is stimulated. It's normally present in infants but indicates upper motor neuron\u75c5\u53d8 in adults. It's not directly related to hypocalcemia, so this seems less likely.\n\nB. Chvostek sign\n\nChvostek sign is a hyperexcitability of the facial muscles in response to tapping over the area of the facial nerve in the face. It's a sign of hypocalcemia because low calcium levels increase neuromuscular irritability. So, if you tap lightly over the facial nerve, it can cause twitching or contraction of the facial muscles.\n\nGiven that the patient has symptoms suggestive of hypocalcemia, finding a Chvostek sign on examination would support this diagnosis.\n\nC. Deviation of the tongue to the left side\n\nTongue deviation can indicate a problem with the hypoglossal nerve, which innervates the tongue muscles. If the tongue deviates to one side, it suggests weakness or paralysis of the muscles on that side.\n\nIn the context of thyroid surgery, there's a risk of injuring the hypoglossal nerve, which runs near the thyroid gland. However, this seems less directly related to the symptoms of numbness and anxiety that the patient is experiencing, which are more suggestive of hypocalcemia.\n\nD. A drooping left shoulder\n\nDrooping of the shoulder could suggest weakness or paralysis of the muscles innervated by the lower cervical nerves, possibly indicating injury to the phrenic nerve or other nerves during surgery.\n\nHowever, this doesn't directly relate to the symptoms of numbness and anxiety, which are more consistent with hypocalcemia.\n\nConsidering all this, the most likely additional physical examination finding in this patient would be the Chvostek sign, given the symptoms suggestive of hypocalcemia post-thyroidectomy.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Trousseau sign, which is another sign of hypocalcemia, involves inducing carpal spasm by inflating a blood pressure cuff above systolic pressure for a few minutes. However, this isn't one of the options.\n\nIn summary, given the clinical presentation and the context of recent thyroid surgery, hypocalcemia due to possible hypoparathyroidism is the most likely scenario, and the Chvostek sign would be a relevant physical examination finding in this case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
