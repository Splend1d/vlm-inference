                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Gamma Co., which makes medical products. It says they have a 10% return on assets and an asset turnover of 4:1. I need to find out their profit margin on sales from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what these terms mean. Return on assets (ROA) is a profitability ratio that shows how efficient a company is in using its assets to generate earnings. It's calculated as net income divided by average total assets. Asset turnover, on the other hand, measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It's calculated as net sales divided by average total assets.\n\nThe formula for ROA is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\nAnd for asset turnover:\n\n\\[ \\text{Asset Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\nNow, profit margin on sales is a measure of profitability that shows how much of each dollar of sales translates into profit. It's calculated as net income divided by net sales.\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Net Sales}} \\]\n\nI need to find the profit margin, and I have ROA and asset turnover. Is there a relationship between these three ratios? Yes, there is. The DuPont identity breaks down ROA into two components: profit margin and asset turnover.\n\nThe DuPont formula for ROA is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\text{Profit Margin} \\times \\text{Asset Turnover} \\]\n\nSo, if I have ROA and asset turnover, I can solve for profit margin.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = 10\\% = 0.10 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Asset Turnover} = 4:1 = 4 \\]\n\nPlugging into the DuPont formula:\n\n\\[ 0.10 = \\text{Profit Margin} \\times 4 \\]\n\nNow, solve for profit margin:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit Margin} = \\frac{0.10}{4} = 0.025 \\]\n\nSo, the profit margin is 0.025, which is 2.5%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 40.00%\n\nB. 10.00%\n\nC. 4.00%\n\nD. 0.025\n\nWait, option D is 0.025, which is the decimal form of 2.5%. But 2.5% isn't listed explicitly. Maybe there's a mistake.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nGiven:\n\nROA = 10% = 0.10\n\nAsset Turnover = 4\n\nUsing DuPont formula:\n\nROA = Profit Margin \u00d7 Asset Turnover\n\nSo,\n\n0.10 = Profit Margin \u00d7 4\n\nTherefore,\n\nProfit Margin = 0.10 / 4 = 0.025, which is 2.5%\n\nBut 2.5% isn't directly listed. Option D is 0.025, which is the same as 2.5%. Maybe the question expects the decimal form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the standard profit margin formula and see.\n\nProfit Margin = Net Income / Net Sales\n\nFrom ROA, I have Net Income / Average Total Assets = 0.10\n\nFrom Asset Turnover, Net Sales / Average Total Assets = 4\n\nI can express Net Income in terms of Net Sales.\n\nFrom Asset Turnover:\n\nNet Sales = 4 \u00d7 Average Total Assets\n\nFrom ROA:\n\nNet Income = 0.10 \u00d7 Average Total Assets\n\nTherefore,\n\nProfit Margin = Net Income / Net Sales = (0.10 \u00d7 Average Total Assets) / (4 \u00d7 Average Total Assets)\n\nThe Average Total Assets cancel out:\n\nProfit Margin = 0.10 / 4 = 0.025 or 2.5%\n\nSo, again, I get 0.025 or 2.5%.\n\nGiven that 0.025 is listed as option D, I think that's the correct answer, even though 2.5% isn't explicitly stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the asset turnover ratio. Sometimes, asset turnover is expressed in different ways, but in this case, it's given as 4:1, which is standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ROA is based on ending assets rather than average assets, but typically, ROA uses average total assets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different formula I should be using, but the DuPont identity is a standard way to break down ROA into profit margin and asset turnover.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different answer based on a different interpretation of return on assets.\n\nWait, sometimes ROA can be calculated using operating income instead of net income, but in standard definitions, ROA uses net income.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a industry-specific adjustment, but given that it's a medical products manufacturer, I don't see why that would apply here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the asset turnover is 4:1, which might mean that for every dollar of assets, they generate $4 in sales.\n\nGiven that, and with ROA of 10%, meaning for every dollar of assets, they generate $0.10 in net income.\n\nTherefore, profit margin would be net income divided by sales: $0.10 / $4 = 0.025 or 2.5%.\n\nSo, again, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is 0.025, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the asset turnover ratio is not directly applicable in this way, but based on the DuPont identity, it should be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me by providing an asset turnover of 4:1, which might be interpreted differently.\n\nWait, 4:1 could be a debt to equity ratio or something else, but in the context, it's specified as asset turnover.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula for asset turnover in the medical industry, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is option D, 0.025.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
