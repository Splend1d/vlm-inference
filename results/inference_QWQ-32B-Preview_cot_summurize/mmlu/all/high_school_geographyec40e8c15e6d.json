                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on agricultural history, but I think I can figure this out. So, the question is about the Third Agricultural Revolution and which crop initiated it. The options are rice, wheat, barley, and millet.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Third Agricultural Revolution is. I believe it's also known as the Green Revolution, which was a period of significant increase in agricultural production, mainly due to new technologies, farming practices, and the development of high-yield varieties of crops.\n\nNow, thinking about the crops listed, wheat is probably the most likely candidate. Wheat has been a staple crop for thousands of years and has seen significant improvements in breeding and cultivation techniques during the Green Revolution. Norman Borlaug is famous for his work on developing high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties, which were a key part of the Green Revolution.\n\nRice is also an important crop, especially in Asia, and there were certainly improvements in rice cultivation during the Green Revolution, like the development of IR8 rice. But I think wheat was more central to initiating the revolution.\n\nBarley and millet are also important crops, but they aren't as widely cultivated as wheat and rice, and I don't recall them being at the forefront of the Green Revolution.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I'm going to go with wheat as the crop that began the Third Agricultural Revolution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
