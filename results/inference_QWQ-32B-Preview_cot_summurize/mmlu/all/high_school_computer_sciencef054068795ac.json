Each insect has its own age, so it shouldn't be static.\n\nB. nextAvailableID - This is used to assign unique IDs to each insect. It needs to keep track of the most recent ID assigned, so it should be shared among all instances of Insect. That sounds like a perfect candidate for a static variable.\n\nC. idNum - This is the unique ID for each insect, assigned based on nextAvailableID. Since each insect has its own ID, this should not be static.\n\nD. position - This is the location of each insect in the garden. Again, each insect has its own position, so this shouldn't be static.\n\nSo, based on this, I think nextAvailableID should be static. What do you think?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
