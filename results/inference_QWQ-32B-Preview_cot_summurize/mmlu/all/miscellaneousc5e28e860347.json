I think he wrote nine complete symphonies, but there's also some talk about a tenth symphony that was unfinished. So, his final completed symphony should be the Ninth, right?\n\nWait, let me think again. I remember that his Ninth Symphony is really famous, especially the choral part with \"Ode to Joy.\" I think that's the one he's most known for, and it was his last complete symphony.\n\nBut I've heard about a Tenth Symphony that he was working on, but he died before he could finish it. So, technically, the Tenth exists in sketches and fragments, but it wasn't completed by him.\n\nSo, if the question is about his final symphony, and considering that the Tenth was unfinished, maybe the answer is the Ninth.\n\nAlternatively, if they're including the unfinished symphony, then it might be the Tenth, but I doubt it because it wasn't completed.\n\nThen there are options for Eleventh and Twelfth, but I know that Beethoven didn't write that many symphonies. I think he only wrote nine complete ones, and the Tenth was incomplete.\n\nWait, maybe the options are just to test if I know that he only wrote nine symphonies, and the rest are either unfinished or don't exist.\n\nSo, in that case, the answer should be A. Ninth.\n\nBut let me check again. Beethoven's symphonies are numbered from one to nine, with the Ninth being the Choral Symphony.\n\nThere have been attempts to reconstruct his Tenth Symphony based on the sketches he left behind, but these are modern interpretations and not complete works by Beethoven himself.\n\nTherefore, his final completed symphony is the Ninth.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Ninth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
