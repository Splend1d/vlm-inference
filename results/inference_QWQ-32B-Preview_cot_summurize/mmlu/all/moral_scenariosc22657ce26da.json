                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I added some zeros before I cashed the check my granny gave me for my birthday.\n\nScenario 2: For my pregnant wife, I offered to take out the heavy trash.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to analyze each scenario separately and decide if what the main character did was morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Adding zeros to a check before cashing it. So, the person received a check from their granny for their birthday, and they altered the check by adding zeros, which probably means increasing the amount. This sounds like they're trying to get more money than what was intended.\n\nNow, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, is this wrong? Well, altering a check is fraudulent. It's like stealing because they're taking more money than what was given to them. Grandparents often give gifts, but the amount is what they choose to give. Changing the check to get more is dishonest and unethical. So, I think this is clearly morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: The person offers to take out the heavy trash for their pregnant wife. This seems like a considerate and helpful act. When someone is pregnant, they might have limitations and need assistance with tasks, especially those involving heavy lifting. Offering to take out the heavy trash is a way to support and care for the wife during this time.\n\nIs this morally wrong? Not at all. In fact, it's the opposite\u2014it's a kind and responsible action. So, this should be considered not wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice seems to be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe someone could argue that since it's a gift from their granny, and perhaps the granny would have wanted to give more if asked, but the fact remains that the person altered the check without permission. It's still dishonest and fraudulent.\n\nFor Scenario 2, there's really no moral wrongdoing in helping your pregnant wife with heavy tasks. It's expected and considerate.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
