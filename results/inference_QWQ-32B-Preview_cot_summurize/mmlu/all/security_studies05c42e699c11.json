                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement can't be applied to the initial development of peace studies. So, I have four options here: A, B, C, and D. I need to think about each one and see which one doesn't fit with how peace studies started.\n\nOption A says: \"Mathematicians and natural scientists entered the field, which was otherwise a social-sciences area of study, adding to the interdisciplinary nature of the field.\" Hmm, peace studies is known for being interdisciplinary, bringing together different fields to understand peace and conflict. So, it makes sense that mathematicians and natural scientists would contribute, maybe with models or data analysis. But was this part of the initial development?\n\nI think peace studies started more within the social sciences, focusing on politics, sociology, and psychology. Mathematicians and natural scientists might have joined later, perhaps with the study of arms races or environmental impacts on conflict. So, maybe this wasn't as prominent in the initial stages.\n\nOption B: \"Now of fundamental importance to peace studies as a field of research, the creation of journals was not a prominent feature of the peace studies until late in the twentieth century.\" Okay, journals are crucial for any academic field because they publish research and foster discussion. If peace studies didn't have prominent journals until late in the twentieth century, that might suggest that the field was still developing its structure and recognition.\n\nPeace studies as a formal academic discipline is relatively new, gaining momentum in the 1960s and 1970s. So, it's possible that journals became more prominent later on.\n\nOption C: \"Most early work was carried out in North America and Scandinavia.\" I know that peace research has strong roots in these regions. For example, the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) is a well-known institution in Norway. Also, in North America, universities like Toronto and Bradford have been centers for peace studies. So, this seems accurate for the initial development.\n\nOption D: \"The establishment of research institutes across the world has been one of the lasting successes of peace studies.\" This sounds right because peace studies has indeed led to the creation of various institutes and centers globally, which focus on research and education in peace and conflict studies.\n\nNow, considering all these options, I need to pick the one that cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies. Let's think again.\n\nOption A suggests that mathematicians and natural scientists entered a field that was otherwise social sciences, adding to its interdisciplinary nature. While peace studies is interdisciplinary now, I wonder if it was primarily social sciences at the beginning, with other disciplines joining later.\n\nOption B says that journals weren't a prominent feature until late in the twentieth century. But considering that peace studies started gaining academic recognition in the mid-twentieth century, it's possible that journals developed later as the field matured.\n\nOption C correctly identifies the regions where early work was done.\n\nOption D acknowledges the success of establishing research institutes worldwide.\n\nPerhaps option A is the one that couldn't be applied to the initial development because the field was still defining itself, and the inclusion of mathematicians and natural scientists might have come later as the field expanded.\n\nAlternatively, option B might be the answer if journals were actually an early feature of peace studies. But I think journals came later.\n\nWait, maybe option B is the correct answer because the creation of journals was actually a part of the initial development. If that's the case, then stating that journals weren't prominent until late in the twentieth century would be incorrect.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If peace studies began in the mid-twentieth century, say around the 1950s or 1960s, and journals started appearing in the 1970s or 1980s, that would be considered late in the twentieth century.\n\nBut I recall that some key journals in peace studies, like the Journal of Peace Research, were founded in the 1960s. So, if journals were established relatively early, then option B might not be accurate.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe some journals came later. But if journals were indeed a part of the initial development, then saying they weren't prominent until late in the twentieth century would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps peace studies didn't have many journals in the beginning, and they became more prominent later on.\n\nGiven that, option B might be the statement that cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies, assuming that journals were indeed a part of the early development.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. Maybe journals weren't as prominent in the early days, and only became so later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the establishment of research institutes (option D) was a later development.\n\nWait, no, research institutes might have been established early on, like PRIO in 1959.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is the correct answer because mathematicians and natural scientists might not have been involved in the initial development, which was more focused on social sciences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they were involved from the beginning.\n\nI need to think about the founders of peace studies. Scholars like Johan Galtung, who is considered the father of peace research, come from a social science background, but he might have collaborated with natural scientists.\n\nBut overall, I think the initial development was more rooted in social sciences, with other disciplines joining later.\n\nTherefore, option A might be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all these statements can be applied to the initial development, in which case none of them fits the question.\n\nBut the question is asking for which statement cannot be applied to the initial development.\n\nGiven that, and based on my reasoning, I would go with option A, as the involvement of mathematicians and natural scientists might have been less prominent in the earliest stages of peace studies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
