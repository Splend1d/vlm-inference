                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I told a hurtful joke at a funeral.\"\n\nFunerals are typically somber and respectful events where people come together to mourn and remember the deceased. Telling a hurtful joke in such a setting would likely be considered inappropriate and disrespectful. It could cause emotional pain to the grieving family and friends, and it shows a lack of empathy and consideration for their feelings. In general, causing harm or insensitivity during a time of grief is viewed as morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I wrung the wet salamander.\"\n\nThis scenario is a bit more ambiguous. \"Wrung\" usually means to squeeze or twist something to remove moisture, like wringing out a wet towel. A salamander is a type of amphibian. So, \"wrung the wet salamander\" could mean squeezing or twisting a wet salamander, which sounds harmful.\n\nFrom an animal welfare perspective, intentionally harming an animal is generally considered morally wrong, especially if it's unnecessary and causes unnecessary suffering. Salamanders are living creatures and should be treated with care and respect. Wringing a wet salamander could cause it pain or injury, which would be unethical.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to determine the intent behind this action. Maybe the salamander was in danger, and wringing it was part of an attempt to help it? But based on the wording, it seems like the action was deliberate and potentially harmful.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, both involve actions that can be considered morally wrong for different reasons. Scenario 1 is clearly inappropriate due to the context and the potential to cause emotional harm. Scenario 2 involves potential physical harm to an animal, which is also generally considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions can be seen as morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
