                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these powers can't support federal law on its own. The options are taxing power, spending power, necessary and proper power, and commerce power. I need to think about each one and see which one isn't sufficient by itself to support a federal law.\n\nFirst, let's consider the taxing power. The federal government has the power to tax, and this power is pretty broad. It's been used to support all kinds of laws, from income taxes to excise taxes. So, it seems like taxing power can definitely support federal laws on its own.\n\nNext, the spending power. The federal government can spend money for various purposes, and this power has been used to fund all sorts of programs and projects. For example, infrastructure, education, social services, and more. So, spending power also seems like it can support federal laws independently.\n\nNow, the necessary and proper power. This is sometimes called the elastic clause because it allows Congress to stretch its powers beyond those explicitly listed in the Constitution. It says that Congress can make all laws necessary and proper for carrying out its enumerated powers. This has been interpreted quite broadly, allowing Congress to pass laws that are reasonably related to its other powers. So, necessary and proper power seems like it can also support federal laws on its own.\n\nFinally, the commerce power. This is the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states, with foreign nations, and with Indian tribes. Over time, this power has been interpreted very broadly, covering almost any activity that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. This has been the basis for a lot of federal regulations and laws.\n\nGiven all that, it seems like all these powers can support federal laws on their own. But the question is asking which one cannot. Maybe it's a trick question, or perhaps there's a specific context I'm missing.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's about which power, when used alone, isn't sufficient to support a federal law. For example, maybe one of these powers needs to be combined with another to constitute the basis for a law.\n\nLet me think about that. Taxing power is pretty independent; you can tax for various reasons. Spending power is also pretty independent; you can spend money for public welfare or other purposes.\n\nNecessary and proper power, however, might require that there's an underlying enumerated power that it's serving. In other words, it's used to carry out other powers, not as a standalone basis for legislation.\n\nWait, is that right? Can Congress pass a law solely under the necessary and proper clause, or does it need to be in service of another enumerated power?\n\nI think it needs to be in service of another enumerated power. The necessary and proper clause is meant to allow Congress to pass laws that help it carry out its enumerated powers, not to create new powers out of thin air.\n\nSo, perhaps the necessary and proper power cannot support a federal law standing alone. It needs to be tied to another enumerated power.\n\nLet me check some case law to see if that's accurate.\n\nIn McCulloch v. Maryland, the Supreme Court established that Congress has implied powers through the necessary and proper clause to carry out its enumerated powers. The Court held that Congress could create a national bank, even though the Constitution doesn't explicitly grant that power, because it was necessary and proper for carrying out its fiscal and monetary powers.\n\nSimilarly, in Wickard v. Filburn, the Court upheld federal regulation of wheat production, even if it was for personal consumption, because it could cumulatively affect interstate commerce.\n\nIn both cases, the necessary and proper clause was used to support laws that were related to other enumerated powers.\n\nI can't think of a case where the necessary and proper clause was used alone, without reference to another enumerated power, to justify a federal law.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the necessary and proper power cannot, standing alone, support a federal law. It needs to be in conjunction with another enumerated power.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. necessary and proper power.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nTaxing power: Definitely can support federal laws on its own. For example, the federal income tax is based solely on the taxing power.\n\nSpending power: Also can support federal laws on its own. For example, funding for public works or social programs is based on the spending power.\n\nCommerce power: This has been used extensively on its own to justify federal laws regulating interstate commerce.\n\nTherefore, among these options, only the necessary and proper power cannot support a federal law standing alone.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
