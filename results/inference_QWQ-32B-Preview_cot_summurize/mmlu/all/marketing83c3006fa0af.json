This includes point-of-purchase displays and packaging, which are designed to be eye-catching and informative, providing consumers with the final push to buy a product while they are already in the store.\n\nBroadcast media (option A) typically refers to television, radio, and other forms of mass communication that reach a wide audience but may not necessarily be in the retail environment where purchasing decisions are made.\n\nInteractive media (option B) involves platforms that allow users to engage and interact with the content, such as websites, social media, and mobile apps. While it can influence purchasing decisions, its primary objective isn't solely to stimulate purchases at the point of sale.\n\nSupport media (option D) is a broad term that could include various forms of media used to support marketing efforts, but it doesn't specifically target shoppers in the store environment like in-store media does.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C. In-store media."
