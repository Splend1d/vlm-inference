                    "text": "So I've got this question here about fiscal and monetary policies. It's asking which option represents a combination of contractionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what contractionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy mean.\n\nContractionary fiscal policy is when the government tries to reduce inflation by decreasing the money supply. This is usually done by increasing taxes or decreasing government spending. The idea is to cool down the economy by reducing the amount of money people have to spend.\n\nExpansionary monetary policy, on the other hand, is when the central bank tries to stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply. This is typically done by lowering interest rates, buying government securities, or decreasing the reserve ratio. The goal is to make money more available and encourage borrowing and spending.\n\nSo, I need to find the option that combines higher taxes or lower government spending (contractionary fiscal policy) with actions that increase the money supply (expansionary monetary policy).\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Higher taxes and selling Treasury securities.\n\nHigher taxes are contractionary fiscal policy, which is what we want. Selling Treasury securities is a monetary policy action, but selling securities reduces the money supply, which is contractionary monetary policy. So this is contractionary fiscal and contractionary monetary policy. Not what we're looking for.\n\nB. Lower taxes and buying Treasury securities.\n\nLower taxes are expansionary fiscal policy, which isn't what we want. Buying Treasury securities is expansionary monetary policy, but since the fiscal policy here is expansionary, this doesn't match the question's request for contractionary fiscal policy.\n\nC. Lower government spending and increasing the reserve ratio.\n\nLower government spending is contractionary fiscal policy, which is good. Increasing the reserve ratio is a monetary policy action that reduces the money supply, which is contractionary monetary policy. Again, this is contractionary in both areas, not what the question is asking for.\n\nD. Higher taxes and buying Treasury securities.\n\nHigher taxes are contractionary fiscal policy, which is correct. Buying Treasury securities is expansionary monetary policy, which is also what we're looking for.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the right combination: contractionary fiscal policy (higher taxes) and expansionary monetary policy (buying Treasury securities).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is buying Treasury securities really expansionary monetary policy? Yes, when the central bank buys Treasury securities, it injects money into the economy, increasing the money supply, which is expansionary.\n\nAnd higher taxes are indeed contractionary fiscal policy.\n\nThe other options don't match the required combination. Option A has both policies contractionary, option B has both expansionary, and option C has contractionary fiscal and contractionary monetary.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
