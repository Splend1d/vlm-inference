It involves adjusting government spending and taxation to manage economic conditions, such as recessions and inflations. During a recession, when the economy is slowing down and unemployment is rising, fiscal policy might involve increasing government spending or cutting taxes to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. Conversely, during periods of high inflation, when prices are rising too quickly, fiscal policy might involve reducing government spending or increasing taxes to cool down the economy and stabilize prices.\n\nOption A is partially correct in that increasing taxes can be a part of fiscal policy, but it's not specifically for fighting recessions; in fact, increasing taxes might exacerbate a recession by reducing disposable income and consumer spending. Option B is also partially correct but misdirected; decreasing taxes is typically used to fight recessions, not inflations. Option D, federal deficits, are a result of fiscal policy choices but are not themselves fiscal policy. So, the most accurate answer is C, as it encompasses both aspects of fiscal policy: adjusting spending and taxes to address economic fluctuations."
