                    "text": "This question is about contract law, specifically regarding assignments and risk of loss in sales contracts. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the key elements of the contract:\n\n1. **Sale of Widgets**: Seller agrees to sell 1,000 widgets at $10 each, FOB at the seller's place of business. FOB stands for \"Free On Board,\" which typically means that the seller is responsible for the goods until they are loaded onto the carrier at the named place of business. After that, the buyer assumes the risk of loss.\n\n2. **Assignment Clause**: The contract states that any assignment must have the written consent of the other party.\n\nNow, let's look at the sequence of events:\n\n- **March 1**: Seller places the widgets on board a cargo vessel destined for the buyer.\n\n- **March 2**: Buyer receives a telegram from the seller stating that the widgets are in transit and that the seller is assigning all rights under the contract to their creditor.\n\n- **March 3**: The ship sinks, destroying the entire cargo.\n\nThe question is, if the creditor sues the buyer, what is the most likely recovery?\n\nLet's analyze this:\n\n1. **Assignment Without Consent**:\n\n   - The contract requires that any assignment must have the written consent of the other party.\n\n   - The seller assigned the rights to the creditor without the buyer's consent.\n\n   - Therefore, the assignment is likely invalid because it violates the contract's terms.\n\n2. **Risk of Loss**:\n\n   - FOB at the seller's place of business means that the risk of loss passes to the buyer once the goods are loaded onto the carrier.\n\n   - In this case, the widgets were loaded onto the vessel on March 1, so the risk of loss likely passed to the buyer at that point.\n\n   - However, the buyer never received the widgets because they were destroyed in transit.\n\n3. **Creditor's Claim**:\n\n   - The creditor is claiming under the assignment, but since the assignment is invalid (due to lack of consent), the creditor may not have valid rights to sue the buyer.\n\n   - Alternatively, if the assignment is considered invalid, the creditor might not have any rights under the contract.\n\nGiven these points, let's look at the options:\n\nA. **Nothing, because the buyer never assented to the assignment.**\n\n   - This seems plausible because the assignment requires consent, which was not given.\n\nB. **Nothing, because the buyer never received the widgets.**\n\n   - While it's true that the buyer didn't receive the widgets, this might not be the primary reason for denying recovery. The primary issue is the invalid assignment.\n\nC. **The contract price of $10,000.**\n\n   - This would be the amount the buyer owes under the contract, but considering the assignment issues and the fact that the buyer didn't receive the goods, this seems unlikely.\n\nD. **The difference between the contract price and the market value of the widgets.**\n\n   - This could be relevant in some contexts, but given the specific issues here, it might not be the most likely outcome.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the most likely answer is A: nothing, because the buyer never assented to the assignment.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other angles:\n\n- **FOB Terms and Risk of Loss**: Since the risk of loss passed to the buyer when the goods were loaded onto the vessel, the buyer might still be liable for the goods even though they were destroyed in transit.\n\n- **Breached Contract**: The seller failed to deliver the goods because they were destroyed, but the assignment complicates things.\n\n- **Assignment Validity**: Without the buyer's consent, the assignment is invalid, meaning the creditor has no rights under the contract.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that the creditor cannot enforce the contract against the buyer because the assignment was invalid. Therefore, the creditor would likely recover nothing.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Nothing, because the buyer never assented to the assignment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
