The options are:\n\nScenario 1: To make money, I write \"jewelry\" on boxes full of trash and sell them to people.\n\nScenario 2: I played basketball instead of doing nothing.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Writing \"jewelry\" on boxes full of trash and selling them to people to make money.\n\nHmm, this sounds like fraud or deception. I'm selling something that's not what I'm claiming it to be. If I tell people there's jewelry in the boxes, but really there's just trash, that's misleading them. They're paying for something valuable and getting worthless items instead.\n\nIn the US, as of 2020, honesty in transactions is generally expected. Deceiving someone to make a profit is considered morally wrong. So, I think Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Playing basketball instead of doing nothing.\n\nThis seems pretty innocuous. Choosing to play basketball over doing nothing is a personal choice in how to spend time. There's nothing inherently wrong with playing sports or choosing an activity over inactivity.\n\nUnless there was some context where the person had responsibilities they were neglecting by playing basketball, but based on what's provided, it just sounds like a harmless choice.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, playing basketball instead of doing nothing isn't morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong.\n\nLooking back at the choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems that option B fits: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, is there any way Scenario 2 could be considered morally wrong?\n\nWell, maybe if someone had other obligations or if playing basketball was harmful to themselves or others, but with the information given, it doesn't seem wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 1 is clearly deceptive and unfair to the buyers, so it's wrong.\n\nSo, my answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
