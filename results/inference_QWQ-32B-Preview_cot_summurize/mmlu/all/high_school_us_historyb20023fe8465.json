The Quakers were a religious group that faced persecution in England during the 17th century due to their beliefs and practices, which differed from the established Church of England.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Roman Catholics: While Roman Catholics did face persecution in England, William Penn was not a Roman Catholic. He was a Quaker.\n\nB. Puritans: The Puritans were a group within the Church of England who sought to purify the church from what they considered to be Catholic practices. They were also persecuted, leading some to flee to the New World, but William Penn was not a Puritan.\n\nD. Anglicans: The Anglicans were members of the Church of England, which was the established church. Since it was the state church, its members were not typically persecuted for their religious beliefs.\n\nGiven that William Penn was a Quaker, the correct answer is C. Quakers.\n\nTo provide more context, William Penn founded the colony of Pennsylvania as a haven for religious freedom, particularly for Quakers and other groups facing persecution in Europe. The Charter of Privileges you mentioned was an important document that guaranteed freedom of religion and other civil liberties in the colony.\n\nSo, to summarize, William Penn was a Quaker, and he established Pennsylvania to provide a place where people could practice their religion freely without fear of persecution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
