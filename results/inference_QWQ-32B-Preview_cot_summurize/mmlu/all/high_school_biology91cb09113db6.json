                    "text": "Let's dive into this osmosis problem. So, we've got a dialysis bag with a 0.5 M solution inside, and it's placed in a beaker of distilled water. We need to predict what will happen.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what osmosis is. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area of higher water concentration to an area of lower water concentration through a semi-permeable membrane, like the dialysis bag. The goal is to equalize the concentrations on both sides.\n\nNow, the dialysis bag contains a 0.5 M solution. That means it has 0.5 moles of solute per liter of solution inside the bag. The beaker has distilled water, which is pure water with no solutes, so its concentration is 0 M.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\n- Inside the bag: 0.5 M solution\n\n- Outside the bag (beaker): 0 M (pure water)\n\nIn terms of water concentration:\n\n- Inside the bag: Since there's more solute, the water concentration is lower.\n\n- Outside the bag: Pure water, so water concentration is higher.\n\nTherefore, water will move from where it's more concentrated (outside the bag) to where it's less concentrated (inside the bag) through the dialysis membrane.\n\nThis means water will flow into the bag, causing it to swell or increase in size.\n\nWait, but let's double-check the options:\n\nA. There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.\n\nB. There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\n\nC. The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.\n\nD. The solute will flow out of the dialysis bag into the beaker.\n\nOption B seems to match our reasoning: water flows into the bag, causing it to swell.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A suggests water flows out of the bag, which would happen if the bag had a lower concentration than the beaker. But in this case, the bag has 0.5 M and the beaker has 0 M, so water should flow into the bag.\n\nOption C says no water moves at all, but that can't be right because there is a concentration difference.\n\nOption D mentions solute flowing out of the bag. Dialysis bags are semi-permeable, allowing water and small molecules to pass through but blocking larger solute molecules. So, if the solute is large, it shouldn't pass through the membrane.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: there will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\n\nTo further solidify this, let's recall that in osmosis, water moves to equalize the solute concentrations. So, water moves into the bag to dilute the 0.5 M solution towards 0 M, but since the beaker is much larger, the overall effect is that the bag swells.\n\nAlso, it's interesting to compare this to the initial scenario where the bag was in a 0.6 M solution. In that case, the beaker has a higher solute concentration than the bag (0.6 M vs. 0.5 M), so water would have moved out of the bag into the beaker, causing the bag to shrink. But in this new scenario with distilled water, it's the opposite.\n\nSo, my final answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
