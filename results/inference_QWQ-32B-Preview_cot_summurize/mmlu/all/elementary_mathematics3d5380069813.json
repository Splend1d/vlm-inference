The options are A. 6.5 gallons, B. 6 gallons, C. 5.5 gallons, and D. 5 gallons.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"24 miles per gallon\" means. It means that for every gallon of gasoline, the car can travel 24 miles. So, if I have one gallon, I can go 24 miles. If I have two gallons, I can go 48 miles, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many gallons are needed to travel 144 miles. I think I can set up a proportion for this. Like, if 1 gallon corresponds to 24 miles, then x gallons would correspond to 144 miles.\n\nSo, I can write it as:\n\n1 gallon / 24 miles = x gallons / 144 miles\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. To do that, I can cross-multiply:\n\n1 gallon * 144 miles = x gallons * 24 miles\n\nThat gives me:\n\n144 = 24x\n\nNow, I divide both sides by 24 to solve for x:\n\nx = 144 / 24\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, the car would need 6 gallons of gasoline to travel 144 miles.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 6 gallons is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of division. Since the car travels 24 miles per gallon, to find out how many gallons are needed for 144 miles, I can divide 144 miles by 24 miles per gallon:\n\n144 miles \u00f7 24 miles/gallon = 6 gallons\n\nThat gives me the same answer.\n\nI can also check if this makes sense. If the car goes 24 miles on one gallon, then in 6 gallons, it should go 24 * 6 = 144 miles. That matches what I need.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 6 gallons, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
