It says, \"Buffer-overflow may remain as a bug in apps if __________ are not done fully.\" And the options are: A. boundary hacks, B. memory checks, C. boundary checks, D. buffer checks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a buffer overflow is. From what I know, a buffer overflow occurs when more data is written into a buffer than it can hold, causing the extra data to overflow into adjacent memory spaces. This can lead to crashes, data corruption, or even allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\nSo, to prevent buffer overflows, developers need to ensure that they handle memory correctly and don't allow data to exceed the allocated space for buffers.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. boundary hacks - I'm not sure what \"boundary hacks\" means. It sounds like something related to manipulating boundaries, but I don't think this is a standard term in the context of preventing buffer overflows.\n\nB. memory checks - This seems relevant. Checking memory usage and ensuring that writes to memory don't exceed allocated spaces is crucial for preventing buffer overflows.\n\nC. boundary checks - This also sounds important. Boundary checks would involve verifying that data doesn't exceed the intended limits or boundaries of a buffer.\n\nD. buffer checks - This is quite general, but it could refer to checks performed on buffers to ensure they are used correctly.\n\nBetween these options, both memory checks and boundary checks seem directly related to preventing buffer overflows.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for what may not be done fully if buffer overflows remain as bugs in apps.\n\nLooking closely, options B and C both seem plausible.\n\nBut in programming, especially in languages like C, where buffer overflows are more common, boundary checks are a specific type of check that is crucial for preventing buffer overflows.\n\nMemory checks are broader and could include various aspects of memory management, not just buffer boundaries.\n\nSo, perhaps boundary checks are more directly related to preventing buffer overflows.\n\nOption A, \"boundary hacks,\" doesn't sound right because \"hacks\" implies modifications or workarounds, which aren't a standard practice for preventing buffer overflows.\n\nOption D, \"buffer checks,\" is somewhat vague, but it might encompass boundary checks.\n\nGiven that, I think the most precise answer is C. boundary checks.\n\nIf boundary checks are not performed fully or correctly, buffer overflows can occur.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. boundary checks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
