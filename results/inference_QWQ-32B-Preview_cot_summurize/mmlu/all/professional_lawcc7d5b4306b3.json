                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a deed where a homeowner conveys his property to his daughter for life, then to his aunt for life, but with some conditions involving the aunt moving to another state. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the deed says the property goes to the daughter for life, and then to the aunt for life. But there are conditions: if the aunt moves to another state, the property goes to the sister for the life of the aunt, and then to the heirs of the aunt if she doesn't move, or to the heirs of the sister if she does move.\n\nOkay, so let's identify the interests here.\n\n1. Daughter: life estate. That's clear. She owns the property for her lifetime.\n\n2. Aunt: seems like a life estate following the daughter's death, but with a condition attached\u2014moving to another state.\n\n3. Sister: her interest is contingent on the aunt moving to another state.\n\n4. Heirs of aunt and heirs of sister: their interests depend on whether the aunt moves or not.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime. So, the daughter is still alive, and we need to describe the aunt's interest at this point.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic estate terminology:\n\n- Life estate: an interest in property that lasts only for the life of the holder or another specified person.\n\n- Remainder: an interest that is to take effect after the termination of a prior estate.\n\n- Vested remainder: a remainder interest that is certain to become possessory because the interest is both certain in interest (i.e., the identity of the holder is known) and certain in degree (i.e., the interest is not subject to being divested or diminished).\n\n- Contingent remainder: a remainder interest that is subject to a condition precedent; it is certain in interest but uncertain in degree because it may be divested or diminished.\n\n- Executory interest: a future interest that cuts short or terminates an existing estate or future interest.\n\n- Shifting executory interest: an executory interest that transfers the interest to a third party.\n\n- Springing executory interest: an executory interest that creates a new interest in a third party.\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, the daughter has a life estate. After her death, the property is to go to the aunt for life, but with the condition that if the aunt moves to another state, the property goes to the sister for the life of the aunt.\n\nSo, the aunt's interest is a life estate following the daughter's death, but it's subject to the condition that the aunt doesn't move to another state.\n\nNow, during the daughter's lifetime, what is the nature of the aunt's interest?\n\nLet's think about it.\n\nThe aunt has a conditional future interest. She is set to receive a life estate after the daughter's death, but this is subject to the condition that she doesn't move to another state.\n\nIf she moves to another state, her interest is defeated, and instead, the sister gets a life estate.\n\nSo, the aunt's interest is conditional\u2014it's contingent upon not moving to another state.\n\nIn terms of estate classification, this sounds like a contingent remainder because it's subject to a condition precedent.\n\nOption A is \"contingent remainder,\" which seems plausible.\n\nOption B is \"shifting executory interest.\" A shifting executory interest transfers the interest to a third party instead of allowing it to go to the original grantee.\n\nIn this case, if the aunt moves, the interest shifts from the aunt to the sister.\n\nSo, the interest in favor of the sister is a shifting executory interest because it shifts the interest from the aunt to the sister upon the occurrence of the condition (moving to another state).\n\nBut the question is about the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime, not the sister's interest.\n\nSo, the aunt's interest is contingent upon not moving, and if she does move, her interest is defeated, and the sister gets it.\n\nTherefore, the aunt's interest is contingent and subject to being divested upon moving to another state.\n\nOption C is \"vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.\" A vested remainder is certain to become possessory, but in this case, the aunt's interest is not certain because it's subject to the condition of not moving to another state.\n\nIf she moves, her interest is completely divested in favor of the sister.\n\nSo, it's subject to complete divestiture.\n\nOption D is \"vested remainder subject to partial divestiture.\" This would be if the aunt's interest could be diminished but not completely taken away.\n\nBut in this case, if the aunt moves, her interest is completely taken away and given to the sister.\n\nSo, it's subject to complete divestiture, not partial.\n\nBetween options C and A, both seem possible.\n\nOption A is contingent remainder, and option C is vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nA contingent remainder is uncertain because it's subject to a condition precedent.\n\nA vested remainder subject to complete divestiture is certain to become possessory but can be completely taken away upon the occurrence of a certain event.\n\nIn this case, the aunt's interest is certain\u2014she is designated to receive the life estate after the daughter's death, but it's subject to being completely divested if she moves to another state.\n\nSo, it sounds more like a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.\n\nTherefore, option C is the best answer.\n\nBut let's consider option B, \"shifting executory interest.\"\n\nAs I thought earlier, the sister's interest is a shifting executory interest because it shifts the interest from the aunt to the sister upon the aunt moving to another state.\n\nBut the question is about the aunt's interest, not the sister's.\n\nSo, option B is not directly applicable here.\n\nOption A, contingent remainder, could be considered, but typically a contingent remainder is uncertain in interest or degree.\n\nIn this case, the aunt's interest is certain in interest (she is designated), but uncertain in degree because it can be completely divested.\n\nTherefore, it's more accurately described as a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
