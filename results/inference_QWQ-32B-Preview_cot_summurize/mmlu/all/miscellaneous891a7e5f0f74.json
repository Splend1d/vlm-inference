I think it might be Pittsburgh, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see what I can find.\n\nI recall that Pittsburgh has a rich history in broadcasting. There was a station there called KDKA, which is often cited as the first commercial radio station. Let me check some facts to confirm.\n\nAccording to my knowledge, KDKA in Pittsburgh began regular broadcasts in 1920, and it's widely recognized as the first commercial radio station in the United States. It's possible that there were experimental stations before that, but KDKA was the first to receive a commercial license.\n\nLet me consider the other options. Chicago is a major media hub, but I don't think it was the site of the first commercial radio station. Austin is known for its music scene, but I don't recall it being the birthplace of commercial radio. Cleveland also has a strong radio presence, but again, I believe Pittsburgh predates it.\n\nTo be thorough, I should verify this information. Maybe I can look it up online or check a reliable source.\n\nAssuming I don't have access to the internet right now, I'll rely on my memory and the facts I know. KDKA in Pittsburgh seems to be the correct answer.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Pittsburgh.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
