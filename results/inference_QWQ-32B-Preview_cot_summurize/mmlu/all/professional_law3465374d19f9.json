                    "text": "So here's this scenario: a pedestrian gets hit by a car, the driver flees the scene, and the pedestrian is in a lot of pain. He's been taking strong painkillers, which seem to be affecting his memory of the accident. Now, at trial, the pedestrian wants to call a hypnotist who worked with him to recall details of the accident. After hypnosis, the pedestrian provided a detailed account, including that the driver ran a red light and gave the license plate number, which matches the defendant's.\n\nThe question is about the admissibility of the hypnotist's testimony. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Admissible, because the license plate identification substantiates that the other information is accurate and trustworthy.\n\nB. Admissible, because it's a statement of past recollection refreshed.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because it's hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because statements procured through hypnosis cannot be authenticated as truthful.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what hearsay is. Hearsay is generally defined as an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, if the hypnotist is testifying about what the pedestrian said under hypnosis to prove that those events happened, that sounds like hearsay.\n\nBut wait, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. One of them is past recollection recorded. That's where a witness's memory is refreshed by something they previously recorded or stated. But in this case, the pedestrian's memory was refreshed through hypnosis, which is a bit different.\n\nOption B says it's admissible because it's a statement of past recollection refreshed. But I'm not sure if hypnosis qualifies as a method to refresh memory for the purposes of this exception.\n\nOption A suggests that because the license plate number matches, it substantiates the accuracy of the other information. But just because one piece of information is correct doesn't necessarily mean the rest is accurate. People can make mistakes or have distorted memories, even under hypnosis.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible because statements procured through hypnosis can't be authenticated as truthful. This seems plausible because hypnosis can sometimes lead to false memories or confabulations. The reliability of hypnosis for memory retrieval is debated in legal and psychological circles.\n\nOption C is a general hearsay objection. If the testimony is hearsay and doesn't fit into any exception, it should be inadmissible.\n\nGiven that the pedestrian is the one who recalled the information under hypnosis, and he's a party to the case, maybe there's an exception for statements by a party opponent. But in this case, he's the plaintiff, and he's trying to introduce his own statement through the hypnotist.\n\nWait, statements by a party are admissible against the opposing party, but here, the pedestrian is trying to introduce his own statement to support his case.\n\nI think the main issue is the reliability of the hypnosis-induced recall. If the memory was refreshed through hypnosis, and hypnosis is considered unreliable or suggestive, then the court might exclude it.\n\nAlso, the pedestrian was taking strong painkillers, which might affect his memory. This could be seen as another factor undermining the reliability of his recollections, even under hypnosis.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, hypnosis-induced statements are treated with caution and are often excluded from evidence because of concerns about their reliability.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the most likely outcome is that the hypnotist's testimony would be held inadmissible because it's hearsay not within any recognized exception, which is option C.\n\nOption D also seems plausible, but it's more specific to the method used, whereas option C is a broader objection.\n\nHowever, since the question is about what the testimony will \"most likely\" be held to be, and considering that hearsay objections are common in court, I think option C is the safer choice.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe the court would allow it under an exception for statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment, but that doesn't seem to fit here because hypnosis for memory retrieval isn't typically considered a medical treatment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps under the exception for present sense impression or excited utterance, but again, hypnosis doesn't fit into those categories.\n\nSo, overall, I believe the hypnotist's testimony would be considered inadmissible hearsay without a recognized exception, making option C the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{c} } \\]"
