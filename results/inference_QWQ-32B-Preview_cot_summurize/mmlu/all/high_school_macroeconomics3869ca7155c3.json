                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the reserve ratio and how much money can be created from a new deposit. Let's see: the reserve ratio is 10 percent, and a new customer deposits $500. I need to find out the maximum amount of money that can be created from this deposit. The options are A. $500, B. $4,500, C. $5,000, and D. $50.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a reserve ratio is. I think it's the percentage of deposits that banks are required to hold in reserve and not lend out. So, if the reserve ratio is 10 percent, that means banks have to keep 10 percent of any deposits as reserves.\n\nNow, if a new customer deposits $500, the bank has to keep 10 percent of that as reserves. Let me calculate that: 10 percent of $500 is $50. So, the bank keeps $50 in reserves and can lend out the remaining $450.\n\nBut the question is about the maximum amount of money created. I think this involves the money multiplier effect, where the initial deposit leads to more deposits as the lent-out money is spent and deposited elsewhere in the banking system.\n\nThe money multiplier formula is usually 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So, if the reserve ratio is 10 percent, or 0.10, then the money multiplier would be 1 / 0.10 = 10.\n\nSo, if the initial deposit is $500 and the money multiplier is 10, then the maximum amount of money that can be created is $500 multiplied by 10, which is $5,000.\n\nWait a minute, but when I think about it step by step, let's see:\n\n1. Initial deposit: $500.\n\n2. Bank keeps $50 in reserves and lends out $450.\n\n3. The $450 is spent and deposited in another bank, which then keeps 10 percent of that, which is $45, and lends out $405.\n\n4. This process continues, with each new deposit leading to more lending and more deposits.\n\nSo, the total money created would be the initial deposit plus all the subsequent deposits, which theoretically can go on forever, but in practice, it approaches a certain limit.\n\nThe formula for the total money created is the initial deposit divided by the reserve ratio. So, $500 / 0.10 = $5,000.\n\nBut let me check if that makes sense. If the reserve ratio is 10 percent, that means for every dollar deposited, the bank keeps $0.10 in reserves and lends out $0.90.\n\nThe money multiplier is 1 / reserve ratio, which is 1 / 0.10 = 10.\n\nSo, $500 times 10 equals $5,000.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. $5,000 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A is $500, which is just the initial deposit. That can't be right because the question is about the maximum amount of money created, which includes more than just the initial deposit.\n\nOption B is $4,500, which might be a miscalculation. Maybe someone subtracted the reserves from the total or something like that.\n\nOption D is $50, which is the amount of reserves from the initial deposit. Again, that's not the total money created.\n\nSo, based on the money multiplier formula, the correct answer should be C. $5,000.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's think about fractional reserve banking and how it works.\n\nWhen a bank receives a deposit, it keeps a certain fraction as reserves (in this case, 10 percent) and lends out the rest (90 percent). The borrowers then spend that money, and it gets deposited into other banks, which again keep 10 percent in reserves and lend out 90 percent, and so on.\n\nThis process continues, creating more money in the banking system.\n\nThe total amount of money created is the initial deposit multiplied by the money multiplier, which is 1 / reserve ratio.\n\nSo, 1 / 0.10 = 10, and $500 * 10 = $5,000.\n\nAlternatively, you can think of it as a geometric series:\n\nTotal money = initial deposit + (initial deposit * loan ratio) + (initial deposit * loan ratio^2) + ...\n\nWhere the loan ratio is 1 - reserve ratio, which is 0.90.\n\nSo, total money = $500 + $500*(0.90) + $500*(0.90)^2 + ... to infinity.\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term a = $500 and common ratio r = 0.90.\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is a / (1 - r), which is $500 / (1 - 0.90) = $500 / 0.10 = $5,000.\n\nSo, again, we get $5,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $5,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
