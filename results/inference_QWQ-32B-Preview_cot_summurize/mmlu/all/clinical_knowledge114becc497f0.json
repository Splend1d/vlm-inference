Preload, contractility, and afterload.\n\nC. Contractility, blood volume, and blood pressure.\n\nD. Cardiac output, contractility, and blood volume.\n\nI need to pick the one that correctly identifies the three factors that regulate stroke volume.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what stroke volume is. Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the heart per beat. So, it's the volume of blood ejected by the left ventricle in one contraction.\n\nNow, what factors affect this stroke volume? I think preload, afterload, and contractility are key terms here.\n\nPreload is the amount of blood that fills the ventricle before it contracts. So, the more blood that fills the ventricle, the higher the preload, and potentially, the higher the stroke volume, up to a point.\n\nAfterload is the resistance that the heart has to pump against, like the blood pressure in the aorta. If the afterload is high, it's harder for the heart to eject blood, so stroke volume might decrease.\n\nContractility is how strongly the heart muscle contracts. If contractility increases, the heart can eject more blood with each beat, increasing stroke volume.\n\nSo, preload, afterload, and contractility seem like they directly affect stroke volume.\n\nLet me look at option B: Preload, contractility, and afterload. That matches what I just thought.\n\nOption A has blood volume instead of contractility. Blood volume affects preload, but contractility is a separate factor related to the heart's contractile force, not just the volume of blood.\n\nOption C has contractility, blood volume, and blood pressure. Blood pressure relates to afterload, but blood volume might be more related to preload. However, blood volume isn't directly a regulator of stroke volume in the same way preload, afterload, and contractility are.\n\nOption D has cardiac output, contractility, and blood volume. Cardiac output is actually stroke volume multiplied by heart rate, so it's a result of stroke volume, not a regulator of it.\n\nSo, option B seems the most accurate.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any role of blood volume directly in regulating stroke volume, or is it more about preload?\n\nBlood volume affects how much blood is returning to the heart, which in turn affects preload. So, blood volume influences preload, but preload is more directly related to the stretching of the heart muscle before contraction.\n\nContractility is about the heart's ability to contract, independent of preload.\n\nAfterload is about the resistance the heart has to overcome during contraction.\n\nSo, preload, afterload, and contractility are the primary determinants of stroke volume.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. Preload, contractility, and afterload.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
