It's about Mr. Costanza sitting on some pasta, I think it was called \"fusilli Jerry.\" So, he must have had some issues because of that. Now, I need to recall what type of doctor he went to see.\n\nFirst, an ophthalmologist is an eye doctor. Does sitting on pasta affect your eyes? Probably not directly. So, maybe not A.\n\nNext, a cardiologist is a heart doctor. Would sitting on pasta cause heart problems? Maybe indirectly if it led to stress or something, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nThen, there's a neurologist, who specializes in the nervous system. Could sitting on pasta affect your nerves? Possibly, if there was pressure or injury, but I'm not sure.\n\nFinally, there's a proctologist, which is a doctor who specializes in the rectum and anus. Hmm, sitting on something sharp or uncomfortable might affect that area.\n\nWait, in the episode, Mr. Costanza sits on a piece of pasta named \"fusilli Jerry,\" which is probably a type of spiral-shaped pasta. So, if he sat on it accidentally, it could have pierced him or caused some discomfort in that area.\n\nGiven that, it makes sense that he would see a proctologist to check if there was any damage or injury from sitting on the pasta.\n\nLet me think about it some more. In the episode, I recall that Mr. Costanza is in pain and needs to see a specialist. He's probably embarrassed about the situation, which fits with seeing a proctologist, as that's not a topic people usually discuss openly.\n\nAlso, the other options don't seem to relate directly to the scenario. Eyes, heart, and nerves aren't likely to be affected by sitting on pasta.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is D, proctologist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
