                    "text": "So I have this probability problem here. I need to find the probability that a randomly selected integer from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 100} is divisible by 2 but not divisible by 3. And I have to express the answer as a common fraction. There are some options provided, but I'll try to solve it step by step without looking at them initially.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes. Since the set contains integers from 1 to 100, there are 100 possible integers to choose from. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 100.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of integers in this set that are divisible by 2 but not divisible by 3. Let's break this down.\n\nStep 1: Find the number of integers divisible by 2.\n\nAn integer is divisible by 2 if it's even. The even numbers between 1 and 100 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a_1 = 2, the common difference d = 2, and the last term a_n = 100.\n\nThe number of terms in this sequence can be found using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n100 = 2 + (n - 1)*2\n\n100 - 2 = (n - 1)*2\n\n98 = (n - 1)*2\n\nn - 1 = 49\n\nn = 50\n\nSo, there are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.\n\nStep 2: Find the number of integers divisible by both 2 and 3, i.e., divisible by 6.\n\nAn integer is divisible by both 2 and 3 if it's divisible by their least common multiple, which is 6. So, I need to find the number of integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 6.\n\nThe multiples of 6 between 1 and 100 are 6, 12, 18, ..., 96. Again, this is an arithmetic sequence where a_1 = 6, d = 6, and a_n = 96.\n\nUsing the formula for the nth term:\n\n96 = 6 + (n - 1)*6\n\n96 - 6 = (n - 1)*6\n\n90 = (n - 1)*6\n\nn - 1 = 15\n\nn = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nStep 3: Find the number of integers divisible by 2 but not by 3.\n\nThis would be the total number of integers divisible by 2 minus the number of integers divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nSo, it's 50 - 16 = 34.\n\nTherefore, there are 34 integers in the set that are divisible by 2 but not by 3.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the probability.\n\nProbability is given by the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, P = 34 / 100\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 2.\n\nP = 17 / 50\n\nSo, the probability is 17/50.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 31/66\n\nB. 17/66\n\nC. 17/31\n\nD. 17/50\n\nMy answer matches option D.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that in some probability problems involving divisibility, Inclusion-Exclusion might be necessary. Let me double-check my approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of integers divisible by 2 or 3, but since the problem asks for divisible by 2 but not by 3, maybe there's a different way.\n\nLet me consider the total number of integers divisible by 2 is 50, and from those, I subtract the ones divisible by both 2 and 3, which are 16, giving me 34, as before.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of integers divisible by 2 is 50, divisible by 3 is floor(100/3) = 33, and divisible by both 2 and 3 is 16.\n\nBut again, since I need only those divisible by 2 and not by 3, sticking with 50 - 16 = 34 seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 34/100, which simplifies to 17/50.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 17/50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{17}{50}} \\]"
