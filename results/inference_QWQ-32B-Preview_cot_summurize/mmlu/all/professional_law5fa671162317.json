                    "text": "Let's see. I have this scenario here: a buyer and a manufacturer have a written contract for 1,000 gidgets at $4,000. Then, before delivery, they have a phone conversation where they agree to change the quantity to 800 gidgets. The question is, is this modification probably unenforceable, and why?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. it violates the statute of frauds.\n\nB. there was no consideration.\n\nC. the original contract was in writing.\n\nD. the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means and how they apply to this situation.\n\nStarting with the statute of frauds (option A): This is a legal rule that requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. Typically, it applies to contracts that can't be performed within one year, contracts for the sale of land, and contracts for the sale of goods over a certain value, which is $500 under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).\n\nIn this case, the contract is for the sale of 1,000 gidgets at $4,000. If gidgets are goods under the UCC, and $4,000 is above the threshold that requires a writing, then the original contract likely needs to be in writing to be enforceable, which it is. But the modification is oral. So, does the statute of frauds apply to modifications as well?\n\nI think under the UCC, modifications can be enforceable even if they are oral, as long as there is sufficient evidence to prove the modification. So, maybe option A isn't the right answer.\n\nNext, option B: there was no consideration. Consideration is something of value exchanged between parties to a contract. For a modification to be enforceable, generally, there needs to be consideration.\n\nIn this case, the parties are agreeing to change the quantity from 1,000 to 800 gidgets. Assuming the price remains the same at $4,000, then the manufacturer is agreeing to supply fewer goods for the same price, which could be seen as the buyer giving up something (getting fewer goods) and the manufacturer receiving something (getting paid the same for fewer goods). So, there might be consideration here.\n\nHowever, under the UCC, for modifications, consideration might not be required if the modification is made in good faith and the contract allows for such modifications. So, perhaps consideration isn't strictly necessary here.\n\nOption C: the original contract was in writing. I'm not sure why the original contract being in writing would make the modification unenforceable. In fact, having the original contract in writing might help in enforcing the modification, assuming the modification meets the legal requirements.\n\nOption D: the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms. The parol evidence rule generally prevents parties from introducing evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict the written contract.\n\nIn this case, the parties are trying to modify the written contract with an oral agreement. So, is the parol evidence rule relevant here? I think the parol evidence rule is more about preventing oral agreements from contradicting the written contract, but if the parties are genuinely modifying the contract, that's different.\n\nUnder the UCC, modifications can be made orally even if the original contract is in writing, as long as certain conditions are met. So, perhaps the parol evidence rule isn't the issue here.\n\nLet me think again. The question is, is the modification probably unenforceable, and why?\n\nGiven that the original contract is in writing and the modification is oral, and considering that the UCC might allow oral modifications under certain circumstances, maybe the issue is lack of consideration.\n\nWait, but I thought that under the UCC, modifications can be enforceable without new consideration if they are made in good faith. So, perhaps consideration isn't the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's because the modification doesn't satisfy the statute of frauds. But I thought the statute of frauds mainly applies to the original contract, not necessarily to modifications.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the modification is unenforceable because it's an oral modification of a written contract that involves a substantial change, and therefore, under the parol evidence rule, it can't be enforced.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the relevant UCC provisions.\n\nUnder UCC \u00a7 2-209, dealing with modifications, corrections, and assignments:\n\n\"(1) A contract for the sale of goods may be modified by the parties and their rights and obligations with respect thereto determined by agreement even though the original contract is otherwise enforceable and even though the modification is not supported by consideration, but the parties cannot by agreement vary the effect of Article 2 or of any other law applicable to the transaction.\n\n(2) A contract for the sale of goods in any quantity calls for successive performances and authorizes a change in the price or other terms on a basis provided in the contract.\n\n(3) A contract which requires that it or any modification or waiver be in writing is not enforceable against the party who did not sign unless the contract or modification or waiver was signed by him or his authorized agent.\"\n\nSo, according to \u00a7 2-209(1), a contract for the sale of goods can be modified by the parties even without consideration, as long as it's in accordance with the UCC and other applicable laws.\n\nTherefore, it seems that option B, lack of consideration, isn't necessarily a bar to enforceability.\n\nOption A, violating the statute of frauds, might be relevant if the modification itself falls within the statute of frauds requirements, but I think modifications can be oral even if the original contract is in writing.\n\nOption C, the original contract being in writing, doesn't seem to make the modification unenforceable.\n\nOption D, the parol evidence rule, might prevent introducing oral modifications that contradict the written contract, but if the parties are genuinely modifying the contract, that might be allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps the parol evidence rule does bar the oral modification because it contradicts the original written contract.\n\nBut under UCC \u00a7 2-209, modifications can be made orally, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parol evidence rule doesn't apply because the parties are seeking to modify the contract, not to contradict it with prior agreements.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider the specific circumstances.\n\nThe original contract is in writing for the sale of 1,000 gidgets at $4,000. Then, before delivery, they agree over the phone to change the quantity to 800 gidgets, presumably still at $4,000.\n\nSo, the modification is a change in quantity.\n\nUnder the UCC, modifications can be enforceable even if they are oral, especially in merchant transactions.\n\nHowever, if the original contract requires that any modifications be in writing, then an oral modification might not be enforceable.\n\nBut in this scenario, there's no mention of such a requirement in the original contract.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the modification should be enforceable.\n\nBut the question says \"probably unenforceable, because...\"\n\nSo, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this jurisdiction, modifications still require consideration, despite what the UCC says.\n\nBut according to \u00a7 2-209(1), consideration isn't required.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statute of frauds applies to the modification because it's a substantial modification.\n\nBut I think the UCC allows oral modifications even if the original contract is within the statute of frauds.\n\nI'm leaning towards thinking that the modification is probably enforceable, but the question suggests that it's probably unenforceable.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the modification is unenforceable because it's an oral modification of a written contract that involves a substantial change, and therefore, under the parol evidence rule, it can't be enforced.\n\nBut \u00a7 2-209 seems to allow for oral modifications.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parol evidence rule doesn't apply because the parties are seeking to modify the contract, not to introduce prior oral agreements that contradict the written contract.\n\nI'm getting more confused.\n\nLet me consider the answer options again:\n\nA. it violates the statute of frauds.\n\nB. there was no consideration.\n\nC. the original contract was in writing.\n\nD. the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms.\n\nGiven that \u00a7 2-209 allows modifications without consideration, option B isn't correct.\n\nOption C is vague; the original contract being in writing doesn't make the modification unenforceable, especially since the UCC allows oral modifications.\n\nOption D might be plausible if the parol evidence rule prevents enforcing oral modifications that contradict the written contract.\n\nHowever, \u00a7 2-209 seems to permit such modifications.\n\nOption A, violating the statute of frauds, might apply if the modification itself is subject to the statute of frauds.\n\nBut I think modifications can be oral under the UCC.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is D, the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms.\n\nEven though \u00a7 2-209 allows modifications, perhaps in this jurisdiction, the parol evidence rule still prevents enforcing oral modifications that contradict the written contract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parol evidence rule isn't applicable here because the parties are seeking to modify the contract, not to introduce prior oral agreements.\n\nI'm still not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the modification is unenforceable because it's an oral modification of a written contract for the sale of goods above a certain value, which would be subject to the statute of frauds.\n\nBut \u00a7 2-209 seems to allow oral modifications.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe the answer is A, it violates the statute of frauds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B, there was no consideration, but I think \u00a7 2-209 overrides that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option C is correct because the original contract was in writing, and therefore, any modification must also be in writing.\n\nBut again, \u00a7 2-209 allows oral modifications.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this jurisdiction, the UCC hasn't modified the common law rules, and therefore, modifications require consideration and to be in writing if they fall within the statute of frauds.\n\nBut the UCC has been adopted in most states, and \u00a7 2-209 specifically allows modifications without consideration.\n\nI'm going to guess that the answer is D, the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms.\n\nEven though \u00a7 2-209 allows modifications, perhaps the parol evidence rule still applies to prevent enforcing oral modifications that contradict the written contract.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nThis is a bit confusing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
