Let's see what it's asking.\n\nTriacylglycerides consist of:\n\nI. A ribose backbone\n\nII. a glycerol backbone\n\nIII. three phosphodiester linkages\n\nIV. three ester linkages\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. I and III\n\nB. II only\n\nC. II and III\n\nD. II and IV\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what triacylglycerides are. I remember that they are a type of lipid, specifically triglycerides, and they are formed by the combination of glycerol and three fatty acids. So, that sounds like option II, a glycerol backbone, is probably correct.\n\nNow, how are the fatty acids attached to the glycerol? I think they are connected through ester linkages. Let me confirm that. Yes, in triglycerides, the fatty acids are linked to the glycerol molecule via ester bonds. So, that would make option IV correct as well.\n\nSo, if II and IV are correct, that would point to option D. But let's make sure about the other options to be certain.\n\nOption I is a ribose backbone. Ribose is a type of sugar, and it's part of RNA molecules, not triacylglycerides. So, that's definitely not correct.\n\nOption III is three phosphodiester linkages. Phosphodiester linkages are found in DNA and RNA, where they connect the nucleotides. Again, not related to triacylglycerides.\n\nSo, confirming again, triacylglycerides have a glycerol backbone and three fatty acids attached via ester linkages. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. II and IV.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other component in triacylglycerides that might fit the other options. But no, triacylglycerides are simply composed of glycerol and three fatty acids linked by ester bonds. No ribose or phosphodiester linkages are present.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is D. II and IV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
