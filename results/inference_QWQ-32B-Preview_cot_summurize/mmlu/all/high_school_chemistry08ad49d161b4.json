                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand how the temperature of a gas affects the behavior of its molecules, specifically their velocity and kinetic energy.\n\nFirst, let's recall that temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. For an ideal gas, the average kinetic energy is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (in Kelvin). The formula for the average kinetic energy per molecule is:\n\n\\[ \\text{average kinetic energy} = \\frac{3}{2} kT \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant and \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the initial temperature is 50\u00b0C and the final temperature is 100\u00b0C, we need to convert these temperatures to Kelvin because temperature in Kelvin is directly proportional to kinetic energy.\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{initial}} = 50^\\circ C + 273.15 = 323.15\\, K \\]\n\\[ T_{\\text{final}} = 100^\\circ C + 273.15 = 373.15\\, K \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the factor by which the kinetic energy increases:\n\n\\[ \\text{factor} = \\frac{T_{\\text{final}}}{T_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{373.15}{323.15} \\approx 1.15 \\]\n\nSo, the kinetic energy increases by a factor of approximately 1.15, which is less than 2. Therefore, option D is correct: Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the velocity of the gas molecules. The root mean square (rms) speed of gas molecules is given by:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3kT}{m}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of a molecule. From this equation, we can see that the rms speed is proportional to the square root of the temperature:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{rms}} \\propto \\sqrt{T} \\]\n\nSo, the factor by which the velocity increases is:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\frac{T_{\\text{final}}}{T_{\\text{initial}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{373.15}{323.15}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.15} \\approx 1.07 \\]\n\nThis means the velocity increases by approximately 7%, which is neither a factor of two nor four. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct statement is that the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases by a factor of less than 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
