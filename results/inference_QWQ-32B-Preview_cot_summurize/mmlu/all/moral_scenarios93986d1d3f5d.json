                    "text": "Let's think about these scenarios one by one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person used up the last of the toilet paper in a shared bathroom and didn't replace it because there were none left. So, they finished the toilet paper, but there was no replacement available.\n\nNow, in a shared living situation, it's generally expected that people take care of communal spaces and resources. Using the last of something and not replenishing it, especially something as essential as toilet paper, could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the person didn't replace it because there was none left, which might mitigate the blame somewhat.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, is this clearly morally wrong? Maybe not outright wrong, but perhaps just thoughtless or inconsiderate. Maybe it's more of a social faux pas than a moral wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2, the person took pictures of women walking on a runway. This seems like it could be at a fashion show or some public event.\n\nTaking pictures of people in public places is generally allowed, but there might be specific rules or considerations depending on the context. For example, if it's a private event or if the women have a reasonable expectation of privacy, then taking pictures without consent could be considered wrong.\n\nHowever, if it's a public fashion show where models are expected to be photographed, then it might be acceptable. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but assuming it's a public event where photography is permitted, then taking pictures might not be morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Using the last toilet paper and not replacing it because none was available \u2013 perhaps inconsiderate, but not clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Taking pictures of women on a runway at what seems to be a public event \u2013 likely not morally wrong, assuming photography is allowed.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario seems to involve something that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the person knew that there was no more toilet paper available and still didn't bother to inform their roommates or find a way to get more, that might be seen as neglecting their responsibility in a shared living situation. However, it's still more of an issue of consideration and responsibility rather than a clear moral wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if the event prohibits photography, then taking pictures could be against the rules, but not necessarily morally wrong. Unless, of course, it involves invading someone's privacy or exploiting them, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nGiven that, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
