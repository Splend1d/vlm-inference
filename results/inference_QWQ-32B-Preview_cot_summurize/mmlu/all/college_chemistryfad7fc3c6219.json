                    "text": "To determine which of these ions has the smallest radius, we need to consider their positions in the periodic table and their ionization states.\n\nFirst, let's list out the ions and their corresponding elements:\n\n- A. K+ is the potassium ion.\n\n- B. Ca2+ is the calcium ion.\n\n- C. Sc3+ is the scandium ion.\n\n- D. Rb+ is the rubidium ion.\n\nNow, let's locate these elements in the periodic table:\n\n- Potassium (K) is in Group 1, Period 4.\n\n- Calcium (Ca) is in Group 2, Period 4.\n\n- Scandium (Sc) is in Group 3, Period 4.\n\n- Rubidium (Rb) is in Group 1, Period 5.\n\nSo, we have ions from two groups (1 and 2) and two periods (4 and 5), all in the fourth period except for Rb, which is in the fifth period.\n\nWhen considering ionic radii, there are a few trends to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Atomic radius generally decreases across a period** from left to right due to the increasing nuclear charge, which pulls the electrons closer.\n\n2. **Atomic radius generally increases down a group** because additional electron shells are added.\n\n3. **Ionization leads to a decrease in radius** for cations because electrons are removed, reducing the electron-electron repulsion and allowing the remaining electrons to be held closer to the nucleus.\n\n4. **Higher charges lead to smaller radii** because the same number of electrons are held more tightly by a higher positive charge.\n\nGiven that all these ions are cations, we need to consider both their group and period positions, as well as their charges.\n\nLet's compare them step by step:\n\nFirst, compare ions within the same period but different groups:\n\n- In Period 4, we have Ca2+ (Group 2), Sc3+ (Group 3), and K+ (Group 1).\n\n- Group 2 elements have two valence electrons, and when they form Ca2+, they lose both, resulting in a noble gas configuration.\n\n- Group 3 elements like Sc have three valence electrons, and Sc3+ loses all three, also achieving a noble gas configuration.\n\n- Group 1 elements have one valence electron, and K+ loses one, achieving a noble gas configuration.\n\nGiven that all these ions have the same noble gas electron configuration, the ion with the highest charge should have the smallest radius because of the stronger attraction between the nucleus and the electrons.\n\nSo, between Ca2+ and Sc3+, Sc3+ has a higher charge and should have a smaller radius.\n\nComparing Sc3+ and K+, Sc3+ has a higher charge, so it should have a smaller radius than K+.\n\nNow, consider Rb+, which is in Period 5, Group 1.\n\nSince Rb is below K in the same group, its atomic radius is larger than K's due to the additional electron shell.\n\nWhen Rb loses one electron to form Rb+, it still has one more electron shell than K+, so its radius should be larger than K+.\n\nTherefore, among K+, Ca2+, Sc3+, and Rb+, Sc3+ should have the smallest radius due to its higher charge and being in the same period as Ca2+ and K+.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the specific values:\n\n- The ionic radius of K+ is approximately 138 pm.\n\n- The ionic radius of Ca2+ is approximately 99 pm.\n\n- The ionic radius of Sc3+ is approximately 65 pm.\n\n- The ionic radius of Rb+ is approximately 148 pm.\n\nAs we can see, Sc3+ has the smallest radius among these ions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Sc3+.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
