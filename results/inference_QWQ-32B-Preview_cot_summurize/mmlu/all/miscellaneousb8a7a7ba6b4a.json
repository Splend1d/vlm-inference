An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet me just make sure I understand why the other options aren't correct.\n\nA. Onomatopoeia is a word that phonetically imitates, resembles, or suggests the sound that it describes. For example, \"buzz\" or \"meow.\" So, that's not about rearranging letters.\n\nB. Malapropism is using a wrong word, especially one that sounds similar to the correct one, often with a comic effect. For example, saying \"ex-patriot\" instead of \"ex-parte.\" It's not about rearranging letters.\n\nD. Antonym is a word that has the opposite meaning of another word. For example, \"hot\" and \"cold.\" Again, not about rearranging letters.\n\nSo, yeah, C. anagram seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
