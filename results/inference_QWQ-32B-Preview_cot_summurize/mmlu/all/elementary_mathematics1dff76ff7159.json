To isolate p, we need to get rid of the coefficient 2 that is multiplying it.\n\nTo do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2. This way, the 2 on the right side will cancel out, leaving us with just p.\n\nSo, let's divide both sides by 2:\n\n24 \u00f7 2 = 2p \u00f7 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n12 = p\n\nTherefore, the value of p is 12.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. p = 4\n\nB. p = 8\n\nC. p = 12\n\nD. p = 24\n\nThe correct choice is C. p = 12.\n\nTo double-check, we can substitute p = 12 back into the original equation:\n\n24 = 2p\n\n24 = 2 * 12\n\n24 = 24\n\nYes, it checks out. So, the answer is indeed p = 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
