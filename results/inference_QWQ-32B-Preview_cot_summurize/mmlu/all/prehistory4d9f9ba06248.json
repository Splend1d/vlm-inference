                    "text": "Let's see... I need to figure out how the commoners in these Aztec villages, Capilco and Cuexcomate, lived. So, first things first, I should probably recall some basic facts about the Aztec Empire and their social structure.\n\nI know that the Aztec Empire was a complex society with a hierarchical structure. At the top was the emperor, then nobles, priests, merchants, and then the commoners, who were farmers, artisans, and other workers. The Aztecs were known for their centralized government and their ability to extract tribute from the regions they controlled.\n\nNow, regarding these villages, Capilco and Cuexcomate, I'm assuming they were rural areas, probably agricultural communities. So, how did the Aztec Empire treat their rural commoners?\n\nOption A says they were ruled by an iron fist by the king, with armies stationed there. That sounds pretty oppressive. I do know that the Aztecs had a system of provincial governance, where they would place officials to collect tribute and maintain order. But I'm not sure if armies were permanently stationed in every small village.\n\nOption B says they were forced to send half of all maize they grew to the king as tribute and lived in absolute poverty. Hmm, tribute was definitely a part of the Aztec system. They required tribute from the provinces and villages they controlled. But half of all maize seems like a lot. I wonder if that's accurate. As for living in absolute poverty, I'm not sure about that. If they had to give half their produce as tribute, that would leave them with half, which might not be enough, but I need to verify that.\n\nOption C says they were mostly left alone and did fairly well for themselves. This seems more plausible to me. Maybe the Aztec Empire allowed rural commoners to manage their own affairs as long as they paid their tribute on time. This way, the empire could function efficiently without needing to micromanage every aspect of village life.\n\nOption D says they had no protection from city-states that invaded from the north. Well, the Aztec Empire was located in central Mexico, and they had expanded their control over many regions. It's possible that some villages might have been vulnerable to invasions, but I think the Aztecs had a military presence to protect their territories.\n\nLet me think about this differently. What was the relationship between the Aztec central government and the rural villages? I recall that the Aztecs had a system of calpulli, which were like clan-based communities that owned land and managed their own affairs to some extent. Maybe the commoners in these villages had some autonomy.\n\nAlso, I know that the Aztecs had a system of tribute where villages or provinces would supply goods, labor, or soldiers to the empire. But the exact amount varied depending on the agreement or conquest terms.\n\nPerhaps I should look up specific information about Capilco and Cuexcomate to see how they were governed. But since I don't have access to external resources right now, I'll have to rely on my general knowledge of the Aztec Empire.\n\nLet me consider the implications of each option:\n\nA: Ruled by an iron fist with armies stationed there. That would mean constant military presence, which might not be practical for every small village. It could be costly and resource-intensive for the empire.\n\nB: Forced to send half of their maize as tribute and living in absolute poverty. While tribute was a significant part of the Aztec economy, I'm not sure if it was exactly half. Also, living in absolute poverty seems extreme. Maybe some villages struggled, but not all.\n\nC: Mostly left alone and did fairly well for themselves. This seems plausible. If the villages paid their tribute and didn't cause trouble, the empire might not interfere much in their daily lives.\n\nD: Had no protection from invasions from the north. Well, the Aztecs were the dominant power, and they had military might. It's unlikely that villages within the empire would have no protection.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems the most reasonable. The Aztec Empire likely allowed rural commoners to manage their own affairs, focusing on collecting tribute and ensuring loyalty, rather than micromanaging every aspect of village life.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any evidence to suggest otherwise. For example, maybe in some cases, the Aztecs did station armies in certain villages to maintain control, especially if there was resistance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tribute system was so oppressive that commoners lived in poverty. But I recall that Aztec society placed importance on agricultural production, and a certain level of stability and prosperity was necessary to maintain the empire's wealth.\n\nMoreover, the Aztecs engineered complex irrigation systems and terraced farming to increase agricultural output, which suggests they were invested in the productivity of their rural areas.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that while commoners had to pay tribute, they were also able to maintain a decent standard of living.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the best answer is C: the commoners were mostly left alone and did fairly well for themselves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
