                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these options isn't a characteristic of an oligopoly. So first, I should remember what an oligopoly is. An oligopoly is a market structure where there are only a few large sellers or producers. Okay, so option D says \"Few firms,\" which sounds like it matches that definition. So, D seems like it is a characteristic.\n\nNext, option C mentions \"Strong barriers to entry.\" I think in an oligopoly, there are high barriers to entry that prevent new firms from easily entering the market. That makes sense, like in industries with high startup costs or when a few firms control most of the resources. So, C also seems correct.\n\nOption B says \"Price-maker.\" In an oligopoly, since there are only a few firms, each firm has some control over the price of its product. They're not price takers like in perfect competition. So, B seems accurate too.\n\nNow, option A says \"P = MC.\" Hmm, P equals MC usually refers to the condition where price equals marginal cost. In perfect competition, firms set P = MC, but in oligopoly, firms have some market power and typically set P > MC to maximize profits. So, does that mean A is not a characteristic of oligopoly?\n\nWait, but I should double-check. In oligopoly, firms consider how their pricing affects the market and what their competitors might do. They often use strategies like price leadership or collude to set prices above marginal cost to earn higher profits. So, generally, in oligopoly, P > MC.\n\nTherefore, saying P = MC doesn't seem to fit with what I know about oligopolies. So, A might be the correct answer to this question.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about whether there are any situations in oligopoly where P could equal MC. Maybe in some competitive scenarios or under certain conditions, but generally, oligopolists have the power to set P above MC.\n\nAlso, I recall that in some models of oligopoly, like perfect competition, P can equal MC, but that's not the typical case. In reality, oligopolies usually have some degree of market power, leading to P > MC.\n\nSo, overall, it seems like A, \"P = MC,\" is not a characteristic of oligopoly, unlike the other options which are characteristics of it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
