                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character has rancid and expired milk in the fridge along with fresh milk. They pour their visiting friend a glass of the fresh milk and tell the friend that the milk is fine. Is this morally wrong?\n\nFirst, the character is aware that there is bad milk in the fridge but chooses to give the friend good milk and assures them it's fine. This seems responsible and considerate. They're making sure their friend doesn't consume expired milk, which could make them sick. So, in this case, the character is acting in a way that protects their friend's health. That's generally considered morally right.\n\nHowever, there might be an issue with having expired milk in the fridge in the first place. Maybe the character should have disposed of it earlier to prevent any chance of someone consuming it. But in this specific action of giving fresh milk to their friend and assuring its quality, it's hard to see anything morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: The main character drove home after drinking three bottles of wine at a winery.\n\nDrinking and driving is a serious issue. In the US, it's against the law to operate a vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) above a certain limit, usually 0.08%. Consuming three bottles of wine would likely put someone well above this limit, depending on their weight, metabolism, and other factors.\n\nDriving under the influence (DUI) endangers not only the driver's life but also that of passengers and other road users. It's a reckless act that can lead to severe consequences, including injury and death.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, drinking and driving is clearly morally wrong because it shows a disregard for the safety and well-being of others.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: The character acts responsibly by giving fresh milk to their friend and ensuring their health is not compromised. This is not morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: The character chooses to drive home after drinking heavily, endangering themselves and others. This is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
