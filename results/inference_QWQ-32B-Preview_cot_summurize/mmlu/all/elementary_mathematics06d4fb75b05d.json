                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: an ice cream shop sold 48 vanilla milkshakes in a day, and that was 40% of the total number of milkshakes sold that day. I need to find out the total number of milkshakes sold. The options are 60, 72, 100, and 120.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, 48 vanilla milkshakes represent 40% of the total milkshakes. I need to find the total, which I'll call T.\n\nSo, 48 is 40% of T. In math terms, that's:\n\n48 = 0.40 * T\n\nNow, I need to solve for T. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.40.\n\nT = 48 / 0.40\n\nLet me calculate that. 48 divided by 0.40.\n\nWell, 0.40 is the same as 2/5, so dividing by 2/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/2.\n\nSo, 48 * (5/2) = 48 * 2.5 = 120.\n\nSo, T = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. If the total is 120, and 40% of 120 is 48, that checks out.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n40% of 120 is 0.40 * 120 = 48. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of milkshakes sold that day is 120.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to think about this, just to be sure.\n\nAnother approach could be to set up a proportion.\n\nIf 48 is to T as 40% is to 100%, then:\n\n48/T = 40/100\n\nSimplifying 40/100 to 2/5:\n\n48/T = 2/5\n\nNow, cross-multiplying:\n\n2 * T = 5 * 48\n\n2T = 240\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nT = 120\n\nAgain, I get T = 120.\n\nOkay, that matches my first method.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nThe problem says \"48 vanilla milkshakes were sold, which was 40% of the total number of milkshakes sold that day.\"\n\nSo, it's clear that 48 is 40% of the total.\n\nNo hidden meanings or additional variables to consider.\n\nTherefore, the total number of milkshakes sold is 120.\n\nLooking back at the options, 120 is option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's quickly check the other options to see why they wouldn't make sense.\n\nOption A: 60\n\nIf the total was 60, then 40% of 60 is 24, which is not 48. So, too low.\n\nOption B: 72\n\n40% of 72 is 28.8, which is not 48. So, not correct.\n\nOption C: 100\n\n40% of 100 is 40, which is still less than 48.\n\nOption D: 120\n\n40% of 120 is 48, which matches the given information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
