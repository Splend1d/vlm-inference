                    "text": "So I have this problem here about diluting sulfuric acid, H2SO4. I need to make 1.00 liter of a 3.0 M solution starting from a stock solution that's 18.0 M. I need to figure out the correct procedure to do this using a volumetric flask.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to dilute solutions properly. I remember that when diluting acids, especially strong ones like sulfuric acid, it's important to add the acid to water, not the other way around, for safety reasons. Adding water to concentrated acid can cause a violent reaction and release a lot of heat quickly, which is dangerous.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nOption A says to add 167 mL of the stock solution to the flask, then fill the rest with distilled water while swirling.\n\nOption B says to add 600 mL of the stock solution, then fill the rest with water while swirling.\n\nOption C says to fill the flask partway with water, then add 167 mL of the stock solution, swirling to mix, then fill the rest with water.\n\nOption D says to fill the flask partway with water, add 600 mL of the stock solution, swirl to mix, then fill the rest with water.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much of the stock solution I need to make 1.00 L of 3.0 M H2SO4.\n\nI can use the dilution formula:\n\nM1 * V1 = M2 * V2\n\nwhere:\n\n- M1 is the molarity of the stock solution (18.0 M)\n\n- V1 is the volume of the stock solution needed (in liters)\n\n- M2 is the desired molarity (3.0 M)\n\n- V2 is the final volume (1.00 L)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n18.0 M * V1 = 3.0 M * 1.00 L\n\nSolving for V1:\n\nV1 = (3.0 M * 1.00 L) / 18.0 M = 0.1667 L\n\nConverting liters to milliliters (since 1 L = 1000 mL):\n\n0.1667 L * 1000 mL/L = 166.7 mL\n\nSo, I need approximately 167 mL of the stock solution.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nOption A suggests adding 167 mL of the stock solution and then filling the rest with water. But, it doesn't specify whether to add the acid to the water or vice versa.\n\nOption B suggests adding 600 mL of the stock solution, which is way more than needed.\n\nOption C suggests filling the flask partway with water, then adding 167 mL of the stock solution, swirling, then filling the rest with water.\n\nOption D suggests filling the flask partway with water, adding 600 mL of the stock solution, swirling, then filling the rest with water.\n\nGiven that I need only 167 mL of the stock solution, option B and D are immediately out because they suggest using 600 mL, which is too much.\n\nBetween options A and C, the key difference is the order of adding the acid and water.\n\nOption A suggests adding the acid first, then water, which is dangerous.\n\nOption C suggests adding water first, then the acid, which is the safer procedure.\n\nHowever, option C says to fill the flask partway with water, add the acid, swirl, then fill the rest with water. I need to make sure that this is the correct procedure for using a volumetric flask.\n\nActually, the proper procedure for using a volumetric flask to prepare a solution of a certain concentration is:\n\n1. Add a small amount of solvent (water, in this case) to the flask.\n\n2. Add the measured amount of solute (the stock H2SO4 solution).\n\n3. Swirl to mix.\n\n4. Fill the flask up to the calibration mark with more solvent.\n\nSo, option C seems to align with this procedure.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, suggests adding the acid first, then adding water, which is not safe.\n\nTherefore, the correct procedure is option C.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider why option A is incorrect.\n\nIf you add the acid first and then water, you risk diluting the acid too slowly, which can generate a lot of heat and potentially cause the solution to splash or the container to break.\n\nWhereas, if you add water first and then the acid, the dilution happens more safely, with the acid being added to a larger volume of water, dispersing the heat more effectively.\n\nHence, for safety and accuracy, option C is the proper procedure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
