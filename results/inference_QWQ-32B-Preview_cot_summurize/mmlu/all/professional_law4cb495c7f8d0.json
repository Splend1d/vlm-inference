Pursuant to that law, a woman sued a local newspaper in state court after the newspaper identified her as a rape victim. The state trial and appellate courts rejected the claim, holding that the state law was invalid under both the state constitution and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The state supreme court affirmed, holding specifically: \"We think that this well-intentioned law very likely violates the First Amendment of the federal Constitution. We need not, however, decide that issue, because the law assuredly violates our state constitution, which provides even greater protection to the right of the press to report the news.\" The woman petitioned for review in the U.S. Supreme Court. Is the U.S. Supreme Court likely to review the state supreme court judgment?\n\nA. No, because the First Amendment prohibits the imposition of liability for the publication of truthful information.\nB. No, because the judgment of the state supreme court rests upon an adequate and independent state-law ground.\nC. Yes, because the supremacy clause does not permit a state to create rights greater than those conferred by the federal Constitution.\nD. Yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction extends to cases arising under federal law.\n"

                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a state law that awards damages if someone publishes the name of a rape victim. A woman sued a newspaper for publishing her name after she was raped, but the state courts rejected her claim, saying the law is invalid under both the state constitution and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe state supreme court affirmed this decision, specifically saying that the law probably violates the First Amendment but they don't need to decide that because it definitely violates the state constitution, which provides even greater protection to the press.\n\nNow, the woman is petitioning for review in the U.S. Supreme Court, and the question is whether the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to review the state supreme court's judgment.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. No, because the First Amendment prohibits the imposition of liability for the publication of truthful information.\n\nB. No, because the judgment of the state supreme court rests upon an adequate and independent state-law ground.\n\nC. Yes, because the supremacy clause does not permit a state to create rights greater than those conferred by the federal Constitution.\n\nD. Yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction extends to cases arising under federal law.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about this.\n\nFirst, I know that the U.S. Supreme Court can review decisions of state supreme courts, but there are some rules about when they will do that.\n\nOne important principle is that if a state supreme court bases its decision on an independent and adequate state ground, the U.S. Supreme Court won't review it because it's a state law issue.\n\nIn this case, the state supreme court said they don't need to decide the First Amendment issue because the law violates the state constitution. So, it seems like they're relying on state law grounds.\n\nBut the woman is petitioning for review in the U.S. Supreme Court, which suggests that she thinks there's a federal issue here.\n\nOption A says no, because the First Amendment prohibits liability for publishing truthful information. That might be true, but the state supreme court already considered the First Amendment and said the law probably violates it, but they didn't need to decide that because of the state constitution.\n\nOption B says no, because the judgment rests on an adequate and independent state-law ground. That sounds plausible because the state supreme court relied on the state constitution.\n\nOption C says yes, because the supremacy clause doesn't permit states to create rights greater than those conferred by the federal Constitution. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. The supremacy clause makes federal law supreme, but it doesn't prevent states from providing greater protections than the federal constitution.\n\nOption D says yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction extends to cases arising under federal law. That's true, but if the state supreme court is relying on an independent state ground, the U.S. Supreme Court might not review it.\n\nWait, but in this case, the state supreme court did address the First Amendment, saying it likely violates it, but they didn't need to decide that because of the state constitution.\n\nI think the key here is whether the state law ground is independent and adequate.\n\nAn independent and adequate state ground means that the state supreme court's decision doesn't depend on federal law and is firmly rooted in state law.\n\nIn this case, the state supreme court said they don't need to decide the First Amendment issue because the law violates the state constitution.\n\nSo, it seems like the state ground is independent and adequate.\n\nTherefore, the U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to review the decision because it's based on state law.\n\nOption B seems correct.\n\nOption A also says no, but for a different reason. It's saying no because of the First Amendment, but the state supreme court already considered that.\n\nOption C is saying yes, because the supremacy clause doesn't permit states to create greater rights, but actually, states can provide greater protections than the federal constitution.\n\nOption D is saying yes, because the case arises under federal law, but the state supreme court's decision is based on state law grounds.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B: No, because the judgment of the state supreme court rests upon an adequate and independent state-law ground.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
