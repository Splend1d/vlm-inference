                    "text": "I need to figure out what Marquis's argument is about abortion being morally wrong. The options are:\n\nA. He shows that a fetus is a person with full moral rights, including the right to life.\n\nB. He appeals to the fact that a fetus is biologically human and says it's presumptively wrong to kill human beings.\n\nC. He shows that a fetus is sentient and that it's wrong to harm or kill sentient creatures.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nI need to recall what Marquis actually says in his argument. I remember that Marquis wrote a famous paper on abortion called \"Why Abortion is Immoral,\" published in 1989. Let me think about the main points he made in that paper.\n\nFirst, Marquis doesn't focus primarily on whether the fetus is a person or biologically human. Instead, he argues that what makes killing wrong is the loss to the victim of their future experiences and potential life. He calls this the \"future-like-us\" argument.\n\nSo, according to Marquis, abortion is immoral because it deprives the fetus of a potential future full of valuable experiences, just like it would be wrong to deprive a born person of their future.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. This seems similar to some pro-life arguments that argue fetuses are persons with full moral rights, but Marquis's argument is different. He doesn't hinge his argument on the fetus being a person; instead, he focuses on the value of the potential future life.\n\nB. Again, this is more aligned with arguments that emphasize the biological humanity of the fetus, but Marquis's argument is about the moral wrongness of depriving someone of their future experiences, regardless of whether they are biologically human or not.\n\nC. This option mentions sentience, which is relevant in some arguments against abortion, particularly those that focus on the ability to feel pain. However, Marquis's argument doesn't center on sentience; it's about the value of future experiences, which can include more than just sentient experiences.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and C don't accurately capture Marquis's argument, it seems like the correct answer is D. None of the above.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm misremembering Marquis's argument. Perhaps he does appeal to the fetus being a person with full moral rights.\n\nLooking back, in Marquis's argument, he does consider the fetus to have a future of valuable experiences, which is why abortion is wrong. He compares abortion to murder, not because the fetus is a person, but because both deprive the entity of their future.\n\nIn fact, Marquis's argument is often cited for separating the personhood issue from the immorality of abortion. He argues that even if one doesn't accept that the fetus is a person, abortion can still be considered immoral because it deprives the fetus of its future.\n\nTherefore, none of the options A, B, or C accurately represent Marquis's argument. So, the answer should be D. None of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
