Bloat\n\nBloat in ruminants is a condition where there is an excessive accumulation of gas in the rumen that cannot be expelled quickly enough, leading to abdominal distension and potential respiratory distress. It's a serious and often fatal condition if not treated promptly.\n\n- **Agalactia** refers to the failure to produce milk, which is not related to gas accumulation.\n\n- **Bovine pleuropneumonia** is a respiratory disease affecting the lungs and pleura, not the rumen.\n\n- **Grass tetany** is a metabolic disorder associated with low blood magnesium levels, often seen in grazing animals on lush, rapidly growing grass.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Bloat."
