Armed force was permitted with no restrictions\n\nC. Armed force was permitted subject to few restrictions\n\nD. Armed force was not regulated under international law prior to 1945\n\nI need to think about what international law was like before the UN Charter was established in 1945. So, prior to that, there was the League of Nations after World War I, but it wasn't very successful in preventing aggression. Before that, there were various treaties and conventions, like the Hague Conventions and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Armed force was prohibited\n\nWas armed force completely prohibited before 1945? I don't think so. There were laws of war that regulated how armed force could be used, but I don't recall any absolute prohibition on the use of force.\n\nB. Armed force was permitted with no restrictions\n\nThat seems unlikely. Even before the UN, there were rules governing warfare, like the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Conventions, which set out rules for conducting war.\n\nC. Armed force was permitted subject to few restrictions\n\nThis might be possible. Maybe there were some restrictions, but not as comprehensive as after the UN Charter.\n\nD. Armed force was not regulated under international law prior to 1945\n\nAgain, I know that there were regulations on warfare before 1945, so this seems incorrect.\n\nLet me look into the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. It renounced war as an instrument of national policy and pledged that signatory nations would settle their disputes by peaceful means. So, in a way, it prohibited aggressive war. But in practice, it didn't prevent World War II, so maybe it wasn't effectively enforced.\n\nBefore the Kellogg-Briand Pact, there was the Covenant of the League of Nations, which also aimed to prevent war through collective security and diplomacy. However, the League lacked teeth to enforce its decisions.\n\nGoing back further, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 focused on regulating the conduct of war and reducing certain inhumane weapons, but they didn't prohibit war altogether.\n\nSo, prior to the UN Charter, there were some international laws and agreements that regulated the use of armed force, but they were perhaps not as comprehensive or effectively enforced as after 1945.\n\nGiven that, option C seems the most accurate: Armed force was permitted subject to few restrictions.\n\nBut I need to be careful. The Kellogg-Briand Pact did prohibit aggressive war, so in a legal sense, aggressive war was prohibited. However, in practice, states still engaged in warfare, and the prohibition wasn't effectively enforced.\n\nMaybe option A is correct because legally armed force was prohibited, but in reality, it was still happening.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option D is correct, saying that armed force was not regulated under international law prior to 1945, but I know that's not true because of the Hague Conventions and others.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to understand what the UN Charter did regarding the use of force. The UN Charter, in Article 2(4), prohibits member states from using force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. So, it established a clear prohibition on the use of force, except in certain circumstances like self-defense or with UN Security Council authorization.\n\nBefore the UN Charter, was there such a clear prohibition? The Kellogg-Briand Pact did renounce war as an instrument of national policy, but it didn't have mechanisms for enforcement, and states continued to engage in warfare.\n\nSo, perhaps prior to the UN Charter, while there were some legal restrictions and prohibitions on the use of force, they were not as codified or as enforceable as after 1945.\n\nGiven that, option C seems appropriate: Armed force was permitted subject to few restrictions.\n\nAlternatively, option A could be considered correct if one interprets it to mean that legal prohibition existed, even if not effectively enforced.\n\nBut perhaps the question is testing whether there was any regulation before the UN Charter, and the answer is that there was some regulation, but it was limited.\n\nAnother perspective is that before the UN Charter, the use of force was largely governed by the concept of sovereignty, where states could use force as they saw fit, as long as it didn't interfere with other states' sovereignty. But even that is complicated by treaties like the Kellogg-Briand Pact.\n\nMaybe the best answer is C: Armed force was permitted subject to few restrictions.\n\nI think I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
