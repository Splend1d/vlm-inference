                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about syllogisms. It asks which type of syllogism has a major premise that says, \"All A's are B.\" And then it gives options: categorical, disjunctive, conditional, and hypothetical.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a syllogism is. I think it's a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true. Okay, so there are different types of syllogisms, and I need to figure out which one matches the description given.\n\nLet me look at the options one by one.\n\nStarting with A. categorical. I recall that categorical syllogisms are arguments consisting of three categorical propositions: two premises and a conclusion. And categorical propositions are statements like \"All A are B,\" \"No A are B,\" \"Some A are B,\" and \"Some A are not B.\" So, the major premise in a categorical syllogism could indeed be \"All A's are B.\" That seems promising.\n\nNext, B. disjunctive. Disjunctive syllogisms involve propositions that present alternatives, like \"Either P or Q, and not P, therefore Q.\" So, it's more about choices or alternatives. The major premise doesn't typically take the form \"All A's are B.\" So, maybe not this one.\n\nOption C. conditional. Conditional syllogisms, also known as hypothetical syllogisms, involve conditional statements like \"If P, then Q.\" So, their major premise might be something like \"If A, then B.\" Again, not exactly \"All A's are B.\"\n\nAnd D. hypothetical is similar to conditional, as they are sometimes used interchangeably. So, same as C.\n\nWait, but I see that conditional and hypothetical are both listed separately, which is a bit confusing. Maybe there's a difference, or perhaps they are used interchangeably in some contexts.\n\nLet me double-check. Hypothetical syllogism typically involves conditional statements, like \"If P, then Q; if Q, then R; therefore, if P, then R.\" Again, not matching the \"All A's are B\" format.\n\nSo, going back to categorical syllogism, it seems to fit better because its premises are categorical propositions, which include statements like \"All A are B.\"\n\nMoreover, in a categorical syllogism, there are three terms, each appearing twice: the major term, the minor term, and the middle term. The major premise contains the major term and the middle term, and the minor premise contains the minor term and the middle term.\n\nIn this case, the major premise is \"All A's are B,\" where B is the major term and A is the middle term, perhaps.\n\nComparing this with other types:\n\n- Disjunctive syllogism: Deals with alternatives, not categorical statements.\n\n- Conditional (or hypothetical) syllogism: Deals with conditional statements, like if-then statements.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be A. categorical.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me see if there's any other type of syllogism that might fit.\n\nIs there such a thing as a disjunctive syllogism with a premise like \"All A's are B\"? I don't think so. Disjunctive syllogisms typically have premises like \"Either A or B\" and \"Not A,\" leading to \"Therefore, B.\"\n\nSimilarly, conditional syllogisms have premises like \"If A, then B\" and \"A,\" leading to \"Therefore, B.\"\n\nHypothetical syllogisms are similar to conditional syllogisms, involving chains of conditional statements.\n\nSo, none of these match the \"All A's are B\" format as well as categorical syllogisms do.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is A. categorical.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
