                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 17-year-old girl who's been experiencing a cough when she exercises, specifically during field hockey games. This has been going on for about two months, and the cough goes away once she rests. She doesn't have any chest pain or palpitations, and her physical exam looks normal, including her chest x-ray and spirometry tests.\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. She's playing field hockey, which involves running and physical exertion. Exercise-induced cough can be a symptom of several conditions, but given her age and the fact that she's otherwise healthy, I need to think about common causes in this population.\n\nOption A is asthma. Now, asthma is a pretty common condition, especially in teenagers, and it can present with exercise-induced symptoms like coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. Her sister has asthma, which could suggest a genetic predisposition. However, her spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 90% and an FEV1 of 90% of predicted, which are both within normal limits. Typically, in asthma, you might see a reduced FEV1 or an FEV1:FVC ratio that decreases with bronchodilator use. So, her spirometry seems normal, which makes asthma less likely, unless it's exercise-induced bronchoconstriction that isn't showing up on the test because it was done at rest.\n\nOption B is chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by a productive cough lasting for at least three months in two consecutive years. However, this patient has a nonproductive cough that occurs only during exercise and resolves with rest. She doesn't smoke, which is a major risk factor for chronic bronchitis, and there's no mention of sputum production. So, chronic bronchitis seems unlikely.\n\nOption C is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD can cause cough, especially if acid reflux triggers bronchial irritation. However, her cough is specifically related to exercise and resolves with rest, which doesn't align perfectly with typical GERD symptoms, unless exercise exacerbates the reflux. But given that she doesn't have any other symptoms like heartburn or regurgitation, and her exam is normal, GERD might not be the primary issue here.\n\nOption D is postnasal drip syndrome. This can cause chronic cough, especially if there's irritation from mucus dripping down the throat. She does mention nasal congestion, which could be related to postnasal drip. However, her cough is exercise-induced and resolves with rest, which doesn't perfectly correlate with typical postnasal drip symptoms, unless exercise worsens the nasal congestion or mucus production.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, which is a form of asthma triggered by exercise. Even though her spirometry is normal at rest, exercise can cause a transient narrowing of the airways that might not be picked up by resting spirometry. Maybe the physician should consider performing exercise spirometry or a bronchoprovocation test to see if her airways narrow in response to exercise.\n\nBut since the question is asking for the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided, and her spirometry is normal, perhaps asthma isn't the best fit. Maybe postnasal drip syndrome could be considered, given the nasal congestion, but it doesn't perfectly explain the exercise-induced cough.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps it's exercise-induced laryngomalacia or vocal cord dysfunction. These conditions can cause cough and breathing difficulties during exercise, and might not show up on spirometry or chest x-ray. But that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, could it be exercise-induced rhinitis? Sometimes, exercise can trigger nasal symptoms, including congestion and cough. But again, that's not directly listed as an option.\n\nGiven the options provided, asthma is still the most plausible diagnosis, even if the spirometry is normal. Maybe she has exercise-induced asthma that isn't persistent enough to affect her resting lung function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's just a simple case of exercise-induced cough without any underlying pathology, and it's benign.\n\nBut considering the differential diagnoses provided, I think asthma is still the most likely, despite the normal spirometry.\n\nSo, my answer is A. Asthma.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
