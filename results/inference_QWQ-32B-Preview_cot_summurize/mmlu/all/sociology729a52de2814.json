And he talks a lot about how society reproduces itself, especially in terms of class. I think the concept here is \"cultural capital.\" Let me see why.\n\nFirst off, Pierre Bourdieu was a French sociologist who developed the concept of cultural capital. He believed that people from different social classes have different amounts of cultural capital, which includes things like education, manners, and taste. This cultural capital can be converted into economic capital or social advantage.\n\nSo, if we look at the options:\n\nA. cults of the capital - I don't think this is a term Bourdieu used. It sounds more like something related to political science or economics.\n\nB. capital culture - Again, not familiar with this term in the context of Bourdieu's work.\n\nC. cultural capital - This seems right. It's a key concept in Bourdieu's theory.\n\nD. culpable capture - I don't recognize this term in relation to Bourdieu's work.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. cultural capital.\n\nBut let me double-check. Bourdieu argued that cultural capital is one of the mechanisms through which social classes reproduce themselves across generations. People from higher social classes tend to have more cultural capital, which gives them advantages in education, employment, and social mobility. This, in turn, allows them to pass on these advantages to their children, perpetuating the class structure.\n\nAlso, Bourdieu talked about different forms of capital:\n\n- Economic capital: financial resources.\n\n- Social capital: networks and relationships.\n\n- Cultural capital: knowledge, education, and skills.\n\nEach of these can be used to maintain and reproduce one's position in society.\n\nSo, in the context of reproducing class, cultural capital seems to be the most relevant concept here.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
