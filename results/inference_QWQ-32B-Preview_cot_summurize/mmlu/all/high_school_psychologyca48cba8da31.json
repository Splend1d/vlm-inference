Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"The result of a variety of experiences that temporarily shape behavior.\" Hmm, this sounds like learning does affect behavior, but it mentions that it's temporary. I think learning is more lasting than that. If something only temporarily shapes behavior, maybe it's not true learning.\n\nOption B: \"An enduring change in an organism's behavior based on experience.\" This seems more accurate. Learning should lead to a lasting change in behavior because of some experience. This sounds like a solid definition.\n\nOption C: \"The sole result of classical and operant conditioning.\" Now, classical and operant conditioning are definitely types of learning, but are they the only ways learning occurs? I don't think so. There's also observational learning, latent learning, and maybe others. So, saying it's the sole result seems too narrow.\n\nOption D: \"The association of experiences due to their occurrence in close proximity.\" This sounds like it's describing associative learning, which is a part of learning, but again, it might not cover all aspects of learning. It's too specific, perhaps.\n\nComparing all these, option B seems the most comprehensive and accurate. It talks about an enduring change based on experience, which covers a broad range of learning types, not just conditioning.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
