Tremor, executive dysfunction, and rigidity\n\nB. Tremor, rigidity, and gait imbalance\n\nC. Tremor, gait imbalance, and paresis\n\nD. Tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what the classic symptoms of Parkinson's are. I know that Parkinson's is a neurodegenerative disorder, and it affects movement. From what I recall, tremor is a big one, especially the resting tremor where people's hands shake when they're not using them. Rigidity is another one, where muscles get stiff and resist movement. And then there's bradykinesia, which is slowness of movement.\n\nSo, option D has tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which matches what I remember. But let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A has tremor, executive dysfunction, and rigidity. Now, executive dysfunction is more related to cognitive issues, like planning and organizing, which can be part of Parkinson's disease, especially in later stages, but it's not considered part of the classic motor triad.\n\nOption B has tremor, rigidity, and gait imbalance. Gait imbalance can be a symptom in Parkinson's, as people have trouble with balance and posture, but again, I think bradykinesia is more central to the classic triad.\n\nOption C has tremor, gait imbalance, and paresis. Paresis is muscle weakness, which can occur in Parkinson's, but again, it's not part of the core motor symptoms that define the disease.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option D is the correct answer. But to be thorough, maybe I should look up the classic triad of symptoms for Parkinson's disease.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that the classic motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are indeed tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. These are often referred to as the cardinal symptoms of the disease.\n\nTremor is the shaking that often starts in one hand and can spread to other parts of the body. It's usually a resting tremor, meaning it's more prominent when the body is at rest.\n\nRigidity is the stiffness in muscles, which can lead to reduced range of motion and discomfort.\n\nBradykinesia is the slowness of movement, which can make everyday tasks more difficult and lead to a general reduction in spontaneous movement.\n\nGait imbalance and executive dysfunction can occur in Parkinson's but are not part of the classic triad.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
