                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I sold exotic wild animals at the farmer's market.\"\n\nSelling exotic wild animals can be considered morally wrong for several reasons. Firstly, it may involve taking animals from their natural habitats, which can disrupt ecosystems and contribute to species endangerment. Secondly, the treatment and conditions these animals are subjected to during capture, transport, and sale can be inhumane. Additionally, selling exotic animals can lead to public health risks and potential harm to the animals once they are in the possession of buyers who may not have the knowledge or resources to care for them properly. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, this action is likely to be seen as wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I was able to cloak my new discovery that I found while working late.\"\n\nThis scenario is a bit vague, but \"cloaking\" a discovery could imply hiding or concealing it. If this discovery belongs to the employer and the individual is obligated to report it, then concealing it could be considered morally wrong, as it involves dishonesty and potentially breaking trust with the employer. However, if the discovery was made independently and belongs to the individual, cloaking it might not be morally wrong, unless it involves harmful or unethical practices.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in Scenario 2, it's challenging to definitively label it as wrong or not wrong without more context. However, based on the information provided, it doesn't necessarily seem morally wrong in the same way that Scenario 1 does.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut, considering that Scenario 2 might involve dishonesty depending on the context, some might argue it's also wrong. However, based on the provided information and ordinary moral standards, selling exotic wild animals is clearly wrong, whereas cloaking a discovery isn't necessarily so.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
