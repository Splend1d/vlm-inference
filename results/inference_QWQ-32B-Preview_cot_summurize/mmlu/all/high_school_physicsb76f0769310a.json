                    "text": "So I have this problem here about a particle moving in a uniform electric field. Let me see if I can figure this out. The particle has mass m, charge Q, and initial velocity V. It's moving towards an electric field of strength E, and it travels a distance d. Now, the question is, if I double the original velocity to 2V and cut the mass in half to m/2, how far will the particle travel? The options are 4d, 2d, d, or d/2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distance traveled depends on these parameters. I know that in an electric field, a charged particle experiences a force given by F = Q * E. This force will cause an acceleration, since F = m * a, so a = Q * E / m.\n\nOkay, so the acceleration is proportional to the charge and the electric field strength, and inversely proportional to the mass.\n\nNow, I need to find out how the distance traveled relates to the initial velocity and the acceleration. I remember there's a kinematic equation that relates distance, initial velocity, acceleration, and time. Specifically, d = V * t + (1/2) * a * t^2, where t is the time of travel.\n\nBut in this case, the particle is moving towards the electric field, so I assume it's decelerating, right? Because the electric field is opposing its motion. Wait, actually, it depends on the direction of the electric field and the sign of the charge. But for simplicity, let's assume the electric field is opposing the motion, so it's decelerating.\n\nSo, if it's decelerating, eventually it will come to a stop. So, the final velocity is zero. Maybe I can use the kinematic equation that relates velocity, acceleration, and distance, without time involved.\n\nV_f^2 = V_i^2 + 2 * a * d\n\nSince the final velocity is zero, 0 = V^2 + 2 * a * d, so d = -V^2 / (2 * a)\n\nBut acceleration a is Q * E / m, so d = -V^2 / (2 * (Q * E / m)) = -V^2 * m / (2 * Q * E)\n\nThe negative sign might indicate direction, but since we're interested in the magnitude of the distance, I can ignore the sign for now.\n\nSo, d = V^2 * m / (2 * Q * E)\n\nNow, the problem asks what happens to d if V is doubled to 2V and m is halved to m/2.\n\nLet's plug in the new values:\n\nd' = (2V)^2 * (m/2) / (2 * Q * E) = (4 * V^2) * (m/2) / (2 * Q * E) = (4/2) * V^2 * m / (2 * Q * E) = 2 * V^2 * m / (2 * Q * E) = V^2 * m / Q * E\n\nWait, hold on. Let's check that calculation again.\n\nd' = (2V)^2 * (m/2) / (2 * Q * E)\n\nFirst, (2V)^2 = 4 * V^2\n\nThen, m/2 is the new mass.\n\nSo, d' = 4 * V^2 * (m/2) / (2 * Q * E) = (4 * m * V^2 / 2) / (2 * Q * E) = (2 * m * V^2) / (2 * Q * E) = m * V^2 / Q * E\n\nWait, that seems familiar. Looking back at the original d = V^2 * m / (2 * Q * E), and now d' = m * V^2 / Q * E, which is twice the original d.\n\nSo, d' = 2 * d\n\nTherefore, the particle will travel twice the distance, which is option B. 2d.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nOriginal d = V^2 * m / (2 * Q * E)\n\nNew d' = (2V)^2 * (m/2) / (2 * Q * E) = 4 * V^2 * (m/2) / (2 * Q * E) = (4/2) * V^2 * m / (2 * Q * E) = 2 * V^2 * m / (2 * Q * E) = V^2 * m / Q * E\n\nWait, but the original d has V^2 * m / (2 * Q * E), so d' is indeed twice d.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of energy, the kinetic energy is (1/2) * m * V^2. The work done by the electric field is F * d = Q * E * d, and this equals the change in kinetic energy.\n\nSo, Q * E * d = (1/2) * m * V^2\n\nTherefore, d = (m * V^2) / (2 * Q * E)\n\nAgain, if V is doubled and m is halved, d' = (m/2) * (4 * V^2) / (2 * Q * E) = (4/2) * (m * V^2) / (2 * Q * E) = 2 * d\n\nSo, it confirms that the new distance is twice the original distance.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 2d.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
