                    "text": "So I have this problem here: the graph of the equation \\( x + 2y + 3 = 0 \\) is perpendicular to the graph of \\( ax + 2y + 3 = 0 \\), and I need to find the value of \\( a \\). The options are A. -4, B. -13, C. -9, D. -15. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1. So, if I can find the slopes of both lines, then set their product equal to -1, I should be able to solve for \\( a \\).\n\nAlright, let's find the slope of the first line, \\( x + 2y + 3 = 0 \\). I think I should rearrange this equation into the slope-intercept form, which is \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope.\n\nSo, starting with \\( x + 2y + 3 = 0 \\), I'll solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\( 2y = -x - 3 \\)\n\n\\( y = -\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} \\)\n\nSo, the slope \\( m_1 \\) of the first line is \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nNow, let's do the same for the second equation, \\( ax + 2y + 3 = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 2y = -ax - 3 \\)\n\n\\( y = -\\frac{a}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} \\)\n\nSo, the slope \\( m_2 \\) of the second line is \\( -\\frac{a}{2} \\).\n\nAccording to the perpendicular lines condition, \\( m_1 \\times m_2 = -1 \\). Plugging in the slopes:\n\n\\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\times -\\frac{a}{2} = -1 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( \\frac{a}{4} = -1 \\)\n\nNow, solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = -1 \\times 4 \\)\n\n\\( a = -4 \\)\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, and according to my calculation, \\( a = -4 \\), which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut let me double-check if I did everything correctly. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for two lines to be perpendicular, the coefficients of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in their general forms should satisfy a certain condition. Specifically, if the first line is \\( a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 = 0 \\) and the second is \\( a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 = 0 \\), then the lines are perpendicular if \\( a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2 = 0 \\).\n\nLet me try applying this formula to see if I get the same answer.\n\nFor the first line, \\( x + 2y + 3 = 0 \\), so \\( a_1 = 1 \\), \\( b_1 = 2 \\).\n\nFor the second line, \\( ax + 2y + 3 = 0 \\), so \\( a_2 = a \\), \\( b_2 = 2 \\).\n\nNow, set \\( a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2 = 0 \\):\n\n\\( (1)(a) + (2)(2) = 0 \\)\n\n\\( a + 4 = 0 \\)\n\n\\( a = -4 \\)\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. So, regardless of the method I use, I get \\( a = -4 \\).\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the correct answer is A. -4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-4} \\]"
