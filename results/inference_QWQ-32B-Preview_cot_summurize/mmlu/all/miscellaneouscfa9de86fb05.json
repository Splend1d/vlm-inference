Lemon juice is acidic, not basic, so this can't be right.\n\nB. 2 - That sounds about right. I know that lemon juice is acidic, and a pH of 2 is quite acidic.\n\nC. 7 - That's neutral, like water. Lemon juice shouldn't be neutral.\n\nD. 0 - That's extremely acidic, almost as acidic as pure acid. I don't think lemon juice is that acidic.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. 2. But let me double-check.\n\nI recall that the pH scale goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Anything below 7 is acidic, and anything above 7 is basic.\n\nLemons are citrus fruits, and citrus fruits are known for their acidity. The pH of lemon juice is typically around 2 to 3. So, pH 2 seems appropriate.\n\nWait a minute, option D is 0, which is the most acidic possible, but lemon juice isn't that acidic. It's definitely not as acidic as pure acid.\n\nAlso, option A is 14, which is the most basic, which doesn't make sense for lemon juice.\n\nOption C is 7, which is neutral, and lemon juice is definitely not neutral.\n\nSo, again, B. 2 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
