The question is asking which theory or theories Feinberg is refuting with his distinction between two different senses of pleasure. The options are psychological egoism, psychological egoistic hedonism, ethical egoism, or all of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means:\n\n1. **Psychological Egoism**: This is the view that humans are always motivated by their own self-interest. It's a descriptive claim about how people actually behave.\n\n2. **Psychological Egoistic Hedonism**: This seems to be a more specific version of psychological egoism, where the self-interest is specifically about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain.\n\n3. **Ethical Egoism**: This is a normative theory that claims that actions are morally right if they promote one's own self-interest.\n\nNow, Feinberg is making a distinction between two different senses of pleasure. I recall that in his work, he discusses the difference between \"pleasure\" as a sensation and \"pleasure\" as a broader concept that includes things like satisfaction or fulfillment.\n\nLet me think about how this distinction might be used to refute these theories.\n\n**Refuting Psychological Egoism**:\n\nPsychological egoism claims that all human actions are motivated by self-interest. If Feinberg can show that there are instances where people act for reasons other than their own pleasure or satisfaction, that could challenge psychological egoism.\n\n**Refuting Psychological Egoistic Hedonism**:\n\nThis is even more specific, focusing on pleasure and pain as the motivators. If Feinberg can demonstrate that there are other factors that motivate people beyond just seeking pleasure, that would directly contradict this theory.\n\n**Refuting Ethical Egoism**:\n\nEthical egoism is a normative theory about what one ought to do, namely, act in their own self-interest. Feinberg's distinction between types of pleasure might not directly refute ethical egoism, which is about what is morally right, not about how people actually behave.\n\nWait, but perhaps by showing that pleasure can be understood in different ways, Feinberg might be arguing that ethical egoism is based on a misunderstanding of what pleasure is or can be.\n\nLet me consider this more carefully.\n\nIf Feinberg distinguishes between hedonic pleasure (sensory pleasure) and higher pleasures (like intellectual satisfaction), he might be arguing that ethical egoism is too narrow if it only considers hedonic pleasure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he's arguing that the concept of pleasure is too malleable or subjective to form the basis of a coherent ethical theory.\n\nBut I need to focus on which of these theories he is refuting with his distinction.\n\nGiven that psychological egoism and psychological egoistic hedonism are descriptive claims about human motivation, and ethical egoism is a normative theory, perhaps Feinberg's distinction is more relevant to the descriptive claims.\n\nLet me look back at the question: \"Feinberg takes his remarks about the two different senses of pleasure to refute:\"\n\nThe phrasing suggests that his distinction is used to argue against certain theories.\n\nGiven that psychological egoism and psychological egoistic hedonism are both descriptive theories about human motivation, and ethical egoism is a normative theory, it's possible that Feinberg is targeting the descriptive theories.\n\nBut the question includes the option \"all of the above,\" so perhaps his distinction challenges all three.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the context in which Feinberg makes this distinction.\n\nIn his work, Feinberg often discusses the nature of pleasure and its role in ethical theories, particularly in utilitarianism. He might be arguing that the concept of pleasure is too ambiguous to serve as the foundation for ethical egoism or other ethical theories.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he's arguing that there are different types of pleasures, and that some are more valuable than others, which could challenge the idea that maximizing one's own pleasure is always the right thing to do.\n\nBut I need to connect this directly to the theories listed in the options.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Psychological Egoism: If Feinberg can show that people are motivated by things other than their own pleasure, that would undermine psychological egoism.\n\nB. Psychological Egoistic Hedonism: This is a stronger claim, specifying that motivation is based on seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. If Feinberg can demonstrate that people are motivated by other factors, this would be refuted.\n\nC. Ethical Egoism: This is a normative theory stating that one ought to act in their own self-interest. Feinberg's distinction might challenge this by showing that self-interest is not uniformly defined by pleasure, or that there are different kinds of pleasures with varying moral significance.\n\nD. All of the above: This would mean that his distinction refutes all three theories.\n\nGiven that psychological egoism and psychological egoistic hedonism are descriptive claims about human behavior, and ethical egoism is a normative claim about what one ought to do, it's possible that Feinberg's distinction affects both types of theories.\n\nHowever, his main target is likely the descriptive claims, as understanding the nature of pleasure is crucial for those theories.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose Feinberg argues that there are different kinds of pleasures, some of which are more aligned with altruistic or moral behaviors. If that's the case, then psychological egoism might be challenged because people could be seeking higher pleasures that involve helping others, which isn't purely self-interested.\n\nSimilarly, psychological egoistic hedonism might be refuted if not all pleasures are solely focused on personal satisfaction.\n\nAs for ethical egoism, if Feinberg shows that some pleasures have greater value when they benefit others, that could challenge the notion that self-interest is the sole moral compass.\n\nTherefore, it seems that his distinction could potentially refute all three theories.\n\nBut perhaps the question is expecting a more specific answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distinction is only directly relevant to the descriptive theories, and not to ethical egoism.\n\nWait, ethical egoism is a normative theory, and Feinberg's distinction might be more about the descriptive aspects of pleasure.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is B, psychological egoistic hedonism, because it specifically ties motivation to pleasure and pain.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that he is refuting these theories with his distinction between two senses of pleasure.\n\nLet me consider that he might be arguing that there are different kinds of pleasures, and that some of them are not self-interested, which would directly challenge psychological egoistic hedonism.\n\nAlternatively, he might be arguing that pleasure can be derived from altruistic actions, which would again challenge the idea that all motivations are self-interested.\n\nIn that case, both psychological egoism and psychological egoistic hedonism would be refuted.\n\nBut ethical egoism is a normative theory, so even if not all actions are motivated by self-interest, ethical egoism could still hold that one ought to act in their self-interest.\n\nTherefore, Feinberg's distinction might not directly refute ethical egoism.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is D, all of the above, because his distinction challenges the understanding of pleasure in all these theories.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's C, ethical egoism, if he's arguing that pleasure isn't solely about self-interest, and therefore ethical egoism is misguided.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to think of it this way: if Feinberg distinguishes between different types of pleasure, and shows that some pleasures are not self-interested, that would undermine psychological egoism and psychological egoistic hedonism by showing that people can be motivated by non-self-interested pleasures.\n\nAs for ethical egoism, if it's based on the idea of maximizing one's own pleasure, and if pleasure can include things like the satisfaction of helping others, then perhaps ethical egoism can accommodate that.\n\nAlternatively, if Feinberg argues that some pleasures are more valuable when they are not self-interested, that could challenge ethical egoism by suggesting that self-interest isn't the highest good.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that his distinction could potentially refute all three theories, but perhaps the most direct target is psychological egoistic hedonism.\n\nHowever, since the question allows for \"all of the above,\" and given that his distinction might impact all three theories in different ways, maybe D is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be precise, I need to recall Feinberg's actual arguments.\n\nUnfortunately, without direct access to Feinberg's text, I have to make an educated guess based on my understanding of his likely position.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is D, all of the above, because his distinction between different senses of pleasure could challenge the foundations of psychological egoism, psychological egoistic hedonism, and ethical egoism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD. all of the above."
