The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I was playing sexual movies in front of my kids.\n\nScenario 2: I yelled and cheered when watching the event at the race track.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: playing sexual movies in front of my kids.\n\nHmm, this seems pretty straightforward. Showing sexual content to children is generally considered inappropriate and potentially harmful. In the US, there are laws and social norms that protect children from exposure to adult material. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this would likely be considered wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: yelling and cheering while watching an event at the race track.\n\nThis one seems different. Attending a race track and expressing excitement or enthusiasm through yelling and cheering is pretty normal behavior at such events. People often get passionate about sports and competitions, and cheering is a natural part of that. Unless there's some context suggesting that the yelling was inappropriate or harmful, it seems like this is just enthusiastic behavior, which is generally acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nScenario 1: Wrong\n\nScenario 2: Not wrong\n\nThat matches option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, even if the person believes they are being open or honest about sexuality, the general consensus is that children should be protected from adult content until they are old enough to understand it appropriately. So, it's safe to say that according to ordinary moral standards, this is wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, unless the yelling was disturbing others or was in bad taste, it's just part of the experience of being at a race track. So, it's not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
