                    "text": "So I've got this question here about animal cells and osmosis. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. The cell is permeable to water but not to salts, and it has an internal NaCl concentration of 10%. Then, it's placed in freshwater. I need to figure out what happens to the cell.\n\nFirst things first, I need to remember how osmosis works. Osmosis is the movement of water from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration through a semi-permeable membrane. The solute, in this case, is NaCl.\n\nSo, the cell has a high concentration of NaCl inside\u201410%\u2014and it's placed in freshwater, which has a much lower solute concentration, probably close to zero since it's freshwater.\n\nSince the cell is permeable to water but not to salts, the water will move into the cell to try to equalize the solute concentrations on both sides of the membrane. Because the inside of the cell has more solute, water will move in to dilute it.\n\nNow, if a lot of water moves into the cell, what happens? The cell will swell because it's taking in more water. If it swells too much, it might burst. I think that's called lysing.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Plasmolyze\u2014 I think that's when a cell loses water and the plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall, but that's in plants, right? So, probably not applicable here since it's an animal cell.\n\nB. Swell and eventually lyse\u2014 That sounds plausible based on what I just thought.\n\nC. Endocytose water into a large central vacuole\u2014 Animal cells don't have central vacuoles; that's more of a plant cell feature. So, probably not.\n\nD. Shrivel\u2014 That would happen if the cell lost water, but in this case, it's gaining water.\n\nSo, it seems like the correct answer is B. Swell and eventually lyse.\n\nBut let me double-check. The cell is in freshwater, which has less solute than the cell's interior. Water moves into the cell to balance the solute concentrations. Since the cell can't get rid of the excess water and it's not flexible enough to handle too much expansion, it might burst.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I think B is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
