                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about sex ratios in species. It says that when there are imbalances in the sex ratio, like not exactly 50:50, the minority sex often gets more care and resources from parents. And we need to pick which type of selection this is an example of from the options: sexual selection, disruptive selection, balancing selection, or frequency-dependent selection.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these selections means.\n\nSexual selection is when certain traits become more common because they give an advantage in mating, like being more attractive to the opposite sex or being able to compete better for mates.\n\nDisruptive selection is when extreme traits are favored over intermediate ones. So, individuals with very high or very low values of a trait have higher fitness than those with average traits.\n\nBalancing selection is when selection acts to maintain multiple variants of a trait in a population. This can happen through mechanisms like heterozygote advantage or frequency-dependent selection.\n\nFrequency-dependent selection is a type of selection where the fitness of a phenotype depends on its frequency in the population. So, if a trait becomes too common, it might become less fit, and vice versa.\n\nNow, back to the question. It's about parents giving more care and resources to the minority sex when the sex ratio is imbalanced. So, if there are fewer males, for example, parents might invest more in their male offspring.\n\nThis seems like it could be related to frequency-dependent selection because the amount of care and resources depends on the frequency of the sex in the population. The rarer sex gets more investment, which could affect their survival and reproduction rates.\n\nLet me think about sexual selection. While sexual selection can lead to differences in investment in males and females, it's more about traits that affect mating success rather than the sex ratio itself.\n\nDisruptive selection doesn't seem to fit here because it's about selecting for extreme traits, not about sex ratios.\n\nBalancing selection maintains multiple variants, which could include maintaining a certain sex ratio, but frequency-dependent selection is a mechanism that can lead to balancing selection.\n\nGiven that the care and resources depend on the frequency of the sex in the population, frequency-dependent selection seems like the most direct answer.\n\nBut wait, balancing selection is often maintained by frequency-dependent selection, so there might be some overlap here.\n\nPerhaps it's both, but since the question asks for the most clear example, and frequency-dependent selection directly relates to the frequency of the trait affecting its fitness, I think frequency-dependent selection is the best answer.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nMaybe parents invest more in the minority sex because those offspring have a higher chance of finding mates. If there are fewer males, for example, each male has a higher chance of reproducing, so investing more in them makes sense.\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of local resource competition, where the rarity of a phenotype affects its fitness.\n\nYes, that sounds like frequency-dependent selection.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. frequency-dependent selection.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why it's not the other options.\n\nSexual selection is about traits that influence mating success, but in this case, it's about parental investment based on sex ratio, which is slightly different.\n\nDisruptive selection is about favoring extreme traits, which isn't directly related to sex ratios.\n\nBalancing selection maintains variation, which could include maintaining a certain sex ratio, but again, frequency-dependent selection is more directly related to the frequency of traits affecting fitness.\n\nTherefore, frequency-dependent selection is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
