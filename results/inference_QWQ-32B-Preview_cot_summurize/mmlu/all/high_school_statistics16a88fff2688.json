                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about electronic parts and their lifespans. It says that 60% of these parts last over 3 years, and 70% last less than 6 years. And we're supposed to assume that the lifespans follow a normal distribution. I need to find the mean and standard deviation based on this information.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that in a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. The empirical rule tells us that about 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations. But here, I have specific percentages given for certain values, so I'll need to use z-scores to find the mean and standard deviation.\n\nLet me denote the mean by \u03bc and the standard deviation by \u03c3.\n\nGiven:\n\n- P(X > 3) = 60%, which is the same as P(X \u2264 3) = 40%\n\n- P(X < 6) = 70%\n\nSo, I can use these probabilities to find the z-scores corresponding to X = 3 and X = 6.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nI need to find z such that:\n\nFor X = 3: P(Z \u2264 z1) = 40%\n\nFor X = 6: P(Z \u2264 z2) = 70%\n\nI can look up these probabilities in the standard normal distribution table to find the corresponding z-scores.\n\nLooking up P(Z \u2264 z) = 0.40, I find that z1 \u2248 -0.253\n\nSimilarly, for P(Z \u2264 z) = 0.70, z2 \u2248 0.524\n\nNow, I can set up two equations based on the z-score formula:\n\n1) -0.253 = (3 - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\n2) 0.524 = (6 - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nI have two equations with two unknowns (\u03bc and \u03c3). I can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \u03bc and \u03c3.\n\nLet me rearrange both equations to express them in terms of \u03bc:\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n-0.253\u03c3 = 3 - \u03bc\n\n=> \u03bc = 3 + 0.253\u03c3\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n0.524\u03c3 = 6 - \u03bc\n\n=> \u03bc = 6 - 0.524\u03c3\n\nNow, set both expressions for \u03bc equal to each other:\n\n3 + 0.253\u03c3 = 6 - 0.524\u03c3\n\nNow, solve for \u03c3:\n\n0.253\u03c3 + 0.524\u03c3 = 6 - 3\n\n0.777\u03c3 = 3\n\n\u03c3 = 3 / 0.777\n\n\u03c3 \u2248 3.861\n\nNow, plug this value of \u03c3 back into one of the expressions for \u03bc. I'll use the first one:\n\n\u03bc = 3 + 0.253 * 3.861\n\n\u03bc \u2248 3 + 0.977\n\n\u03bc \u2248 3.977\n\nSo, the mean is approximately 3.977 years, and the standard deviation is approximately 3.861 years.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \u03bc = 3.677, \u03c3 = 3.561\n\nB. \u03bc = 3.977, \u03c3 = 3.861\n\nC. \u03bc = 4.177, \u03c3 = 3.561\n\nD. \u03bc = 4.377, \u03c3 = 3.261\n\nOption B matches our calculations.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, the z-scores:\n\nFor P(Z \u2264 z) = 0.40, z1 \u2248 -0.253\n\nFor P(Z \u2264 z) = 0.70, z2 \u2248 0.524\n\nThen, the equations:\n\n-0.253 = (3 - \u03bc)/\u03c3\n\n0.524 = (6 - \u03bc)/\u03c3\n\nSolving for \u03bc:\n\nFrom equation 1: \u03bc = 3 + 0.253\u03c3\n\nFrom equation 2: \u03bc = 6 - 0.524\u03c3\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n3 + 0.253\u03c3 = 6 - 0.524\u03c3\n\n0.253\u03c3 + 0.524\u03c3 = 6 - 3\n\n0.777\u03c3 = 3\n\n\u03c3 = 3 / 0.777 \u2248 3.861\n\nThen, \u03bc = 3 + 0.253 * 3.861 \u2248 3 + 0.977 \u2248 3.977\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be option B.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem or if I made any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the properties of the normal distribution and the given percentages to set up the equations differently.\n\nFor example, since 60% last over 3 years, that means 40% last 3 years or less. Similarly, 70% last less than 6 years.\n\nSo, I can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution to relate these probabilities to the z-scores.\n\nI think I've done it correctly by converting the probabilities to z-scores and then solving for \u03bc and \u03c3.\n\nAnother way could be to use the inverse normal function on a calculator or lookup table to find the z-scores corresponding to the given cumulative probabilities.\n\nYes, that's what I did.\n\nLet me check the z-scores again:\n\nFor 40% , z \u2248 -0.253\n\nFor 70%, z \u2248 0.524\n\nThese seem correct based on standard normal distribution tables.\n\nThen, setting up the equations:\n\n-0.253 = (3 - \u03bc)/\u03c3\n\n0.524 = (6 - \u03bc)/\u03c3\n\nSolving these simultaneously, I get \u03bc \u2248 3.977 and \u03c3 \u2248 3.861, which matches option B.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\mu = 3.977, \\ \\sigma = 3.861} \\]"
