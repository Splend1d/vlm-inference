He's associated with deontological ethics, focusing on duties rather than consequences.\n\nSo, prima facie duties\u2014what does that mean? Prima facie means 'at first glance' or 'on the surface,' so prima facie duties are duties that appear to be obligatory at first glance, but they might not be absolutely binding once all factors are considered.\n\nRoss seems to believe that there are these self-evident moral principles that tell us about our duties. He calls them self-evident propositions. So, maybe option B is correct: our prima facie duties are self-evident.\n\nBut let me make sure. If they are self-evident, does that mean they can be proven? Well, self-evident truths don't necessarily require proof beyond understanding them. So, option A says they can be proven, but perhaps that's not the best fit because self-evident truths are more about intuition and rational insight rather than proof.\n\nOption C says they cannot be known. That doesn't seem right because Ross argues that we can know these duties through intuition.\n\nOption D says they are not objective. But Ross was a proponent of objectivity in ethics; he believed in objective moral truths.\n\nSo, weighing these options, B seems the most accurate: our prima facie duties are self-evident according to Ross.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up Ross's ethics quickly to confirm.\n\n[Simulates looking up information]\n\nOkay, W.D. Ross did propose a ethical theory based on prima facie duties, which he believed were self-evident moral propositions. He argued that these duties are known through intuition, and they include things like fidelity (keeping promises), reparation (making up for harms), gratitude, justice, beneficence, self-improvement, and non-maleficence (not harming others).\n\nHe didn't claim that these duties are absolutely binding in every situation; sometimes duties can conflict, and in such cases, we need to use moral judgment to decide which duty takes precedence.\n\nSo, given that, his view is that these duties are self-evident, meaning that upon reflection, reasonable people would accept them as morally binding.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: are self-evident.\n\nOptions A, C, and D don't align with Ross's philosophy as I recall it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
