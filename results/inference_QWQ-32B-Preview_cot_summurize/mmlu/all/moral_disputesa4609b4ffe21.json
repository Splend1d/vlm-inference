Aquinas identifies several such goods, including human life, human procreation, and human sociability.\n\nHuman life is considered an intrinsic good because it is valuable in itself, and preserving and promoting life is a fundamental moral obligation. Human procreation is also regarded as an intrinsic good because it is essential for the continuation of the human species and for the fulfillment of human nature. Human sociability, or the natural inclination of humans to live in communities and form social bonds, is another intrinsic good, as it allows for the development of virtues and the attainment of the common good.\n\nTherefore, according to Aquinas's natural law theory, all of the above options\u2014human life, human procreation, and human sociability\u2014are basic intrinsic goods.\n\nSo, the answer is D. all of the above."
