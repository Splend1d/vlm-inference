                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Descartes' views on physical things. The question is: \"Descartes says that the chief characteristic of physical things is that _____.\" And the options are:\n\nA. they cannot be measured\n\nB. science can study them\n\nC. they do not have extension\n\nD. they have extension\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what Descartes believed about physical objects. I remember that Descartes was a rationalist philosopher who made a distinction between the mind and the body, which is known as dualism. He thought that the mind is a non-physical thing, while the body is physical.\n\nNow, regarding physical things, Descartes had some specific ideas about their fundamental properties. I think he associated physical objects with certain characteristics that define them as physical.\n\nLet me think about option D first, which says \"they have extension.\" Extension refers to the property of taking up space, having length, width, and height. Descartes did consider extension to be the principal attribute of material substances. In his view, the essence of physical things is their spatial dimensions and their capacity to occupy space.\n\nOption C says \"they do not have extension.\" But that directly contradicts what I just thought about Descartes' view, so I doubt this is correct.\n\nOption A says \"they cannot be measured.\" But if physical things have extension, which is a measurable property, then they can be measured. So this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says \"science can study them.\" While it's true that science studies physical things, I don't think Descartes would consider this their chief characteristic. He might agree with this, but I don't recall him stating that as the main defining feature.\n\nLet me double-check what Descartes actually said about physical objects. In his metaphysics, Descartes identified two main kinds of substances: thinking substances (minds) and extended substances (bodies). So, for physical things, their essence is extension.\n\nIn his \"Principles of Philosophy,\" Descartes writes that material substance is characterized by extension, and he defines it in terms of its spatial properties.\n\nTherefore, the chief characteristic of physical things, according to Descartes, is that they have extension.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. They have extension.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A: \"they cannot be measured.\" But extension is something that can be measured; length, width, height are all measurable quantities. So, this doesn't make sense.\n\nOption B: \"science can study them.\" While science does study physical objects, Descartes' chief characteristic for physical things is their extension, not the fact that science studies them.\n\nOption C: \"they do not have extension.\" This is contrary to Descartes' view, as he explicitly states that extension is the essence of material substances.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is D: they have extension.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
