                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a man who works as a clerk in a gourmet coffee shop. His friend comes by to chat when there are no customers around. One day, the man needs to use the bathroom and asks his friend to watch the store while he's gone. The friend agrees. While the man is in the bathroom, a customer comes in wanting to buy some freshly ground coffee. The shop has a grinding machine, and the customer picks a bag of beans to grind.\n\nThe customer isn't sure how to operate the machine, so she asks the friend for help. The friend tries to assist but doesn't know how the machine works properly and gives her wrong instructions. As a result, the customer gets her finger pinched and cut by the machine.\n\nNow, the question is, if the customer sues the coffee shop company for her injury, will she most likely prevail? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nOption A says she will prevail because the company would be vicariously liable for the man's unauthorized actions.\n\nOption B says she will prevail because the friend's negligence would be imputed to the company.\n\nOption C says she won't prevail because the man acted outside the scope of his employment by entrusting the shop to his friend.\n\nOption D says she won't prevail because the company isn't liable for the friend's negligence.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about agency and vicarious liability here. Vicarious liability generally means that one party is held liable for the actions of another party. In the context of employment, employers can be held vicariously liable for the negligent acts of their employees committed during the scope of their employment.\n\nFirst, I need to determine whether the friend is an agent of the company. The friend is not an employee; he's just a pal of the clerk. The clerk asked him to watch the store temporarily while he used the bathroom, but this doesn't make the friend an agent of the company. Agency requires that the principal (the company) has control over the agent's actions, and there's a relationship where the agent is authorized to act on behalf of the principal.\n\nIn this case, the clerk, who is an employee, asked his friend to watch the store, but he doesn't have the authority to make his friend an agent of the company. So, the friend's actions wouldn't be imputed to the company unless there's some other reason to believe he was acting within the company's authority.\n\nGiven that, option B might not be correct because the friend isn't an agent whose negligence would be imputed to the company.\n\nOption A mentions vicarious liability for the man's unauthorized actions. The man is an employee, but his action of asking his friend to watch the store might be unauthorized. If it's outside the scope of his employment, then perhaps the company isn't liable for that action.\n\nOption C suggests that the man acted outside the scope of his employment by entrusting the shop to his friend, hence the customer won't prevail. This seems plausible because if the employee's action is outside his duties, the company might not be liable for it.\n\nOption D says the company isn't liable for the friend's negligence, which aligns with the earlier thought that the friend isn't an agent of the company.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's any other basis for liability. Maybe premises liability, where the company is responsible for ensuring the safety of its premises and its equipment.\n\nThe grinding machine is in the store, and customers are expected to use it. If there are risks associated with its use, the company might have a duty to ensure that proper instructions are given or that the machine is safe to use.\n\nIn this scenario, the friend, who isn't trained or authorized, gave incorrect instructions, leading to the injury. One could argue that the company is liable for failing to supervise or ensure that only authorized personnel provide assistance with the machine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company could be liable under respondeat superior if the employee's request for help is considered part of his employment duties. But since the friend isn't an employee, that might not hold.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at it differently. The employee stepped away temporarily and asked his friend to watch the store. If the company has a policy allowing employees to have friends watch the store, then perhaps the friend could be considered a temporary agent.\n\nBut in this case, it seems like the employee acted on his own accord, without authorization, to have his friend watch the store.\n\nGiven that, option C seems most appropriate: the man acted outside the scope of his employment by entrusting the shop to his friend, so the company isn't liable for what happened.\n\nOption D also suggests no liability due to the friend's negligence, which aligns with the earlier thoughts.\n\nBetween C and D, I think C is better because it specifies why there's no liability: the employee acted outside his scope of employment.\n\nOption B is tempting because it mentions imputation of negligence, but since the friend isn't an agent of the company, his negligence wouldn't be imputed to the company.\n\nOption A mentions vicarious liability for unauthorized actions, but vicarious liability typically requires that the actions be within the scope of employment, even if unauthorized.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is C: the customer will not prevail because the man acted outside the scope of employment by entrusting the supervision of the shop to his friend.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
