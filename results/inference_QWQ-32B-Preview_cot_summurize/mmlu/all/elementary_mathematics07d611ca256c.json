                    "text": "So Stephanie flew from Los Angeles to New York City, and the distance was 2,448 miles. The question is asking me to round that number to the nearest thousand miles. I need to pick the correct option among A. 2,000, B. 2,400, C. 2,500, and D. 3,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"rounding to the nearest thousand\" means. When we round a number to the nearest thousand, we look at the digit in the thousands place and decide whether to keep it the same or round it up based on the digit in the hundreds place.\n\nIn this case, the number is 2,448. The digit in the thousands place is 2, and the digit in the hundreds place is 4.\n\nThe rule for rounding is that if the hundreds digit is 5 or greater, we round up the thousands digit by one. If it's less than 5, we keep the thousands digit the same.\n\nHere, the hundreds digit is 4, which is less than 5. So, we should keep the thousands digit as 2 and round down.\n\nThat means 2,448 miles rounded to the nearest thousand is 2,000 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 2,000, B is 2,400, C is 2,500, and D is 3,000.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. 2,000.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I misunderstood the rounding.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how close 2,448 is to 2,000 compared to 3,000.\n\n2,448 minus 2,000 is 448 miles.\n\n3,000 minus 2,448 is 552 miles.\n\nSince 448 is less than 552, 2,448 is closer to 2,000 than to 3,000.\n\nTherefore, rounding to the nearest thousand would indeed be 2,000.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that 2,448 is closer to 2,500, but the question specifically says \"nearest thousand,\" not \"nearest hundred.\"\n\nLooking back at the options, B is 2,400, which is rounding to the nearest hundred, not thousand.\n\nC is 2,500, which is also not a thousand.\n\nD is 3,000, which is too high.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 2,000.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
