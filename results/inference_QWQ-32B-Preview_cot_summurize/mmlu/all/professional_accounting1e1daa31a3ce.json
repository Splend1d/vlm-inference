                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that the market price of Company X is $45 per share and Company Y is $30 per share. Then, Company X is offering three-fourths a share of its common stock for each share of Company Y. I need to find the ratio of exchange of market prices. The options are A) 0.667, B) 1, C) 1.125, D) 1.5.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The ratio of exchange of market prices should compare the market prices of the two companies in relation to the share exchange offer.\n\nCompany X is offering three-fourths (0.75) of its share for each share of Company Y. So, for every share of Y, you get 0.75 shares of X.\n\nThe market price of X is $45 per share, and Y is $30 per share.\n\nI think the ratio of exchange would be the value of the shares being offered by X compared to the value of shares of Y.\n\nSo, for each share of Y ($30), you're getting 0.75 shares of X, which would be 0.75 * $45.\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.75 * 45 = 33.75.\n\nSo, for each $30 share of Y, you're getting $33.75 worth of X.\n\nNow, the ratio of exchange would be the value received from X to the value of Y.\n\nSo, ratio = value of X received / value of Y.\n\nThat would be 33.75 / 30 = 1.125.\n\nWait, but the question says \"ratio of exchange of market prices.\" Is there another way to interpret this?\n\nMaybe I should look at the share exchange ratio directly.\n\nThe share exchange ratio is 0.75 shares of X for 1 share of Y.\n\nSo, the ratio of X shares to Y shares is 0.75:1.\n\nTo find the ratio of their market prices in this exchange, I should consider the market value being exchanged.\n\nSo, the market value given by Y is $30 per share.\n\nThe market value received from X is 0.75 shares * $45 per share = $33.75.\n\nSo, the ratio of exchange is 33.75 / 30 = 1.125.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at it as the ratio of the market prices adjusted by the share exchange ratio.\n\nSo, ratio = (price per share of X / price per share of Y) * (shares of Y / shares of X).\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe ratio of exchange of market prices should reflect how the market prices relate given the share exchange offer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the market prices alone, without considering the share exchange.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the share exchange is part of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the share exchange multiplied by the ratio of the prices.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nShare exchange ratio is 0.75 X shares per Y share.\n\nPrice ratio is $45 / $30 = 1.5.\n\nSo, ratio of exchange of market prices = share exchange ratio * price ratio.\n\nThat would be 0.75 * 1.5 = 1.125.\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the answer should be C) 1.125.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I consider the value received from X per share of Y.\n\nThat's 0.75 * $45 = $33.75.\n\nNow, the market price of Y is $30.\n\nSo, the ratio of value received to value given up is 33.75 / 30 = 1.125.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the inverse, the value given up to value received, it would be 30 / 33.75 \u2248 0.888, but that's not one of the options.\n\nSo, 1.125 seems to be the correct ratio.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C) 1.125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
