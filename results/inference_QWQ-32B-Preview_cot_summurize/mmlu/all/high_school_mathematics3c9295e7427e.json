                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a radioactive isotope. Let me see if I can figure this out. At noon, the experimenter starts with 50 grams of this isotope, and 9 days later, only 45 grams remain. I need to find out how many days after the experiment started there will be only 20 grams left. And I need to round to the nearest day. The options are 54, 59, 60, and 78 days.\n\nFirst, I know that radioactive substances decay exponentially, so the amount left at any time follows an exponential decay formula. The general formula for exponential decay is:\n\n\\[ A(t) = A_0 e^{-kt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A(t) \\) is the amount of substance left after time \\( t \\),\n\n- \\( A_0 \\) is the initial amount,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the decay constant,\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time elapsed.\n\nIn this problem, \\( A_0 = 50 \\) grams, and after 9 days, \\( A(9) = 45 \\) grams. I need to find \\( t \\) when \\( A(t) = 20 \\) grams.\n\nFirst, I need to find the decay constant \\( k \\). I can use the information about the amount after 9 days to set up an equation and solve for \\( k \\).\n\nSo, plugging in the known values:\n\n\\[ 45 = 50 e^{-k \\cdot 9} \\]\n\nI can solve this equation for \\( k \\). Let's see:\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\n\n\\[ \\frac{45}{50} = e^{-9k} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.9 = e^{-9k} \\]\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.9) = \\ln(e^{-9k}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.9) = -9k \\]\n\n\\[ k = -\\frac{\\ln(0.9)}{9} \\]\n\nI can calculate \\( \\ln(0.9) \\). Let me do that.\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.9) \\approx -0.10536 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ k = -\\frac{-0.10536}{9} \\]\n\n\\[ k \\approx 0.011707 \\, \\text{per day} \\]\n\nNow that I have the decay constant, I can use it to find the time \\( t \\) when the amount is 20 grams.\n\nUsing the exponential decay formula again:\n\n\\[ 20 = 50 e^{-0.011707 t} \\]\n\nLet me solve for \\( t \\):\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20}{50} = e^{-0.011707 t} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.4 = e^{-0.011707 t} \\]\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.4) = \\ln(e^{-0.011707 t}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.4) = -0.011707 t \\]\n\n\\[ t = -\\frac{\\ln(0.4)}{0.011707} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\ln(0.4) \\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.4) \\approx -0.91629 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ t = -\\frac{-0.91629}{0.011707} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 78.27 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest day, that's 78 days.\n\nLooking back at the options, 78 days is option D.\n\nWait a minute, but the other options are 54, 59, and 60 days. Maybe I should check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation of \\( k \\).\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ 45 = 50 e^{-9k} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.9 = e^{-9k} \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.9) = -9k \\]\n\n\\[ k = -\\frac{\\ln(0.9)}{9} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, calculating \\( \\ln(0.9) \\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.9) \\approx -0.10536 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ k \\approx 0.011707 \\, \\text{per day} \\]\n\nThat seems fine.\n\nNow, for \\( A(t) = 20 \\):\n\n\\[ 20 = 50 e^{-0.011707 t} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.4 = e^{-0.011707 t} \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.4) = -0.011707 t \\]\n\n\\[ t = -\\frac{\\ln(0.4)}{0.011707} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 78.27 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 78 days, which is option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider using the half-life formula or see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for half-life, but I don't know the half-life of this isotope directly. Maybe I can find the half-life first using the information given.\n\nThe half-life \\( t_{1/2} \\) is related to the decay constant \\( k \\) by:\n\n\\[ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} \\]\n\nBut in this case, I don't know the half-life directly. Maybe it's easier to stick with the exponential decay formula I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up a ratio or use logarithms differently.\n\nLet me try solving it again from the beginning.\n\nGiven:\n\nInitial amount: 50 grams\n\nAfter 9 days: 45 grams\n\nFind time \\( t \\) when amount is 20 grams.\n\nSo, using the exponential decay formula:\n\n\\[ A(t) = A_0 e^{-kt} \\]\n\nFirst, find \\( k \\) using the information at 9 days:\n\n\\[ 45 = 50 e^{-9k} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.9 = e^{-9k} \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.9) = -9k \\]\n\n\\[ k = -\\frac{\\ln(0.9)}{9} \\]\n\nThat's the same as before.\n\nNow, find \\( t \\) when \\( A(t) = 20 \\):\n\n\\[ 20 = 50 e^{-kt} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.4 = e^{-kt} \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.4) = -kt \\]\n\n\\[ t = -\\frac{\\ln(0.4)}{k} \\]\n\n\\[ t = -\\frac{\\ln(0.4)}{-\\frac{\\ln(0.9)}{9}} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{9 \\ln(0.4)}{\\ln(0.9)} \\]\n\nNow, calculating this:\n\nFirst, \\( \\ln(0.4) \\approx -0.91629 \\)\n\n\\( \\ln(0.9) \\approx -0.10536 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{9 \\times (-0.91629)}{-0.10536} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-8.24661}{-0.10536} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 78.27 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use logarithms with a different base.\n\nLet's try using base-10 logarithms.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ 0.4 = e^{-0.011707 t} \\]\n\nTake the natural logarithm or common logarithm. Let's use common logarithm:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(0.4) = \\log_{10}(e^{-0.011707 t}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(0.4) = -0.011707 t \\cdot \\log_{10}(e) \\]\n\nWe know that \\( \\log_{10}(e) \\approx 0.405465 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(0.4) = -0.011707 t \\times 0.405465 \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(0.4) \\approx -0.00474 t \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\log_{10}(0.4) \\approx -0.39794 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ -0.39794 = -0.00474 t \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-0.39794}{-0.00474} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 83.9 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nWait, this is different from what I got earlier. Before, I had approximately 78.27 days, but now I have 83.9 days. That's a significant difference. What did I do wrong here?\n\nLet me check my steps.\n\nI started with:\n\n\\[ 0.4 = e^{-0.011707 t} \\]\n\nThen took the common logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(0.4) = \\log_{10}(e^{-0.011707 t}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(0.4) = -0.011707 t \\cdot \\log_{10}(e) \\]\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nGiven that \\( \\log_{10}(e) \\approx 0.405465 \\), and \\( \\log_{10}(0.4) \\approx -0.39794 \\), then:\n\n\\[ -0.39794 = -0.011707 t \\times 0.405465 \\]\n\n\\[ -0.39794 = -0.00474 t \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-0.39794}{-0.00474} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 83.9 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nBut earlier, using natural logarithms, I got approximately 78.27 days. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nLet me check the calculation using natural logarithms again.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ 0.4 = e^{-0.011707 t} \\]\n\nTake natural logarithm:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.4) = -0.011707 t \\]\n\n\\[ t = -\\frac{\\ln(0.4)}{0.011707} \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.4) \\approx -0.91629 \\]\n\n\\[ t = -\\frac{-0.91629}{0.011707} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 78.27 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, in the common logarithm approach, I have:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(0.4) = -0.011707 t \\times \\log_{10}(e) \\]\n\n\\[ -0.39794 = -0.011707 t \\times 0.405465 \\]\n\n\\[ -0.39794 = -0.00474 t \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-0.39794}{-0.00474} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 83.9 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nHmm, why is there a difference?\n\nWait, perhaps I used an incorrect value for \\( \\log_{10}(e) \\). Let me verify that.\n\nActually, \\( \\log_{10}(e) \\) is approximately 0.434294, not 0.405465. I think I misremembered that value.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nSo, \\( \\log_{10}(e) \\approx 0.434294 \\)\n\nNow, plugging that back in:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(0.4) = -0.011707 t \\times 0.434294 \\]\n\n\\[ -0.39794 = -0.00508 t \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-0.39794}{-0.00508} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 78.3 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nOkay, now this matches the earlier calculation using natural logarithms.\n\nSo, the correct time is approximately 78.3 days, which rounds to 78 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 78 days, which corresponds to option D.\n\nI must have misremembered the value of \\( \\log_{10}(e) \\) earlier, which led to the discrepancy. But correcting that, both methods give the same result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
