                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"A sample of solid MgCl2 would be most soluble in which of the following solutions? A. LiOH(aq) B. CBr4(aq) C. Mg(NO3)2(aq) D. AlCl3(aq)\" Okay, I need to figure out in which of these solutions magnesium chloride, MgCl2, will dissolve the best.\n\nFirst off, I remember that solubility usually follows the rule \"like dissolves like.\" That means that substances with similar types of molecular interactions will dissolve into each other. So, I need to consider the properties of MgCl2 and each of the given solutions.\n\nMgCl2 is an ionic compound, consisting of magnesium ions, Mg2+, and chloride ions, Cl-. Ionic compounds generally dissolve in polar solvents, especially water, because the polar solvent can surround and separate the ions, pulling them into solution.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. LiOH(aq): This is lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Lithium hydroxide is an ionic compound itself, Li+ and OH-, and when dissolved in water, it dissociates into its ions. So, this is essentially an aqueous solution with Li+ and OH- ions.\n\nB. CBr4(aq): This is carbon tetrabromide in aqueous solution. Carbon tetrabromide is a nonpolar molecule (even though it has bromines, the symmetry makes it nonpolar), and mixing it with water would not result in a homogeneous solution because \"like dissolves like.\" Nonpolar substances don't dissolve well in polar solvents like water.\n\nC. Mg(NO3)2(aq): This is magnesium nitrate in aqueous solution. Magnesium nitrate is another ionic compound, Mg2+ and NO3-, which dissociates in water.\n\nD. AlCl3(aq): This is aluminum chloride in aqueous solution. Aluminum chloride is also an ionic compound, Al3+ and Cl-, that dissociates in water.\n\nSo, all options are aqueous solutions, meaning they have water as the solvent. But option B, CBr4(aq), is problematic because CBr4 is not soluble in water; it's a nonpolar substance in a polar solvent, which typically doesn't mix well. So, perhaps that's not a stable solution to begin with.\n\nBut assuming that all these solutions are prepared and stable, I need to determine in which of them MgCl2 would be most soluble.\n\nLet me consider the common ion effect. The common ion effect states that the solubility of an ionic compound is decreased if there is already an ion in the solution that is common to the compound being dissolved.\n\nMgCl2 dissociates into Mg2+ and 2 Cl-. So, if there are already Mg2+ or Cl- ions in the solution, the solubility of MgCl2 would be reduced due to the common ion effect.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. LiOH(aq): Contains Li+ and OH-. No common ions with MgCl2, so no common ion effect here.\n\nB. CBr4(aq): As discussed, CBr4 doesn't dissolve well in water, so this might not be a good solvent for MgCl2.\n\nC. Mg(NO3)2(aq): Contains Mg2+ and NO3-. Here, Mg2+ is a common ion with MgCl2.\n\nD. AlCl3(aq): Contains Al3+ and Cl-. Cl- is a common ion with MgCl2.\n\nSo, in option C, there's a common ion Mg2+, which would decrease the solubility of MgCl2. In option D, there's a common ion Cl-, which would also decrease the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nOption A has no common ions, so perhaps MgCl2 would dissolve well in that solution.\n\nBut wait, option B is CBr4(aq), which is likely not a homogeneous solution because CBr4 is nonpolar and water is polar. So, MgCl2 might not dissolve well in that.\n\nMoreover, I should consider whether there are any chemical reactions that could occur between MgCl2 and the solute in each solution.\n\nLet's check:\n\nA. LiOH(aq): Mixing MgCl2 with LiOH might lead to a double displacement reaction: MgCl2 + 2 LiOH \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + 2 LiCl. Magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2, is insoluble in water, so this could lead to precipitation, which would decrease the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nB. CBr4(aq): As mentioned, CBr4 doesn't dissolve well in water, so this might not be a good solvent for MgCl2.\n\nC. Mg(NO3)2(aq): Mixing with MgCl2 might lead to increased concentration of Mg2+ and Cl-, but no precipitate would form since all compounds are soluble.\n\nD. AlCl3(aq): Mixing with MgCl2 would increase the concentration of Al3+ and Cl-, but no precipitate would form.\n\nSo, in option A, there's a potential for precipitation, which would decrease the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nIn option C, there's a common ion Mg2+, which decreases solubility.\n\nIn option D, there's a common ion Cl-, which also decreases solubility.\n\nOption B is problematic because CBr4 doesn't dissolve well in water.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider the dielectric constant of the solvent. The dielectric constant measures a solvent's ability to reduce the electrostatic forces between ions. Water has a high dielectric constant, which is why it's a good solvent for ionic compounds. However, among the options, CBr4 is likely to have a lower dielectric constant because it's nonpolar.\n\nBut since all options are listed as aqueous solutions, perhaps the dielectric constant is similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of like ions affects solubility.\n\nLet me think differently: solubility product constant, Ksp.\n\nThe solubility of MgCl2 in water is determined by its Ksp. In solutions containing common ions, the solubility decreases.\n\nIn option A, although there are no common ions, the potential for a precipitation reaction reduces solubility.\n\nIn option C, common ion Mg2+ reduces solubility.\n\nIn option D, common ion Cl- reduces solubility.\n\nIn option B, CBr4 is likely not miscible with water, so MgCl2 might not dissolve well in that solution.\n\nSo, perhaps the best option is C. Mg(NO3)2(aq), but wait, that has a common ion Mg2+, which decreases solubility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's D. AlCl3(aq), which has Cl- as a common ion.\n\nBut both C and D have common ions that decrease solubility.\n\nOption A has the potential for a precipitation reaction, which also decreases solubility.\n\nOption B has a solvent that may not be compatible with MgCl2.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to consider which of these has the least impact on the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nOption A has a reaction that could remove Mg2+, reducing solubility.\n\nOption C has a common ion Mg2+, reducing solubity.\n\nOption D has a common ion Cl-, which also reduces solubility.\n\nOption B is likely not a good solvent for MgCl2.\n\nPerhaps among these, option C has Mg2+ as a common ion, but MgCl2 could still dissolve, albeit less than in pure water.\n\nOption D has Cl- as a common ion, but MgCl2 has two Cl- per formula unit.\n\nSo, perhaps the effect in option D is stronger.\n\nOption A has a chemical reaction that could remove Mg2+, which might make it less soluble than in option C.\n\nTherefore, perhaps option C is the best among the worst, so to speak.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that Mg(NO3)2 is highly soluble in water, and so is MgCl2.\n\nIn option C, Mg(NO3)2 dissociates into Mg2+ and NO3-, and MgCl2 would dissociate into Mg2+ and Cl-.\n\nThe common ion is Mg2+, which according to the common ion effect, should decrease the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nSimilarly, in option D, AlCl3 dissociates into Al3+ and Cl-, and MgCl2 dissociates into Mg2+ and Cl-.\n\nHere, the common ion is Cl-.\n\nBut MgCl2 has two Cl- per formula unit, so the common ion effect might be more significant.\n\nIn option A, LiOH dissociates into Li+ and OH-, and MgCl2 dissociates into Mg2+ and Cl-.\n\nThere are no common ions, but there's a potential for a precipitation reaction forming Mg(OH)2, which is insoluble.\n\nThis could remove Mg2+ from the solution, thereby affecting the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nOption B, CBr4 is likely not soluble in water, so MgCl2 might not dissolve well in that solution.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps option C is the best choice, despite the common ion effect, because there's no precipitation reaction like in option A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me look up the solubility rules and Ksp values.\n\nFrom solubility rules, MgCl2 is soluble in water, as are Mg(NO3)2 and AlCl3.\n\nLiOH is also soluble, and CBr4 is not soluble in water.\n\nSo, option B is likely not a good choice.\n\nNow, for Ksp values:\n\nMgCl2 has a high solubility in water, with a Ksp of around 1.8 x 10^-5.\n\nMg(OH)2 has a very low solubility, with a Ksp of around 5.6 x 10^-12.\n\nSo, in option A, if Mg(OH)2 precipitates, it would remove Mg2+ and OH-, decreasing the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nIn option C, with Mg(NO3)2, the common ion is Mg2+, which decreases the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nIn option D, with AlCl3, the common ion is Cl-, which also decreases the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nSo, comparing options C and D, which one has a stronger effect on decreasing solubility?\n\nIn option C, the common ion is Mg2+, and in option D, it's Cl-.\n\nMgCl2 dissociates into one Mg2+ and two Cl-, so the concentration of Cl- is twice that of Mg2+.\n\nTherefore, the common ion effect from Cl- might be more significant than from Mg2+.\n\nSo, perhaps option C has less of an effect on solubility compared to option D.\n\nMoreover, in option A, the precipitation reaction could remove a significant amount of Mg2+, reducing solubility.\n\nTherefore, among the options, option C might be the best, as it has a common ion that decreases solubility, but perhaps not as much as the precipitation in option A or the potential insolubility in option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another factor I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the activity coefficients in each solution.\n\nIn solutions with high ionic strength, the activity coefficients of ions are altered, which can affect solubility.\n\nHowever, that might be beyond the scope of this question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dielectric constant of the solution affects solubility.\n\nBut since all solutions are aqueous, the dielectric constant is similar.\n\nI think the key points are:\n\n1. Option A has a precipitation reaction that removes Mg2+, decreasing solubility.\n\n2. Option B has a solvent that's not compatible with MgCl2.\n\n3. Option C has a common ion Mg2+, decreasing solubility.\n\n4. Option D has a common ion Cl-, which also decreases solubility.\n\nBetween options C and D, option D might have a stronger common ion effect due to the higher concentration of Cl-.\n\nTherefore, option C might be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option C is the least worst option.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident.\n\nMaybe I should consider the concentration of common ions.\n\nIn option C, Mg(NO3)2 dissociates into Mg2+ and two NO3-, so [Mg2+] would be equal to [Mg(NO3)2].\n\nIn option D, AlCl3 dissociates into Al3+ and three Cl-, so [Cl-] would be three times [AlCl3].\n\nIn option C, the common ion is Mg2+, which directly affects the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nIn option D, the common ion is Cl-, which also affects solubility, but MgCl2 has two Cl- per formula unit.\n\nSo, perhaps the effect in option D is stronger.\n\nTherefore, option C might be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option D is worse because of the higher concentration of Cl-.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that in option C, the common ion is Mg2+, which directly ties to the solubility equilibrium of MgCl2.\n\nIn option D, the common ion is Cl-, which also affects solubility but perhaps not as strongly as Mg2+.\n\nSo, maybe option C decreases solubility more than option D.\n\nWait, but MgCl2 has two Cl- ions, so the Cl- concentration is higher, which might make the common ion effect more significant in option D.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is A, LiOH(aq), because there's no common ion, and despite the precipitation reaction, perhaps the solubility is higher.\n\nBut in reality, the precipitation reaction would decrease the solubility.\n\nI'm getting stuck here.\n\nMaybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nLet me consider the chemical potential or the thermodynamics of dissolution.\n\nWhen MgCl2 dissolves in water, it dissociates into Mg2+ and 2 Cl-, and the entropy increases.\n\nThe solubility is determined by the balance between the enthalpy change (solvation energy) and the entropy change.\n\nIn solutions with ions that are similar to those in MgCl2, the solubility is decreased due to the common ion effect.\n\nTherefore, options C and D decrease solubility due to common ions.\n\nOption A decreases solubility due to a precipitation reaction.\n\nOption B is likely not a good solvent for MgCl2.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the least worst option is C, Mg(NO3)2(aq), because the common ion is Mg2+, but maybe the effect is less severe than the precipitation in option A or the insolubility in option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option D is worse because of the higher concentration of Cl-.\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I need to look for data or think about another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the ionic strength of the solutions.\n\nThe ionic strength affects the activity coefficients of ions, which in turn affects solubility.\n\nHowever, this might be too complicated for this question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dielectric constant of the solution affects the solubility of ionic compounds.\n\nBut again, since all solutions are aqueous, the dielectric constant is similar.\n\nI think the key points are the common ion effect and possible precipitation reactions.\n\nGiven that, option A has a precipitation reaction, which decreases solubility.\n\nOption B has a solvent that's not compatible with MgCl2.\n\nOption C has a common ion Mg2+, decreasing solubility.\n\nOption D has a common ion Cl-, which also decreases solubility.\n\nBetween C and D, perhaps C has a lesser effect on solubility.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be C, Mg(NO3)2(aq).\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D, AlCl3(aq), because Al3+ has a higher charge than Mg2+, which might have a greater effect on solubility.\n\nWait, no, in terms of common ion effect, it's the shared ion that matters.\n\nSince MgCl2 has Mg2+ and Cl-, options C and D have common ions.\n\nThe effect might be stronger in option D due to the higher concentration of Cl-.\n\nTherefore, perhaps option C is better.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should just pick option A, LiOH(aq), because there's no common ion, and despite the precipitation reaction, perhaps the solubility is higher.\n\nBut in reality, the precipitation reaction would decrease the solubility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B, CBr4(aq), but that doesn't make sense because CBr4 is not soluble in water.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is testing whether I recognize that CBr4 is not soluble in water, making option B not a good choice.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the answer is C, Mg(NO3)2(aq), as the least worst option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D, AlCl3(aq), but I think that's worse due to the common ion Cl-.\n\nI'm really not sure.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the concentration of the solutions.\n\nIf all solutions have the same concentration, then perhaps the extent of the common ion effect can be compared.\n\nAssuming that, in option C, [Mg2+] is equal to the concentration of Mg(NO3)2.\n\nIn option D, [Cl-] is three times the concentration of AlCl3.\n\nIn option C, the common ion is Mg2+, which directly affects the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nIn option D, the common ion is Cl-, which also affects solubility but perhaps to a lesser extent because Cl- is not as highly charged as Mg2+.\n\nTherefore, perhaps option C decreases solubility more than option D.\n\nWait, but MgCl2 has two Cl- ions, so the Cl- concentration is higher.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just go with my initial intuition and pick option C, Mg(NO3)2(aq).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
