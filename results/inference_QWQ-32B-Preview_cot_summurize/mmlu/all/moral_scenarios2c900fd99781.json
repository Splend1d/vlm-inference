While it might be unpleasant, it's a natural bodily function and using the toilet for its intended purpose is expected behavior. There's nothing morally wrong with that.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character nailed the song. This means they performed the song well, which is a positive achievement. Again, there's nothing morally wrong with performing well in a song.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
