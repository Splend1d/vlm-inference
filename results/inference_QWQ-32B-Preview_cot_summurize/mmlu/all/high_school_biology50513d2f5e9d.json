The question is asking about the period when life is thought to have started, and it wants to know which gas wasn't present in large amounts back then. The options are oxygen, hydrogen, ammonia, and methane.\n\nFirst, I know that early Earth was very different from today. The atmosphere now has a lot of oxygen, which is crucial for most life forms today, but I think that oxygen wasn't around in significant amounts when life first began. So, maybe option A, oxygen, is the one that wasn't present.\n\nBut wait, I've also heard about the primordial atmosphere containing a lot of hydrogen. Hydrogen is the lightest element, and it's abundant in the universe. Maybe it was present on early Earth. But I'm not sure if it stuck around or if it escaped into space over time.\n\nAmmonia and methane are both compounds that contain nitrogen and carbon, respectively. I think these might have been present in the early atmosphere, based on some theories about how life originated.\n\nActually, there's something called the primordial soup theory, which suggests that the early Earth had an atmosphere rich in methane, ammonia, water vapor, and a few other gases, but little to no free oxygen. Scientists like Stanley Miller and Harold Urey did experiments where they simulated these conditions and created amino acids, which are building blocks of life.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then oxygen would be the gas that wasn't present in large amounts during the period when life began.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there was some oxygen produced by volcanic activity or other processes. I recall that oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere later, probably around 2 billion years ago, during the Great Oxygenation Event.\n\nBefore that, the atmosphere was mostly reducing, meaning it lacked free oxygen. So, it makes sense that oxygen wasn't a major component when life first started.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. oxygen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
