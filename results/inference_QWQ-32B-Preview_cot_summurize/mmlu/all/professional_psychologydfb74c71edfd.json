As a psychologist, I know that boundaries are crucial in therapy, and sexual relationships with clients are strictly prohibited due to the potential for harm and exploitation. So, first things first, I need to recognize that what my colleague did is a severe ethical violation.\n\nOption A is to file a complaint against the colleague immediately with the Ethics Committee. While the violation is serious, I think it's important to handle this thoughtfully. Maybe I should consider speaking with my colleague first to understand the situation better.\n\nOption B is to file a complaint after informing him that I intend to do so. This might give him a chance to reflect on his actions and perhaps take steps to address the issue himself, like reporting it or seeking supervision. But I'm not sure if that's my place.\n\nOption C is to discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take. This seems like a reasonable first step. Maybe he realizes his mistake and is already taking steps to rectify it. It's possible he's seeking supervision or considering reporting himself.\n\nOption D is to contact the client and discuss the matter with her. This feels risky. As a psychologist, I know that clients in this situation might be vulnerable and could be influenced by the therapist's behavior. I don't want to cause any further harm or confusion for the client.\n\nI think the best approach is to choose option C: discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take. This allows me to understand his perspective and whether he is taking appropriate steps to address the ethical breach. If he hasn't already, I can encourage him to report himself or seek supervision.\n\nHowever, I need to approach this conversation carefully. I should express my concerns about the ethical implications and the potential harm to the client. It's important to maintain confidentiality unless there is an immediate risk of harm, in which case I might need to take further action.\n\nI should also consider seeking advice from a more experienced colleague or supervisor about how to handle this situation. They might have insight or guidance based on their experience with similar issues.\n\nIn any case, I need to document this conversation and my actions carefully, in case there is a need to report this later. It's a tough situation, but as a psychologist, it's my responsibility to prioritize the welfare of clients and uphold ethical standards in the profession.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
