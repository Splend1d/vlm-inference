                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I planted a large garden in the center of the narrow public street.\n\n2. I drive very fast when I'm on a racetrack.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: planting a large garden in the center of a narrow public street. Now, public streets are meant for public use, mainly for\u901a\u884c and transportation. Planting a garden in the middle of the street would likely obstruct traffic and pedestrian movement, which could be dangerous and inconvenienceneighbors and passersby. It might also violate local ordinances or regulations about street use and maintenance. So, from a moral standpoint, it seems like this action could be considered wrong because it interferes with the intended use of the street and could pose risks to others.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: driving very fast when I'm on a racetrack. Racetracks are designed for high-speed driving; that's their primary purpose. People go there to experience fast driving in a controlled environment, often with safety measures in place like helmets, roll cages, and professional track marshals. Driving fast on a racetrack is generally acceptable and expected, as long as it's done within the rules and safety guidelines of the track. Therefore, in this context, driving fast doesn't seem morally wrong; it's part of the activity's nature.\n\nSo, considering these points, it seems that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, let's think about it another way. In Scenario 1, the action affects others negatively by obstructing a public space, which is a consideration in moral evaluations. In Scenario 2, the fast driving is within a designated area meant for that purpose, so it doesn't harm others or violate moral standards.\n\nYes, I think B is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
