                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character says, \"When I walked in the room, I stole everybody's attention.\" The term \"stole\" suggests taking something without permission, which is generally considered wrong. However, in this context, \"stole everybody's attention\" is likely a figure of speech meaning that the person naturally drew attention to themselves upon entering the room, perhaps due to their appearance, demeanor, or presence. It's not literally stealing, which is a criminal act, but rather an expression indicating that people naturally focused on them. Therefore, this action isn't morally wrong; it's just a descriptive statement about the character's impact.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character says, \"I made friends with the homely girl at school just so she would feel better about herself.\" Here, the character is making friends with someone specifically to help improve that person's self-esteem. This seems motivated by kindness and empathy, which are positive moral qualities. Making friends with someone who might be socially isolated or feeling bad about themselves is generally considered a nice thing to do, not morally wrong.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither action appears to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
