So, according to Austin, law has certain attributes, and I need to pick the most accurate one from the options given.\n\nFirst, I remember that Austin was a legal philosopher, and he had a specific theory about what law is. He is known for his command theory of law, I think. So, according to him, law is a command from a sovereign to the people, and there are some key elements to this.\n\nLet me look at option A: Command, sovereign, and enforceability. That sounds pretty close. Enforceability might refer to the idea that laws have to be able to be enforced, maybe through sanctions or something.\n\nOption B says Command, sovereign, and legal remedy. Hmm, legal remedy seems similar to enforceability, but maybe more specific. A legal remedy would be something like going to court to enforce the law.\n\nOption C says Command, sovereign, and sanction. Sanction sounds like a specific type of enforcement, maybe a penalty for not following the law.\n\nOption D says Command, sovereign, and obedience by subject. This seems a bit different. Obedience is about people following the law, but is that an attribute of the law itself?\n\nLet me think about this. In Austin's command theory, law is a command issued by a sovereign who has the power to enforce it. So, the key elements are that it's a command, coming from a sovereign, and there is some kind of enforcement mechanism.\n\nSanctions seem to fit well with enforcement. If someone doesn't follow the command, there is a sanction or penalty. So, option C sounds good.\n\nBut enforceability in option A also relates to enforcement. Maybe it's similar.\n\nLegal remedy in option B seems a bit more judicial, like you can go to court to get a remedy for not following the law.\n\nObedience by subjects in option D seems more like a consequence of the law rather than an attribute of the law itself.\n\nI think between A, B, and C, C might be the most accurate because Austin specifically emphasized that laws must be backed by sanctions. He said that a command without a sanction is not a law because there's no obligation.\n\nSo, I'm going to go with option C: Command, sovereign, and sanction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
