                    "text": "So here's this scenario: a driver parks his car kinda illegally, not in a proper parking space, just next to a store. He thinks it's okay because he's only going in for a few minutes. While he's inside, another driver comes along and crashes into his car because it's partially in the road. Now, there's damage to both cars\u2014$5,000 to the first driver's car and $1,000 to the woman's car. The question is, in a jurisdiction that follows traditional contributory negligence rules and considering the last clear chance doctrine, how much can the driver recover from the woman in a negligence lawsuit?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what contributory negligence means. In traditional contributory negligence jurisdictions, if the plaintiff is at all negligent and that negligence contributes to the accident, they can't recover any damages from the defendant. It's an all-or-nothing rule. So, if the driver is found to be even slightly at fault, he might not get anything.\n\nBut there's also this \"last clear chance\" doctrine mentioned. This is a exception to the contributory negligence rule. It allows the plaintiff to recover damages if they can prove that the defendant had the last clear chance to avoid the accident, even if the plaintiff was also negligent.\n\nSo, in this case, the driver parked his car partially in the road, which was negligent because he shouldn't have parked there in the first place. The woman was driving and should have been paying attention to avoid hitting the car, but apparently, she didn't manage to do so.\n\nGiven that, the driver was contributorily negligent for parking illegally, which obstructed the road. The woman was negligent for not avoiding the parked car.\n\nNow, applying the last clear chance doctrine, if the woman had the opportunity to avoid hitting the car but didn't, then maybe the driver can still recover damages despite his own negligence.\n\nBut in jurisdictions with pure contributory negligence, the plaintiff cannot recover anything if they are at all negligent, unless the last clear chance doctrine applies.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.\n\nAssuming that she did have a chance to avoid hitting the car but failed to do so, then the driver might be able to recover damages.\n\nBut the question is, how much can he recover?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $5,000, the full amount of his damages.\n\nB. $4,000, which is his damages minus the woman's damages.\n\nC. $2,500, which is half of his damages.\n\nD. Nothing, because of his contributory negligence.\n\nIn pure contributory negligence jurisdictions, if the plaintiff is at all negligent, they can't recover anything. However, the last clear chance doctrine might allow recovery.\n\nBut in some jurisdictions that follow contributory negligence, the last clear chance doctrine can operate to allow recovery, but the damages might be reduced based on the plaintiff's degree of fault.\n\nWait, but traditional contributory negligence doesn't reduce damages; it's all or nothing. If the last clear chance applies, then the plaintiff can recover full damages.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because in some jurisdictions, even with the last clear chance doctrine, the damages might be apportioned based on fault.\n\nLet me think differently. If the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence, and the plaintiff is found to be contributorily negligent, they can't recover anything, unless the last clear chance doctrine applies, in which case they can recover full damages.\n\nIn this case, since the driver parked illegally, which contributed to the accident, he is contributorily negligent.\n\nHowever, if the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision and didn't, then perhaps the driver can recover full damages.\n\nBut the question is, in such a scenario, does the last clear chance doctrine override the contributory negligence completely, allowing the driver to recover the full $5,000?\n\nAlternatively, might the damages be reduced based on the driver's fault?\n\nI think in traditional contributory negligence jurisdictions, if the last clear chance doctrine applies, the plaintiff can recover full damages, despite their own negligence.\n\nSo, in that case, the answer would be A. $5,000, the full amount of his damages.\n\nBut let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B, $4,000, which is his damages minus the woman's damages. I don't see a legal basis for this. It's not apportioning fault; it's just subtracting the other party's damages from his own, which doesn't make sense in terms of negligence principles.\n\nOption C, $2,500, which is half of his damages, suggests that damages are being split 50/50 based on fault. But in pure contributory negligence jurisdictions, it's not about splitting damages; it's about whether the plaintiff's negligence bars recovery at all, unless the last clear chance applies.\n\nOption D is that he can recover nothing because of his contributory negligence. But again, with the last clear chance doctrine, he might still be able to recover.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is A. $5,000, assuming that the last clear chance doctrine applies, which it seems to based on the facts provided.\n\nBut wait, I should consider whether the last clear chance doctrine indeed applies here.\n\nThe woman saw the driver's car partially obstructing the road and tried to avoid it but still crashed. So, she had a chance to avoid the collision but didn't succeed.\n\nWhether this constitutes having the last clear chance might depend on the specific facts, like how much time she had to react, whether it was possible for her to avoid the collision, etc.\n\nIf it's determined that she had enough time to avoid hitting the car but failed to do so, then she had the last clear chance, and the driver could recover full damages.\n\nAlternatively, if it's found that it was impossible for her to avoid the collision given the circumstances, then maybe the last clear chance doesn't apply, and the driver's contributory negligence bars recovery.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems that she did have a chance to avoid hitting the car but didn't, so the last clear chance likely applies.\n\nTherefore, the driver can recover the full $5,000 for the damage to his car.\n\nSo, the answer is A. $5,000, or the full amount of damages to his car.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
