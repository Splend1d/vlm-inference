The options are:\n\nA. whether they help develop human capabilities.\n\nB. whether they minimize the amount of suffering in the world.\n\nC. whether they recognize, enforce, and implement duties not to violate human rights.\n\nD. whether they are universalizable.\n\nI need to pick the one that Ashford thinks is the right test for minimal justice.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Ashford's perspective is on this. I remember that Ashford is associated with a particular approach to justice, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I think he emphasizes the protection of certain basic rights or something like that.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: helping develop human capabilities. That sounds like it relates to capabilities approach, which is associated with philosophers like Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. They argue that the focus should be on expanding people's freedoms and capabilities to live the lives they value. But I don't recall Ashford being directly linked to this approach. Maybe it's not the right choice.\n\nOption B: minimizing suffering in the world. This seems more like a utilitarian approach, where the goal is to maximize overall happiness or minimize pain. Again, I don't think Ashford is particularly known for advocating a purely utilitarian test for justice.\n\nOption C: recognizing, enforcing, and implementing duties not to violate human rights. This sounds more in line with a rights-based approach to justice. Ashford might be someone who emphasizes the importance of protecting basic rights and duties to not infringe upon them. This seems plausible.\n\nOption D: universalizability. This reminds me of Kant's idea that moral principles should be universalizable, meaning they should be applicable to everyone in similar situations. Perhaps Ashford thinks that legal and economic structures should be based on principles that can be universally applied. That could be a possibility.\n\nBetween options C and D, I'm leaning towards C because it specifically mentions human rights and duties not to violate them, which seems like a clear test for minimal justice. Ensuring that rights are recognized and protected is a fundamental aspect of a just society.\n\nOn the other hand, universalizability is also an important principle, but it's more about the consistency and universality of the principles themselves, rather than their specific content regarding rights.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is the best answer. Ashford likely\u8ba4\u4e3a that the minimal test for justice in legal and economic structures is whether they adequately recognize, enforce, and implement duties not to violate human rights.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
