                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about logical behaviorism and commonsense intuition. The question is: \"Logical behaviorism is at odds with our commonsense intuition that mental states _____.\" And then there are four options: A. cause behavior, B. never cause behavior, C. exist, D. do not exist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what logical behaviorism is. From what I recall, logical behaviorism is a philosophical position that tries to analyze mental terms in terms of behavior and behavioral dispositions. It was popular in the mid-20th century, especially among logical positivists. The idea is that statements about mental states should be understood in terms of observable behavior.\n\nNow, commonsense intuition about mental states. Commonsense generally holds that mental states, like beliefs, desires, pains, etc., do exist and they play a causal role in our behavior. For example, I believe it's raining, so I take an umbrella. Here, the belief causes the behavior.\n\nSo, logical behaviorism is trying to reduce mental states to behavior, whereas commonsense intuition holds that mental states exist and cause behavior.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. cause behavior\n\nB. never cause behavior\n\nC. exist\n\nD. do not exist\n\nI need to see which of these logical behaviorism is at odds with.\n\nIf logical behaviorism tries to explain mental states in terms of behavior, then it might be at odds with the idea that mental states cause behavior, because if mental states are just behavior or dispositions to behave, then talking about them causing behavior might be redundant or unnecessary.\n\nWait, but behaviorism does allow that behavior is caused by environmental stimuli and internal states that are defined in terms of behavior. So, perhaps it's not so much that mental states don't cause behavior, but rather that mental states are behavior or dispositions to behave.\n\nOption B says \"never cause behavior.\" That seems too strong. Logical behaviorism might say that mental states are behavior or dispositions to behave, but not that they never cause behavior.\n\nOption C is \"exist.\" Logical behaviorism does acknowledge the existence of mental states, but it tries to define them in behavioristic terms. So, it might be at odds with the commonsense view that mental states exist as internal, non-behavioral states.\n\nOption D is \"do not exist.\" Logical behaviorism does not hold that mental states do not exist; rather, it tries to give a behavioral account of them.\n\nSo, between options A and C, I think the answer might be A, \"cause behavior.\" Because logical behaviorism might hold that mental states are behavior or dispositions to behave, and therefore, it's not that mental states cause behavior, but that mental states are behavior.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit nuanced. Commonsense intuition is that mental states cause behavior, whereas logical behaviorism might say that mental states are behavior or dispositions to behave, thus eliminating the need for a separate causal role.\n\nTherefore, logical behaviorism is at odds with the commonsense intuition that mental states cause behavior.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. cause behavior.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I choose C, \"exist,\" logical behaviorism does acknowledge the existence of mental states, but defines them behaviorally. So, it's not so much that they don't exist, but how they exist.\n\nTherefore, A seems more appropriate.\n\nYes, I think A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
