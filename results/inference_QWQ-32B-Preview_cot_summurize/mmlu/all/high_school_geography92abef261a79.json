It's basically a city that plays a significant role in global affairs, economy, culture, and politics. They're like the hubs of the global network.\n\nOption A says: \"World cities contain the headquarters of many transnational corporations.\" That sounds about right. Big cities like New York, London, and Tokyo are known for housing the headquarters of major multinational companies. So, this seems like a characteristic of world cities.\n\nOption B: \"World cities are well connected to secondary-level world cities.\" Again, this makes sense. World cities have extensive networks of connections, both in terms of transportation and communication, with other important cities around the world. So, this is probably a characteristic too.\n\nOption C: \"World cities contain many offices of multinational organizations.\" Definitely. Organizations like the UN, World Bank, and various corporate offices have their presence in these cities. So, this is another characteristic.\n\nNow, option D: \"World cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres.\" Hmm, this seems questionable. Traditionally, many world cities have been in the northern hemisphere, like New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo. But in recent years, with the rise of economies in the southern and eastern hemispheres, cities like Singapore, Sydney, and especially cities in emerging economies like Beijing, Shanghai, and Mumbai are gaining more prominence on the global stage.\n\nSo, is it accurate to say that world cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres? No, that doesn't seem right. There are world cities in the southern hemisphere, like Sydney in Australia, and in the eastern hemisphere, like Dubai in the UAE, which is gaining importance in global trade and business.\n\nTherefore, option D is likely the one that is NOT a characteristic of world cities.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- A: Correct, world cities have headquarters of transnational corporations.\n\n- B: Correct, they are well connected to other secondary world cities.\n\n- C: Correct, they contain many offices of multinational organizations.\n\n- D: Incorrect, world cities are not only found in the northern and western hemispheres; they are spread globally, including the southern and eastern hemispheres.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
