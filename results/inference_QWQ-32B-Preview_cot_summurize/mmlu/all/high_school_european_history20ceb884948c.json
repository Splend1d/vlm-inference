                    "text": "Let's see. I have this passage about the Paris Exposition of 1889, and it's talking about the opportunities for studying natural history, especially anthropology, during that time. It mentions various places like the Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, the work of Bertillon in the Palais de Justice, lectures at the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, collections in the Jardin de Plantes, and opportunities for research in medical schools and hospitals. The author, Otis T. Mason, seems to be highlighting how rich and diverse these resources were for anthropologists.\n\nNow, the question is asking what can be inferred about the changes in the scientific community at that time, and the options are:\n\nA. the inclusion of women\n\nB. an increase in funding from officials in the French capital\n\nC. the development of universal public education in many European countries\n\nD. the development of new, specialized fields\n\nLooking at the passage, I don't see any mention of women being included in the scientific community, so option A doesn't seem directly supported. Similarly, there's no specific mention of increased funding from French officials, so option B is also not clearly inferred from the text. Option C about universal public education isn't directly related to the content of the passage, which is more focused on specific institutions and their resources for anthropology.\n\nOption D, though, talks about the development of new, specialized fields, and this seems to align well with what's described in the passage. The text mentions various specialized institutions and areas of study: the Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, which are likely focused on physical anthropology; Bertillon's work in anthropometrics at the Palais de Justice, which sounds like forensic anthropology; lectures at the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, indicating a formalized educational track in anthropology; collections in the Jardin de Plantes, which is a natural history museum; and opportunities for original work in medical schools and hospitals, suggesting an intersection between medicine and anthropology.\n\nAll these points suggest that anthropology, and perhaps science more broadly, was becoming more specialized, with distinct branches and institutions dedicated to different aspects of the field. The reference to \"comparative anatomist and biologist\" also hints at the specialization within biology.\n\nMoreover, the mention of \"the great Congresses and the French Association held their sessions\" during the Exposition suggests a growing professionalization and organization within the scientific community, with dedicated conferences and associations for different scientific disciplines.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, it seems that the development of new, specialized fields (option D) is the most appropriate inference from the text regarding changes in the scientific community at the time of the Paris Exposition of 1889.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
