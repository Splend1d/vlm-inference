The options are:\n\nA. A postwar reassertion of traditional religious values\n\nB. An expression of patriotic pride thanks to victory in World War II\n\nC. A modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities\n\nD. An increased willingness to embrace radical Marxism\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Camus is saying in the passage. He mentions that he doesn't know if the world has a meaning that goes beyond it, and he acknowledges that he can't know that meaning right now. He also says that he can only understand things in human terms. So, it seems like he's expressing uncertainty about the existence of a higher meaning and focusing on human understanding.\n\nOption A suggests a reassertion of traditional religious values after the war. But Camus seems to be questioning the idea of a transcendent meaning, which might be related to religious beliefs. So, this doesn't seem to fit because he's not affirming religious values; he's expressing doubt about them.\n\nOption B is about patriotic pride due to victory in World War II. The passage doesn't mention anything about patriotism or the war. Camus is talking about the meaning of the world and human understanding, so this option doesn't seem relevant.\n\nOption C mentions a modernist tendency to question faith-based moralities. Camus is indeed questioning the validity of a meaning that transcends human condition, which could be related to faith-based moralities. Modernism often involved a skepticism towards traditional beliefs and a focus on individual experience and reason.\n\nOption D is about an increased willingness to embrace radical Marxism. While Camus was involved in leftist politics, \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" is more philosophical and deals with the meaning of life and existence. There's no direct mention of Marxism in the passage, so this might not be the best fit.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to be the most appropriate. Camus is exemplifying a modernist tendency to question faith-based moralities by expressing uncertainty about a transcendent meaning and asserting that he can only understand things in human terms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
