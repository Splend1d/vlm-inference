In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill.

So, there's a state law that bans selling computer printer ink cartridges in plastic bags and requires them to be sold in recyclable paper cartons instead. Before this law, about 28% of ink cartridges in the state were packaged in plastic bags, with 75% of those packaged outside the state and 25% packaged in-state. The law was pushed for by the paper industry, which spent a lot of money lobbying for it, and even some environmentalists supported it because they thought recyclable paper would help reduce litter.\n\nNow, the state Supreme Court has ruled that this law is unconstitutional because it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and state constitutions. They say the law retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for selling ink cartridges in plastic bags. The state attorney general wants the U.S. Supreme Court to review this decision.\n\nI need to choose how the U.S. Supreme Court should rule from these options:\n\nA. Refuse to review this case on the merits because there's an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below.\n\nB. Reverse the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue because the federal constitutional holding rendered below makes such a state constitutional decision unnecessary.\n\nC. Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.\n\nD. Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to both the federal and state constitutional issues because the state constitution must substantially conform with the federal constitution on this issue.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's being asked here. The state Supreme Court invalidated the law based on both federal and state contracts clauses. The U.S. Supreme Court is being asked to review this decision. I need to decide which approach the Court should take.\n\nOption A suggests that the U.S. Supreme Court should not review the case on its merits because the state Supreme Court had an adequate and independent state law ground for its decision. This means that even if the federal constitutional issue is present, the state court's decision can stand on state constitutional grounds alone, and the U.S. Supreme Court shouldn't get involved in the federal issue.\n\nOption B proposes reversing the state court's decision on the state constitutional issue because the federal constitutional holding makes the state issue unnecessary. This seems a bit confusing. If the federal constitutional issue is resolved one way, does that automatically decide the state constitutional issue?\n\nOption C suggests affirming the federal constitutional issue and abstaining from reviewing the state constitutional issue. This means the U.S. Supreme Court would agree with the state court on the federal issue but leave the state issue alone.\n\nOption D is to affirm both the federal and state constitutional issues, arguing that the state constitution must conform to the federal constitution in this regard.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the doctrine of abstention and the role of the U.S. Supreme Court in reviewing state court decisions.\n\nGenerally, the U.S. Supreme Court can review decisions of state courts only on federal questions. If a state court's decision rests on an adequate and independent state ground, the U.S. Supreme Court won't review the federal issues because the state court didn't need to reach them; they decided based on state law alone.\n\nHowever, in this case, the state Supreme Court invalidated the law based on both federal and state constitutional grounds. So, both are present.\n\nOption A is about abstention based on an adequate and independent state ground. But since both federal and state constitutional grounds were used, is there still an independent state ground?\n\nWait, perhaps the state constitutional ground is independent, but the federal constitutional issue is also present, which is directly reviewable by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOption B suggests reversing the state court's decision on the state constitutional issue because the federal holding makes it unnecessary. This seems odd because the state constitutional issue is separate from the federal one, and the U.S. Supreme Court may not have jurisdiction to review state constitutional issues unless they're entangled with federal issues.\n\nOption C proposes affirming the federal constitutional issue and abstaining from reviewing the state constitutional issue. This seems plausible because the U.S. Supreme Court can decide the federal issue and leave the state issue to the state courts.\n\nOption D is to affirm both, suggesting that the state constitution must conform to the federal constitution, which is generally true, but state constitutions can provide more protections than the federal constitution.\n\nLet me consider the contracts clause. The contracts clause in the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from passing laws that retroactively impair contract obligations. Similarly, the state constitution has a similar provision.\n\nIn this case, the state law is alleged to retroactively impair existing contracts of plastic bag packagers for selling ink cartridges in plastic bags.\n\nI need to think about whether such a law does indeed retroactively impair contracts.\n\nThe law prohibits selling ink cartridges in plastic bags, so if someone has a contract to sell them in plastic bags, the law would make it illegal to fulfill that contract as agreed. That seems like it impairs the contract.\n\nBut, is this a valid exercise of the state's police power, perhaps for environmental reasons?\n\nThe legislature was influenced by the paper industry and environmentalists, who thought that recyclable paper would help prevent littering.\n\nSo, there's a legitimate purpose here\u2014environmental protection.\n\nThe question is whether the impairment of contracts is substantial and whether there's a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the law, and whether the legislative means are reasonable and appropriate to accomplish that purpose.\n\nIn contract clause cases, courts balance these factors.\n\nGiven that the law affects existing contracts but serves an important public purpose, it's possible that the impairment is justified.\n\nHowever, the state Supreme Court has already ruled that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and state constitutions.\n\nNow, the U.S. Supreme Court is being asked to review this decision.\n\nI need to think about how the U.S. Supreme Court should approach this.\n\nFirst, regarding federalism and the relationship between federal and state constitutions.\n\nThe state constitution has a contracts clause similar to the federal one. So, if the U.S. Supreme Court were to review the federal constitutional issue, its decision would have implications for the state constitutional issue as well, but not necessarily bind it completely.\n\nHowever, in this case, the state Supreme Court has ruled that both the federal and state contracts clauses are violated.\n\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court were to review this, it could affirm or reverse the federal constitutional holding, but the state constitutional holding might still stand independently.\n\nGiven that, option A suggests refusing to review the case on the merits because there's an adequate and independent state ground.\n\nBut, since both federal and state constitutional issues were decided, and the U.S. Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the federal issue, it might proceed to review the federal issue, even if there's a state ground.\n\nOption B suggests reversing the state court's decision on the state constitutional issue because the federal holding makes it unnecessary.\n\nThis seems problematic because the U.S. Supreme Court may not have jurisdiction to review the state constitutional issue independently; it's primarily for federal issues.\n\nOption C is to affirm the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.\n\nThis makes sense because the U.S. Supreme Court can decide the federal issue and let the state court's decision stand on the state constitutional issue.\n\nOption D is to affirm both, suggesting that the state constitution must conform to the federal constitution.\n\nWhile state constitutions must comply with the federal constitution, they can provide additional protections. So, affirming both would mean that in this instance, both the federal and state contracts clauses are violated by the law.\n\nGiven all this, I think option C is the most appropriate.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court should affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.\n\nThis allows the federal issue to be resolved, and the state constitutional issue remains within the purview of the state courts.\n\nAdditionally, if the federal constitutional issue is affirmed, meaning the law violates the federal contracts clause, then the law is invalid on that basis alone, making the state constitutional issue moot.\n\nHowever, since the state Supreme Court has already invalidated it on both grounds, affirming the federal issue would suffice to uphold the decision without delving into the state constitutional issue.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the best approach.\n\nLet me check option A again. Refusing to review the case on the merits because of an adequate and independent state ground.\n\nBut, since the U.S. Supreme Court has jurisdiction over federal constitutional issues, and the state court has decided both federal and state issues, the U.S. Supreme Court can still review the federal issue, even if there's a state ground.\n\nSo, option A might not be the best choice.\n\nOption B suggests reversing the state court's decision on the state constitutional issue based on the federal holding, which seems like overstepping the U.S. Supreme Court's jurisdiction, as it primarily deals with federal issues.\n\nOption D suggests affirming both, which might be acceptable, but it's not necessary to review the state constitutional issue if the federal issue is sufficient to decide the case.\n\nTherefore, option C appears to be the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
