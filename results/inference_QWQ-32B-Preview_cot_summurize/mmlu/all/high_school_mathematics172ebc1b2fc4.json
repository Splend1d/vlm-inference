                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. Alex has two loan options from the bank, and we need to find the positive difference between the total amounts he has to pay back under each scheme. The options are:\n\n1. A ten-year loan with an annual interest rate of 10% compounded quarterly, with a condition that at the end of 5 years, Alex must make a payment equal to half of what he owes. The other half continues to accrue interest, and at the end of ten years, he pays off the remaining balance.\n\n2. A ten-year loan with a simple annual interest rate of 12%, with just one lump-sum payment at the end of ten years.\n\nOur goal is to calculate the total repayment for each option and then find the difference between them, rounding to the nearest dollar.\n\n### Option 1: Compounded Quarterly with a Payment at 5 Years\n\nFirst, let's understand the compounded quarterly interest. The annual interest rate is 10%, and it's compounded quarterly, which means it's divided into four equal parts and applied each quarter.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = \\$10,000 \\)\n- \\( r = 10\\% = 0.10 \\)\n- \\( n = 4 \\) (since it's compounded quarterly)\n- \\( t = 5 \\) years for the first phase\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the amount owed after 5 years.\n\n\\[ A_5 = 10,000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 5} \\]\n\\[ A_5 = 10,000 \\left(1 + 0.025\\right)^{20} \\]\n\\[ A_5 = 10,000 \\left(1.025\\right)^{20} \\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( (1.025)^{20} \\):\n\n\\[ (1.025)^{20} \\approx 1.63861644 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ A_5 \\approx 10,000 \\times 1.63861644 \\approx 16,386.16 \\]\n\nAt the end of 5 years, Alex pays half of this amount:\n\n\\[ \\text{Payment at 5 years} = \\frac{16,386.16}{2} \\approx 8,193.08 \\]\n\nNow, the remaining half continues to accrue interest for another 5 years.\n\n\\[ \\text{Remaining balance} = 8,193.08 \\]\n\nWe need to calculate the future value of this remaining balance after another 5 years with the same interest rate and compounding.\n\n\\[ A_{10} = 8,193.08 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 5} \\]\n\\[ A_{10} = 8,193.08 \\left(1.025\\right)^{20} \\]\n\\[ A_{10} \\approx 8,193.08 \\times 1.63861644 \\approx 13,432.82 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Alex has to pay back under Option 1 is the sum of the payment at 5 years and the balance at 10 years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Option 1} = 8,193.08 + 13,432.82 \\approx 21,625.90 \\]\n\n### Option 2: Simple Interest with a Lump-Sum Payment at 10 Years\n\nFor simple interest, the formula is:\n\n\\[ A = P (1 + rt) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (\\$10,000).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (12% or 0.12).\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is borrowed for (10 years).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ A = 10,000 (1 + 0.12 \\times 10) \\]\n\\[ A = 10,000 (1 + 1.2) \\]\n\\[ A = 10,000 \\times 2.2 \\]\n\\[ A = 22,000 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Alex has to pay back under Option 2 is \\$22,000.\n\n### Finding the Difference\n\nNow, we find the positive difference between the total amounts under Option 1 and Option 2:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = |21,625.90 - 22,000| = 374.10 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} \\approx 374 \\]\n\nHowever, the answer choices provided are:\n\nA. 16401\nB. 16400\nC. 382\nD. 383\n\nIt seems there might be a miscalculation in the previous steps. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\n#### Rechecking Option 1:\n\n1. Calculate the amount owed after 5 years:\n\n\\[ A_5 = 10,000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{20} \\]\n\\[ A_5 = 10,000 \\left(1.025\\right)^{20} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n\\[ (1.025)^{20} \\approx 1.63861644 \\]\n\\[ A_5 \\approx 10,000 \\times 1.63861644 \\approx 16,386.16 \\]\n\n2. Payment at 5 years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Payment} = \\frac{16,386.16}{2} \\approx 8,193.08 \\]\n\n3. Remaining balance after payment:\n\n\\[ \\text{Remaining} = 8,193.08 \\]\n\n4. Future value of the remaining balance after another 5 years:\n\n\\[ A_{10} = 8,193.08 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{20} \\]\n\\[ A_{10} \\approx 8,193.08 \\times 1.63861644 \\approx 13,432.82 \\]\n\n5. Total payment under Option 1:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Option 1} = 8,193.08 + 13,432.82 \\approx 21,625.90 \\]\n\n#### Rechecking Option 2:\n\n\\[ A = 10,000 (1 + 0.12 \\times 10) = 10,000 \\times 2.2 = 22,000 \\]\n\n#### Rechecking the Difference:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 22,000 - 21,625.90 = 374.10 \\]\n\nRounded to the nearest dollar, it's indeed \\$374. However, this doesn't match any of the provided options. There might be a mistake in the interpretation of the problem or in the calculations.\n\n#### Alternative Approach for Option 1:\n\nPerhaps the payment at 5 years doesn't reduce the principal immediately but is considered as a partial payment. Let's try another approach.\n\n1. Calculate the amount owed after 5 years:\n\n\\[ A_5 = 10,000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{20} \\approx 16,386.16 \\]\n\n2. Alex pays half of this amount:\n\n\\[ \\text{Payment} = \\frac{16,386.16}{2} \\approx 8,193.08 \\]\n\n3. The remaining balance continues to accrue interest for another 5 years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Remaining balance} = 16,386.16 - 8,193.08 = 8,193.08 \\]\n\n4. Calculate the future value of the remaining balance after another 5 years:\n\n\\[ A_{10} = 8,193.08 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{20} \\approx 8,193.08 \\times 1.63861644 \\approx 13,432.82 \\]\n\n5. Total payment:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Option 1} = 8,193.08 + 13,432.82 = 21,625.90 \\]\n\nThis matches the previous calculation.\n\n#### Checking Option 2 Again:\n\nSimple interest for 10 years:\n\n\\[ A = 10,000 + 10,000 \\times 0.12 \\times 10 = 10,000 + 12,000 = 22,000 \\]\n\n#### Difference:\n\n\\[ 22,000 - 21,625.90 = 374.10 \\]\n\nStill, \\$374 doesn't match any options. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the payment at 5 years is not half of the amount owed but half of the original principal. Let's explore this possibility.\n\n#### Alternative Interpretation for Option 1:\n\nSuppose the payment at 5 years is half of the original principal, i.e., \\$5,000.\n\n1. Calculate the amount owed after 5 years:\n\n\\[ A_5 = 10,000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{20} \\approx 16,386.16 \\]\n\n2. Alex pays \\$5,000 at 5 years.\n\n3. Remaining balance:\n\n\\[ \\text{Remaining} = 16,386.16 - 5,000 = 11,386.16 \\]\n\n4. This remaining balance accrues interest for another 5 years:\n\n\\[ A_{10} = 11,386.16 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{20} \\approx 11,386.16 \\times 1.63861644 \\approx 18,652.64 \\]\n\n5. Total payment:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Option 1} = 5,000 + 18,652.64 = 23,652.64 \\]\n\nDifference from Option 2:\n\n\\[ 23,652.64 - 22,000 = 1,652.64 \\]\n\nStill doesn't match the options.\n\n#### Another Approach:\n\nMaybe the payment at 5 years is half of the original principal, and the remaining half continues to accrue interest for the full 10 years.\n\n1. First half: \\$5,000 borrowed for 5 years.\n\n\\[ A_{5,\\text{half}} = 5,000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{20} \\approx 5,000 \\times 1.63861644 \\approx 8,193.08 \\]\n\n2. Second half: \\$5,000 borrowed for 10 years.\n\n\\[ A_{10,\\text{half}} = 5,000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{40} \\]\n\nCalculate \\( (1.025)^{40} \\):\n\n\\[ (1.025)^{40} \\approx 2.68506384 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ A_{10,\\text{half}} \\approx 5,000 \\times 2.68506384 \\approx 13,425.32 \\]\n\n3. Total payment under Option 1:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Option 1} = 8,193.08 + 13,425.32 = 21,618.40 \\]\n\nDifference from Option 2:\n\n\\[ 22,000 - 21,618.40 = 381.60 \\]\n\nRounded to the nearest dollar: \\$382\n\nThis matches option C. It seems the initial calculation was correct, but there was a miscalculation in the difference.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{382} \\]\n\n"
