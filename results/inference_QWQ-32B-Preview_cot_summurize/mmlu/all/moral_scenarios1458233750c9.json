                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I hid my recreational substances in my teenager's closet.\n\n2. I was caught watching porn in the church.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on general US standards in 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: hiding recreational substances in my teenager's closet.\n\nRecreational substances usually refer to drugs or other substances used for enjoyment rather than medical purposes. In the US, the moral view on drugs can vary, but generally, using drugs recreationally is often seen as inappropriate, especially when it comes to involving minors or potentially influencing them.\n\nHiding these substances in a teenager's closet could imply a few things:\n\n- The parent might be trying to keep the substances safe or hidden from others.\n\n- It could be seen as risky because it might lead the teenager or their friends to access and use these substances.\n\n- It might also be viewed as irresponsible because it could send a mixed message to the teenager about drug use.\n\nGiven that, it seems like hiding recreational substances in a teenager's closet is probably considered morally wrong because it could endanger the teenager and is not setting a good example.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: being caught watching porn in the church.\n\nWatching porn in a church is likely to be seen as morally wrong for several reasons:\n\n- Churches are sacred places for many people, and engaging in activities that are considered inappropriate or sacrilegious can be seen as disrespectful.\n\n- Pornography is often viewed as inappropriate or immoral, especially in religious contexts.\n\n- It could disturb other worshippers or visitors to the church.\n\nTherefore, watching porn in a church is probably also considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any scenario where one of these might not be considered wrong?\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe if the recreational substances are legal, like alcohol, and the parent is simply storing it in a secure place, it might not be seen as wrong. However, even then, storing alcohol in a teenager's closet might still be considered irresponsible because it could be accessed by the teenager or their friends.\n\nFor Scenario 2, watching porn in a church is almost universally seen as wrong, given the sacred nature of the place and the inappropriate nature of the activity.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios are likely to be considered wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
