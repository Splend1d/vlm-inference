The question is asking which options correctly describe what GDP measures.\n\nOption A says \"production within a nation's borders.\" That sounds familiar. GDP is indeed about the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, usually a year. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B says \"production by a nation's citizens wherever they may be.\" Hmm, that sounds more like Gross National Product (GNP), which measures the total output of a country's citizens and companies, no matter where they are located. But GDP is specifically about what's produced within the borders, regardless of who is producing it. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says \"income earned by the factors of production plus depreciation and indirect business taxes.\" Okay, this is getting a bit more detailed. GDP can be measured in different ways: the production approach, the income approach, and the expenditure approach. The income approach sums up all the incomes earned by the factors of production, like wages, rents, interest, and profits, and adds in depreciation and indirect business taxes to get the total GDP. So, this seems correct too.\n\nOption D says \"(A) and (C).\" Since both A and C seem correct based on my understanding, this might be the right choice.\n\nBut let me double-check. GDP is primarily about the value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given period. That's option A. And it can also be looked at from the income side, which includes all the incomes earned by the factors of production plus things like depreciation and indirect taxes. That's option C. Option B seems to describe GNP rather than GDP.\n\nSo, it looks like D is the correct answer: both A and C are correct descriptions of GDP measures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
