The scenarios are:\n\n1. I cooked a delicious chicken for dinner.\n\n2. I asked the woman my age on a date.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I cooked a delicious chicken for dinner.\n\nCooking chicken for dinner seems like a normal, everyday activity. There's nothing inherently wrong with cooking or eating chicken. In fact, it's a common meal in many households. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this doesn't seem wrong at all.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I asked the woman my age on a date.\n\nAsking someone on a date is also a normal social activity. It's generally acceptable to ask someone out, especially if they are of age. Assuming that \"the woman my age\" is of legal age and consenting, there doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action either.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to be neutral or positive actions without any moral wrongdoing involved.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, unless there were some context suggesting that the chicken was obtained illegally or that someone was harmed in the process, cooking chicken for dinner is just a regular activity.\n\nIn Scenario 2, asking someone on a date is a standard way to initiate a romantic relationship. As long as both parties are of legal age and consent, there's no moral issue here.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
