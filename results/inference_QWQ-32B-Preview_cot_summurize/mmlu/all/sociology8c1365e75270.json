                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which one of these options isn't a feature of globalization. So, first things first, I should probably understand what globalization means. I know that globalization refers to the way the world is becoming more connected, both economically and culturally, through increased trade, communication, and the spread of ideas. It's like the whole world is shrinking in a way, because things that happen in one part of the world can affect people everywhere.\n\nOption A says \"an increasing awareness of the world as a whole.\" That makes sense. With globalization, people are more aware of what's going on globally. We have news from all over the world at our fingertips, and social media connects us with people from different countries and cultures. So, I think that's definitely a feature of globalization.\n\nOption B is \"the extended power of nation states.\" Hmm, this is interesting. Nation states are countries, right? So, is globalization about countries becoming more powerful? Well, actually, some people argue that globalization can sometimes reduce the power of nation states because global markets and international organizations can influence a country's decisions. For example, a country might have to follow certain rules set by the World Trade Organization, even if they don't entirely agree with them. So, maybe the extended power of nation states isn't a feature of globalization. In fact, it might be the opposite.\n\nOption C says \"the destruction of distance through communications technologies.\" That sounds spot on. Thanks to the internet, smartphones, and all kinds of communication tools, distances don't matter as much as they used to. We can talk to people on the other side of the world instantly, and businesses can operate globally without the hindrance of physical distance. So, this is definitely a feature of globalization.\n\nOption D is \"the stretching of social relations beyond national boundaries.\" Again, this seems like a key aspect of globalization. People are making friends, doing business, and forming relationships with people from other countries more than ever before. Globalization breaks down the barriers that used to limit social interactions to local or national levels.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems like option B, \"the extended power of nation states,\" doesn't fit with the other options. In fact, it might be the opposite of what globalization does, as it can sometimes diminish the power of nation states in favor of global networks and institutions.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. But just to be sure, maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me look up a quick definition of globalization to confirm. According to my textbook, globalization is the process of increasing interconnectedness and interdependence among countries through the increase in flow of goods, services, information, and people across international borders. It emphasizes the reduction of national boundaries' significance in economic, political, and social activities.\n\nSo, again, it talks about reducing the significance of national boundaries, which aligns with options A, C, and D, but not really with option B, which suggests an extension of nation states' power.\n\nMaybe another way to look at it is to consider if there's any way that globalization extends the power of nation states. Perhaps in some cases, countries can project their power further globally due to globalization, but overall, it seems like globalization tends to distribute power more evenly across global networks rather than concentrating it in nation states.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is B, \"the extended power of nation states,\" because globalization generally leads to a diffusion of power beyond the control of individual nation states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
