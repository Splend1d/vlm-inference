                    "text": "Selye's general adaptation syndrome is a model that describes the body's non-specific response to stress. It consists of three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. The key endocrine glands involved in this process are the adrenal and pituitary glands.\n\nThe adrenal glands produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which play crucial roles in the body's stress response. The pituitary gland, often referred to as the \"master gland,\" regulates the activity of other endocrine glands, including the adrenals, through the release of various hormones.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. adrenal and pituitary.\n\nOption A, thyroid and thymus, is incorrect because while the thyroid gland is involved in metabolism and the thymus in immune function, they are not the primary mediators of the general adaptation syndrome.\n\nOption C, thyroid and parathyroid, is also incorrect for similar reasons. Although these glands have important functions in the body, they are not central to the stress response as described by Selye.\n\nOption D, pancreas and pineal, is incorrect as well. The pancreas plays a role in blood sugar regulation, and the pineal gland is involved in sleep-wake cycles, but neither is primarily associated with the general adaptation syndrome.\n\nIt's important to note that while other glands and systems in the body may be affected by stress, Selye's model specifically highlights the role of the adrenal and pituitary glands in mediating the body's response to stress.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nSelye, H.
