                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about international law. So, the question is: \"Who is an 'injured State' in the law of international responsibility?\" And we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, option A says: \"A State is 'injured' in case that it has suffered damage from the internationally wrongful conduct.\" Hmm, that sounds plausible. In many areas of law, injury is associated with some kind of harm or damage. So, if a state suffers damage due to another state's wrongful act, it makes sense that it would be considered injured.\n\nOption B says: \"A State is 'injured' in cases where there has been a violation of a peremptory norm of international law.\" Now, peremptory norms, or jus cogens, are fundamental principles that all states must follow, and no state can derogate from them. So, if a peremptory norm is violated, it's a serious breach. But does that automatically make any state an \"injured state\"? Maybe not necessarily. It might affect the international community as a whole, but not necessarily cause direct damage to a specific state.\n\nOption C states: \"A State is 'injured' should it acknowledge the existence of the internationally wrongful conduct.\" This seems a bit subjective. Just because a state acknowledges that a wrongful conduct has occurred doesn't necessarily mean it has been injured by it. Acknowledgment is more about recognizing that a breach has happened, not about suffering any consequences from it.\n\nOption D says: \"A State is 'injured' if the obligation breached was owed to it individually, or if it was owed to a group of states, including that state, and it was specially affected.\" This seems comprehensive. It takes into account both bilateral obligations and multilateral ones where a state is particularly affected.\n\nLet me think about this. In international law, states can have obligations towards each other individually or as part of a group. For example, a bilateral treaty would create obligations between two specific states, while a multilateral treaty would bind multiple states.\n\nIf a state has an obligation owed to it individually and that obligation is breached, it's logical to consider that state as injured because it's the direct addressee of the obligation.\n\nSimilarly, in cases where an obligation is owed to a group of states, but a particular state within that group is specially affected by the breach, it should also be considered injured. \"Specially affected\" probably means that the breach has caused it particular harm or impairment of its rights, even if the obligation was not exclusively directed at it.\n\nComparing this with option A, which focuses on suffering damage, option D seems more inclusive. Damage is often a element of injury, but in international law, injury can also encompass impairment of rights or interests, even if there's no tangible damage.\n\nOption B, about peremptory norms, seems too broad. While violating a peremptory norm is a grave matter, not every violation directly injures a particular state. It's more about maintaining the fabric of international law.\n\nOption C is about acknowledgment, which doesn't necessarily correlate with suffering injury. A state might acknowledge a breach without being affected by it.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option D seems to be the most accurate definition of an \"injured state\" in the law of international responsibility.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or if I'm missing something.\n\nOption A focuses on damage, which is a part of injury, but perhaps not the entire picture. Option D seems to cover both the nature of the obligation and the effect on the state, which aligns better with the legal concept.\n\nAlso, in international law, the concept of injury is important because it determines which states have standing to complain about a breach. It's not just about any state wanting to enforce international law, but specifically those states that have been affected by the breach.\n\nSo, to sum it up, an injured state is one that has suffered damage or impairment due to a breach of an obligation owed to it individually or to a group of states where it is specially affected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
