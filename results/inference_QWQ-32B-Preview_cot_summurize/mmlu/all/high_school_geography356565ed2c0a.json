                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about boundary problems between the United States and Mexico. The options are ownership of fertile ground, land use, irredentism, and immigration. I need to pick which one of these issues is causing the boundary problems.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these terms means.\n\nOwnership of fertile ground probably refers to disputes over who has the rights to use and profit from productive agricultural land along the border.\n\nLand use could be about how the land is being utilized on either side, maybe farming, urban development, conservation, etc., and disagreements arising from that.\n\nIrredentism is a new term for me. I think it has something to do with a country wanting to claim territory that is part of another country, based on ethnic or national ties.\n\nImmigration is the movement of people across borders, which is a big issue between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nNow, considering the context of the U.S.-Mexico border, which of these is most likely to cause boundary problems?\n\nOwnership of fertile ground could be an issue, but I think land use might be more comprehensive, as it includes not just agriculture but also other uses like building homes, industries, or parks.\n\nIrredentism sounds serious; if one country is trying to claim part of the other's territory, that would definitely cause boundary problems.\n\nImmigration is more about people crossing the border, but it might also impact the border regions and their management.\n\nBut the question is specifically about boundary problems, which seems to be more about the demarcation and control of the physical border line.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Ownership of fertile ground: While important, this seems more specific to certain areas and might not cover the entire border.\n\nB. Land use: This could be a factor, as different uses on either side could lead to conflicts, but again, it might not be the primary cause of boundary problems.\n\nC. Irredentism: This seems more political and less relevant to the current situation between the U.S. and Mexico, as I don't recall any significant claims of one country over the other's territory based on ethnic ties.\n\nD. Immigration: This has been a major issue between the two countries, with debates over illegal crossings, border security, and immigration policies.\n\nConsidering all this, I think immigration is the most likely answer. Boundary problems often arise from the attempts to control and manage the movement of people across the border.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps land use and ownership are also significant, especially in areas where the border is not clearly defined or where there are shared resources like waterways.\n\nAlternatively, irredentism might have historical significance, but I don't think it's currently a major issue between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nMaybe I should look up some information about current boundary issues between the two countries.\n\nUpon a quick search, I see that immigration is indeed a major point of contention, with debates over building a wall, enforcing immigration laws, and dealing with undocumented immigrants.\n\nThere are also issues related to land use, such as environmental concerns and cross-border pollution.\n\nOwnership of fertile ground might be relevant in some areas, but it's probably not the main issue.\n\nIrredentism doesn't seem to be a current issue in this context.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D. Immigration, as it is the most prominent and widely discussed issue related to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's another option that could be equally valid.\n\nFor example, land use could encompass issues like border security infrastructure, which might require using land in certain ways that one country or the other disagrees with.\n\nSimilarly, ownership of fertile ground could be related to water rights and access to agricultural land, which are important in border regions.\n\nHowever, I still think immigration is the most comprehensive answer, as it touches on many aspects of the boundary problems, including security, economic impacts, and social issues.\n\nSo, I'll go with D. Immigration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
