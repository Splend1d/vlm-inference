                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the Hohokam and their connections to Mesoamerican culture. The options are about different practices: ritual consumption of maize beer, ritual human sacrifice, playing ritual ball games, and construction of stepped pyramids. I need to figure out which one of these the Hohokam borrowed from Mesoamerican cultures.\n\nFirst, I should recall who the Hohokam were. The Hohokam were a Native American culture that lived in the present-day southern Arizona area, particularly in the Salt River valley. They were known for their extensive irrigation systems, their trade networks, and their pottery and architecture.\n\nMesoamerican cultures, on the other hand, refer to the pre-Columbian civilizations that developed in Mesoamerica, which includes parts of Mexico and Central America. These cultures are known for their advancements in agriculture, astronomy, mathematics, and architecture, as well as their complex religious and ritual practices.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Ritual consumption of maize beer: Maize was a staple crop in both Mesoamerican and Hohokam cultures. It's possible that they both had rituals involving the consumption of maize beer, but I need to see if there's evidence that the Hohokam borrowed this practice from Mesoamerica.\n\nB. Ritual human sacrifice: Human sacrifice was a practice in some Mesoamerican cultures, most famously in the Aztec civilization. However, I don't recall hearing about human sacrifice being a common practice among the Hohokam. It's possible that they engaged in some form of ritual sacrifice, but I'm not sure if there's direct evidence of human sacrifice.\n\nC. Playing ritual ball games: Mesoamerican cultures are well-known for their ritual ball games, often played in ball courts that were built as part of their ceremonial centers. The games had religious significance and were sometimes associated with human sacrifice. I wonder if the Hohokam had similar ball courts or played similar games.\n\nD. Construction of stepped pyramids: Stepped pyramids are a common architectural feature in Mesoamerican cultures, used as bases for temples and other ceremonial structures. The Hohokam also built platform mounds, but I'm not sure if they constructed true stepped pyramids.\n\nLet me consider each option more carefully.\n\nStarting with option A, ritual consumption of maize beer: Maize was a fundamental crop for both Mesoamerican and Hohokam cultures. It's likely that both cultures had rituals involving the consumption of foods and beverages made from maize. However, I need to determine if the Hohokam specifically borrowed this practice from Mesoamerica or if it developed independently.\n\nMoving on to option B, ritual human sacrifice: While human sacrifice was practiced in some Mesoamerican cultures, there isn't substantial evidence that the Hohokam engaged in this practice to the same extent. There have been some findings suggesting that the Hohokam may have practiced ritualistic killing, but it's not as prominent in their culture as it was in some Mesoamerican societies. Therefore, it might not be the best answer for this question.\n\nOption C, playing ritual ball games: Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Maya and Aztecs, had elaborate ball games with significant religious and ceremonial importance. These games were often played in specialized ball courts. As for the Hohokam, there is evidence that they built ball courts similar to those found in Mesoamerica. In fact, the Hohokam ball courts are one of the indicators of cultural exchange or influence between the Hohokam and Mesoamerican cultures. So, this seems like a strong candidate for a practice that the Hohokam borrowed from Mesoamerica.\n\nOption D, construction of stepped pyramids: Mesoamerican cultures are famous for their stepped pyramids, such as the Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan or the pyramids at Chichen Itza. These pyramids served as bases for temples and were central to religious ceremonies. The Hohokam, on the other hand, built platform mounds, which are flattened earthen mounds often used for ceremonial purposes or as platforms for structures. While these mounds share some similarities with Mesoamerican pyramids, they are not exactly the same. The Hohokam mounds are generally less steep and lack the stepped design characteristic of Mesoamerican pyramids. Therefore, it's less likely that the Hohokam borrowed the construction of stepped pyramids from Mesoamerica.\n\nConsidering all the options, it seems that the strongest evidence for borrowing from Mesoamerican culture is in the construction of ball courts and the playing of ritual ball games. There is archaeological evidence of Hohokam ball courts, and their similarity to Mesoamerican ball courts suggests cultural influence or exchange.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. playing ritual ball games.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
