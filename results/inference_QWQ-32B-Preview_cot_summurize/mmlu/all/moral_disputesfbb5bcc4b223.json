Cloned individuals are likely to experience psychological and social identity problems.\n\nB. Cloned individuals cannot be created quickly enough.\n\nC. There are no problems with cloning.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nI need to figure out which one Kass would agree with. I remember that Kass was known for his concerns about cloning, especially human cloning. He was part of the President's Council on Bioethics and had some strong opinions on the ethical implications of cloning.\n\nLet me think about option A: psychological and social identity problems. Cloning involves creating a genetically identical copy of an existing being. If you have a clone, they would essentially be a genetic copy of someone else, which could lead to issues with their sense of self and identity. They might feel like they're living in the shadow of the original person, or people might treat them differently knowing they're a clone. So, it makes sense that Kass would consider this a problem.\n\nOption B: cloned individuals cannot be created quickly enough. I don't recall Kass mentioning anything about the speed of cloning. His concerns were more about the ethical and moral aspects rather than the practicalities of how fast clones can be produced. So, this seems less likely.\n\nOption C: there are no problems with cloning. Given that Kass was known for his criticisms of cloning, it's unlikely that he would say there are no problems with it.\n\nOption D: none of the above. Well, if none of the above, that would mean that Kass's problem with cloning isn't any of the listed issues.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is A. Cloned individuals are likely to experience psychological and social identity problems. This aligns with the ethical concerns that Kass had about cloning, particularly human cloning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
