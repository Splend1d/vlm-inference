                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question on jurisdiction. It's asking about the \"ordinary geographical scope of jurisdiction.\" The options are:\n\nA. Jurisdiction is ordinarily extra-territorial\n\nB. Jurisdiction is ordinarily on the high seas\n\nC. Jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial\n\nD. Jurisdiction is determined by the location of the offender.\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct. Let's start by understanding what jurisdiction means. Jurisdiction generally refers to the authority of a court or a legal body to hear and decide a case. It's about the limits of legal authority in terms of geography and subject matter.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about the geographical scope, so I need to focus on where this authority applies.\n\nOption A says \"jurisdiction is ordinarily extra-territorial.\" Extra-territorial means beyond the borders of a country. So, this would suggest that courts usually have authority outside their own country's borders. But I don't think that's generally the case. Most countries' laws and courts have jurisdiction within their own territories unless there are specific international agreements or laws that extend their reach.\n\nOption B says \"jurisdiction is ordinarily on the high seas.\" The high seas are areas of the ocean that are not within any country's territorial waters. I know that there are international laws that apply to the high seas, governed by bodies like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). But saying that jurisdiction is ordinarily on the high seas seems too narrow, as jurisdiction typically applies to a country's own territory, including its territorial waters, but not necessarily the high seas unless there are specific treaties or laws.\n\nOption C says \"jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial.\" This sounds familiar. I think I've learned that jurisdiction is generally territorial, meaning that a country's laws apply within its own borders. This makes sense because countries have sovereignty over their own territories. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\nOption D says \"jurisdiction is determined by the location of the offender.\" This seems a bit too specific. While the location of the offender can be relevant in determining jurisdiction, especially in criminal cases, it's not the only factor. For example, in civil cases, jurisdiction might be based on where the cause of action occurred or where the parties reside.\n\nLet me think about this some more. If jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial, that would mean that legal authority is primarily based on geographical boundaries. This aligns with the principle of territoriality in international law, where states have sovereignty over their own territories.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are exceptions or other principles that might make another option correct.\n\nFor example, extra-territorial jurisdiction does exist in some cases, like when a country exercises jurisdiction over its own citizens abroad or in cases of universal jurisdiction for serious crimes like piracy or war crimes. However, these are exceptions rather than the ordinary rule.\n\nSimilarly, on the high seas, jurisdiction is usually based on the principle of flag state jurisdiction, meaning that the ship's owning state has jurisdiction over vessels flying its flag. But again, this is a specific case and not the ordinary scope of jurisdiction.\n\nAlso, considering the location of the offender, while important, isn't the sole determinant of jurisdiction. For instance, in some cases, jurisdiction might be based on where the crime was committed, where the effects of the crime were felt, or where the plaintiff and defendant reside.\n\nGiven this, it seems that option C, \"jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial,\" is the most accurate statement. It reflects the general principle that legal authority is bounded by geographical territories.\n\nTo confirm, I can think of some examples. For instance, a country's tax laws generally apply to individuals and entities within its borders. Similarly, criminal laws apply to acts committed within the country's territory.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. Jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
