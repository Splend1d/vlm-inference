                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says, \"Client thinks she has been slandered. What of the following is not true about slander?\" And then there are four options: A, B, C, and D. I need to figure out which one of these statements is not true regarding slander.\n\nFirst, I should recall what slander is. Slander is a type of defamation that is spoken, as opposed to libel, which is written. So, option A says, \"It is spoken defamation.\" That sounds correct.\n\nNext, option B says, \"Plaintiff has to prove special damages, unless it falls into slander per se.\" I think I remember that in slander cases, the plaintiff generally needs to prove that they suffered special damages, like loss of money or reputation, unless the statement falls into a category of slander per se, which are statements that are so damaging that damage is presumed. So, that seems accurate.\n\nOption C says, \"The statement does not have to be published if it constitutes slander per se.\" Hmm, this is tricky. In legal terms, \"published\" means that the statement was communicated to at least one person other than the plaintiff. In slander cases, publication is required; the statement has to be spoken to someone else besides the plaintiff. So, even if it's slander per se, I believe the statement still needs to be published. I think this might be the false statement here.\n\nLet me check option D: \"There are four slander per se categories.\" I recall that there are certain types of statements that are considered slander per se, and I think there are four main categories: imputing criminal conduct, imputing infectious disease, imputing unchastity in a woman, and imputing inability to perform or unfitness in a person's business, trade, or profession. So, that seems correct.\n\nLooking back, option C seems to be the one that's not true, because even in slander per se, the statement must be published to at least one other person besides the plaintiff. So, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
