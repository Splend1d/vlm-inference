                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which option most likely increases investment demand. Let's look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A says that investment demand most likely increases when real GDP decreases. Hmm, usually when GDP decreases, it means the economy is slowing down or maybe even in a recession. In such times, businesses might be hesitant to invest because the future looks uncertain and risky. So, I think investment demand would decrease when real GDP decreases, not increase. So, maybe A is not the right answer.\n\nOption B says that investment demand most likely increases when the cost of acquiring and maintaining capital equipment rises. Well, if it costs more to get and keep machinery or other capital, businesses might think twice before investing. Higher costs could discourage investment, so I don't think B is correct.\n\nOption C says that investment demand most likely increases when investor optimism improves. That makes sense. If investors are more optimistic about the future, they're probably more willing to put their money into new projects or expand their businesses. So, improved optimism should lead to higher investment demand.\n\nOption D says that investment demand most likely increases when the real rate of interest rises. Now, interest rates affect the cost of borrowing. If real interest rates go up, borrowing becomes more expensive. That might discourage investment because it costs more to finance projects. So, I think higher real interest rates would decrease investment demand.\n\nComparing all these, option C seems to make the most sense. When investors are more optimistic, they're more likely to invest, which increases investment demand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
