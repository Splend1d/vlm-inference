Quick response to change, C. Discipline and stability, D. Small span of control.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a hierarchical structure is. In organizations, a hierarchy is a way of organizing people where there are levels of authority, with each level reporting to the one above it. It's like a pyramid, with the top management at the apex and the lower-level employees at the base.\n\nNow, the question is asking for what is NOT an advantage of this type of structure. So, I need to identify which of these options is not something positive about a hierarchical structure.\n\nLet's look at option A: Clear chain of command. In a hierarchy, there is a very defined path of authority and communication. Everyone knows who their boss is and who they report to. This clarity can help in decision-making and accountability. So, this seems like an advantage.\n\nOption B: Quick response to change. This one is interesting. In a hierarchical structure, decisions often have to pass through multiple levels before they are implemented. This can sometimes lead to delays because each level may need to review and approve the decision. So, it might not be the quickest way to respond to change. In contrast, flatter organizations might be able to respond more quickly because there are fewer layers to go through.\n\nOption C: Discipline and stability. Hierarchies often emphasize rules, procedures, and established ways of doing things. This can lead to a stable and disciplined work environment, which can be advantageous in certain industries where consistency is key.\n\nOption D: Small span of control. Span of control refers to the number of subordinates a manager is responsible for. In a hierarchical structure, managers typically have a smaller span of control because the pyramid has many layers. This can allow for more personalized attention to each employee, which can be beneficial for management and development.\n\nSo, considering all these points, option B, \"Quick response to change,\" might not be an advantage of a hierarchical structure because the multiple layers can slow down decision-making and implementation.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about real-world examples. In a large corporation with many levels of management, if a new opportunity arises, it might take time for that information to percolate up to the decision-makers and then for the decisions to filter back down through the layers. In contrast, in a startup with a flat structure, decisions can be made more\u8fc5\u901f because there are fewer people involved in the approval process.\n\nTherefore, I believe that \"Quick response to change\" is not an advantage of a hierarchical structure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
