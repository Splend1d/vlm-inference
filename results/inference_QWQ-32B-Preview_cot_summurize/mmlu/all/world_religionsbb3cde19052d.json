The term \"unveiling\" suggests revealing the meaning or understanding of the text, which aligns with what tafsir does. Fiqh is more about Islamic jurisprudence, dhikr is remembrance of God, and ijtihad is the process of making a legal decision by independent interpretation. So, tafsir seems the most appropriate choice here."
