                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a puck being pushed across a table. Let me try to understand what's going on. The student pushes the puck from x = 0 to x = 0.2 m, and then after letting go, the puck keeps moving until it stops at x = 1.2 m. So, the puck starts at x = 0, gets pushed to x = 0.2 m, and then continues on its own to x = 1.2 m before stopping.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the net force on the puck when it's at x = 1.0 m. So, at that point, the student has already let go, meaning he's not applying any force anymore. The puck is just sliding and slowing down due to friction or some other resistive force.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. The net force is in the negative direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. If the puck is slowing down while moving in the positive direction, that means there's a net force acting against its motion, which would be in the negative direction.\n\nB. The net force is down, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s^2 downward.\n\nWait, the puck is on a table, so gravity is acting downward, but the table is supporting it, so the normal force should be balancing the gravitational force. Therefore, the net force shouldn't be down. Maybe this isn't the correct choice.\n\nC. The net force is in the positive direction, because the student\u2019s push caused the puck to speed up in the positive direction.\n\nBut the student has already let go, so his push is no longer acting on the puck. At x = 1.0 m, the only forces acting on the puck are probably friction and possibly air resistance, both of which would be opposing the motion, so negative direction.\n\nD. The net force is zero, because the student\u2019s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.\n\nAgain, the student has let go, so his push is not acting anymore. So, only friction is acting, which would be in the negative direction, so the net force isn't zero.\n\nWait, but when the student is pushing, his force is in the positive direction, and friction is in the negative direction. If he's pushing hard enough to make the puck accelerate in the positive direction, then his force must be greater than friction. So, net force is positive.\n\nBut in this case, the question is about when the puck is at x = 1.0 m, which is after the student has let go. So, only friction is acting, slowing the puck down.\n\nSo, the net force should be in the negative direction due to friction.\n\nBut option A says the net force is negative because the puck is slowing down in the positive direction. That seems correct.\n\nOption B suggests the net force is down due to gravity, but since the table is supporting the puck, the net force shouldn't have a downward component.\n\nOption C says the net force is positive because the student\u2019s push caused it to speed up, but the student has already let go, so his push is no longer acting.\n\nOption D says the net force is zero because the student\u2019s push equals friction, but again, the push is no longer acting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A.\n\nWait, but I feel like there might be something else to consider. Maybe air resistance or something else.\n\nBut in most physics problems involving objects sliding on a table, the main resistive force is friction.\n\nSo, I think A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
