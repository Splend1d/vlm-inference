Then, his mom gives in and lets him choose one candy if he stops crying. The question is asking how Jacob's crying behavior is being affected by his mom's actions. The options are: punished, associated, reinforced, or extinguished.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in this context.\n\n\"Punished\" usually means that a behavior is being discouraged by introducing something unpleasant or by removing something desirable. But in this case, Jacob's mom is giving in and letting him choose a candy, which seems like a positive outcome for Jacob. So, it doesn't seem like punishment.\n\n\"Associated\" might refer to connecting the crying behavior with something else, maybe the candy aisle or his mom's reaction. But I'm not sure if that's the exact term being used here.\n\n\"Reinforced\" means that the behavior is being strengthened or encouraged to happen again in the future. So, if Jacob's crying leads to getting candy, that might be reinforcing the crying behavior.\n\n\"Extinguished\" would mean that the behavior is being eliminated or stopped over time. But in this scenario, Jacob's mom giving in seems to encourage the crying, not eliminate it.\n\nLet me think about this again. Jacob cries when his mom won't let him buy candy, and then his mom lets him choose one candy if he stops crying. So, from Jacob's perspective, crying leads to getting candy, which is something he wants. Therefore, the crying behavior is being reinforced because it results in him getting what he wants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe his mom giving in is actually punishing the crying by giving him something to stop crying. But that doesn't make sense because punishment is meant to decrease a behavior, not satisfy it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a case of negative reinforcement. Negative reinforcement is when a behavior is strengthened because a negative condition is removed. In this case, Jacob's crying is stopped when he gets the candy, so maybe the removal of crying is being reinforced. But that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, I think the best answer is that Jacob's crying is being reinforced by his mom's giving in and letting him choose a candy. Because every time he cries, he gets what he wants, which is the candy. So, the crying behavior is being encouraged to happen again in the future.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. reinforced.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that this could be considered punishment or something else?\n\nWell, if his mom gave him something unpleasant or took something away when he cried, that might be punishment. But she's giving him something he wants, which is the opposite of punishment.\n\nAssociation might refer to classical conditioning, where two things are paired together. Maybe the crying is associated with getting candy, but I think \"reinforced\" is a better fit.\n\nExtinguished would imply that the crying stops over time, which isn't happening here since his mom gives in every time.\n\nSo, yeah, I think reinforced is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
