                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about auditing and going concern issues. So, the scenario is that an auditor has substantial doubt about the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern due to negative cash flows and working capital deficiencies. We need to figure out which aspect the auditor would be most concerned about among the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"going concern\" means. It's a fundamental assumption in accounting that a business will continue its operations indefinitely unless there's evidence to the contrary. When an auditor has doubts about this, it's a big red flag because it affects the reliability of the financial statements.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Control environment factors that affect the organizational structure.\n\nWhile the control environment is crucial for internal controls and overall governance, in the context of going concern issues, it might not be the primary concern here. Negative cash flows and working capital deficiencies are more directly related to the entity's financial health and ability to meet its obligations.\n\nB. Correlation of detection risk and inherent risk.\n\nDetection risk and inherent risk are components of audit risk, which is the risk that the auditor will issue an inappropriate opinion on the financial statements. Inherent risk is the susceptibility of an assertion to a material misstatement assuming there are no related controls, while detection risk is the risk that the auditor will not detect a material misstatement.\n\nWhile understanding these risks is important, the question is specifically about the auditor's concern regarding the going concern status due to financial issues. So, this might not be the most direct concern in this scenario.\n\nC. Effectiveness of the entity\u2019s internal control activities.\n\nInternal control activities are designed to help ensure that the entity's operations are efficient and effective, and that financial reporting is reliable. However, in the context of going concern issues arising from negative cash flows and working capital deficiencies, the auditor might be more concerned about the financial statements' accuracy and the entity's viability rather than the internal controls per se.\n\nD. Possible effects on the entity\u2019s financial statements.\n\nThis seems like the most directly relevant concern. If there's substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, it could have significant implications for the financial statements. For example, assets might need to be valued differently, liabilities might need to be classified as current rather than long-term, and additional disclosures might be required.\n\nMoreover, according to auditing standards, when an auditor has substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, they are required to consider the implications for the audit and may need to modify their opinion accordingly.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, the auditor would be most concerned about the possible effects on the entity\u2019s financial statements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
