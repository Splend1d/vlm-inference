                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Which of the following refers to the systematic study of the earth's layers?\" and there are four options: A. primatology, B. stratigraphy, C. weathering, and D. archaeology. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is about studying the earth's layers.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means. Let's start with A, primatology. I think primatology has something to do with primates, like monkeys and apes. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's about studying those animals. So, that doesn't sound like it's about the earth's layers.\n\nNext is B, stratigraphy. I'm not entirely sure what that is, but I think it has something to do with layers. Strat- sounds like layers, like strata, which means layers or beds of rock. So, maybe stratigraphy is the study of rock layers. That sounds promising.\n\nOption C is weathering. I know that weathering is about how rocks and minerals break down over time due to environmental factors like wind, water, and temperature changes. It's more about the processes that affect the earth's surface and materials, but not necessarily about studying the layers themselves.\n\nThen there's D, archaeology. That's the study of human history and prehistory through the excavation of sites and the analysis of artifacts and other physical remains. So, archaeologists dig up old human settlements and study what people did in the past. That doesn't seem directly related to studying the earth's layers, although they might encounter different layers in the ground while excavating.\n\nWait a minute, in archaeology, they do talk about stratigraphy sometimes, because the layers in the ground can correspond to different time periods. But I think that's a bit different from studying the earth's layers in a geological sense.\n\nGoing back to stratigraphy, I recall that in geology, stratigraphy is the study of rock layers and their arrangement, especially in terms of their age and the time periods they represent. Geologists use stratigraphy to understand the sequence of events in the earth's history.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, primatology is about primates, weathering is about the breakdown of rocks, archaeology is about human history, and stratigraphy is about the study of rock layers. Therefore, stratigraphy seems to be the one that refers to the systematic study of the earth's layers.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should double-check the other options. Primatology is definitely not about earth layers; that's biology. Weathering is a geological process, but it's more about how materials change over time, not about studying the layers. Archaeology involves looking at layers, but again, it's focused on human artifacts and history.\n\nStratigraphy, on the other hand, is specifically about the layers of the earth, their composition, age, and the relationships between them. It's a fundamental concept in geology and helps in understanding the geological history of an area.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B, stratigraphy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
