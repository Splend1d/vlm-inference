                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of the following is an example of parietal art? A. beadwork B. inscribed bone C. ivory statues D. cave paintings.\" I need to pick the correct one, but I'm not entirely sure what \"parietal art\" means. I think it has something to do with ancient art, maybe from cave dwellers or something like that. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I should probably look up what \"parietal art\" is. Parietal comes from the word \"parietal,\" which relates to walls. So, parietal art might refer to art that's on walls. That makes me think of cave paintings, where ancient people would paint on the walls of caves. So, maybe cave paintings are parietal art.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Beadwork - that sounds more like decorative art or jewelry. Not sure if that's on walls.\n\nB. Inscribed bone - that might be engravings on bones, perhaps for tools or ceremonial purposes. Not necessarily on walls.\n\nC. Ivory statues - these are three-dimensional sculptures, probably held or placed somewhere, not necessarily on walls.\n\nD. Cave paintings - this seems directly related to art on walls, specifically cave walls.\n\nSo, based on my initial thought, cave paintings seem like the most likely answer. But I should make sure I understand what parietal art really is.\n\nI recall that in archaeology, parietal art refers to art that's created on permanent surfaces, like the walls of caves or rock shelters. It includes paintings, engravings, and carvings directly on the rock surface. So, it's art that's fixed in place and can't be moved.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Beadwork - this is more portable and not fixed to a wall or surface. So, probably not parietal art.\n\nB. Inscribed bone - again, this is an object that can be moved, not fixed to a wall. So, maybe not parietal art.\n\nC. Ivory statues - these are sculptures, likely meant to be held or placed on a surface, not attached to walls. So, probably not parietal art.\n\nD. Cave paintings - this fits the definition of parietal art, as it's art created directly on the walls of caves.\n\nTo be thorough, maybe I should double-check the definition of parietal art. According to my textbook, parietal art refers to artistic works that are found on the walls or ceilings of caves, rock shelters, or other natural formations. It's a type of prehistoric art that includes paintings, engravings, and bas-reliefs.\n\nSo, confirming that cave paintings are indeed parietal art. The other options seem to be more related to portable art, which is art that can be moved and is not fixed to a surface.\n\nPortable art includes things like beads, pendants, sculptures, and engravings on movable objects like bones, ivory, or stones. So, options A, B, and C all fall under portable art, whereas D is parietal art.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. cave paintings.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider if there are any exceptions or if any of the other options could sometimes be considered parietal art.\n\nFor example, inscribed bone might be found attached to a wall, but that seems unlikely. Typically, bones with inscriptions would be portable objects. Similarly, beadwork and ivory statues are usually small and meant to be carried or held.\n\nCave paintings, on the other hand, are always fixed in place, as they're painted or engraved directly onto the rock surface.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there's any confusion here. The clear answer is D. cave paintings.\n\nI'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
