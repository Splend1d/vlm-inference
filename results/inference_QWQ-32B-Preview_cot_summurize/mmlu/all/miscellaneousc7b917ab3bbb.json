The options are Neptune, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn.\n\nFirst, I know that Neptune has moons because I remember Triton, which is a large moon with a retrograde orbit. So, Neptune has moons, probably more than one.\n\nNext, Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. I think Mercury doesn't have any moons. I don't recall hearing about any moons orbiting Mercury.\n\nThen there's Mars. Mars has two small moons called Phobos and Deimos. So, Mars does have moons.\n\nLastly, Saturn is known for its many moons, including Titan, which is larger than Mercury itself. Saturn has a large number of moons, so it's not the one without any.\n\nSo, between these options, Mercury is the planet that has no known moons.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again. Neptune has moons, Mars has two, Saturn has many, and Mercury has none. Yes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
