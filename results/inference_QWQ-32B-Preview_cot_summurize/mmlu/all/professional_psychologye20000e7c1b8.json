So, the question is: \"___________ is caused by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles.\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Spina bifida\n\nB. Meningitis\n\nC. Hydrocephalus\n\nD. Encephalitis\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with spina bifida. I think spina bifida is a birth defect where there's an incomplete closure of the spine. So, it's more related to the spinal cord, not directly to the accumulation of fluid in the brain's ventricles.\n\nNext, meningitis. I know that meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, which are the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. It's usually caused by an infection. So, while it affects the brain, it's not specifically about the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles.\n\nThen, hydrocephalus. Hmm, the term \"hydro\" means water, and \"cephalus\" refers to the head. So, it must be something related to excess fluid in the head. Looking back at the question, it mentions an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles. That sounds a lot like hydrocephalus.\n\nLastly, encephalitis. I believe encephalitis is inflammation of the brain itself, often due to viral infections. Again, not directly related to the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like hydrocephalus is the condition caused by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles.\n\nBut let me double-check. I recall that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced in the ventricles of the brain and circulates around the brain and spinal cord, providing cushioning and nutrition. Sometimes, there can be an obstruction in the pathways where the CSF flows, leading to a buildup in the ventricles. This condition is known as hydrocephalus.\n\nSpina bifida, as I mentioned, is a different condition related to the spine. Meningitis involves inflammation of the meninges, which can be a complication of infection, but it's not primarily about CSF accumulation in the ventricles. Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain tissue itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Hydrocephalus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Hydrocephalus}} \\]"
