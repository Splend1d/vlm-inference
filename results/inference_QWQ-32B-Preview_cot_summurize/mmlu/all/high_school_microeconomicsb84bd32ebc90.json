                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about taxes and how they affect prices. So, the question is: \"A tax imposed on a supplier will more likely be passed on to the consumer in the form of a price increase if...?\"\n\nAnd we have four options:\n\nA. Price elasticity of demand is highly elastic.\n\nB. Price elasticity of demand is highly inelastic.\n\nC. Price elasticity of demand is unit elastic.\n\nD. Wage elasticity of demand is highly elastic.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what price elasticity of demand means. Price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nNow, if demand is highly elastic, that means that a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded. So, consumers are very sensitive to price changes.\n\nOn the other hand, if demand is highly inelastic, a change in price doesn't affect the quantity demanded much. Consumers don't really care about price changes; they'll buy the same amount anyway.\n\nUnit elastic means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price. So, the elasticity is exactly one.\n\nWage elasticity of demand, option D, seems a bit different. I think that refers to how much the demand for labor changes in response to a change in wages, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to look that up later.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the main question: When a tax is imposed on a supplier, under what condition is it more likely that the supplier will pass on the tax to the consumer through a price increase?\n\nI think this has to do with who bears the burden of the tax, the supplier or the consumer. In economics, the incidence of a tax depends on the price elasticities of supply and demand.\n\nIf demand is inelastic, consumers are less sensitive to price changes, so they'll keep buying even if the price goes up. That means the supplier can pass on more of the tax to the consumers because consumers don't have many alternatives.\n\nConversely, if demand is elastic, consumers are very sensitive to price changes. If the supplier tries to pass on the tax by increasing the price, consumers might switch to substitutes or buy less, reducing the supplier's sales and revenue. So, in this case, the supplier might have to absorb more of the tax themselves rather than passing it on to consumers.\n\nWait, but let's think about supply elasticity as well. If supply is elastic, suppliers can adjust their production easily in response to price changes, and if supply is inelastic, they can't.\n\nBut the question is only about the price elasticity of demand, so maybe we don't need to consider supply elasticity here.\n\nLooking back at the options, A says highly elastic demand, B says highly inelastic demand, C says unit elastic demand.\n\nSo, if demand is highly inelastic (option B), consumers don't respond much to price changes. That means the supplier can increase the price without losing many customers, so they're more likely to pass on the tax to consumers.\n\nIf demand is highly elastic (option A), consumers are very sensitive to price changes, so the supplier might not want to increase the price because they could lose a lot of sales. Therefore, they might have to absorb more of the tax themselves.\n\nUnit elastic (option C) means that percentage change in quantity demanded equals the percentage change in price. In this case, the revenue doesn't change when the price changes, but I'm not sure how that affects the passing of the tax to consumers.\n\nWait, maybe I should recall the formula for the division of the tax burden between suppliers and consumers based on elasticities.\n\nI think the formula is:\n\nTax burden on consumers = (Es / (Es + Ed)) * tax\n\nTax burden on producers = (Ed / (Es + Ed)) * tax\n\nWhere Es is the price elasticity of supply and Ed is the price elasticity of demand.\n\nWait, but the question only mentions the price elasticity of demand, not supply. Maybe I need to assume something about the elasticity of supply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a general rule about how the more inelastic the demand, the more the tax is passed on to consumers.\n\nLet me see. If demand is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), consumers have no choice but to buy the same quantity no matter the price. So, the supplier can pass on the entire tax to consumers.\n\nIf demand is perfectly elastic (Ed approaches infinity), any price increase will cause quantity demanded to drop to zero, so the supplier cannot pass on any tax to consumers.\n\nIn between, the more inelastic the demand, the more of the tax the consumer bears.\n\nSo, based on that, option B seems correct: if price elasticity of demand is highly inelastic, the supplier is more likely to pass on the tax to consumers through a price increase.\n\nOption A, highly elastic demand, would mean less likely to pass on the tax.\n\nOption C, unit elastic demand, is somewhere in the middle.\n\nOption D, wage elasticity of demand, seems irrelevant to this scenario, unless it affects the cost of production, but I think it's not directly related here.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Maybe wage elasticity of demand is about how sensitive the demand for labor is to wage changes, which might affect the supplier's costs, but I don't think that's what's being asked here.\n\nThe question is specifically about price elasticity of demand and how it affects the passing on of a tax to consumers.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B: price elasticity of demand is highly inelastic.\n\nThat makes sense because if demand is inelastic, consumers are less price-sensitive and will continue to buy the product even at a higher price, allowing the supplier to pass on the tax.\n\nIn contrast, if demand is elastic, consumers can easily switch to alternatives or reduce consumption in response to a price increase, so the supplier would have to absorb more of the tax to keep their sales up.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
