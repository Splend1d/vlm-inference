                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here, and I need to symbolize the sentence: \"Since the university raised tuition, the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it.\" The options are:\n\nA. (P \u2022 ~B) \u2283 U\n\nB. (U \u2283 P) \u2022 B\n\nC. U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B)\n\nD. U \u2283 (P \u2228 ~B)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the sentence means. The sentence seems to be saying that because the university raised tuition (U), it follows that the president approved of it (P) and the board didn't prevent it (~B). It's like saying the tuition raise happened, and as a result, we can conclude that the president approved and the board didn't stop it.\n\nSo, it's a conditional statement where the raising of tuition leads to the conclusion about the president's approval and the board's inaction.\n\nIn logic, a conditional is typically symbolized as \"if U, then something else,\" which is U \u2283 something else.\n\nLooking at options A and C, both have U as the antecedent, which matches. Option B has two conditionals combined, and D has a conditional with a disjunction in the consequent.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- U: the university raised tuition\n\n- P: the president approved of it\n\n- B: the board prevented it\n\nThe sentence is: \"Since the university raised tuition, the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it.\"\n\nThis seems to be saying: if U, then P and not B.\n\nIn logical terms: U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B)\n\nThat matches option C.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: (P \u2022 ~B) \u2283 U\n\nThis would mean: if the president approved and the board didn't prevent, then the university raised tuition. That's not the same as the original sentence, which is saying that because the university raised tuition, we can conclude that the president approved and the board didn't prevent it.\n\nOption B: (U \u2283 P) \u2022 B\n\nThis means: (if U then P) and B\n\nSo, the university raising tuition leads to the president's approval, and the board prevented it. But the original sentence says the board didn't prevent it, so this doesn't match.\n\nOption D: U \u2283 (P \u2228 ~B)\n\nThis means: if U, then P or not B\n\nBut the original sentence says both P and not B, not just one or the other.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct symbolization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
