                    "text": "I'm going to try to work through this real estate scenario step by step. It's a bit complex with multiple transactions over many years, so I need to keep track of who owned what and when, especially regarding the mortgage.\n\nFirst, there's a farmer who owned a tract of land with two farms: one on the eastern half and one on the western half. He recorded a general warranty deed conveying the property to his son. So, the son now owns the entire tract.\n\nTwo years later, the son gets a mortgage from his friend, securing the entire farm property. The friend records this mortgage. So, there's a mortgage on the entire property in favor of the friend.\n\nTwenty years pass, and the son sells the property to an investor with a general warranty deed, and the investor assumes the friend's mortgage. So, now the investor owns the whole property but is liable for the mortgage to the friend.\n\nThen, the investor subdivides the property and sells the western farm to a developer, retaining the eastern farm. The deed to the developer doesn't mention the mortgage. So, the developer buys just the western farm, and presumably, the mortgage still encumbers the entire original property, including the western farm.\n\nThe developer runs into zoning issues and sells the western farm to a florist, again without mentioning the mortgage in the deed.\n\nFinally, the florist enters into a contract to sell the western farm to a rancher for $75,000, with closing on January 15. The rancher does a title search on January 10 and discovers the friend's mortgage on the property.\n\nNow, the question is: given this sequence of events, which statement is correct regarding the rancher's rights upon discovering the mortgage?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The rancher would be entitled to rescind the real estate contract with the florist immediately.\n\nB. The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\n\nC. The mortgage would only encumber the eastern farm, not the western farm, because the investor's partition of the property created a joint tenancy.\n\nD. The encumbrance would not entitle the rancher to rescind the real estate contract until closing on January 15.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the status of the mortgage. The son originally took a mortgage on the entire property in favor of his friend, and this mortgage was recorded. Then, the son sold the property to the investor, who assumed the mortgage. So, the investor is now responsible for the mortgage, but the mortgage still encumbers the property.\n\nNext, the investor subdivided the property and sold the western farm to the developer. The deed to the developer didn't mention the mortgage. In states with notice recording statutes and following the title theory of mortgages, the mortgage follows the land, and recording provides notice to subsequent purchasers.\n\nSo, when the investor sold the western farm to the developer, the mortgage still encumbers that portion, even if it wasn't mentioned in the deed. Because the mortgage was recorded before the sale to the developer, the developer is bound by the mortgage, especially since the state has a notice recording statute.\n\nThen, the developer sold the western farm to the florist without mentioning the mortgage. Again, the mortgage is still encumbering the property, as it was recorded prior to the developer's sale.\n\nNow, the florist is selling to the rancher, and the rancher discovers the mortgage before closing. The question is about the rancher's rights upon discovering this encumbrance.\n\nOption A suggests that the rancher can rescind the contract immediately. Rescission generally allows a party to undo a contract under certain circumstances, such as misrepresentation or fraud. However, in real estate transactions, if a buyer discovers an encumbrance that wasn't disclosed, their rights might depend on whether the encumbrance renders the title unmarketable and whether they have the right to cancel the contract before closing.\n\nOption B states that the encumbrance renders the title unmarketable. An encumbrance can make title unmarketable if it significantly affects the value or use of the property and isn't disclosed or insured against. In this case, the mortgage is a significant encumbrance, and if it wasn't disclosed to the rancher, it might render the title unmarketable.\n\nOption C claims that the mortgage only encumbers the eastern farm, not the western farm, because the investor's partition created a joint tenancy. This seems incorrect. When the investor subdivided the property and sold part of it, the mortgage, being a pre-existing encumbrance, would generally attach to both portions unless specifically released or subordinated. So, the mortgage likely encumbers both the eastern and western farms.\n\nOption D says that the encumbrance wouldn't entitle the rancher to rescind the contract until closing on January 15. This suggests that the rancher has to wait until closing to take action, but in reality, if the encumbrance is a material fact that affects the title, the rancher might have the right to rescind earlier, especially if they discover it before closing.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems most accurate. The mortgage is a significant encumbrance that wasn't disclosed in the chain of title leading to the rancher, which could render the title unmarketable. Additionally, the rancher discovering this before closing might give them the right to rescind the contract, supporting option A as well. However, the question is specifically about which statement is correct given the discovery on January 10.\n\nGiven that, option B is directly about the effect of the encumbrance on the marketability of the title, which is a fundamental issue in real estate transactions. Option A might also be correct, but the question seems to focus on the status of the title rather than the rancher's contractual rights.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
