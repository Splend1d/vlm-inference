                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which principle isn't part of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The options are:\n\nA. Evolution is a gradual process that occurs over a long period of time.\n\nB. Every population has tremendous variation.\n\nC. Mutations are the main source of all variation in a population.\n\nD. Organisms will overpopulate an area, giving rise to competition.\n\nFirst, I remember that Darwin's theory is about how species change over time through natural selection. So, option A says that evolution is gradual and happens over a long time. That sounds right; Darwin thought that small changes accumulate over many generations.\n\nOption B mentions that every population has a lot of variation. Yeah, that makes sense too. Darwin observed that within species, there are many differences among individuals.\n\nNow, option C says that mutations are the main source of all variation in a population. Hmm, I think Darwin developed his theory before genetics were really understood. Mutations are a genetic concept, and Darwin didn't know about genes or mutations. So, maybe this isn't something Darwin included in his original theory.\n\nOption D talks about organisms overpopulating areas, leading to competition. That relates to the idea of struggle for existence, which is a key part of natural selection. Organisms produce more offspring than can survive, so there's competition for resources.\n\nSo, considering that, option C seems like it might not be part of Darwin's original theory because he didn't have the knowledge about genetics and mutations that we have today. I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
