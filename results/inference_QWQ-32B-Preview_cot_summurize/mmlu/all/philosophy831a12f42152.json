Let me see... formalism, that sounds familiar. Isn't formalism the idea that art should be evaluated based on its formal qualities, like color, line, shape, and composition?\n\nWait, but there's also something called informalism. I'm not sure what that is exactly. Maybe it's a less strict approach to art criticism? And then there's expressionism, which is more about the artist's emotions and feelings being expressed through the art. And structuralism seems more related to how elements in art are structured and how they relate to each other.\n\nSo, if formalism is about the formal elements of art, that might be the correct answer. But let me double-check. Maybe I should look up a quick definition for each option.\n\nFirst, formalism: It's an approach to interpreting art that focuses on the formal elements of the work, such as line, color, shape, and composition, rather than its historical context, the artist's intentions, or the work's subject matter.\n\nInformalism doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's not a standard term in art criticism. Perhaps it's a misnomer or a less common term.\n\nExpressionism is an art movement that emphasizes the artist's emotional experience over realistic representation. So, it's more about the feelings conveyed through the art.\n\nStructuralism is a broader concept that looks at how elements in a work are structured and relate to each other, not just in art but in other fields like anthropology and linguistics.\n\nGiven that, formalism seems to be the correct answer because it specifically deals with the form and formal elements of art.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might not be correct.\n\nExpressionism is about emotion, not form, so that doesn't fit.\n\nStructuralism is more about the structure and relationships between elements, which is slightly different from focusing solely on form.\n\nInformalism isn't a term I'm familiar with in art criticism, so maybe it's not the right choice.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. formalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
