By comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.\n\nEratosthenes estimated the circumference of the Earth by comparing the angles of the Sun's rays at two different locations: Alexandria and Syene (modern-day Aswan), both in Egypt. He knew that on the summer solstice, at local noon, the Sun was directly overhead in Syene, casting no shadow. In Alexandria, about 500 miles north of Syene, the Sun cast a slight shadow, and he measured this angle to be about 7.2 degrees.\n\nHe reasoned that this angle represented the difference in latitude between the two cities and that this angle was also the central angle corresponding to the arc length between them on the Earth's surface. Since a circle has 360 degrees, the ratio of the angle to 360 degrees would be the same as the ratio of the distance between the two cities to the Earth's circumference.\n\nUsing this proportion, he could calculate the Earth's circumference. His calculation was remarkably close to the actual value, considering the limited tools available at the time.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Eratosthenes did not use solar eclipses for his calculation. Solar eclipses involve the Moon passing between the Earth and the Sun, which is not relevant to measuring the Earth's size directly.\n\nOption B is also incorrect. While lunar eclipses can provide information about the relative sizes and distances of the Earth and Moon, Eratosthenes did not use them for his Earth size estimation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because sending fleets of ships around the Earth was not feasible in 240 B.C., and it was not the method Eratosthenes used. His method was based on geometry and the measurement of angles, which was much more practical and accurate for his time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: By comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
