So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the scenario says that Ty didn't pull as hard as he would have if he were pulling alone against one competitor. That means he's putting in less effort when he's part of a team compared to when he's by himself.\n\nOption A is deindividuation. I think deindividuation is when people lose their sense of individual identity in a group and maybe act differently than they normally would. But in this case, Ty is just putting in less effort, not necessarily acting differently or losing his identity.\n\nOption B is groupthink. Groupthink happens when a group prioritizes harmony and consensus over critical thinking and individual responsibilities. It usually leads to poor decision-making. But here, it's about effort in a physical activity, not decision-making.\n\nOption C is social loafing. Social loafing is when people exert less effort to achieve a goal when they work in a group than when they work alone. That sounds a lot like what's happening with Ty. He's putting in less effort because he's part of a team.\n\nOption D is the bystander effect. That's when individuals are less likely to help someone in need when other people are present. It's about diffusion of responsibility in helping situations, not about effort in a competitive activity.\n\nComparing all these, social loafing seems to fit best with Ty's behavior. He's putting in less effort because he's part of a team, which is exactly what social loafing is about.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. social loafing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
