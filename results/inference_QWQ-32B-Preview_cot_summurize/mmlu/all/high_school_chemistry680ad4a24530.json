                    "text": "To determine how many moles of propane (C3H8) are in 6.2 grams of propane, we need to use the molar mass of propane. The molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance and is calculated by summing the atomic masses of all the atoms in the molecule.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of propane (C3H8):\n\n- Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of approximately 12.01 grams per mole.\n- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1.01 grams per mole.\n\nPropane has 3 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms, so:\n\nMolar mass of C3H8 = (3 \u00d7 12.01 g/mol) + (8 \u00d7 1.01 g/mol)\n= (3 \u00d7 12.01) + (8 \u00d7 1.01)\n= 36.03 + 8.08\n= 44.11 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use the molar mass to convert the mass of propane to moles. The formula for this conversion is:\n\nmoles = mass / molar mass\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nmoles of C3H8 = 6.2 g / 44.11 g/mol\n\nLet's do the division:\n\nmoles of C3H8 \u2248 0.1405 moles\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 14.1 mol\nB. 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol\nC. 71 mol\nD. 7.1 mol\n\nOption B is 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol, which is the same as 0.14 mol. Our calculated value is approximately 0.1405 mol, so the closest answer is B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
