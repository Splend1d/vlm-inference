On June 1, the collector sent the 11th antique toy to the expert with a signed note that read: \"Here is another toy for you to restore. As with all prior jobs, I will pay $500 for the work, but no more.\" On June 4, after receipt of the collector's June 1 note and the toy, the expert began restoring the toy. On June 6, the collector unexpectedly died. On June 7, unaware of the collector's death, the expert sent the collector a note that stated that the restoration work had begun on June 4. The following day, the expert learned of the collector's death. Does a contract exist that binds the expert and the collector's estate?\n\nA. No, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.\nB. No, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.\nC. Yes, because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death.\nD. Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this contract problem. So, there's a toy collector who sent an expert a toy to restore, along with a note saying he'll pay $500, but no more, just like he did for the previous 10 toys. The expert started restoring the toy on June 4, after receiving the note and the toy on June 1. Then, on June 6, the collector died unexpectedly. The expert sent a note on June 7 saying that the restoration began on June 4, and the next day, June 8, the expert learned about the collector's death.\n\nThe question is whether a contract exists that binds the expert and the collector's estate.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. No, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.\n\nB. No, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.\n\nC. Yes, because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death.\n\nD. Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what constitutes a contract. A contract generally requires an offer and an acceptance, and some consideration, which is something of value exchanged between the parties.\n\nHere, the collector sent a note on June 1 offering to pay $500 for the restoration of the toy, and the expert started restoring the toy on June 4. Starting the restoration work can be seen as acceptance of the offer.\n\nSo, the offer was made on June 1, and acceptance was on June 4.\n\nNow, the collector died on June 6.\n\nSo, the offer was made when the collector was alive, and acceptance was also before the collector's death.\n\nBut the expert sent a note on June 7 confirming that the work had started on June 4, and then learned of the death on June 8.\n\nI need to consider whether the death of the collector affects the contract.\n\nIn contract law, the death of a party generally ends their ability to enter into new contracts or perform existing ones, but what about contracts entered into before death?\n\nI think that contracts entered into before death are generally enforceable against the estate of the deceased.\n\nSo, in this case, since the offer was made on June 1 and accepted on June 4, before the collector's death on June 6, there should be a binding contract.\n\nTherefore, options C and D seem plausible.\n\nOption C says yes, because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death.\n\nBut I'm not sure if sending that note is what makes the contract binding. It seems like the acceptance was already made on June 4 by starting the work.\n\nOption D says yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n\nThat sounds more accurate to me.\n\nAlso, option A says no, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.\n\nBut the acceptance was already on June 4, so the expert's note on June 7 is just confirming the start of work, not accepting the offer.\n\nOption B says no, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.\n\nBut since the offer was accepted before the death, I don't think it lapsed.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer: yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n\nMoreover, the expert's note on June 7 is probably just informative, not part of the acceptance process.\n\nSo, my final answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
