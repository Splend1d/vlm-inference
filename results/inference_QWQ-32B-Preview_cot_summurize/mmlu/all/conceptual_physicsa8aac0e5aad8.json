                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Find the speed of a wave by multiplying its frequency by its...\" and then it gives options: period, wavelength, amplitude, or none of these. Hmm, I remember something about wave speed, but I need to think this through carefully.\n\nFirst off, what is a wave? It's a disturbance that travels through a medium, right? Like water waves or sound waves. And waves have properties like speed, frequency, wavelength, and amplitude.\n\nFrequency is how many waves pass a point per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs, measured in meters. Amplitude is the height of the wave from the rest position, which tells us about its energy. Period is the time it takes for one complete wave to pass a point, which is the inverse of frequency.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the speed of the wave, which is how fast the wave is moving, measured in meters per second (m/s).\n\nI think there's a formula that relates these properties. I recall something like speed equals wavelength times frequency. Let me write that down: speed = wavelength \u00d7 frequency.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me see. If frequency is the number of waves per second and wavelength is the distance of one wave, then multiplying them should give the distance covered per second, which is speed. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, speed = wavelength \u00d7 frequency.\n\nBut the question is saying \"multiplying its frequency by its...\" and then gives options. Option A is period, which is the time for one wave, not wavelength. Option B is wavelength, which seems to fit based on the formula I just recalled. Option C is amplitude, which is related to energy, not directly to speed. Option D is none of these.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there another formula that relates frequency and period? Yeah, period is the inverse of frequency: period = 1 / frequency.\n\nSo, if I multiply frequency by period, I get frequency times 1/frequency, which is 1. That's not speed.\n\nSo, option A, period, would give me speed = frequency \u00d7 period = 1, which is not correct.\n\nOption B, wavelength, matches the formula I recall: speed = frequency \u00d7 wavelength.\n\nOption C, amplitude, doesn't seem related to speed directly.\n\nOption D, none of these, wouldn't make sense because wavelength is an option.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B, wavelength.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about the units. Frequency is in Hz, which is 1/second, and wavelength is in meters. So, multiplying them gives meters per second, which is indeed the unit for speed.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to multiply frequency by period, as in option A, frequency is 1/second and period is seconds, so they cancel out to give 1, which is dimensionless, not a speed.\n\nAmplitude might be in meters, but multiplying that by frequency would give meters per second, which could be speed, but I don't recall any direct relationship between speed and amplitude in this way.\n\nWait, actually, in some contexts, like simple harmonic motion, the maximum speed of a particle in the wave is related to amplitude and frequency, but that's different from the speed of the wave itself.\n\nThe speed of the wave is indeed determined by the properties of the medium and is given by wavelength times frequency.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is B, wavelength.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
