The options are:\n\nA. is possible\n\nB. is meaningless\n\nC. exists somewhere\n\nD. cannot exist\n\nI need to recall what Craig's position is on actual infinities. I think Craig is a philosopher or a theologian who argues against the possibility of actual infinities in reality. He might be William Lane Craig, who is known for his work in philosophy of religion and cosmology.\n\nFrom what I remember, Craig argues that an actually infinite number of things cannot exist in reality. He presents several arguments to support this view, such as the hotel analogy attributed to David Hilbert, where an infinite hotel can always accommodate more guests even if it's full, which leads to counterintuitive conclusions.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that Craig would say that an actually infinite number of things cannot exist. That would correspond to option D.\n\nBut let me double-check. Option A says \"is possible.\" That seems contrary to what I recall of Craig's position. He argues that actual infinities are not possible in reality.\n\nOption B says \"is meaningless.\" Well, Craig might argue that certain concepts involving actual infinities are meaningless or lead to paradoxes, but I think his main point is that they cannot exist, not just that they are meaningless.\n\nOption C says \"exists somewhere.\" Again, this contradicts his position because he argues that actual infinities cannot exist in reality.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer seems to be D. \"cannot exist.\"\n\nTo make sure, I should consider if there's any context where Craig might say that actual infinities are possible or exist somewhere. I don't recall any such instances; his arguments are primarily against the possibility of actual infinities in reality.\n\nHence, I'll go with D. \"cannot exist.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
