Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Nuclear disarmament. I think Reagan was known for his hardline stance against the Soviet Union, and I don't recall him pushing strongly for nuclear disarmament right at the beginning. Maybe later in his presidency, but not in the early years.\n\nB. D\u00e9tente. D\u00e9tente was more associated with the Nixon and Ford administrations, where there was a easing of tensions with the Soviet Union. Reagan was more confrontational, so I don't think d\u00e9tente fits.\n\nC. Anticommunism. This seems likely. Reagan was well-known for his strong opposition to communism and the Soviet Union. He even called the USSR the \"evil empire.\" So, in his early years, it makes sense that his policies would emphasize anticommunism.\n\nD. International free trade. While free trade is important, I don't recall it being the central focus of his foreign and defense policies in his early years. Maybe in terms of economic policies, but not specifically in defense and foreign affairs.\n\nSo, between these options, I think C. anticommunism is the most accurate answer. His administration was marked by a significant increase in defense spending and a tough stance against communist regimes around the world.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
