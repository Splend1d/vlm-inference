                    "text": "Let's see what Taurek is saying here. So, he has a view about the value of lives and how we should make decisions when people's lives are at stake. The options are:\n\nA. the death of two people is always worse than the death of one.\n\nB. the death of two people is sometimes less bad than the death of one.\n\nC. the death of two people is always exactly as bad as the death of one.\n\nD. the notion of the sum of two people\u2019s losses should be rejected.\n\nFirst, option A says that two deaths are always worse than one. That seems intuitively right, doesn't it? More deaths are worse than fewer deaths. But maybe there are circumstances where that's not the case.\n\nOption B suggests that sometimes, the death of two people is less bad than the death of one. That sounds counterintuitive. How could that be possible? Maybe if the two people are, say, criminals or something, but I don't think that's the kind of scenario Taurek is considering. He's probably thinking about innocent lives or comparable cases.\n\nOption C says that two deaths are always exactly as bad as one. That seems clearly false. How can two deaths be exactly as bad as one? Unless, maybe, he's arguing that each life is incomparable, but that doesn't align with the wording here.\n\nOption D proposes rejecting the notion of summing up people's losses. That sounds like he might be advocating for a view where you can't aggregate utilities or harms. Maybe he's a separateness of persons kind of guy, like Robert Nozick, who argues that you can't trade off one person's rights or well-being against others.\n\nGiven that, I think Taurek is most likely associated with option D. He might be arguing that each person's life is separate and can't be combined or traded off against others in a calculus. So, you can't just add up the losses and decide based on the total; each person's life has its own value that shouldn't be aggregated.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about his possible reasoning. If he rejects aggregating losses, then he wouldn't accept that the death of two is always worse than one because that would require summing their losses. Instead, he might argue that each death is a separate moral tragedy that shouldn't be combined in a single calculation.\n\nThat makes sense. So, Taurek is likely claiming that the notion of the sum of two people\u2019s losses should be rejected. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
