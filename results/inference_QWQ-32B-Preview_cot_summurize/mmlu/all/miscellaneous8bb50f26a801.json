It commemorates the Mexican Army's victory over the French Empire at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. Although it is not Mexico's Independence Day, which is celebrated on September 16th, Cinco de Mayo has become a significant cultural celebration in both Mexico and the United States, particularly in areas with large Mexican-American populations. The holiday is often marked by parades, festivals, traditional foods, music, and dancing."
