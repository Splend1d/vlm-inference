                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an object resting on an inclined plane, and I need to find its acceleration. Let's see what I know. There's an angle of incline, which is denoted by \u03b8, the acceleration due to gravity, g, and the coefficient of friction between the object and the plane is \u03bc. The question is asking for the acceleration of the object, and there are four options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the forces acting on the object. Since it's on an inclined plane, gravity is pulling it down, but the plane is at an angle, so that force gets divided into components parallel and perpendicular to the plane. Also, there's friction acting against the motion, which depends on the normal force.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I draw a free-body diagram, I should have:\n\n1. The gravitational force, mg, pointing straight down.\n\n2. The normal force, N, perpendicular to the plane.\n\n3. The frictional force, f, acting up the plane, opposite to the direction of motion.\n\nNow, I need to resolve the gravitational force into components parallel and perpendicular to the plane.\n\nThe component parallel to the plane is mg sin \u03b8, and the component perpendicular to the plane is mg cos \u03b8.\n\nThe normal force, N, should be equal to the perpendicular component of the gravitational force, so N = mg cos \u03b8.\n\nThe frictional force, f, is given by f = \u03bcN = \u03bcmg cos \u03b8.\n\nNow, the net force acting down the plane is the parallel component of gravity minus the frictional force, right?\n\nSo, net force, F_net = mg sin \u03b8 - f = mg sin \u03b8 - \u03bcmg cos \u03b8.\n\nThen, acceleration, a, is F_net divided by mass, m.\n\nSo, a = (mg sin \u03b8 - \u03bcmg cos \u03b8) / m.\n\nThe m's cancel out, so a = g sin \u03b8 - \u03bcg cos \u03b8.\n\nLooking back at the options, that matches option D: a = g (sin \u03b8 \u2013 \u03bc cos \u03b8).\n\nWait, but let's double-check if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nIs there a possibility that the frictional force could be acting in the opposite direction, or maybe if the object is moving up the plane? But the question says the object is resting on the plane, so I'm assuming it's initially at rest and starting to slide down.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the angle \u03b8 is such that the object doesn't move at all, but I think that's a different case, involving static friction. Here, since it's asking for acceleration, I'm assuming the object is already moving or the friction is kinetic.\n\nAlternatively, if the angle is such that the component of gravity down the plane is greater than the frictional force, then the object will accelerate down the plane, which is what I've calculated.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach. Maybe using the concept of the effective acceleration on the inclined plane.\n\nI've seen sometimes people use a = g sin \u03b8, but that's without friction. In this case, friction is present, so I need to account for it.\n\nOption A is just a = g sin \u03b8, which is incorrect because it ignores friction.\n\nOption B has a = g (sin \u03b8 \u2013 cos \u03b8), which doesn't make sense because it's subtracting cos \u03b8 without any coefficient.\n\nOption C has a = g (cos \u03b8 \u2013 \u03bc sin \u03b8), which seems to have the terms mixed up.\n\nOnly option D matches my calculation: a = g (sin \u03b8 \u2013 \u03bc cos \u03b8).\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the units to confirm. All terms in the expression should have the same units.\n\ng is in m/s\u00b2, sin \u03b8 and cos \u03b8 are dimensionless, \u03bc is dimensionless. So, a = g (sin \u03b8 \u2013 \u03bc cos \u03b8) has units of m/s\u00b2, which is correct for acceleration.\n\nAlso, if \u03bc = 0, meaning no friction, then a = g sin \u03b8, which makes sense.\n\nIf \u03b8 = 0, meaning the plane is horizontal, then a = 0, which also makes sense because there's no component of gravity along the plane.\n\nIf \u03b8 = 90\u00b0, then a = g (1 \u2013 0) = g, which is correct because it's free-falling.\n\nSo, everything seems consistent.\n\nI think option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
