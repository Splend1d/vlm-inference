                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question on fertilization. It's asking about the acrosome and cortical reactions that happen right after fertilization, and it wants to know what these ensure. The options are:\n\nA. The sperm will fertilize the ovum.\n\nB. The zygote will begin to divide normally.\n\nC. One and only one sperm will fertilize the egg.\n\nD. The zygote will not divide into two embryos, producing twins.\n\nSo, I need to recall what the acrosome and cortical reactions are and what their roles are in fertilization.\n\nFirst, the acrosome reaction: I think this happens in the sperm before it penetrates the egg. The sperm has an acrosome at its head, which contains enzymes that help it break through the outer layers of the egg. When the sperm reaches the egg, it undergoes the acrosome reaction, releasing these enzymes and allowing it to fuse with the egg membrane.\n\nThen, there's the cortical reaction in the egg. Once the sperm fuses with the egg membrane, it triggers the cortical reaction in the egg, which causes the egg's membrane to undergo changes that prevent other sperm from entering. This is often referred to as the \"fast block to polyspermy.\"\n\nSo, the acrosome reaction is more about enabling a single sperm to fertilize the egg, and the cortical reaction is about preventing multiple sperm from fertilizing the same egg.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to make sense: \"One and only one sperm will fertilize the egg.\" Because the cortical reaction prevents additional sperm from entering after the first one has fused with the egg.\n\nOption A says \"The sperm will fertilize the ovum.\" Well, the acrosome reaction helps the sperm to fertilize the egg, but I think the question is about what these reactions ensure after fertilization has occurred. So, maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B says \"The zygote will begin to divide normally.\" I don't recall the acrosome and cortical reactions directly ensuring normal cell division of the zygote. Those reactions are more about the fertilization process itself.\n\nOption D says \"The zygote will not divide into two embryos, producing twins.\" I think twinning occurs later during embryonic development, perhaps during the first few cell divisions, and isn't directly related to the acrosome and cortical reactions.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C seems to be the most accurate: the acrosome and cortical reactions ensure that only one sperm fertilizes the egg.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should consider if these reactions have other roles as well. For example, does the cortical reaction have any effect on the zygote's division? I don't think so. It's primarily about preventing polyspermy.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are other mechanisms that prevent polyspermy. I think there are additional layers of protection, like the formation of the fertilization membrane after the cortical reaction, which provides a physical barrier to other sperm.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"immediately after fertilization,\" so the acrosome and cortical reactions are the initial events that occur right after fertilization.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: One and only one sperm will fertilize the egg.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
