There are a few options here: layering of materials within the Earth, fossils of ancient life, cratering history, and radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites. I think the best answer is D, radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites, but let me think this through.\n\nFirst, the layering of materials within the Earth, option A, that sounds like stratigraphy, which is used to date layers of rock based on their position. But this method is more about relative dating\u2014figuring out which layers are older or younger than others\u2014rather than absolute dating, which gives a specific age in years. So, while it helps us understand the sequence of events, it doesn't directly tell us the actual age of the Earth.\n\nOption B, fossils of ancient life, are also used in relative dating. By comparing types of fossils in different rock layers, scientists can correlate the ages of those layers. Again, this is more about relative timing than absolute ages.\n\nOption C, the cratering history of Earth\u2019s surface, could be interesting. The Moon\u2019s craters, for example, have been used to date its surface based on the number of impacts. But for Earth, with its active geology, the surface is constantly changing, erasing old craters. So, while cratering might give some clues, it\u2019s not the primary method for determining Earth's age.\n\nThat leaves option D, radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites. Radioactive dating is an absolute dating method that measures the decay of radioactive isotopes in rocks to calculate their age. This method can give us a numerical age in years, which is what we need to determine the age of the Earth.\n\nScientists have used radioactive dating on the oldest rocks found on Earth, as well as on meteorites and samples from the Moon. The ages obtained from these different sources are consistent, suggesting that the Earth is about 4.54 billion years old.\n\nMeteorites are particularly important because they are remnants from the early solar system and have not undergone the same geological processes as Earth's rocks. Therefore, their age is closer to that of the solar system itself, providing a reliable estimate for Earth's age.\n\nSo, while methods A, B, and C are useful for understanding Earth's history and the relative ages of its features, it's radioactive dating that allows us to determine the absolute age of the Earth. Therefore, I believe the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
