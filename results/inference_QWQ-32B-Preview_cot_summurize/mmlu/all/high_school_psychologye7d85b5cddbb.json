                    "text": "Let's see. So, Conrad is studying hard for his finals, and right after the exams, he gets the flu. I need to figure out which theory best explains this chain of events from the options given: Selye's general adaptation syndrome, Yerkes-Dodson law, Thorndike's law of effect, and Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory.\n\nFirst, I'll think about what's happening here. Conrad is under a lot of stress while studying for his finals, especially in the last two weeks when he's cramming for hours each day. Then, right after the stress of finals is over, he gets sick with the flu.\n\nOption A is Selye's general adaptation syndrome. I remember that this theory talks about how the body responds to stress in three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. Maybe this is relevant here because Conrad is experiencing a lot of stress while studying, and then getting sick after the stress is over.\n\nOption B is the Yerkes-Dodson law, which is about the relationship between arousal and performance. It suggests that there's an optimal level of arousal for best performance, and that too much or too little arousal can hurt performance. While this might relate to Conrad's studying, it doesn't directly explain why he gets sick after finals.\n\nOption C is Thorndike's law of effect, which is about how behaviors that are followed by positive consequences are more likely to be repeated, and those followed by negative consequences are less likely to be repeated. This seems more related to behavior reinforcement and doesn't directly connect to stress or illness.\n\nOption D is Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory, which deals with mental discomfort arising from holding two conflicting beliefs or thoughts. Again, this doesn't seem directly related to stress from studying and getting sick afterward.\n\nSo, going back to Selye's general adaptation syndrome, it seems like the most fitting choice. Let me recall the three stages:\n\n1. **Alarm stage**: This is the initial response to stress, where the body mobilizes resources to deal with the stressor. In Conrad's case, this might be the initial reaction to the upcoming finals, maybe feeling anxious or starting to prepare.\n\n2. **Resistance stage**: Here, the body adapts to the stressor and tries to cope with it over a period of time. This seems to align with Conrad studying for hours each day in the two weeks before finals. His body is trying to handle the stress of academics.\n\n3. **Exhaustion stage**: If the stress continues for too long, the body's resources are depleted, leading to exhaustion and increased vulnerability to illness. After finals, when the stress is over, Conrad's immune system might be weakened from the prolonged stress, making him more susceptible to getting the flu.\n\nThis makes sense because often people get sick right after a period of high stress, when they finally relax or the stressor is removed. It's like the body crashes after sustained stress.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe the Yerkes-Dodson law could be relevant if we think about Conrad's study performance under stress, but again, it doesn't explain why he gets sick after finals.\n\nThorndike's law of effect is about learning and behavior reinforcement, which doesn't seem directly related to stress and illness.\n\nFestinger's cognitive dissonance theory deals with internal mental conflicts, not with stress or physical health.\n\nTherefore, Selye's general adaptation syndrome appears to be the most appropriate theory to explain Conrad's situation. It directly links stress and the body's response to it, culminating in potential illness after the stress period ends.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
