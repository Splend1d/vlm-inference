This type of question is designed to gather qualitative data, which can offer deeper insights into people's thoughts, feelings, and experiences.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Likert scale: This is a rating scale that measures attitudes or opinions. Respondents are asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with a series of statements. It typically includes options like \"strongly agree,\" \"agree,\" \"neutral,\" \"disagree,\" and \"strongly disagree.\" This is a quantitative method because it produces numerical data that can be statistically analyzed.\n\nB. Multiple choice: In multiple-choice questions, respondents are presented with a set of predefined options and are asked to select one or more that apply. This type of question also generates quantitative data, as responses can be easily counted and compared.\n\nD. Yes/No: These are closed-ended questions that require a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. They are straightforward and produce binary data, which is quantitative in nature.\n\nIn contrast, open-ended questions encourage respondents to express themselves fully, providing rich, descriptive information that can be analyzed thematically or through other qualitative methods. This makes them particularly useful for understanding complex issues, exploring new topics, or gaining deeper insights into respondent perceptions and experiences.\n\nFor example, an open-ended question might be: \"Please describe your experience with our customer service.\" The responses to this question would vary widely and provide qualitative data that can be analyzed for common themes, specific issues, or general sentiment.\n\nIn summary, among the options provided, open-ended questions are the type that seeks qualitative information, allowing for a more in-depth exploration of respondents' perspectives and experiences."
