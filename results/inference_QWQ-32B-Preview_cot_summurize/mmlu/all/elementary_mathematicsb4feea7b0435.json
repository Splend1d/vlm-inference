The options are A. 687, B. 687, C. 1,493, and D. 1,695. Wait, option A and B are both 687. Maybe there's a typo, but I'll proceed with the calculation.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the numbers one below the other to make it easier to subtract:\n\n```\n\n 2,396\n\n-1,709\n\n------\n\n```\n\nNow, I'll subtract starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n6 minus 9. Hmm, 6 is smaller than 9, so I need to borrow from the tens place.\n\nThe tens place has 9, so I'll borrow 1 from there, making it 8, and the units place becomes 16.\n\nNow, 16 minus 9 is 7.\n\nNext, the tens place: 8 minus 0 is 8.\n\nThen, the hundreds place: 3 minus 7. Again, 3 is smaller than 7, so I need to borrow from the thousands place.\n\nThe thousands place has 2, so I'll borrow 1, making it 1, and the hundreds place becomes 13.\n\nNow, 13 minus 7 is 6.\n\nFinally, the thousands place: 1 minus 1 is 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n```\n\n 2,396\n\n-1,709\n\n------\n\n  687\n\n```\n\nWait, but in the thousands place, 1 minus 1 is 0, but we don't write leading zeros in numbers, so it's just 687.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, both A and B are 687, C is 1,493, and D is 1,695.\n\nSince my calculation gives me 687, and both A and B are 687, maybe there was a repetition in the options. In any case, 687 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can check my answer by adding 1,709 and 687 to see if I get back to 2,396.\n\nLet's do that:\n\n```\n\n 1,709\n\n+  687\n\n------\n\n 2,396\n\n```\n\nYes, that matches the original number. So, my subtraction was correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 687, which corresponds to options A and B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{687} \\]"
