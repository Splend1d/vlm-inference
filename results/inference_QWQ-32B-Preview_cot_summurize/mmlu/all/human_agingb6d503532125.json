Unexpected\n\nD. External rather than internal\n\nI need to think about what social support really means and how it affects people's health and well-being.\n\nFirst, social support is basically the help and support from friends, family, and community. It can be emotional, like getting comfort and understanding, or practical, like help with tasks or financial assistance.\n\nNow, the question is asking when social support is most likely to have a positive influence on health and well-being. So, I need to consider which of these options makes social support most effective.\n\nOption A is \"Very emotional.\" While emotional support is important, I'm not sure if \"very emotional\" is always positive for health and well-being. Sometimes too much emotion can be overwhelming. So, maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B is \"Perceived as support.\" This seems important because if someone feels that they are being supported, it can have a positive impact on their mental and physical health. Perception is key here because even if support is offered, if it's not perceived as such, it might not have the desired effect.\n\nOption C is \"Unexpected.\" Unexpected support might be nice, but I'm not sure if it's the most consistent way to have a positive influence on health and well-being. Maybe expected support is more reliable and therefore more beneficial.\n\nOption D is \"External rather than internal.\" I'm not entirely sure what this means in the context of social support. External support would be from others, while internal might be self-support. Probably, external support is what social support refers to, but I'm not sure if that's what makes it most positive.\n\nLet me think again. The question is about when social support has a positive influence. So, it's not about the type of support as much as when it's effective.\n\nI recall that in psychology, the perception of support is crucial. Even if support is available, if someone doesn't recognize it as support, it may not benefit them as much.\n\nAlso, social support that is perceived as supportive can reduce stress, improve mood, and even boost immune function. So, perhaps the key is that the support is perceived as such.\n\nOn the other hand, \"very emotional\" support might not always be positive. For example, if the support is too emotionally charged, it could be counterproductive.\n\n\"Unexpected\" support might be a nice surprise, but consistent, expected support might be more beneficial in the long run.\n\n\"External rather than internal\" \u2013 well, social support is external by nature, coming from others. Internal support would be more like self-support, which is different.\n\nGiven that, maybe option B, \"perceived as support,\" is the best answer.\n\nLet me check if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps the question is trying to say that social support is most positive when it is perceived by the individual as support. That makes sense because the individual's perception shapes how they experience and benefit from the support.\n\nAlso, in research, it's often found that the perceived availability of social support is as important, if not more, than the actual support provided.\n\nSo, based on that, I think option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
