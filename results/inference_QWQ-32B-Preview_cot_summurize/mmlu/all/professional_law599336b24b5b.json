                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which fact the defendant's attorney would be least likely to try to prove in this motion to suppress the gun. Let's break down the scenario and see what's relevant here.\n\nSo, the defendant killed her boyfriend and his new girlfriend in a rage after finding them together in bed. She then went on a trip, leaving her apartment and her daughter in the care of her teenage neighbor. The police came to the apartment that night and asked the neighbor if they could search the apartment, and the neighbor gave them permission. The police found the gun used in the killings in the defendant's bedroom.\n\nNow, the defendant's attorney is moving to suppress the gun before trial. That means they're trying to keep the gun from being used as evidence because they think it was obtained illegally or in violation of the defendant's rights.\n\nIn order to suppress evidence, the attorney generally needs to show that the evidence was obtained through an unlawful search or seizure, often in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nSo, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.\n\nB. The police did not have a search warrant.\n\nC. The defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone.\n\nD. The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.\n\nFirst, option B: the police did not have a search warrant. This is relevant because searches generally require a warrant unless there's an exception to the warrant requirement. So, if the police didn't have a warrant, that could be a problem for them, unless they can argue that the neighbor had authority to consent to the search.\n\nOption A: the defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment. This could be important because if the neighbor had keys, that might suggest that she had implied authority to allow the police to search the apartment. On the other hand, maybe the defendant only gave her the keys to take care of the apartment and the daughter, not to let the police in.\n\nOption C: the defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone. This seems relevant because if the defendant specifically instructed the neighbor not to answer the door, that might limit the neighbor's authority to consent to a search.\n\nOption D: the police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search. This suggests that the neighbor's consent might have been coerced, which would make it invalid.\n\nNow, thinking about which fact the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove, I need to consider which one doesn't really help the defendant's case for suppression.\n\nLet's consider each one:\n\nA. If the defendant gave the neighbor keys, that might suggest that the neighbor had authority to consent to the search, which would help the police's case. So, the attorney might not want to prove this, but likely, the prosecution would bring this up, and the attorney would need to address it.\n\nB. Showing that there was no warrant is crucial for the defendant's case because it questions the legality of the search.\n\nC. If the defendant told the neighbor not to answer the door, that weakens the neighbor's authority to consent to the search, which helps the defendant's case.\n\nD. If the police coerced the neighbor into giving consent, that invalidates the consent, which is beneficial for the defendant's case.\n\nSo, option A seems like something the attorney wouldn't want to prove because it could imply that the neighbor had authority to consent to the search. However, since the defendant did give the neighbor keys, it's probably something that will come out anyway.\n\nWait, but in option C, if the defendant told the neighbor not to answer the door, that might limit the neighbor's authority to consent. So, proving that could help the defendant's case by showing that the neighbor didn't have the authority to let the police in.\n\nOption D also helps the defendant by showing that the consent was not voluntary.\n\nOption B is fundamental: no warrant means the search is presumptively invalid, unless there's consent or some exception.\n\nSo, perhaps the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove option A, that the defendant gave her neighbor the keys, because it could be used against them to show that the neighbor had authority to consent.\n\nBut, realistically, the prosecution might bring up that the defendant gave the neighbor keys, so the defense would need to address it anyway.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option C: the defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone. If the defendant told the neighbor not to answer the door, that might suggest that the neighbor didn't have authority to consent to a search, because she wasn't even supposed to let anyone in.\n\nWait, but from the defendant's perspective, that would actually help their case, because it shows that the neighbor didn't have the authority to let the police in.\n\nSo, why would the attorney be least likely to attempt to prove that? It seems like something they would want to prove.\n\nSimilarly, option D shows that the consent was coerced, which is beneficial for the defendant.\n\nOption B is crucial.\n\nMaybe the answer is A because proving that the defendant gave the neighbor keys might not directly help the motion to suppress, and could potentially hurt the defendant's case by implying that the neighbor had authority to consent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove option C because it might backfire: if the neighbor was instructed not to answer the door, but did so anyway, that might suggest that she didn't have the authority to consent, but it could also make the neighbor look unreliable, which might not help the defendant.\n\nWait, but from a legal standpoint, if the neighbor was instructed not to answer the door, that could indeed limit her authority to consent to a search.\n\nSo, perhaps the attorney would be more likely to prove option C to show that the neighbor didn't have the authority to let the police in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove option D because it could lead to further incriminating evidence or because the neighbor might deny it, making the defendant's case weaker if the judge doesn't believe the assertion.\n\nBut, generally, if the attorney can show that the consent was coerced, that would be beneficial for suppressing the evidence.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove option A because it's probably already known, and focusing on it might highlight the neighbor's potential authority to consent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove option C because it might not be relevant or because it could be seen as an instruction to obstruct justice or something like that.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove option B, that the police did not have a search warrant, because maybe it's already established, or perhaps because it's not as important as showing that the consent was invalid.\n\nBut, no, option B seems like a fundamental point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove option D because it might not be true, or because the neighbor might not support it, or because it could open the door to other issues.\n\nBut again, if it's true, it's beneficial for the defendant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is A because the fact that the defendant gave the neighbor keys is likely already known or evident, and the attorney wouldn't need to spend time proving it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove option A because it might suggest that the defendant had control over the apartment and its contents, which could be used against her in other ways.\n\nBut, overall, it seems like option A is somewhat detrimental to the defendant's case in terms of suppression, because it could indicate that the neighbor had authority to consent to the search.\n\nTherefore, the attorney might be least likely to attempt to prove option A, but in reality, it's probably already known and needs to be addressed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D because the attorney might not want to rely on the neighbor's potential coercion, perhaps fearing that the neighbor won't support that claim or that it could backfire.\n\nBut, overall, it's a bit tricky.\n\nGiven the options, I think the answer is A: the defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment. The attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove this because it could strengthen the prosecution's argument that the neighbor had authority to consent to the search.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
