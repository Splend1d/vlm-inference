So, the question is about the study of older adults and aging, and it gives four options: Gerontology, Geropsychiatry, Geriatrics, and Gero-education. I need to figure out which one is the correct term for the study of aging.\n\nFirst, I know that \"gero\" seems to be a prefix related to old age. So all these terms probably have something to do with older adults. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Gerontology. I've heard this term before. I think it's the broad study of the social, psychological, and biological aspects of aging. So, it seems like it covers a wide range of topics related to older adults and the process of aging.\n\nNext, B. Geropsychiatry. This one sounds like it's specifically about psychiatry related to older adults. So, maybe it's a subset of psychiatry that deals with mental health issues in the elderly. It seems more specialized compared to gerontology.\n\nThen, C. Geriatrics. I know that geriatrics is a medical field that deals with the health care of elderly people. So, it's more about the medical aspects and healthcare of older adults, perhaps focusing on diseases and treatments common in older age.\n\nLastly, D. Gero-education. I'm not sure about this one. It sounds like it might be about education for older adults, but I'm not entirely sure. It doesn't seem as directly related to the study of aging itself.\n\nGiven these definitions, I think the most comprehensive term for the study of older adults and aging would be Gerontology, since it covers social, psychological, and biological aspects, whereas the others seem more specialized in certain areas like mental health or medical care.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me make sure. If geriatrics is about medical care for the elderly, and geropsychiatry is about psychiatric care for the elderly, then gerontology seems to be the broader field that includes all aspects of aging.\n\nAlso, gero-education might be about educating older adults, but that doesn't necessarily cover the study of aging processes and the elderly population as a whole.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A. Gerontology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
