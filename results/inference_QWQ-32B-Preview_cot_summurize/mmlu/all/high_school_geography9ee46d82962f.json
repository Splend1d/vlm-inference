I need to choose the one that's experiencing the most rapid urban growth.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"urbanization\" means. It's the process where more and more people are moving from rural areas to cities. This can be due to various reasons like job opportunities, better services, education, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to think about these regions and see which one is seeing the biggest shift towards city living.\n\nLet's start with Europe. Europe is already quite developed, and most of its population lives in urban areas. So, I doubt it's the region with the most rapid urbanization now.\n\nNext, East Asia. East Asia has some of the world's largest cities and has seen tremendous growth over the past few decades. Countries like China and South Korea have experienced rapid urbanization as they industrialized. But I'm not sure if it's the fastest now.\n\nThen, Sub-Saharan Africa. I've heard that this region is undergoing rapid urbanization. Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are developing quickly, and people are moving to cities in search of better lives. Maybe this is the answer.\n\nLastly, South Asia. This includes countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, which are also experiencing significant urban growth. India, in particular, has a large and growing urban population.\n\nBetween Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, I need to decide which one is urbanizing more rapidly.\n\nI recall that Sub-Saharan Africa has one of the highest urbanization rates in the world. For example, cities like Lagos in Nigeria are growing at an incredible rate, almost organically, with people migrating from rural areas to urban centers.\n\nSouth Asia is also urbanizing quickly, but I think Sub-Saharan Africa might have a higher rate.\n\nMoreover, the United Nations has published reports on urbanization trends, and I believe they have data showing that Sub-Saharan Africa has some of the fastest urbanizing regions.\n\nLet me see if I can remember any specific statistics. I think that in Sub-Saharan Africa, the urban population is expected to quadruple by 2050, which would mean a very high urbanization rate.\n\nIn comparison, South Asia is also urbanizing, but perhaps not at the same breakneck speed as Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAlso, considering that many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are still largely rural but are seeing rapid urban growth, which suggests a higher rate of change.\n\nOn the other hand, South Asia already has a significant urban population, so the growth might be substantial in absolute terms, but perhaps not as rapid in relative terms.\n\nTherefore, I think the most rapidly urbanizing area is Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
