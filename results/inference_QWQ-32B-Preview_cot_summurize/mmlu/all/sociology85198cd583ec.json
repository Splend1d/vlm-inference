A secondary group C. An aggregate D. A social category.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nA primary group, I think, is a small social group whose members share personal and lasting relationships. Like families or close friends. They have deep emotional connections.\n\nA secondary group is larger and more formal, where relationships are more temporary and goal-oriented. Like classmates in a school or coworkers.\n\nAn aggregate, I believe, is a collection of people who happen to be in the same place at the same time but don't necessarily interact with each other. Like passengers waiting at a bus stop or people in an elevator.\n\nA social category is a collection of individuals who have something in common, but may not interact directly. Like all teachers or all dog owners.\n\nNow, in this scenario, there are seven people standing silently at a bus stop. They're all there to wait for the same bus, but they're not really interacting; they're just standing there quietly.\n\nSo, they share a common location and a common purpose\u2014waiting for the bus\u2014but they don't seem to have any deeper connections or interactions.\n\nComparing this to the definitions:\n\n- Primary group: unlikely, since they're not sharing personal and lasting relationships.\n\n- Secondary group: maybe they have some common goal, which is catching the bus, but they don't seem to be interacting in a way that suggests a group effort or collaboration.\n\n- Aggregate: this seems fitting because they're just gathered in the same place at the same time without much interaction.\n\n- Social category: they don't necessarily share any other characteristics beyond waiting for the bus, so this seems less fitting.\n\nWait, but aggregates are characterized by the lack of interaction and the temporary nature of the gathering. In this case, the people are standing silently, which aligns with not interacting much. They're all there for the bus, but once the bus comes, they'll probably go their separate ways without any further connection.\n\nOn the other hand, a social category might be something like \"bus riders,\" but that seems too broad and doesn't capture the specific instance of these seven people waiting together at this particular time.\n\nPrimary and secondary groups both imply some level of interaction and relationship, which isn't present here.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. An aggregate.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there's any possibility of them being a secondary group. Secondary groups are those where people come together for a specific purpose, like a work team or a study group. However, in this scenario, the people are not really working together or interacting; they're just waiting individually for the bus.\n\nTherefore, aggregate seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
