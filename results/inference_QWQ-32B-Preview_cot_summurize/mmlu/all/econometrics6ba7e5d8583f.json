So, under the null hypothesis, the data should resemble a normal distribution in terms of skewness and kurtosis.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what skewness and kurtosis are. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution. A skewness of zero indicates a symmetrical distribution, like the normal distribution. Kurtosis measures the \"tailedness\" of the distribution. For a normal distribution, the kurtosis is three, which is often referred to as mesokurtic.\n\nSo, if the null hypothesis of the Bera-Jarque test assumes that the data is normally distributed, then the skewness should be zero and the kurtosis should be three.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis\n\nB. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three\n\nC. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis\n\nD. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.\n\nOption A says zero skewness and zero kurtosis. But, as I recall, the kurtosis of a normal distribution is three, not zero.\n\nOption B matches what I think is correct: zero skewness and kurtosis of three.\n\nOption C has skewness of one and zero kurtosis, which doesn't match the normal distribution.\n\nOption D has skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Skewness of one indicates some asymmetry, not zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B.\n\nBut just to make sure, I should verify this information. Let me look it up.\n\nAfter checking, I confirm that in a normal distribution, skewness is zero and kurtosis is three. The Bera-Jarque test checks if the sample data has these same characteristics.\n\nSo, under the null hypothesis, the distribution has zero skewness and a kurtosis of three.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
