The choices are:\n\nA. current technologies\n\nB. the capabilities of the designer\n\nC. the limitations of the printer\n\nD. the nature of the audience\n\nHmm, let's think about this. Graphic communications are all about getting a message across using visual elements, right? So, to make sure that message is received and understood by the intended audience, what should be the top priority?\n\nOption A is current technologies. While it's important to use up-to-date tools and software for design, I don't think that's the most crucial factor. Technologies change over time, but the core principles of communication should remain somewhat constant.\n\nOption B is the capabilities of the designer. Now, the designer's skills are certainly important because they affect the quality and effectiveness of the design. But again, I think there's something more fundamental that should guide the design process.\n\nOption C is the limitations of the printer. This is relevant because you need to make sure that the design can be properly reproduced in print. However, this seems more like a technical consideration rather than a strategic one in terms of message delivery.\n\nOption D is the nature of the audience. This strikes me as the most important consideration. If you don't understand who your audience is, their preferences, their needs, their level of understanding, and their context, then no matter how technically skilled you are or how advanced your tools are, your message might miss the mark.\n\nLet me elaborate on that. The audience is the ultimate decider of whether your communication is successful or not. If they don't connect with the message, if it doesn't resonate with them, or if it's not relevant to them, then all the technology and design prowess in the world won't save it.\n\nSo, knowing your audience means understanding their demographics, their psychographics, their behaviors, their pain points, and their motivations. This knowledge should inform every aspect of the design, from the choice of colors and fonts to the imagery and the overall layout.\n\nFor example, if your audience is young adults, you might use more vibrant colors and modern fonts, whereas if your audience is older professionals, you might opt for more subdued colors and classic fonts.\n\nMoreover, understanding the audience helps in crafting a message that speaks directly to them, addressing their specific concerns and interests. This relevance increases the chances that they will engage with the communication and take the desired action.\n\nIn contrast, focusing solely on current technologies might lead to using fancy effects or interactive elements that are impressive but don't necessarily enhance the message or appeal to the target audience.\n\nSimilarly, while the designer's capabilities are important, they should be used to serve the needs of the audience, not just to showcase the designer's skills.\n\nThe limitations of the printer are certainly something to be aware of, but again, they are more about the execution rather than the strategic direction of the design.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the nature of the audience is the most important consideration in designing successful messages for graphic communications.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
