                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. I need to pick the correct statement from these options, so I'll evaluate each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"An employee who resigns regardless of cause is eligible for unemployment benefits.\" Hmm, I think unemployment benefits are typically for people who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, like if they were laid off. If someone resigns voluntarily, especially without a good reason, they might not be eligible for unemployment benefits. So, this seems questionable.\n\nOption B states: \"The federal unemployment system is funded by both employer and employee taxes.\" I recall that unemployment taxes are usually paid by employers, not employees. I don't think employees contribute to the federal unemployment tax. So, this might be incorrect.\n\nOption C says: \"The Act is intended to assist workers who are permanently out of work and need assistance in supporting themselves.\" Actually, unemployment benefits are generally designed to provide temporary financial assistance to workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, while they look for new employment. It's not for permanent assistance but rather to bridge the gap between jobs. So, this seems inaccurate.\n\nOption D states: \"The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws.\" I believe that while the Federal Unemployment Tax Act sets up the federal government's role, the actual administration of unemployment benefits is handled by the states, each with their own laws and regulations. This sounds right.\n\nLet me double-check. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is a federal law that imposes a tax on employers to fund unemployment compensation. The tax collected helps to finance unemployment benefits for workers who have lost their jobs. Now, it's important to note that while FUTA provides a framework, the day-to-day administration of unemployment benefits is typically managed by state governments, which have their own unemployment insurance programs.\n\nSo, considering that, option D seems to be the correct statement. It accurately describes how the unemployment insurance system is administered by the states, in line with their own employment laws, even though the federal government sets overall guidelines through FUTA.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all resignations qualify for unemployment benefits; it usually depends on the reason for resignation.\n\nOption B is wrong because, generally, only employers pay unemployment taxes; employees do not contribute to FUTA.\n\nOption C misrepresents the purpose of unemployment benefits, which are meant to be a temporary safety net during periods of job loss, not permanent assistance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
