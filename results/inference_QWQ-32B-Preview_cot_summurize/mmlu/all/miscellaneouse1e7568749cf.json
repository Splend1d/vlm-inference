                    "text": "So I've got this question here about colors and light, and I have to figure out what color a piece of paper appears under certain lighting conditions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the paper appears blue in sunlight. That means it reflects blue light and absorbs other colors. So, its intrinsic color is blue.\n\nNow, it's being illuminated solely by a red light that has passed through a green filter. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky. Let's see.\n\nLight sources can be thought of in terms of the colors they emit. Sunlight is white light, which contains all colors. But here, the paper is being illuminated by a red light that's passed through a green filter.\n\nWait a minute, red light is being passed through a green filter. What happens when light passes through a filter?\n\nA filter typically allows only certain colors to pass through. So, a green filter would allow green light to pass through and block other colors.\n\nBut the light source is red, and it's passing through a green filter. Red and green are different colors. So, does that mean the red light is being blocked by the green filter?\n\nI think so, because the green filter should block the red light and only allow green light to pass through. But the light source is red, so probably very little to no light passes through the green filter.\n\nWait, but if the light source is red and it's passing through a green filter, and if the filter blocks red light, then doesn't that mean there's no light reaching the paper?\n\nIf there's no light reaching the paper, then the paper shouldn't reflect any light, right? So, it should appear black.\n\nBut let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nFirst, the paper is blue in sunlight, meaning it reflects blue light.\n\nNow, it's being illuminated by red light that's passed through a green filter.\n\nIf the green filter blocks red light, then no red light reaches the paper.\n\nTherefore, there's no light hitting the paper, so it should appear black.\n\nAlternatively, if the green filter doesn't completely block red light, maybe some light still gets through, but probably very little.\n\nBut the question says \"solely by a red light that is passed through a green filter.\" So, it's implying that the only light source is this filtered red light.\n\nIf the green filter blocks the red light, then the paper shouldn't reflect any light, hence it should look black.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filter doesn't block all of the red light, so a tiny bit gets through and is reflected by the paper.\n\nBut since the paper only reflects blue light, and the incoming light is red, which is a different color, would the paper reflect the red light at all?\n\nWell, color works based on reflection and absorption. If the paper is blue, it means it reflects blue and absorbs other colors. So, if red light hits it, it should absorb the red light and not reflect it.\n\nTherefore, no light is being reflected, so it should appear black.\n\nWait, but what if the filter isn't perfect and lets some red light through? Then, the paper absorbs that red light, so still no reflection.\n\nSo, in either case, it seems like the paper should appear black under this illumination.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe the filter isn't purely green and lets some red through, or perhaps there's some overlap in the wavelengths.\n\nBut according to the question, it's a green filter, which should primarily allow green light through and block red light.\n\nTherefore, under these conditions, the paper should appear black.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Black.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Blue - This would be the case if the paper was being illuminated by blue light, but it's being illuminated by red light that's filtered green, which shouldn't provide any blue light.\n\nB. Green - If the filter was allowing green light through and the paper was reflecting green, but the light source is red, not green.\n\nC. Red - If the paper was reflecting the red light, but since it's blue, it should absorb red light.\n\nD. Black - No light is being reflected, so it appears black.\n\nYes, D. Black seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
