                    "text": "Let's see. I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: I admired the neighbor's prized roses, so I picked them.\n\nHmm, picking someone else's flowers without their permission seems like trespassing and theft. Even if you admire them, taking them without asking is wrong. It's invading their property and taking something that doesn't belong to you. So, that sounds morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: I sold my rundown car online, photoshopping it to look brand-new online.\n\nOkay, selling something and misrepresenting its condition by altering photos to make it look better than it actually is seems dishonest. It's like lying to potential buyers to get them to purchase the car. That doesn't sound right either.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions. In the first one, it's about respecting others' property, and in the second, it's about honesty in transactions.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Maybe there's a difference in how serious or clearly wrong they are.\n\nIn the first scenario, picking flowers might be seen as a lesser offense compared to selling a car with false information. Maybe it's more acceptable or less harmful?\n\nWait, but harming someone's property is still wrong, regardless of the value. And selling a car with misleading photos could cause more damage because the buyer might pay more than the car is worth, based on the false representation.\n\nSo, both are wrong, but perhaps in different ways and with different degrees of severity.\n\nBut the question is asking according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, which might consider both actions as clearly wrong, just in different contexts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe admiring the roses and picking them is seen as more understandable, especially if the person really admires them, although still wrong. Whereas photoshopping car photos is a deliberate act of deception for personal gain.\n\nBut in terms of moral wrongness, both seem pretty clear-cut.\n\nWait, maybe some people might think that selling the car with photoshopped images is just standard practice in used car sales, but I don't think that's the case. In the US, there are laws about truth in advertising and misrepresentation, so that would be illegal and morally wrong.\n\nSimilarly, picking neighbors' flowers without permission is against the law and morally wrong.\n\nSo, I think both actions are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's consider if there might be any perspective where one of them isn't clearly wrong.\n\nFor example, maybe in some communities, neighbors share flowers, but I don't think that's a common assumption. Generally, neighbors' properties are respected, and you don't take things without asking.\n\nAs for the car, well, that's a clear case of fraud, which is universally considered wrong.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there's much room for considering either of these actions as not wrong.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
