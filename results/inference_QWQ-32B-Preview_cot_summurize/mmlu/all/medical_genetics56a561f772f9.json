                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fragments a restriction enzyme that recognizes a specific 4-base sequence would cleave a double-stranded bacteriophage genome of 5,000 base pairs (bp) into. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understand that a restriction enzyme cuts DNA at specific sequences. In this case, it recognizes a 4-base sequence. Since DNA consists of four different bases (A, C, G, T), the probability of any given 4-base sequence occurring is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability of a specific 4-base sequence} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{256}\n\\]\n\nThis means that, on average, the enzyme would recognize and cut every 256 base pairs.\n\nHowever, since the genome is double-stranded, we need to consider that the enzyme can bind to either strand. But because the recognition sequence is usually palindromic (the same on both strands when read in the correct orientation), the frequency of cuts might not double. For simplicity, we'll assume that the recognition sequences on both strands are independent, effectively doubling the number of recognition sites.\n\nThus, the average distance between cuts would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average distance between cuts} = \\frac{256}{2} = 128 \\text{ bp}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find out how many fragments the enzyme would produce from a 5,000 bp genome, we can divide the total genome size by the average distance between cuts:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fragments} = \\frac{5000}{128} \\approx 39.06\n\\]\n\nSince the number of fragments must be a whole number, we can round this to approximately 40 fragments.\n\nHowever, considering that the genome is circular ( typical for bacteriophages), the first and last cuts would connect, forming a loop. But for practical purposes, this doesn't significantly affect the average number of fragments.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. about 2\n\nB. about 4\n\nC. about 20\n\nD. about 50\n\nOur calculation suggests approximately 40 fragments, which is closest to option D, about 50.\n\nBut let's double-check our assumptions. Perhaps the recognition sequences on both strands are not entirely independent; they might overlap or correlate in some way. Additionally, some sequences might be palindromic on both strands, leading to more frequent cuts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enzyme only cuts once per recognition site, regardless of the strand, which would mean the frequency of cuts isn't doubled.\n\nLet's consider an alternative approach. The total number of possible 4-base sequences in a 5,000 bp genome is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of possible 4-base sequences} = 5000 - 4 + 1 = 4997\n\\]\n\nThe probability of any given sequence being the recognition sequence is 1/256, as calculated earlier. Therefore, the expected number of recognition sites is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected number of recognition sites} = 4997 \\times \\frac{1}{256} \\approx 19.52\n\\]\n\nSince each recognition site corresponds to one cut, and each cut increases the number of fragments by one, starting from one piece, the total number of fragments would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fragments} = 1 + 19.52 \\approx 20.52\n\\]\n\nRounding to about 20 fragments, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, this is quite different from our earlier estimate of about 40 fragments. What's the discrepancy here?\n\nThe issue lies in how we accounted for the double-stranded nature of the DNA. In the first approach, we halved the average distance between cuts by assuming that cuts on both strands double the frequency. However, in reality, for palindromic sequences, the recognition sites on both strands coincide at the same position, effectively meaning that a single recognition site is present per 256 bp, not doubled.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to consider that each recognition site is unique, regardless of the strand, and thus the expected number of recognition sites is indeed approximately 19.52, leading to about 20 fragments.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be option C, about 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
