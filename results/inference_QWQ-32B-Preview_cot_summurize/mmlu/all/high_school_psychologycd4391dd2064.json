The question is asking which approach expresses the idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others. The options are:\n\nA. Homeostatic regulation\n\nB. Goal-setting\n\nC. Expectancy-value\n\nD. Hierarchy of needs\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to recall what Abraham Maslow is known for. I remember that Maslow is famous for his hierarchy of needs, which is like a pyramid where basic needs are at the bottom and more advanced needs are at the top.\n\nSo, the hierarchy of needs suggests that certain needs are more fundamental or imperative for survival compared to others. For example, physiological needs like food, water, and sleep are at the base, followed by safety needs, then love and belonging, esteem, and finally self-actualization at the apex.\n\nThis seems to align with the question's statement about some motives being more imperative to survival than others. The hierarchy shows that without fulfilling the lower, more basic needs, one cannot adequately pursue higher-level needs.\n\nNow, let's look at the other options to make sure that hierarchy of needs is indeed the correct answer.\n\nOption A: Homeostatic regulation. I think this is related to maintaining internal balance in the body, like regulating temperature or hormone levels. While it's important for survival, it seems more biological and less about motivational levels compared to Maslow's psychological needs hierarchy.\n\nOption B: Goal-setting. This is a concept that involves setting specific objectives and working towards them. While motivation is involved, it doesn't specifically address the prioritization of needs based on their importance for survival.\n\nOption C: Expectancy-value. I believe this refers to a theory where motivation is based on the expectation of achieving a goal and the value placed on that goal. Again, it's about motivation but doesn't emphasize the hierarchy or importance of needs for survival.\n\nComparing all these, the hierarchy of needs seems to be the approach that best expresses the idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others.\n\nTo double-check, maybe I should think about Maslow's actual theory. In his hierarchy, physiological needs are essential for basic survival. If these aren't met, the organism will focus on fulfilling them before moving up to higher needs. Similarly, safety needs are important for continued well-being, and so on.\n\nThis prioritization based on survival importance is a key aspect of Maslow's theory. Therefore, it makes sense that the hierarchy of needs is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer should be D. Hierarchy of needs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
