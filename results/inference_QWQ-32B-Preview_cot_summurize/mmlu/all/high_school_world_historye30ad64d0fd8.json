And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat evidence is there in the passage that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Ibn Battuta about his travels in Mali during the 1300s, and it's describing some interesting social customs there. The question is asking for evidence in the passage that shows the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously. The options are:\n\nA. The genealogy is derived from the maternal side.\n\nB. They study Islamic law faithfully.\n\nC. The men do not yield to sexual jealousy.\n\nD. They enjoy friendship with all, regardless of gender.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the passage is saying about their religious practices. Let's look at the relevant parts:\n\n\"They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart.\"\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. They are practicing Muslims, keeping to their prayers, studying Islamic law, and memorizing the Qur'an. That sounds like they take their faith seriously.\n\nOption B mentions \"They study Islamic law faithfully.\" That aligns directly with \"studying fiqh,\" which is Islamic jurisprudence. So that seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption A is about genealogy being derived from the maternal side. While this is an interesting cultural practice, it's not directly related to their religious practices or how seriously they take their faith.\n\nOption C says \"The men do not yield to sexual jealousy.\" The passage mentions that there is no sexual jealousy among the men, and that women are not modest in the presence of men and do not veil themselves. This seems more related to their social and sexual norms rather than their religious practices. In fact, these practices might even be considered un-Islamic by some standards, as modesty and veiling are important aspects of Islamic teachings for women.\n\nOption D talks about enjoying friendship with all, regardless of gender. Again, this is more about their social interactions and may not directly relate to their religious devotion.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, option B seems to be the most directly related to their serious practice of Islam, as it mentions studying fiqh and learning the Qur'an, which are key religious activities.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's more to it. The passage says they \"keep to the prayers,\" which is another important aspect of Islam. But options A, C, and D don't seem to directly relate to religious practices or devotion.\n\nOption C might be seen as a positive trait in some religious contexts, but in Islam, jealousy is generally considered a negative trait, but not directly related to religious practice. Moreover, the passage presents this lack of jealousy in a matter-of-fact way, not necessarily as a religious practice.\n\nOption D about friendships across genders could be seen as either positive or negative depending on one's perspective on Islam, but again, it's more about social interactions than religious devotion.\n\nTherefore, the best evidence in the passage that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously is option B: \"They study Islamic law faithfully.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
