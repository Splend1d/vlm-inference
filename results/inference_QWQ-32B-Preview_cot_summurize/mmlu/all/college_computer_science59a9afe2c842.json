To translate Web addresses to host names\n\nB. To determine the IP address of a given host name\n\nC. To determine the hardware address of a given host name\n\nD. To determine the hardware address of a given IP address\n\nFirst, I need to recall what ARP does. I remember that ARP is related to finding hardware addresses, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nOption A mentions translating Web addresses to host names. I think that sounds like DNS, not ARP. DNS handles mapping domain names to IP addresses, but ARP is something different.\n\nOption B says to determine the IP address of a given host name. Again, that seems like DNS's job. So probably not ARP.\n\nOption C is about determining the hardware address from a host name. Hmm, that sounds a bit like combining DNS and ARP. Maybe.\n\nOption D is to determine the hardware address from a given IP address. That sounds more like what ARP does.\n\nLet me think about it. In a network, when one device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it needs to know the hardware address, which is the MAC address, to send the Ethernet frame.\n\nBut devices know each other by their IP addresses, not directly by their MAC addresses. So, ARP is used to map an IP address to a MAC address.\n\nSo, if I have an IP address and I need to find the corresponding MAC address to send a packet, I would use ARP.\n\nWait, but option C says \"hardware address of a given host name.\" That would involve first resolving the host name to an IP address using DNS, and then using ARP to get the MAC address from the IP address.\n\nBut option D directly says from IP address to hardware address, which is exactly what ARP does.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D. ARP is used to determine the hardware address (MAC address) of a device when you have its IP address.\n\nJust to make sure, let's eliminate the other options:\n\nA. Translating Web addresses to host names is DNS's job.\n\nB. Determining the IP address from a host name is also DNS.\n\nC. Determining the hardware address from a host name would involve both DNS and ARP, but ARP itself is specifically for IP to MAC resolution.\n\nD. Determining the hardware address from a given IP address is exactly what ARP does.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
