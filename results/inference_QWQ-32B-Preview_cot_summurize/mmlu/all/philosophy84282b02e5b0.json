I remember something about reason and emotion being involved.\n\nOption A says \"reason.\" I think Hume might have had something to say about reason in morality. Maybe he thought that reason isn't the source of moral judgments. I think he believed that reason is more about discovering facts and truths, but moral judgments are something else.\n\nOption B says \"a moral sense that is unique to each person.\" Hmm, that sounds like moral relativism, where everyone has their own moral compass. I'm not sure if Hume would agree with that. He might have thought that morality is more universal than that.\n\nOption C says \"a moral sense that is universal in our species.\" That sounds interesting. Maybe he believed that all humans share a common moral sense, like certain moral principles are innate or universally recognized.\n\nOption D says \"emotion.\" I think this might be related to his idea that moral judgments are feelings or sentiments. He might have argued that when we make moral judgments, we're expressing our emotions about actions or characters.\n\nLet me think about this. Hume is often associated with the idea that reason is the slave of the passions. So, perhaps he thought that our moral judgments are driven by feelings rather than cold, rational calculations.\n\nAlso, I recall that Hume made a distinction between facts and values, suggesting that you can't derive an \"ought\" from an \"is.\" That might imply that moral judgments aren't purely rational.\n\nGiven that, I think option D, \"emotion,\" might be the correct answer. Hume seems to suggest that moral judgments come from our feelings or sentiments about things.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe he did believe in a universal moral sense, like option C. Some philosophers argue that there are universal moral principles that all humans recognize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he thought that each person has their own moral sense, making option B plausible.\n\nWait, but Hume was a empiricist, which means he believed that all knowledge comes from sensory experience. So, maybe he thought that our moral judgments are based on our experiences and feelings.\n\nI think the key here is understanding Hume's take on morality. He famously said that reason alone can't motivate action; it's always passion or emotion that drives us.\n\nSo, in the context of moral judgments, it makes sense that he would say they arise from emotion rather than reason.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to go with option D, \"emotion.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
