                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics problem step by step. So, the question is about a price ceiling on leather garments that's set below the equilibrium price. We need to figure out what happens in the market based on that.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a price ceiling is. A price ceiling is a maximum price that sellers are allowed to charge for a good or service. It's like a legal limit set by the government to make sure that prices don't get too high, maybe to make things more affordable for consumers.\n\nNow, the key here is that this price ceiling is below the equilibrium price. Equilibrium price is the price where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. It's the market's natural balance point.\n\nSo, if the government sets a price ceiling below that equilibrium price, what does that mean? Well, at that lower price, consumers might be happier because they're paying less, but producers might not be so happy because they're getting less money for their products.\n\nLet me think about supply and demand. When the price is below equilibrium, the quantity demanded usually exceeds the quantity supplied. That means more people want to buy the product at that price than there are sellers willing to sell it at that price. So, there's a shortage.\n\nIs that correct? Let me recall the basic principles. According to the law of demand, when prices decrease, quantity demanded increases. According to the law of supply, when prices decrease, quantity supplied decreases.\n\nSo, if the price is lowered below equilibrium, quantity demanded goes up, and quantity supplied goes down. That means there's a bigger gap between what people want to buy and what's available to buy. That's a shortage.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. There will be a shortage.\n\nB. There will be a surplus.\n\nC. The demand curve for leather garments will shift leftward.\n\nD. The supply curve for leather garments will shift rightward.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option A seems to be the correct answer. But let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nOption B is a surplus. A surplus happens when there's more supply than demand, which is the opposite of a shortage. That would happen if the price ceiling was above the equilibrium price, but in this case, it's below, so surplus doesn't make sense here.\n\nOption C says the demand curve shifts leftward. A leftward shift in the demand curve means that at every price level, consumers are willing to buy less. But in this scenario, the demand curve isn't shifting; it's the price that's being changed by the price ceiling. So, this doesn't seem relevant to the situation.\n\nOption D suggests the supply curve shifts rightward. A rightward shift in the supply curve means that at every price level, suppliers are willing to supply more. Again, in this case, the supply curve isn't shifting; the price is being controlled by the ceiling.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A: there will be a shortage.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider if there are any other factors at play here. For example, might the price ceiling cause some producers to exit the market because they can't make a profit at the lower price? That could shift the supply curve, but in the short run, it's more likely that the quantity supplied just decreases along the existing supply curve.\n\nAlso, perhaps consumers might start demanding even more as the price decreases, exacerbating the shortage. But again, that's consistent with option A.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The price ceiling below equilibrium leads to a shortage in the market for leather garments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
