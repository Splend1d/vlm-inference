This technique is based on the principle that trees produce one growth ring per year, and the pattern of these rings can be used to date the tree and, in some cases, the wood from the tree.\n\nHere's a brief overview of why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Radiocarbon dating: This method measures the decay of carbon-14 isotopes in organic material to determine its age. It's not based on tree-ring growth patterns.\n\nC. Paleomagnetic dating: This technique uses changes in the Earth's magnetic field over time, recorded in rocks and sediments, to date those materials. It doesn't involve tree rings.\n\nD. Fission-track dating: This is a radiometric dating method that measures the damage trails, or fission tracks, caused by the spontaneous fission of uranium-238 in minerals. It's not related to tree-ring growth.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. dendrochronology."
