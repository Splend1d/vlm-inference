                    "text": "Let's tackle this salary increase problem step by step. Patricia starts with an annual salary of $20,000. After the first year, she gets a 10% raise, and then after the second year, she gets another 10% raise on her new salary. We need to find out what her salary is after these two increases.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a 10% increase means. A 10% increase means she gets an additional 10% of her current salary added to her salary.\n\nSo, after the first year:\n\nIncrease = 10% of $20,000\n\nTo calculate 10% of $20,000, we can multiply $20,000 by 0.10.\n\n$20,000 * 0.10 = $2,000\n\nSo, her salary after the first year increases by $2,000, making her new salary:\n\n$20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000\n\nNow, after the second year, she gets another 10% increase, but this time it's 10% of her new salary, which is $22,000.\n\nIncrease after second year = 10% of $22,000\n\nAgain, to find 10% of $22,000, we multiply $22,000 by 0.10.\n\n$22,000 * 0.10 = $2,200\n\nSo, her salary after the second year increases by $2,200, making her new salary:\n\n$22,000 + $2,200 = $24,200\n\nTherefore, after two years of 10% increases each year, Patricia's salary would be $24,200.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $24,200\n\nB. $24,000\n\nC. $22,000\n\nD. $4,000\n\nThe correct answer is A. $24,200.\n\nAlternatively, there's a quicker way to calculate this using the concept of compound interest, since each raise is applied to the new salary amount.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\nFinal Amount = Principal * (1 + rate)^time\n\nIn this case, the principal is the initial salary, the rate is the raise percentage, and the time is the number of years.\n\nSo,\n\nFinal Salary = $20,000 * (1 + 0.10)^2\n\n= $20,000 * (1.10)^2\n\n= $20,000 * 1.21\n\n= $24,200\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation.\n\nIt's important to note that the raises are compounded; each raise is based on the previous year's salary after the raise. So, it's not just two separate 10% increases on the original salary, but rather each raise is applied to the increased salary from the previous year.\n\nOption B, $24,000, might be a miscalculation if someone added 10% twice on the original salary:\n\nFirst year increase: $20,000 * 0.10 = $2,000\n\nSecond year increase: another $2,000\n\nTotal increase: $4,000\n\nNew salary: $20,000 + $4,000 = $24,000\n\nBut this doesn't account for the fact that the second raise is on the already increased salary of $22,000, not the original $20,000.\n\nOption C, $22,000, is the salary after the first year's raise.\n\nOption D, $4,000, seems to be the total increase if each raise was 10% of the original salary, which is incorrect because the second raise is on the increased salary.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. $24,200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
