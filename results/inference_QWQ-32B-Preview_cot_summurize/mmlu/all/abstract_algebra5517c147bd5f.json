A solvable group is a group that has a subnormal series where all the factor groups are abelian. Prime-power order means the order of the group is a power of a prime number, like \\( p^n \\) where \\( p \\) is prime and \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n\nIs it true that every solvable group has an order that's a power of a prime? Well, I know that all abelian groups are solvable, and there are abelian groups whose orders are not prime powers, like the cyclic group of order 6, which is \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\). This group is abelian, hence solvable, but 6 is not a prime power since it's \\( 2 \\times 3 \\). So, this seems to be a counterexample to Statement 1. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of prime-power order is solvable.\n\nNow, this statement is about groups whose order is a prime power. So, if a group has order \\( p^n \\), where \\( p \\) is prime and \\( n \\) is a positive integer, is it always solvable?\n\nI recall that all p-groups (groups of prime-power order) have non-trivial centers, and there are results about the upper central series in p-groups. In fact, there's a theorem that says that every p-group is nilpotent, and every nilpotent group is solvable. So, if a group is a p-group, it is nilpotent, and hence solvable. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Statement 1 is false.\n\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
