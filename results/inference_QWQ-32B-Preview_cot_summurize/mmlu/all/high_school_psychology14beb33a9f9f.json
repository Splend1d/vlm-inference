I need to figure out which one is the behavioral component of these negative attitudes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means.\n\nBias: I think bias is when someone has a prejudice or an unfair inclination toward or against something or someone. So, it seems like a mental inclination or a tendency, maybe not purely behavioral.\n\nConditioning: This sounds like a psychological concept where behavior is modified by consequences. Like, if someone does something and gets a reward, they're more likely to do it again. So, conditioning might be related to how attitudes are formed through experiences, but I'm not sure if it's specifically the behavioral component of negative attitudes.\n\nCatharsis: I've heard this term in relation to releasing pent-up emotions, like in therapy. It doesn't seem directly related to negative attitudes toward groups; it's more about emotional release.\n\nDiscrimination: This one seems promising. Discrimination is when someone is treated differently, usually negatively, because of their membership in a particular group. That sounds like a behavior that stems from negative attitudes.\n\nSo, comparing these options, bias seems more like a mental attitude, conditioning is about how behaviors are learned, catharsis is about emotional release, and discrimination is actually acting on negative attitudes toward groups.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. Discrimination.\n\nBut let me double-check. The question is asking for the behavioral component of negative attitudes toward particular groups. Bias is more of a cognitive or attitudinal component, not necessarily behavioral. Conditioning is a process that can lead to behaviors, but it's not the behavior itself in this context. Catharsis is about emotional expression, not specifically about behavior toward groups. Discrimination, on the other hand, is actions or behaviors that reflect negative attitudes toward groups.\n\nSo, yes, discrimination seems to be the behavioral manifestation of negative attitudes or biases toward certain groups.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
