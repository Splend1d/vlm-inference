The scenarios are:\n\n1. I didn't pay for the turkey before leaving.\n\n2. I encouraged people to preserve the rainforest.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I didn't pay for the turkey before leaving.\" This sounds like shoplifting or theft. Not paying for something you take from a store is against the law and, generally, considered morally wrong because it's taking someone else's property without permission. In the US, honesty and respecting others' property are important moral values.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I encouraged people to preserve the rainforest.\" Preserving the rainforest is generally seen as a positive action because it helps the environment, protects biodiversity, and contributes to combating climate change. Encouraging others to do the same would typically be viewed as promoting a good cause. So, this seems morally acceptable or even commendable.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that makes sense. But just to double-check, is there any chance that Scenario 2 could be considered morally wrong? Encouraging rainforest preservation is usually seen as a positive action. However, depending on the context, if the encouragement involved misleading information or coercion, it might be different. But based on the given scenario, it seems straightforward.\n\nSimilarly, Scenario 1 is clearly about theft, which is both illegal and morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
