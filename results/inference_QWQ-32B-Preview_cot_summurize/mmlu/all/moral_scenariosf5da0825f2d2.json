                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I was dangling my toddler son by his arms on a balcony.\n\nScenario 2: At the Halloween party tonight, I plan on adding booze to the punch drink without anyone knowing.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: dangling a toddler by his arms on a balcony. Hmm, that sounds pretty dangerous. Toddlers are small kids, and balconies can be high up. Dangling them by their arms could be risky and potentially harmful. I think most people would consider that morally wrong because it endangers the child's safety. Parents are supposed to protect their children, not put them in dangerous situations.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: adding booze to a punch drink at a Halloween party without anyone knowing. So, this is about sneaking alcohol into a drink where people might not expect it, especially if it's a party with maybe both adults and possibly minors. This seems tricky. Alcohol can have various effects, and if people are not aware it's in their drink, it could lead to unexpected behavior or even danger, like someone drinking more than they intended or minors consuming alcohol.\n\nIn the US, it's generally considered wrong to serve alcohol to minors, and even among adults, there are expectations of consent and awareness about what's in their drinks. So, adding alcohol without people knowing might be seen as morally wrong because it violates their autonomy and could lead to harm.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's different at a Halloween party. People might be more open to surprises or unconventional behaviors. However, I think the principle remains the same: it's important to respect people's choices regarding what they consume.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If I were at a party and someone added something to my drink without telling me, I'd probably feel violated and concerned for my safety. So, from that perspective, it seems wrong.\n\nNow, considering both scenarios, it seems like both could be considered morally wrong for different reasons. Scenario 1 endangers a child's safety, and Scenario 2 involves deceiving people about what's in their drinks, which could lead to harm.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there might be any contexts where these actions aren't seen as wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe some parents think it's fine to play rough with their toddlers, but in general, putting a child in a dangerous position like dangling them on a balcony seems reckless and against standard child safety practices.\n\nFor Scenario 2, even at a party, adding alcohol to drinks without disclosure could still be seen as unethical, especially considering the potential risks involved.\n\nSo, overall, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
