                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. Starting with Statement 1: \"Support vector machines, like logistic regression models, give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example.\"\n\nHmm, I know that logistic regression outputs probabilities directly because it models the log-odds of the classes. But what about support vector machines (SVMs)? I recall that SVMs are primarily designed for classification by finding the hyperplane that maximally separates the classes. They don't inherently provide probability estimates like logistic regression does.\n\nHowever, there are methods to obtain probability estimates from SVMs, such as using Platt scaling or isotonic regression, which are post-processing steps applied after the SVM has made its predictions. But by default, SVMs don't output probabilities; they output class labels based on which side of the decision boundary the input falls.\n\nSo, is Statement 1 true or false? I think it's false because SVMs don't naturally provide probability distributions over labels like logistic regression does. You need to add extra steps to get probabilities from an SVM.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"We would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\"\n\nSupport vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary and have a direct impact on the position and orientation of the hyperplane. They are crucial in defining the SVM model.\n\nWhen you change the kernel from linear to a higher-order polynomial kernel, you're essentially mapping your data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separator can be found. The support vectors in the original feature space might change because the mapping can alter which points become closest to the new decision boundary in the higher-dimensional space.\n\nIn other words, the support vectors are dependent on the kernel used because different kernels induce different mappings and thus different decision boundaries. So, it's unlikely that the same data points would be support vectors across different kernels.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 seems false as well.\n\nSo, both statements are false, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
