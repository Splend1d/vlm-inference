                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Alex is placing paving stones, and the pattern of walking changes with each stone. Let's break it down.\n\nFor the first stone:\n- Alex walks 3 feet to place the stone.\n- Then walks back 3 feet to the crate.\n- So, total distance for the first stone is 3 + 3 = 6 feet.\n\nFor each subsequent stone, Alex walks two feet farther each way. So, for the second stone:\n- Walks 3 + 2 = 5 feet to place the stone.\n- Walks back 5 feet to the crate.\n- Total distance for the second stone is 5 + 5 = 10 feet.\n\nFor the third stone:\n- Walks 5 + 2 = 7 feet to place the stone.\n- Walks back 7 feet to the crate.\n- Total distance is 7 + 7 = 14 feet.\n\nI see a pattern here. Each time, the distance walked to place the stone increases by 2 feet each way, and since he walks back the same distance, the total distance for each stone placement increases by 4 feet.\n\nLet's verify that:\n- First stone: 6 feet\n- Second stone: 10 feet (6 + 4)\n- Third stone: 14 feet (10 + 4)\n- And so on.\n\nSo, it's an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 is 6 feet, and the common difference d is 4 feet.\n\nAlex is placing 50 stones, so we need to find the total distance for all 50 stones.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (2a1 + (n - 1)d)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nn = 50\n\na1 = 6\n\nd = 4\n\nS_50 = 50/2 * (2*6 + (50 - 1)*4)\n\n= 25 * (12 + 49*4)\n\n= 25 * (12 + 196)\n\n= 25 * 208\n\n= 5200 feet\n\nSo, the total distance Alex walked is 5200 feet.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that formula. Sometimes I get confused between different formulas.\n\nAlternatively, I can use:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (a1 + a_n)\n\nWhere a_n is the nth term.\n\nFirst, find a_50.\n\na_n = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\na_50 = 6 + (50 - 1)*4\n\n= 6 + 49*4\n\n= 6 + 196\n\n= 202 feet\n\nThen, S_50 = 50/2 * (6 + 202) = 25 * 208 = 5200 feet\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nBut let's think about it differently to make sure.\n\nFirst stone: 6 feet\n\nSecond stone: 10 feet\n\nThird stone: 14 feet\n\n...\n\nFiftieth stone: 202 feet\n\nSo, it's an arithmetic series with first term 6, last term 202, and number of terms 50.\n\nSum = (first + last) * number of terms / 2\n\n= (6 + 202) * 50 / 2\n\n= 208 * 25\n\n= 5200 feet\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the distance added each time.\n\nEach stone adds 4 feet more than the previous one.\n\nSo, it's indeed an arithmetic sequence with common difference 4.\n\nTherefore, the total distance is 5200 feet.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 100\n\nB. 90950\n\nC. 5200\n\nD. 50\n\nOption C is 5200 feet, which matches our calculation.\n\nBut wait, let's make extra sure.\n\nIs there any chance that the first term or the common difference is different?\n\nLet's re-examine.\n\nFirst stone: walks 3 feet out, 3 feet back: total 6 feet.\n\nSecond stone: two feet farther each way, so 3 + 2 = 5 feet out, 5 feet back: total 10 feet.\n\nThird stone: 5 + 2 = 7 feet out, 7 feet back: total 14 feet.\n\nYes, each time, the distance out increases by 2 feet, and the return trip also increases by 2 feet, so the total distance increases by 4 feet each time.\n\nSo, the sequence is 6, 10, 14, ..., up to 50 terms.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total distance is indeed 5200 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5200} \\]"
