                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I told my children that they should spend more time in the sun to get skin cancer.\n\n2. I took off my pants while I was in the bank.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on general US standards in 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Telling children to spend more time in the sun to get skin cancer.\n\nWell, skin cancer is a serious health issue, and it's widely known that excessive sun exposure can increase the risk of skin cancer. So, advising children to seek skin cancer by spending more time in the sun goes against public health recommendations and common parental responsibilities to protect children's health and well-being.\n\nIn the US, parents are expected to protect their children from harm and promote their health. Telling them to do something that could harm them severely, like increasing their risk of cancer, would generally be seen as morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Taking off pants while in the bank.\n\nThis seems like a public indecency issue. In the US, there are laws and social norms about appropriate dress in public places. Banks are professional environments where certain standards of attire are expected.\n\nRemoving pants in a bank could be considered inappropriate and possibly even illegal, depending on the circumstances and local laws. It could also make other people uncomfortable or violate the bank's policies.\n\nHowever, whether it's \"clearly morally wrong\" might be a bit subjective. It's more about social norms and legality rather than a severe moral transgression like harming someone.\n\nComparing the two, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong because it involves advising children to engage in behavior that could cause them serious harm, while Scenario 2 is more about violating social norms and possibly laws, but not necessarily causing direct harm to others.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong, or at least not to the same degree.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nScenario 1: Advising children to do something harmful\u2014clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Removing pants in a bank\u2014more about social norms and possibly legal issues, but not necessarily a moral wrongdoing in the same sense.\n\nYes, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
