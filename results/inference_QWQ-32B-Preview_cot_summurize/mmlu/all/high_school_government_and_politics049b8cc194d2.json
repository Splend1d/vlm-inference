                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about executive orders. I need to figure out which statement isn't true. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions.\" Hmm, I think about it, and actually, presidents sometimes use executive orders for controversial actions because it allows them to act without Congress's approval. So, this might not be true.\n\nOption B: \"Executive orders have the same effect as laws passed by Congress.\" Well, executive orders are directives from the president that have the force of law, but they're not exactly the same as laws passed by Congress. Laws passed by Congress require approval from both houses and the president, or the president's veto must be overridden. Executive orders are issued solely by the president. So, they might have similar effects in some ways, but they're not the same thing. This might not be true.\n\nOption C: \"Presidents have made increased use of executive orders since the 1970s.\" I recall that there has been a trend of presidents using executive orders more frequently over time, but I'm not sure about the specifics starting from the 1970s. I might need to think about this more or recall some historical data.\n\nOption D: \"Executive orders bypass congressional approval.\" Yeah, that's pretty much the definition of an executive order. The president can issue them without Congress's approval, which is why they're used in situations where the president wants to take action but can't get congressional agreement.\n\nAlright, let's reconsider option A. If presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions, that seems counterintuitive because executive orders allow presidents to act unilaterally, which might be precisely what they'd do for controversial actions when they can't get Congress on board. So, this seems like it might not be true.\n\nOption B is interesting. While executive orders can have the force of law, they're not the same as laws passed by Congress. Laws passed by Congress are supposed to be more comprehensive and go through a broader legislative process. Executive orders are more limited in scope and can be overturned by future presidents or by acts of Congress.\n\nNow, option C about increased use since the 1970s. I think that's probably true because over time, the presidency has become more powerful, and presidents have relied more on executive orders to advance their agendas, especially when faced with a hostile or gridlocked Congress.\n\nOption D is definitely true; that's the whole point of executive orders\u2014they bypass congressional approval.\n\nSo, between options A and B, I think option A is more likely to be the incorrect statement because presidents don't avoid using executive orders for controversial actions; sometimes, they use them precisely for those reasons.\n\nLet me double-check. If I look at recent examples, like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program instituted by President Obama, that was an executive action on immigration, which is a very controversial topic. So, that suggests that presidents do use executive orders for controversial issues.\n\nSimilarly, President Trump issued several executive orders on immigration and other contentious topics.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the statement that isn't true.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider option B again. While executive orders can have legal force, they're not the same as laws passed by Congress. Laws passed by Congress are more enduring and require bicameral support and the president's signature or a veto override.\n\nExecutive orders can be more easily reversed by future presidents and are subject to judicial review.\n\nSo, in that sense, option B is also not entirely true, but compared to option A, I think option A is more clearly incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: Presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
