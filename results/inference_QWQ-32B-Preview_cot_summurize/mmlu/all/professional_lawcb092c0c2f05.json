                    "text": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we have a landowner who sold a farm to an investor with a warranty deed. Then, the investor borrowed $50,000 from a farmer and mortgaged the farm to secure that loan, and this mortgage was recorded. Two years later, the investor sold the farm to his friend using a quitclaim deed, and in that deed, it says the friend \"assumed the mortgage.\"\n\nNow, the investor defaults on the mortgage, and the farmer sues the friend personally to recover the mortgage debt. We need to figure out if the farmer is likely to win this lawsuit.\n\nFirst, let's understand the difference between a warranty deed and a quitclaim deed. A warranty deed guarantees that the seller owns the property and has the right to sell it, and it includes covenants for title assurance. A quitclaim deed, on the other hand, transfers whatever interest the seller has in the property without any warranties. So, when the investor sold the farm to his friend via quitclaim deed, he's basically saying, \"I'm giving you whatever interest I have in this farm, no guarantees.\"\n\nNow, the deed says the friend \"assumed the mortgage.\" Assuming a mortgage typically means that the new owner agrees to take over the mortgage obligations from the original borrower. So, in this case, the friend is agreeing to take over the investor's mortgage debt to the farmer.\n\nBut here's the key point: assuming a mortgage usually affects the liability for the mortgage debt. In many jurisdictions, when a new owner assumes a mortgage, they step into the shoes of the original borrower and become primarily liable for the mortgage debt.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the investor conveyed the property to his friend with a quitclaim deed, and the friend assumed the mortgage. The question is whether this assumption makes the friend personally liable to the farmer for the mortgage debt.\n\nOption A says the farmer will prevail because the friend acquired title to the farm by quitclaim deed. But the type of deed alone doesn't determine personal liability for the mortgage debt. So, this seems a bit off.\n\nOption B says the farmer will prevail because the farmer was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the investor and the friend. Hmm, that's interesting. In some cases, a third party can enforce a contract if they are intended beneficiaries. But in this scenario, the conveyance was between the investor and the friend, and it's not clear that the farmer was intended to be a beneficiary of that conveyance. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption C says the farmer will not prevail because the conveyance did not effectuate a delegation of duties. Delegation of duties typically refers to transferring responsibility for performing an obligation to another party. In mortgage assumptions, the assumption can be either a delegation of duties or a novation. In a novation, the original borrower is released from liability, and the new party assumes full responsibility. If it's just a delegation, the original borrower remains liable.\n\nIn this case, since the deed says the friend \"assumed the mortgage,\" it's possible that this is a novation, meaning the friend is now primarily liable, and the investor is off the hook. But the question is about the farmer suing the friend personally, not about the investor's liability.\n\nOption D says the farmer will not prevail unless the land was subject to the mortgage. But the mortgage was recorded, and it encumbers the land, so the land is subject to the mortgage. That's why the farmer can foreclose on the land if the investor defaults.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. The farmer is bringing an in personam action against the friend to recover the mortgage debt. An in personam action is a lawsuit against a person, as opposed to an in rem action, which is against the property.\n\nSo, the farmer is trying to collect the debt directly from the friend, not just foreclose on the property.\n\nNow, in many jurisdictions, a mortgagee (the farmer, who holds the mortgage) can sue the mortgagor (the investor, who borrowed the money) personally to recover the debt if there's a default.\n\nBut here, the farmer is suing the friend, who is now the owner of the property, having assumed the mortgage.\n\nSo, the question is whether the friend, by assuming the mortgage, has personally obligated himself to pay the mortgage debt to the farmer.\n\nThis seems to hinge on the nature of the assumption of the mortgage.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, assuming a mortgage without more doesn't necessarily make the new owner personally liable to the mortgagee. Instead, it may just mean that the mortgage continues to encumber the property, and the new owner is liable up to the value of the property.\n\nBut in other jurisdictions, assuming a mortgage can make the new owner personally liable for the debt.\n\nAdditionally, the way the assumption is structured can make a difference. If it's a novation, where the original borrower is released and the new owner steps into their shoes, then the new owner would be primarily liable.\n\nIf it's a delegation, where the new owner agrees to make payments, but the original borrower remains liable, then the new owner might be secondarily liable.\n\nGiven that the deed says the friend \"assumed the mortgage,\" it suggests that the friend is now responsible for the mortgage debt.\n\nBut the question is whether this assumption creates personal liability to the farmer.\n\nAlso, since the investor conveyed the property via quitclaim deed, which doesn't provide warranties, and the friend assumed the mortgage, it's possible that the friend is now liable for the mortgage debt.\n\nHowever, the farmer is suing the friend in personam, meaning personally, to recover the debt.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, for the farmer to have a personal claim against the friend, there needs to be an agreement whereby the friend personally undertakes to pay the debt.\n\nSimply assuming the mortgage might not be sufficient to create personal liability; it might only mean that the mortgage continues to encumber the property.\n\nMoreover, since the mortgage was recorded, the farmer has a lien on the property, and can foreclose to satisfy the debt, but that's an in rem action.\n\nAn in personam action is different because it's a personal claim against the friend.\n\nSo, perhaps the farmer cannot bring an in personam action against the friend unless there's a specific agreement whereby the friend personally promises to pay the debt.\n\nGiven that the assumption was part of the quitclaim deed, it's possible that this assumption is only with respect to the property, not personally.\n\nTherefore, the farmer might not have a personal claim against the friend.\n\nAlternatively, if the assumption is deemed a novation, where the friend steps into the investor's shoes, then the friend might be personally liable.\n\nBut without clearer language or jurisdictional specifics, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Prevail, because the friend acquired title to the farm by quitclaim deed.\n\nThis seems incorrect because the type of deed shouldn't determine personal liability.\n\nB. Prevail, because the farmer was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the investor and the friend.\n\nThis also seems unlikely, as the conveyance was between the investor and the friend, and it's not clear that the farmer was intended to be a beneficiary.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the conveyance between the investor and the friend did not effectuate a delegation of duties.\n\nThis could be plausible if the assumption didn't create personal liability for the friend.\n\nD. Not prevail, unless the land was subject to the mortgage.\n\nBut the land was subject to the mortgage, as it was recorded.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is the best answer.\n\nThe friend assuming the mortgage might not be sufficient to delegate the duties of paying the mortgage to the friend in a way that creates personal liability to the farmer.\n\nTherefore, the farmer is unlikely to prevail in an in personam action against the friend.\n\nInstead, the farmer could foreclose on the property to satisfy the debt, but that's an in rem action.\n\nSo, the correct answer is likely C. The farmer will not prevail, because the conveyance between the investor and the friend did not effectuate a delegation of duties.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
