I remember that R-rated movies are restricted in some way, but I don't recall the exact age requirements.\n\nLet me think about this. In the United States, movie ratings are assigned by the Motion Picture Association (MPA), and R-rated movies are meant for viewers who are 17 years or older, but I think there might be some exceptions.\n\nI think for R-rated movies, people under 17 need to be accompanied by an adult, but I'm not sure about the exact age. Maybe it's 17 or 18. Let's see what the options are:\n\nA. 15\n\nB. 17\n\nC. 18\n\nD. 21\n\nOption D seems too high; 21 is the drinking age in the US, but movie viewing ages are different. Option A, 15, seems too young for R-rated movies. So, it's probably between 17 and 18.\n\nI think in the US, the age to see an R-rated movie without an adult is 17, but I might be wrong. Maybe it's 18. I should look this up.\n\nWait, I recall that in some states, the age is 17, and in others, it's 18. But I'm not sure. Perhaps the MPAA has a standard age, but individual states can have their own regulations.\n\nLet me consider that. The MPAA sets the rating, but enforcement is up to the states. So, it might vary.\n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question, and both 17 and 18 are options, maybe the answer is 17, and 18 is just to confuse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 18, as that's the age of adulthood in some contexts.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Generally, in the US, for R-rated movies, the age to see them without an adult is 17.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A, 15: That seems too young for R-rated content.\n\nOption C, 18: That's the age of adulthood, but I think in movies, it's 17.\n\nOption D, 21: Definitely too old.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with B. 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
