Darius has 3 times as many cookies as Sara, so he has 3 * 6 = 18 cookies. So the answer should be C. 18.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. John has 4 cookies. Sara has 2 more than John, which is indeed 6. Then Darius has 3 times Sara's amount, which is 18. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to look at it. Let's see. If John has 4 cookies, and Sara has 2 more, that's 6. Then Darius has 3 times that, which is 18. No other calculations come to mind here.\n\nI think the answer is clearly C. 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
