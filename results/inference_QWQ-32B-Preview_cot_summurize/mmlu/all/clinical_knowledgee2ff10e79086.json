Maybe it's different for them. I should look it up to be sure.\n\nLet me see. I remember that using too much toothpaste can be wasteful and might not provide any extra benefit. In fact, swallowing too much toothpaste can be harmful, especially for kids, because of the fluoride content. So, it's important to use the right amount.\n\nI think for adults, a pea-sized amount is sufficient to cover all teeth surfaces. But maybe for kids, it's less. Like, maybe a smear or a grain of rice-sized amount. I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me check some reliable sources. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), for children under 3 years old, parents should use a smear of fluoride toothpaste about the size of a rice grain. For children between 3 and 6 years old, a pea-sized amount is recommended. For adults, a pea-sized amount is also sufficient.\n\nSo, in this context, since the question doesn't specify age, but considering it's a general recommendation, I think B. A pea-sized amount is the correct answer. Options A, C, and D seem either too little or too much.\n\nWait a minute, option A is \"A smear.\" For adults, a smear might not be enough, especially if it's just a thin layer. A pea-sized amount can be spread appropriately across all teeth. So, perhaps B is better than A.\n\nOption C, \"the length of the toothbrush,\" sounds way too much. That would be a huge amount of toothpaste, and it's not necessary. It could be messy and wasteful.\n\nOption D, \"half an inch,\" that sounds like a line of toothpaste half an inch long. That might be more than a pea-sized amount, but less than the length of the toothbrush. Still, I think a pea-sized amount is the standard recommendation.\n\nI think I'll go with B. A pea-sized amount. But to be thorough, maybe I should consider the type of toothbrush as well. Some toothbrushes have larger heads, so maybe the amount needed varies. However, generally speaking, a pea-sized amount should be adequate.\n\nAlso, the key is to ensure that all tooth surfaces are covered with toothpaste during brushing. So, as long as the toothpaste is distributed properly, the amount should be sufficient.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the correct answer is B. A pea-sized amount. It's a balance between effectiveness and avoiding excess, which could lead to waste or potential health issues if swallowed in large quantities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
