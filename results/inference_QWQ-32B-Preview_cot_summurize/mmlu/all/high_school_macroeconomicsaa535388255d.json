                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which monetary policy would make expansionary fiscal policy less effective. Let's see what each option means and how it affects fiscal policy.\n\nFirst, what is expansionary fiscal policy? It's when the government increases spending or cuts taxes to stimulate the economy, right? So, it's aimed at boosting economic activity.\n\nNow, monetary policy is controlled by the central bank and involves tools like interest rates and money supply to influence the economy.\n\nSo, I need to find out which monetary policy action would counteract or lessen the impact of expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nOption A: Decreasing the value of the domestic currency.\n\nIf the domestic currency decreases in value, that makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive. This could boost domestic production and potentially increase aggregate demand, which seems like it would support expansionary fiscal policy. So, maybe this isn't the answer.\n\nOption B: Lowering the income tax rate.\n\nWait, lowering income tax rates is actually a part of expansionary fiscal policy, not monetary policy. Monetary policy is about actions by the central bank, like the Fed in the US, not about tax rates set by the government. So, this option doesn't make sense in the context of monetary policy.\n\nOption C: Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks.\n\nSelling Treasury securities to commercial banks reduces the banks' reserves. When banks have less reserves, they can lend less money, which decreases the money supply. A decrease in the money supply typically leads to higher interest rates.\n\nHigher interest rates can discourage private investment and consumer spending because borrowing becomes more expensive. This could offset the stimulative effects of expansionary fiscal policy, which is aimed at increasing spending and economic activity.\n\nSo, this seems like it could lessen the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nOption D: Lowering the discount rate.\n\nThe discount rate is the interest rate that the central bank charges to commercial banks for loans. Lowering the discount rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the central bank, which increases their reserves and allows them to lend more to customers.\n\nThis increases the money supply and typically leads to lower interest rates, which encourages borrowing and spending. This would complement expansionary fiscal policy by further stimulating the economy.\n\nTherefore, lowering the discount rate would make expansionary fiscal policy more effective, not less.\n\nComparing options C and D, option C (selling Treasury securities) seems to be the one that would lessen the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy by reducing the money supply and raising interest rates, thereby countering some of the stimulative effects of fiscal policy.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
