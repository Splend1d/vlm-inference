This process is crucial for various biological functions, including gene regulation, genomic imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. The methylation of cytosine typically occurs in CpG dinucleotides, where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide, separated by a phosphate bond.\n\nMethylation is an epigenetic modification that can influence gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Generally, methylation of promoter regions is associated with gene silencing, while methylation within gene bodies can have different effects depending on the context.\n\nAberrant DNA methylation patterns are implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where hypomethylation can lead to genomic instability and hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes.\n\n**References:**\n\n1.
