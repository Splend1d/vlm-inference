                    "text": "So I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure out what the firm should do based on the information given. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the firm hires labor for $15 each and sells its products for $3 each. The marginal product (MP) of the 3rd worker is 10. I need to decide whether the firm should hire more or less labor and how that affects the marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL).\n\nOkay, so let's recall what MRPL is. MRPL is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more unit of labor. It's calculated as the marginal product of labor (MP) multiplied by the marginal revenue (MR). In a perfectly competitive market, MR is equal to the price of the product, which in this case is $3.\n\nSo, MRPL = MP * MR = MP * P\n\nGiven that MP for the 3rd worker is 10 and P is $3, MRPL for the 3rd worker is 10 * 3 = $30.\n\nNow, the firm hires labor up to the point where MRPL equals the wage rate. The wage rate here is $15. So, MRPL ($30) is greater than the wage ($15) for the 3rd worker.\n\nThis suggests that hiring the 3rd worker adds more value ($30) than the cost ($15), so it's profitable to hire them.\n\nBut the question is, what should the firm do next? Should it hire more labor or less?\n\nIf MRPL > wage, it means that hiring an additional worker would still add more to revenue than to cost, so it's beneficial to hire more.\n\nHowever, I need to think about what happens to MRPL as more labor is hired. Typically, marginal product decreases as more labor is added (diminishing marginal returns), so MP decreases with each additional worker.\n\nIf MP decreases, and P is constant, then MRPL also decreases.\n\nSo, as the firm hires more labor, MRPL decreases because MP decreases.\n\nNow, the firm should keep hiring more labor until MRPL equals the wage rate.\n\nIn this case, for the 3rd worker, MRPL is $30, which is greater than the wage of $15, so the firm should hire more labor.\n\nBut as it hires more, MRPL will decrease because MP decreases.\n\nEventually, MRPL will equal the wage, and that's the optimal point.\n\nSo, the statement that seems most true is:\n\nA. The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will increase.\n\nWait, but MRPL typically decreases as more labor is hired due to diminishing marginal returns. So, hiring more labor would actually cause MRPL to decrease, not increase.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to rephrase that.\n\nThe firm should hire more labor until MRPL equals the wage. As it hires more, MRPL decreases, approaching the wage rate.\n\nSo, perhaps a better interpretation is:\n\nThe firm should hire more labor, and as it does, MRPL will decrease toward the wage rate.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will increase.\n\nThis seems incorrect because MRPL usually decreases with more labor.\n\nB. The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\n\nThis makes more sense because as more labor is hired, MRPL decreases.\n\nC. The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will increase.\n\nWait, if the firm hires less labor, MRPL would increase because MP increases (less labor means higher MP per worker), but since MRPL is already greater than wage, it's better to hire more.\n\nD. The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\n\nThis doesn't make sense because if the firm hires less labor, MRPL increases.\n\nSo, the most appropriate answer seems to be B: The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\n\nThis aligns with the idea that the firm should continue hiring labor until MRPL equals the wage, and as it hires more, MRPL decreases toward the wage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because hiring more labor doesn't typically increase MRPL; it decreases it.\n\nOption C is wrong because if MRPL is greater than wage, the firm should hire more, not less.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because hiring less labor would cause MRPL to increase, not decrease.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
