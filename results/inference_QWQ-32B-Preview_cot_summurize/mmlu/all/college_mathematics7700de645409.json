                    "text": "So I have this problem here about work done by a force on a particle moving along a path. The force is constant and unitary, parallel to the vector (-1, 0, 1). The particle moves along the path given by (t, t^2, t^3) from t=0 to t=1. I need to find the work done by this force on the particle during this motion.\n\nFirst, I recall that work done by a force on a particle moving along a curve is given by the line integral of the force field along that curve. Since the force is constant, things should be a bit simpler.\n\nLet me denote the force vector as F. It's parallel to (-1, 0, 1), and it's a unit force. So, first I need to find the unit vector in the direction of (-1, 0, 1).\n\nTo find the unit vector, I need to normalize (-1, 0, 1). The magnitude of (-1, 0, 1) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 0 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the unit vector in the direction of (-1, 0, 1) is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{\\hat{F}} = \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSince F is a unit force in that direction, F = \\mathbf{\\hat{F}}.\n\nNow, the work done by F on the particle as it moves along the path r(t) = (t, t^2, t^3) from t=0 to t=1 is given by the line integral:\n\n\\[\nW = \\int_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{r}\n\\]\n\nSince F is constant, this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nW = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}(1) - \\mathbf{r}(0))\n\\]\n\nLet me compute r(1) and r(0):\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{r}(1) = (1, 1^2, 1^3) = (1, 1, 1)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{r}(0) = (0, 0^2, 0^3) = (0, 0, 0)\n\\]\n\nSo, the displacement vector is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{r}(1) - \\mathbf{r}(0) = (1 - 0, 1 - 0, 1 - 0) = (1, 1, 1)\n\\]\n\nNow, the work is the dot product of F and this displacement vector:\n\n\\[\nW = \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\cdot (1, 1, 1) = \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)(1) + (0)(1) + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)(1) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 0 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, the work done is 0.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this approach. I recall that for a constant force field, the work is indeed just the dot product of the force and the displacement. But maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the line integral explicitly to confirm.\n\nThe path is given by r(t) = (t, t^2, t^3), so the derivative with respect to t is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{r}'(t) = (1, 2t, 3t^2)\n\\]\n\nThen, the work integral is:\n\n\\[\nW = \\int_{0}^{1} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\cdot (1, 2t, 3t^2) \\, dt\n\\]\n\nComputing the dot product:\n\n\\[\n\\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)(1) + (0)(2t) + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)(3t^2) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 0 + \\frac{3t^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3t^2 - 1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[\nW = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{3t^2 - 1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\, dt = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\int_{0}^{1} (3t^2 - 1) \\, dt\n\\]\n\nNow, compute the integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{1} (3t^2 - 1) \\, dt = \\left[ t^3 - t \\right]_{0}^{1} = (1^3 - 1) - (0^3 - 0) = (1 - 1) - (0 - 0) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, W = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\times 0 = 0\n\nThis confirms the earlier result that the work done is 0.\n\nBut let's think about this physically. The force is in the direction of (-1, 0, 1), and the particle moves from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). The displacement is (1,1,1), and the force is (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). The dot product is zero, meaning the force is perpendicular to the displacement. Therefore, no work is done, which makes sense.\n\nWait, but in the line integral approach, even though the force is constant, it's the integral of the dot product of F and dr, which in this case still comes out to zero.\n\nI think the answer is indeed 0, which corresponds to option C.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's any possibility I'm missing something. Maybe the force isn't exactly in the direction of (-1,0,1), but parallel to it, but perhaps scaled differently. But the problem says it's a unit force parallel to (-1,0,1), so my calculation of the unit vector should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that F is a constant force. But the problem states that F is a constant unit force, so my approach should be valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the path isn't straight, and even though the displacement is (1,1,1), the work along the curved path needs to be considered. But since F is constant, the work should still just be F dot displacement, which is zero.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\n"
