                    "text": "Let's tackle this consumer price index (CPI) question. So, the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses a basket of goods and services to calculate CPI. In the base period, this basket costs $200, and in the current period, it costs $400. We need to figure out what the CPI is in the current period based on this information.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for CPI. I think it's something like:\n\n\\[ \\text{CPI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Current Period Price}}{\\text{Base Period Price}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{CPI} = \\left( \\frac{400}{200} \\right) \\times 100 = 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\]\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, according to this, the CPI in the current period is 200.\n\nBut let's double-check if I'm missing something. The base period usually has a CPI of 100, right? Because it's the reference point. So, if the base period price is $200 and the current period price is $400, that means prices have doubled.\n\nIf the base period CPI is 100, then doubling the price should make the current period CPI 200. That makes sense.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. equals 0.5 in the current period.\n\nThat can't be right because if the price has doubled, the CPI should be higher than the base period, not lower.\n\nB. has risen 5 percent from the base to the current period.\n\nWait, the price has doubled, which is a 100% increase, not 5%. So, this can't be correct.\n\nC. equals 50 in the current period.\n\nAgain, if prices have doubled, the CPI should be 200, not 50.\n\nD. equals 200 in the current period.\n\nThis matches what I calculated.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about what each option is saying.\n\nOption A says the CPI is 0.5 in the current period. That would mean that prices have halved, which is the opposite of what happened.\n\nOption B says it has risen 5% from the base to the current period. A 5% increase from 200 would be 210, but that's not what's being said here. The price went from 200 to 400, which is a 100% increase.\n\nOption C says it equals 50 in the current period, which would imply that prices have fallen by 75%, which isn't the case.\n\nOption D says it equals 200 in the current period, which aligns with the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
