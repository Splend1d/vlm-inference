Maximisation of outcomes for individuals\n\nC. The best outcome for the majority of people\n\nD. The least worst outcome for everybody\n\nFirst, I need to remember what utilitarianism is all about. I think it's a theory that focuses on maximizing happiness or utility for the greatest number of people. So, it's kind of like deciding what's best for the majority.\n\nOption A says \"equality for everyone.\" That sounds more like egalitarianism, where everyone is treated equally. But utilitarianism isn't just about equality; it's about the greatest happiness for the greatest number. So, maybe A isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B is \"maximisation of outcomes for individuals.\" This sounds a bit like individualism or perhaps egoism, where each person looks out for their own interests. But utilitarianism is more about the overall happiness, not just maximizing for single individuals. So, B might not be the correct answer.\n\nOption C is \"the best outcome for the majority of people.\" That seems pretty close to what I remember about utilitarianism. It's about making decisions that benefit the most people possible. So, this could be a strong candidate.\n\nOption D is \"the least worst outcome for everybody.\" I'm not sure what that means exactly. Maybe it's about minimizing harm or something like that. It sounds a bit like a utilitarian approach, but I think it's not as precise as option C.\n\nLet me think again. Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory, which means that the rightness or wrongness of actions is determined by their consequences. The goal is to maximize utility, which is often interpreted as happiness or well-being.\n\nSo, if I have to choose between these options, C seems the most accurate. It directly refers to achieving the best outcome for the majority, which aligns with the idea of maximizing overall happiness.\n\nOption A, equality for everyone, isn't necessarily about maximizing happiness; it's about equality. You could have equality and still not maximize happiness.\n\nOption B, maximizing outcomes for individuals, seems to focus on individual gains rather than the collective good.\n\nOption D, the least worst outcome for everybody, is a bit vague. Maybe it's related to minimizing suffering, but I'm not sure.\n\nI think I'll go with C. The best outcome for the majority of people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
