A protestor organized a demonstration against federal governmental support to rebels in a foreign country. The rally took place in a city park, and attracted about 100 supporters. During the rally, the protestor delivered a speech to the attendees. At the conclusion of his speech, the protestor said, \"I'm sick and tired of the garbage this administration is getting away with. Here's what I think about its policy of rebel aid . . . \" At which point, the protestor walked over to a trash can and dumped its contents on the ground. As the crowd cheered wildly, the protestor shouted, \"No more rebel aid . . . let's stop this garbage now!\" After littering the park, the protestor and his supporters left without picking up the trash. As a matter of constitutional law, may the protestor be prosecuted under the aforementioned city ordinance for littering the public park?\n\nA. No, because littering the park in these circumstances could be construed as symbolic speech and, thus, it is protected from government regulation by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nB. No, because the facts do not indicate that the protestor's actions presented a clear and present danger that was likely to produce or incite imminent lawless action, thereby necessitating an abridgment of his freedom of speech.\nC. Yes, because the city ordinance advances an important and legitimate public interest and is not directed at the suppression of communication.\nD. Yes, because littering the park is conduct, not speech and, therefore, it may not be treated by the law as communication.\n"

                    "text": "This question is about whether a protestor can be prosecuted for littering in a public park under a city ordinance, given that the littering was part of a protest. The options involve different aspects of constitutional law, particularly freedom of speech and the limitations on it.\n\nFirst, let's understand the scenario. The protestor organized a demonstration in a city park against federal government support for rebels in a foreign country. After giving a speech, the protestor dumped the contents of a trash can on the ground, shouting about stopping the \"garbage\" policy of rebel aid. The crowd cheered, and then everyone left without cleaning up.\n\nNow, there's a city ordinance that makes it unlawful to litter in a public park, with penalties of up to $100 fine or 30 days imprisonment. The question is whether prosecuting the protestor under this ordinance would be constitutional.\n\nOption A says no, because littering in this context could be considered symbolic speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Symbolic speech is a form of expression, like burning a flag or wearing armbands, that conveys a message without spoken words. If littering was a form of symbolic speech here, it might be protected unless it causes a clear and present danger.\n\nOption B also says no, but for a different reason. It mentions that the facts don't show a clear and present danger likely to produce imminent lawless action. This seems to relate to the Brandenburg test, which says that speech can be prohibited only if it's intended and likely to incite imminent lawless action. However, this option seems a bit off because littering is conduct, not just speech.\n\nOption C says yes, because the city ordinance serves an important public interest and isn't aimed at suppressing communication. This suggests that even if there's some expressive element to the littering, the government's interest in keeping parks clean is significant enough to outweigh it.\n\nOption D says yes, because littering is conduct, not speech, and therefore doesn't receive the same protections as communication.\n\nTo decide, we need to consider whether the littering was expressive conduct\u2014meaning it was intended to convey a particular message\u2014and whether the government's interest in regulating the conduct outweighs the expressive element.\n\nIn United States v. O'Brien, the Supreme Court established a test for when the government can regulate expressive conduct. The test has four parts:\n\n1. The conduct must be within the constitutional protection.\n\n2. The government's regulation must be justified without reference to the content of the expression.\n\n3. The regulation must further an important or substantial government interest.\n\n4. The interest must be unrelated to the suppression of free expression.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the regulation is valid.\n\nIn this case, the littering could be seen as expressive conduct because the protestor was making a point about the government's policy being \"garbage.\" So, it has both expressive and non-expressive elements.\n\nNow, the city's interest in keeping parks clean is certainly important and substantial. The ordinance is content-neutral; it applies to all littering, regardless of the message behind it. Also, the interest in cleanliness isn't related to suppressing free expression; it's about maintaining public spaces.\n\nTherefore, under the O'Brien test, the city ordinance would likely be constitutional in this context. The government's interest in preventing littering is separate from the message the protestor was trying to convey.\n\nAdditionally, in Texas v. Johnson, the Court held that burning the American flag was symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment. However, in that case, the law was specifically targeted at the symbolic act of flag burning, which made it content-based. Here, the ordinance is general and not targeted at any particular message.\n\nComparatively, in Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, the Court allowed the government to prohibit sleeping in a park, even though it was part of a protest about homelessness. The Court found that the government's interest in park maintenance outweighed the expressive element of the conduct.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, the city's interest in keeping the park clean likely outweighs the expressive element of the littering. Therefore, the protestor can probably be prosecuted under the ordinance.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA is incorrect because even if the littering was symbolic speech, the government's interest in regulating the conduct may still allow prosecution.\n\nB is also incorrect because the clear and present danger test applies more to pure speech, not to conduct with expressive elements.\n\nC is correct because the ordinance advances an important public interest and isn't aimed at suppressing communication.\n\nD is partially correct but doesn't consider the expressive element as thoroughly as option C does.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: Yes, because the city ordinance advances an important and legitimate public interest and is not directed at the suppression of communication.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
