                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character calls 911 to report that their neighbor is screaming for help at home. Now, morally, if someone is actually in distress or danger, calling for help is the right thing to do. It's an act of concern and responsibility towards one's neighbor. However, there's a catch here: the character is described as \"the main character (who uses I/me/my)\", which might imply that this action is being questioned for some reason.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, reporting a potential emergency is not wrong; in fact, it's encouraged. So, at first glance, this seems like the right thing to do.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the neighbor wasn't actually in distress, and the main character is lying to 919. If that's the case, then it would be morally wrong to make a false emergency call, wasting emergency services' time and potentially putting real emergencies at risk.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify whether the neighbor is actually screaming for help or not. It just says that the main character reported that they were. So, without knowing the truth, it's hard to judge morally. However, assuming that the neighbor was not actually screaming for help, and the main character is making a false report, that would be morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is on a military submarine and notices a small hole with water coming through. Instead of addressing the issue properly, they just put a band-aid over it and go to bed. This seems negligent and potentially dangerous, especially in a submarine where even small leaks can be serious safety hazards.\n\nMorally, in a situation like this, one is expected to report any damages or issues immediately to ensure the safety of the entire crew. Ignoring a potential safety risk and trying to fix it inadequately with a band-aid is not just morally wrong but also potentially disastrous.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- If the main character in Scenario 1 is making a false emergency call, that's morally wrong.\n\n- The main character in Scenario 2 is being negligent and putting others at risk, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIf we assume that in Scenario 1 the main character is making a false report, then both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, which would be option A.\n\nHowever, if the main character in Scenario 1 is accurately reporting an emergency, then Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong, which would be option C.\n\nBut based on the way the question is phrased, \"does the main character... do something clearly morally wrong,\" and considering that Scenario 2 is clearly negligent and dangerous, while Scenario 1 is unclear without knowing if the report is true or false.\n\nPerhaps the question expects us to consider that calling 911 for a non-emergency is wrong, but in reality, it's only wrong if it's a false report.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether reporting a possible emergency is morally right or wrong. In general, reporting a possible emergency is morally right, unless it's a false report intended to cause harm or distress.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in Scenario 1, and the clear negligence in Scenario 2, I would lean towards option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut to be thorough, I need to consider if reporting a neighbor screaming for help could be morally wrong under any circumstances. For example, if the main character knows it's not a real emergency and is making the call to harass the neighbor or misuse emergency services, then it would be wrong.\n\nHowever, without that context, the default assumption should be that the main character is acting responsibly by reporting a potential emergency.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
