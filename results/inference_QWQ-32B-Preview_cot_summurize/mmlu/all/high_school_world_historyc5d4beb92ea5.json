This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid. And all lands, both islands and mainlands, found and discovered already, or to be found and discovered hereafter, by the said King of Portugal and by his vessels on this side of the said line and bound determined as above, toward the east, in either north or south latitude, on the eastern side of the said bound provided the said bound is not crossed, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King of Portugal and his successors.

                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about the Treaty of Tordesillas signed in 1494, which was an agreement between the Kingdom of Castile (part of Spain) and Portugal to divide the newly discovered lands in the New World. The treaty established a meridian line 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, and all lands discovered to the east of this line would belong to Portugal, while lands to the west would belong to Spain.\n\nNow, the question is asking which technology most directly caused this treaty to be signed. So, I need to think about what technological advancements enabled the European explorations that led to the need for such a treaty.\n\nOption A is gunpowder weapons. While gunpowder was indeed a significant military technology at the time, I'm not sure if it directly led to the signing of this particular treaty. The treaty was more about dividing territorial claims rather than military conquests.\n\nOption B is the compass. The compass was a crucial navigation tool that allowed sailors to determine their direction at sea more accurately. This would have been essential for long-distance ocean voyages, like those undertaken by Columbus and other explorers. So, the compass played a significant role in enabling these explorations.\n\nOption C is steel. Steel was certainly important for the construction of ships and for weaponry, but similar to gunpowder, I'm not sure if it was the direct cause for the treaty being signed.\n\nOption D is germ theory. Germ theory is the understanding of how diseases are caused by microorganisms, but this concept wasn't developed until much later, in the 19th century. So, this can't be the correct answer.\n\nThinking back, the Treaty of Tordesillas was a response to the explorations of Christopher Columbus in 1492, who sailed westward from Spain, seeking a new route to Asia but instead landed in the Americas. Portugal, which had been exploring the African coast, wanted to clarify the boundaries of their territorial claims to avoid conflicts with Spain.\n\nSo, what technology enabled these long-distance sea voyages? It was a combination of several advancements, including better ship design, navigation tools, and sailing techniques. Among the options given, the compass stands out as a key technological advancement that made these voyages possible by improving navigation.\n\nWithout the compass, sailors would have relied more on celestial navigation and coastal piloting, which were less reliable for ocean crossings. The compass allowed for more accurate navigation in open seas, which was essential for the voyages of Columbus and other explorers.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the compass is the technology that most directly caused the treaty to be signed, as it enabled the explorations that led to the need for dividing the newly discovered lands.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
