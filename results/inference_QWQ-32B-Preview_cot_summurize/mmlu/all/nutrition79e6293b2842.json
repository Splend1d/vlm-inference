                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about newborn weight loss. It's important to understand what's normal and when to worry because every parent wants their baby to thrive.\n\nFirst, I know that babies often lose some weight right after they're born. This is usual because they lose extra fluid and might not eat much in the first few days. But how much weight loss is too much?\n\nOption A says to be concerned if weight loss is 5%. But 5% seems pretty minimal. I think babies can lose more than that without it being a problem, right? Maybe not.\n\nOption B says to be concerned if weight loss is less than 10%. Wait, less than 10% means weight loss is below 10%, so like 9%, 8%, etc. But if a baby loses 9% of their weight, is that still okay? I'm a bit confused here.\n\nOption C mentions being concerned if the birth weight isn't regained by day 7. So, if a baby hasn't gotten back to their original weight by a week old, that might be a issue.\n\nOption D says to be concerned if weight loss is more than 10% or if birth weight isn't regained by day 14. So, this allows for more time, up to two weeks, for the baby to regain their birth weight.\n\nHmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nI recall that normal weight loss after birth can be up to 10% of the birth weight. So, if a baby is born at 3.5 kg, they might lose up to 350 grams. That seems significant, but it's considered normal.\n\nBut when does weight loss become a cause for concern? If it's more than 10%, that might indicate that the baby isn't getting enough milk or there's some other issue.\n\nAlso, the time frame for regaining birth weight is important. Some babies might take longer, especially if they were born premature or have other health issues.\n\nI think option D makes the most sense because it considers both the percentage of weight loss and the time frame for regaining birth weight.\n\nLet me check some reliable sources to confirm this.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), newborns typically lose between 5% and 7% of their birth weight in the first few days after birth. They usually regain this weight within the first 10 to 14 days.\n\nMoreover, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that weight loss of more than 10% of birth weight or failure to regain birth weight by day 10-14 may indicate inadequate feeding or other problems.\n\nSo, based on these guidelines, option D seems to be the correct answer: being concerned when weight loss is more than 10% or birth weight isn't regained by day 14.\n\nIt's also important to note that for breastfed babies, it's crucial to ensure they're latching properly and getting enough milk. Sometimes, supplemental feedings might be necessary if the baby isn't gaining weight as expected.\n\nIn summary, while some weight loss after birth is normal, excessive weight loss or delayed regain of birth weight can be signs of potential problems that require attention.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
