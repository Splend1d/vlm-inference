                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Plaid Pants, Inc. and Acme Dynamite Company, and it's asking for their required returns based on their betas, the expected market return, and the risk-free rate. It says to use the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM, to figure this out. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what the CAPM formula is. I think it's something like:\n\nRequired return = Risk-free rate + Beta * (Expected market return - Risk-free rate)\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, the required return for a stock depends on the risk-free rate, the stock's beta, and the difference between the expected market return and the risk-free rate, which is often called the market risk premium.\n\nGiven that, let's identify the values from the question:\n\n- Plaid Pants, Inc. has a beta of 0.90.\n\n- Acme Dynamite Company has a beta of 1.80.\n\n- Expected return on the market is 10 percent.\n\n- Risk-free rate is 6 percent.\n\nSo, the market risk premium would be the expected market return minus the risk-free rate, which is 10% - 6% = 4%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the required return for Plaid Pants, Inc.:\n\nRequired return = 6% + 0.90 * 4%\n\nFirst, 0.90 times 4% is 3.6%, right? So, 6% + 3.6% = 9.6%.\n\nOkay, so for Plaid Pants, it's 9.6%.\n\nNow, for Acme Dynamite Company:\n\nRequired return = 6% + 1.80 * 4%\n\n1.80 times 4% is 7.2%, so 6% + 7.2% = 13.2%.\n\nSo, the required returns should be 9.6% for Plaid Pants and 13.2% for Acme.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B says 9.6% and 13.2%, which matches what I just calculated.\n\nBut let me double-check if I did this correctly. The CAPM formula seems straightforward, and I've applied it correctly with the given betas and rates.\n\nWait a minute, option C has 9.0% and 18.0%, which is close but not exactly what I got. Option A has 3.6% and 7.2%, which are the products of the betas and the market risk premium, but that's not the complete required return. Option D has 14.0% and 23.0%, which seems way off.\n\nI think I'm correct with option B. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any possibility that the expected market return is already inclusive of the risk-free rate? No, I don't think so. The expected market return is separate from the risk-free rate in the CAPM formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the betas are misinterpreted. Beta is a measure of systematic risk compared to the market, and it's used directly in the CAPM formula as I've used it.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the market risk premium is calculated correctly. It's definitely expected market return minus risk-free rate, which is 10% - 6% = 4%.\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\nFor Plaid Pants: 6% + 0.90 * 4% = 6% + 3.6% = 9.6%\n\nFor Acme: 6% + 1.80 * 4% = 6% + 7.2% = 13.2%\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting something different, like considering different risk-free rates or market returns, but the question clearly states the risk-free rate is 6% and the expected market return is 10%.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
