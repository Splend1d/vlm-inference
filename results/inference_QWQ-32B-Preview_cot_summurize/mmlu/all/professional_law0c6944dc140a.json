So, the homeowner hired the contractor to renovate her kitchen for $25,000, and there's this clause that says the work has to be subject to her complete personal satisfaction. The contractor did the cabinets, flooring, and countertops, and then asked for payment. But the homeowner only paid $20,000 and said she wasn't satisfied with the finish on the cabinets.\n\nNow, if the contractor sues for the remaining balance, will he likely win? The options are:\n\nA. No, because the condition to the homeowner's obligation to pay wasn't met.\n\nB. No, because the contractor breached his duty of good faith and fair dealing by supplying unsatisfactory materials.\n\nC. Yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification.\n\nD. Yes, because the homeowner was the first party to breach the contract.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, there's a contract where the homeowner agrees to pay $25,000 for the kitchen renovation, subject to her complete personal satisfaction. That means that the homeowner has the final say on whether she's satisfied with the work or not.\n\nThe contractor did the work and expects full payment, but the homeowner paid only $20,000, stating she's not satisfied with the cabinet finish. So, the contractor is suing for the remaining amount.\n\nOption A says no, because the condition to the homeowner's obligation to pay wasn't satisfied. Well, the condition was her complete personal satisfaction, and she's saying she's not satisfied with the cabinets. So, according to the contract, she doesn't have to pay the full amount until she's satisfied.\n\nBut wait, did she reject the entire work or just part of it? She paid $20,000 and said she's not satisfied with the cabinets. Maybe the cabinets were a part of the $25,000, and she's paying for the other parts she is satisfied with.\n\nOption B says no, because the contractor breached his duty of good faith and fair dealing by supplying unsatisfactory materials. Well, the homeowner is not saying the materials are unsatisfactory; she's saying she doesn't like the finish. Finish could be a matter of aesthetics, not necessarily quality or unsatisfactory materials.\n\nOption C says yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification. Now, every contract includes an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, meaning neither party should do anything to undermine the other party's rights under the contract.\n\nIn this case, the homeowner is exercising her right to determine satisfaction. She's truthfully saying she's not satisfied with the cabinet finish. Is this a breach of good faith? Well, as long as her dissatisfaction is genuine and not arbitrary or capricious, it should be within her rights.\n\nOption D says yes, because the homeowner was the first party to breach the contract. But again, if she's genuinely not satisfied, is that a breach? The contract says payment is subject to her satisfaction, so her payment is conditional on her satisfaction.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look at it differently. Perhaps the contractor did everything as per the contract, and the homeowner is unreasonably withholding payment by claiming dissatisfaction without a valid reason.\n\nBut the question says she truthfully didn't like the finish on the cabinets. So, her dissatisfaction is genuine. Does that mean the contractor has to accept that and not get the full payment?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the contractor can argue that the dissatisfaction is only with part of the work, and he should get payment for the parts she's satisfied with.\n\nWait, she paid $20,000 and said she's not satisfied with the cabinets. Maybe the cabinets were worth $5,000, and that's why she paid $20,000 instead of $25,000.\n\nBut the contract is for the entire renovation, and payment is subject to her complete personal satisfaction. So, if she's not satisfied with any part, she doesn't have to pay the full amount.\n\nThis seems tricky. Let me see what the law says about \"satisfaction clauses\" in contracts.\n\nIn contracts, a clause that makes payment conditional on the satisfaction of one party is called a \"satisfaction clause.\" These clauses are generally enforceable, provided that the satisfaction is honest and not capricious.\n\nSo, if the homeowner's dissatisfaction is honest and not arbitrary, then she's within her rights to withhold payment until the contractor meets her satisfaction.\n\nIn this case, she's truthfully saying she doesn't like the cabinet finish. Assuming that's a legitimate reason for dissatisfaction, she shouldn't have to pay the full amount until the contractor addresses her concerns.\n\nTherefore, if the contractor sues for the remaining $5,000, he might not prevail because the condition for payment hasn't been met.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. No, because the condition to the homeowner's obligation to pay wasn't satisfied.\n\nThis seems correct. The condition was her complete personal satisfaction, which she hasn't given due to the cabinet finish.\n\nB. No, because the contractor breached his duty of good faith and fair dealing by supplying unsatisfactory materials.\n\nThis seems incorrect because the homeowner isn't claiming the materials are unsatisfactory, just that she doesn't like the finish.\n\nC. Yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification.\n\nThis might not be correct because her dissatisfaction seems genuine and not without justification.\n\nD. Yes, because the homeowner was the first party to breach the contract.\n\nAgain, if her dissatisfaction is genuine, it may not be a breach of the contract.\n\nSo, option A seems the most appropriate.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's more to it. Maybe the contractor can argue that the dissatisfaction is only with a part of the work, and he should get payment for the parts she's satisfied with.\n\nIn some cases, if the satisfaction clause applies to the entire project, the homeowner can withhold payment until everything meets her satisfaction. But if it's possible to separate the satisfactory parts from the unsatisfactory parts, she might have to pay for the satisfactory parts.\n\nIn this case, she paid $20,000 and said she's not satisfied with the cabinets. Maybe the cabinets were a separate part, and she's paying for the other parts she's satisfied with.\n\nHowever, the contract says \"subject to the homeowner's complete personal satisfaction,\" which suggests that satisfaction is for the entire renovation, not just parts of it.\n\nTherefore, if she's not completely satisfied, she doesn't have to pay the full amount.\n\nSo, in suing for the remaining $5,000, the contractor might not prevail because the condition for payment hasn't been met.\n\nTherefore, option A is likely correct: No, because a condition to the homeowner's obligation to pay was not satisfied.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
