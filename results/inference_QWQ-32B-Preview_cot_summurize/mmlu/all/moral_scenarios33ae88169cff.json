Maya Angelou was a renowned American poet, memoirist, and civil rights activist. Celebrating her birthday seems like a positive and respectful action, honoring someone who made significant contributions to literature and civil rights. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with proposing such a celebration.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person was longing for ice cream at midnight. Wanting ice cream late at night is a common craving and doesn't harm anyone. It's a personal desire and doesn't involve any moral wrongdoing.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither of these scenarios involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
