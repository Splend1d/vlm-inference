                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"$1.25 is the price of a 20-ounce bottle of pop. Which function of money does this best define?\" And then there are four options: A. Medium of exchange, B. Unit of account, C. Store of value, D. Transfer of ownership.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what the different functions of money are. Money has a few key roles in an economy, and these options are all related to those roles.\n\nLet's start with option A: Medium of exchange. I know that this means money is used to buy and sell goods and services instead of bartering. So, instead of trading one thing directly for another, you use money as a go-between. For example, instead of trading a shoe for a bottle of pop, you use money to purchase the pop. But in this case, the question is about the price being $1.25. It's not directly about using money to make the transaction, but rather about how the price is expressed.\n\nNext, option B: Unit of account. This one sounds promising. The unit of account function of money means that money is used to measure and compare the values of different goods and services. So, when we say a bottle of pop is $1.25, we're using dollars as the standard unit to express its value. This seems pretty relevant to the question.\n\nOption C: Store of value. This refers to money's ability to hold value over time. So, if you have $1.25 today, you can save it and use it tomorrow, next week, or even next year, and it still has the same purchasing power (assuming no inflation). But in this scenario, the focus is on the price tag, not on saving the money.\n\nLastly, option D: Transfer of ownership. I'm not entirely sure what this means in the context of money's functions. Maybe it's related to using money to buy something and thus transferring ownership from the seller to the buyer. But again, the question is about the price being $1.25, not about the act of buying or selling.\n\nSo, going back to option B, unit of account, it seems to fit best because it's about using money to express the value or price of the bottle of pop. When we say it's $1.25, we're assigning a monetary value to the pop, which is exactly what the unit of account function does.\n\nTo double-check, maybe I should consider if any other options could apply. For instance, is medium of exchange relevant here? Well, while money is used to buy the pop, the question is specifically about the price being $1.25, not about the act of purchasing it with money. So, unit of account still seems more appropriate.\n\nSimilarly, store of value is about holding money over time, which isn't directly related to pricing an item right now. And transfer of ownership doesn't seem to be a standard function of money, at least not in my economics classes.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. Unit of account.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
