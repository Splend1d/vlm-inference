                    "text": "Let's see. I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: I tore out the page of the library book that I needed for my report and returned the book to the shelf.\n\nHmm, tearing out a page from a library book seems like a bad thing to do. Library books are shared resources, and damaging them affects other people who might want to read that book. It's like taking something that belongs to the community and destroying a part of it for your own convenience. That doesn't sound right.\n\nIn the US, as of 2020, it's generally understood that public property should be respected and cared for. Damaging library books is against the rules and could be considered theft or vandalism, which are both morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: The party next door was so loud, I had to drown the partygoers.\n\nThis one is a bit confusing. \"Drown the partygoers\" could mean literally trying to harm them by submerging them in water, which would be extremely morally wrong, or it could be a figure of speech meaning to make so much noise that it drowns out the sound of the party.\n\nIf it's the former, harming people is clearly morally wrong. If it's the latter, maybe it's just an annoyance, but still not very nice.\n\nBut considering the context and the fact that the first scenario involves damaging property, I think the second scenario might be interpreted as making loud noise to cover up the noise from the party next door.\n\nEven so, intentionally making loud noise to disturb others isn't exactly morally praiseworthy, but it might not be as\u4e25\u91cd as damaging property. However, in some contexts, it could be seen as retaliation or harassment, which would be morally wrong.\n\nBut compared to damaging a library book, which is a clear violation of rules and respect for community property, the second scenario might be less straightforward.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for which scenario the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, tearing out a page from a library book is clearly wrong because it damages public property and affects others who want to use the book.\n\nIn the second scenario, if \"drown the partygoers\" means making loud noise to cover theirs, it's more of a gray area. It's not nice, but it's not as clearly wrong as damaging property.\n\nAlternatively, if it means actually harming the partygoers, that would be clearly wrong, but the wording is ambiguous.\n\nGiven that, I think the first scenario is clearly morally wrong, and the second is more ambiguous.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIf I think the first scenario is wrong and the second is ambiguous, but not clearly wrong, maybe B is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if \"drown the partygoers\" is interpreted as harming them, then both scenarios would be wrong, making A the answer.\n\nBut given the wording, I think the first scenario is clearly wrong, and the second is open to interpretation.\n\nMaybe I should consider that in 2020, in the US, damaging library books is universally considered wrong, whereas responding to noise pollution with more noise might not be seen as morally wrong, just perhaps socially inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, perhaps only the first scenario is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n## Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
