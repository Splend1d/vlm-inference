                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about psychological egoism. The question is: \"Feinberg claims that most arguments for psychological egoism: A. make reference to neuroscience. B. are based on controlled studies. C. are based on interviews and surveys. D. are nonempirical in character.\" I need to figure out which option Feinberg thinks is correct regarding how arguments for psychological egoism are typically constructed.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what psychological egoism is. Psychological egoism is the view that humans are always motivated by their own self-interest, even when they appear to be acting altruistically. It's a descriptive claim about how people actually behave, as opposed to normative claims about how they ought to behave.\n\nNow, Feinberg is a philosopher who has written about egoism and altruism. I think he critiqued psychological egoism, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of his arguments here. The question is about the kind of arguments that Feinberg says are typically used to support psychological egoism.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Make reference to neuroscience. Hmm, neuroscience is a relatively recent field, and while it might be used nowadays to support or critique psychological egoism, I don't think Feinberg would have focused on that, especially if he was writing before neuroscience was as advanced as it is today.\n\nB. Are based on controlled studies. Controlled studies suggest empirical research, perhaps in psychology. Maybe some arguments for psychological egoism are based on experimental data or observations from psychological studies.\n\nC. Are based on interviews and surveys. Similar to controlled studies, this is another form of empirical research, but more focused on self-reporting by individuals about their motivations.\n\nD. Are nonempirical in character. This suggests that the arguments don't rely on empirical evidence or observation but instead on logical reasoning, thought experiments, or other non-empirical methods.\n\nI need to think about how psychological egoism is usually argued for. Is it based on empirical evidence like studies and surveys, or is it more of a philosophical argument based on logic or analysis of concepts?\n\nI recall that psychological egoism is often criticized for being difficult to test empirically because it's hard to distinguish between apparent altruistic behavior and behavior that is ultimately self-interested. So, maybe the arguments for it aren't heavily based on empirical evidence like controlled studies or surveys.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps proponents of psychological egoism use everyday observations and anecdotes to support their claims, which wouldn't be considered rigorous empirical evidence.\n\nGiven that, maybe Feinberg would say that most arguments for psychological egoism are nonempirical in character. They might rely on conceptual analysis, logical deductions, or interpretations of human behavior that don't depend on systematic empirical research.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps some arguments do cite empirical evidence, like surveys or studies showing that people act in their self-interest.\n\nI need to consider which one Feinberg would likely claim is the case.\n\nLet me think about the nature of philosophical arguments versus scientific arguments. Philosophers often engage in nonempirical reasoning, while scientists rely on empirical data.\n\nSince psychological egoism is a claim about human psychology, one might expect that empirical evidence would be central to arguing for it. However, if Feinberg is critiquing these arguments, he might point out that many arguments for psychological egoism aren't actually based on solid empirical evidence but rather on philosophical assumptions or interpretations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Feinberg would argue that the empirical evidence doesn't support psychological egoism, and thus the arguments for it are nonempirical.\n\nI need to recall Feinberg's specific stance on this.\n\nI remember that Feinberg discusses the concept of altruism and challenges the idea that all apparent altruistic acts are motivated by self-interest. He might argue that psychological egoism is not well-supported by empirical evidence and that the arguments for it are more philosophical in nature.\n\nGiven that, it seems plausible that Feinberg would claim that most arguments for psychological egoism are nonempirical in character.\n\nLet me consider the other options again to make sure.\n\nOption A: Make reference to neuroscience. As I said earlier, neuroscience might not have been as developed in Feinberg's time, and moreover, psychological egoism is more about motivations and intentions, which are not directly observable through neuroscience.\n\nOption B: Are based on controlled studies. While possible, I don't recall Feinberg emphasizing that arguments for psychological egoism rely on controlled studies. Moreover, as I thought earlier, it's difficult to empirically verify motivations, so perhaps controlled studies aren't the primary basis for these arguments.\n\nOption C: Are based on interviews and surveys. Again, while surveys and interviews could provide some insight into people's motivations, they might not be reliable, and Feinberg might argue that such methods don't sufficiently support the strong claims of psychological egoism.\n\nOption D: Are nonempirical in character. This seems the most plausible, given that philosophical arguments often rely on logical reasoning rather than empirical evidence.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. Are nonempirical in character.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
