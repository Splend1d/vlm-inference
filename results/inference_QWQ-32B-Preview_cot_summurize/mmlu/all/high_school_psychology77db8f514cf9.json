                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, Dr. Ramchandran found that patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20 the number of cavities as those who didn't. The newswriter then reports that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities based on this research. We need to evaluate which statement is true regarding the justification of the writer's statement based on the number of patients studied.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what the research shows. The research indicates a strong association between brushing after lunch and fewer cavities, since those who brushed had only 1/20 the cavities of those who didn't. That's a significant difference!\n\nHowever, the question is about whether this association justifies the conclusion that brushing after lunch prevents cavities. In other words, is there enough evidence to support a causal relationship?\n\nTo establish causation, we generally need to consider several factors, including the study design, the presence of confounding variables, and the sample size.\n\nIn this case, we don't have information about the study design. Was it an experimental study where patients were randomly assigned to brush or not brush after lunch? Or was it an observational study where patients chose themselves whether to brush after lunch?\n\nIf it was an experimental study with random assignment, that would strengthen the case for causation because random assignment helps to eliminate confounding variables. However, if it was an observational study, there might be other factors that differ between the groups, which could affect the cavity rates.\n\nGiven that we don't have information about the study design, we'll have to assume it's an observational study, which is common in such scenarios.\n\nNow, regarding sample size: in statistics, larger sample sizes generally provide more reliable estimates and increase the power of the study to detect true effects. However, even with small sample sizes, if the effect is very large, it might still be statistically significant.\n\nIn this case, the effect is quite large\u2014 a 20-fold difference in cavity rates. So, even with a relatively small sample size, this difference might be statistically significant.\n\nBut does statistical significance equate to practical significance or justification for the writer's statement? Not necessarily. The writer is making a causal claim: brushing after lunch prevents cavities. To justify this claim, we need to be confident that brushing is the cause of the reduced cavity rate and not some other factor.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.\n\nB. If a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.\n\nC. At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.\n\nD. No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.\n\nOption D seems strong because, as I mentioned earlier, establishing causation typically requires more than just observing an association, especially in an observational study. There could be confounding variables at play. For example, perhaps the patients who brush after lunch also have better overall oral hygiene habits or different diets, which could affect cavity rates independently of brushing after lunch.\n\nEven with a large sample size, if the study is observational, we can't rule out confounding variables completely. Therefore, the writer's statement that brushing after lunch prevents cavities might not be fully justified based solely on this research.\n\nOptions A and B suggest that with a certain minimum sample size, the writer's statement is justified. But as I argued, sample size isn't the only consideration for establishing causation.\n\nOption C says that at least 100 patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified. This seems to be addressing the number of patients in the intervention group, but again, sample size isn't the only factor for justifying a causal claim.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement seems to be option D: no matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified, because the research likely doesn't establish causation on its own.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's any scenario where the writer's statement could be justified.\n\nIf the study was experimental with random assignment to brushing and not brushing after lunch, and if the sample size was large enough to detect the effect with high confidence, then perhaps the causal claim could be justified.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that the study was experimental. It just says \"based on the dentist's research,\" which could be observational.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
