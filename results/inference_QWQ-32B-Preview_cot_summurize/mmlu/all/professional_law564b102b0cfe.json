                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a ranch, a woman, her niece, and a farmer. Let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a rancher who owns the property in fee simple and conveys it to a woman via a warranty deed. So, the woman now owns the ranch with a warranty deed, which means she has a guaranteed clear title.\n\nThen, the woman gives her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan of $500,000. This mortgage is recorded immediately. So, the niece has a recorded mortgage interest in the property.\n\nTwo years later, the woman conveys the ranch to a farmer via a quitclaim deed. Importantly, this quitclaim deed makes no reference to the existing mortgage.\n\nNow, the woman defaults on the mortgage, and the niece sues the farmer personally (in personam) to recover the amount due on the mortgage.\n\nThe question is: Will the niece probably succeed in her lawsuit against the farmer?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.\n\nB. Succeed, because the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.\n\nC. Not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nD. Not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.\n\nOkay, let's analyze each option.\n\nOption A talks about an implied delegation of duties. Delegation usually means that the woman transferred her obligation to pay the mortgage to the farmer. But in this case, the conveyance was via a quitclaim deed, which generally doesn't transfer liabilities like mortgages unless specifically stated. So, it's unlikely that there was an implied delegation of duties.\n\nOption B suggests that the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer. Third-party beneficiaries typically have rights when a contract is made for their benefit. However, in this scenario, the conveyance is via a quitclaim deed, which is not a contract but a deed that transfers whatever interest the grantor has without warranties. So, it's unlikely that the niece is a third-party beneficiary here.\n\nOption C states that the niece won't succeed because the farmer didn't promise to pay the mortgage debt. This seems plausible because the farmer received a quitclaim deed that didn't mention the mortgage, so he didn't assume the mortgage debt.\n\nOption D says the niece won't succeed unless the farmer had constructive notice of the mortgage. Constructive notice means that the farmer should have known about the mortgage due to recording laws. Since the mortgage was recorded, the farmer might be charged with constructive notice, meaning he should have discovered the mortgage if he had done a title search.\n\nBut in this case, the woman conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed, which doesn't guarantee that the title is free of encumbrances like mortgages. Quitclaim deeds transfer only the interest the grantor has, without warranties. So, the farmer probably took the property subject to existing encumbrances, including the mortgage.\n\nHowever, the niece is bringing an in personam action against the farmer to recover the mortgage debt. An in personam action is against the person, not against the property.\n\nSo, the question is whether the farmer is personally liable for the mortgage debt.\n\nGiven that the farmer didn't assume the mortgage and received a quitclaim deed, it's unlikely that he's personally liable for the mortgage debt.\n\nBut, if the farmer had constructive notice of the mortgage due to recording laws, perhaps he's bound by it in some way.\n\nWait, recording laws vary by jurisdiction, but generally, recording a mortgage puts subsequent purchasers on notice of the mortgage lien.\n\nIn this case, the mortgage was recorded before the quitclaim deed was issued to the farmer. So, the farmer should have known about the mortgage if he checked the public records.\n\nHowever, even if the farmer had constructive notice, that typically affects his title to the property, making his interest subject to the mortgage lien. It doesn't necessarily make him personally liable for the mortgage debt.\n\nThe niece is suing the farmer personally to recover the debt, not foreclosing on the mortgage to affect the property.\n\nSo, unless there's some assumption of liability or personal promise to pay by the farmer, it seems unlikely that the niece can collect the debt from the farmer personally.\n\nTherefore, option C seems most correct: the niece probably won't succeed because the farmer didn't promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nOption D is tempting because it involves constructive notice, but even with constructive notice, the farmer wouldn't necessarily be personally liable for the debt; he'd just be taking the property subject to the mortgage lien.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
