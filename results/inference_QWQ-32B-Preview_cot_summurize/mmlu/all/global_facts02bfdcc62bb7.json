                    "text": "I'm trying to recall the statistics from the Iran-Contra affair in 1987. I remember there was a lot of controversy about President Reagan's involvement and whether he was withholding information from the public and Congress. I think there were polls at the time that showed varying levels of public trust in his administration.\n\nLet me think about the options given:\n\nA. 2% - That seems way too low. If only 2% of Americans believed he was withholding information, that would mean nearly everyone trusted him completely, which doesn't align with what I remember about the scandal.\n\nB. 25% - That's a quarter of the population. It might be possible, but I feel like more people were skeptical during that time.\n\nC. 50% - Half of the Americans believing he was withholding information seems plausible. It suggests a divided public opinion, which often happens during political scandals.\n\nD. 75% - That's three-quarters of the population. If 75% of Americans thought he was withholding information, that would indicate a major loss of trust in the president.\n\nI need to consider the context of the Iran-Contra affair. It involved the sale of arms to Iran, which was under a U.S. embargo, and the proceeds were used to fund the Contras in Nicaragua, which was also against U.S. policy. This was a significant breach of trust, and there were congressional hearings and investigations.\n\nGiven the seriousness of the affair, I would guess that a majority of Americans suspected that President Reagan was not being entirely transparent. So, options C and D seem more likely.\n\nHowever, President Reagan was quite popular, and some polls at the time showed that a significant portion of the public still trusted him, even in the face of the scandal.\n\nI recall that in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra affair, his approval ratings remained relatively high, which might suggest that not everyone believed he was withholding information.\n\nOn the other hand, the scandal was substantial, and it involved illegal activities and cover-ups, so it's likely that a substantial portion of the public was skeptical.\n\nPerhaps a poll at the time would have shown that around 50% of Americans believed he was withholding information, with the other half either trusting him or not sure.\n\nAlternatively, it could be higher, at 75%, given the gravity of the scandal.\n\nBut considering Reagan's popularity and the fact that he was seen as a strong leader, maybe 50% is a more accurate reflection of public opinion.\n\nI should also consider that public opinion can be complex, with people having mixed feelings about the president and the specifics of the scandal.\n\nPerhaps some people believed that while Reagan may have been unaware of certain details, his administration was certainly involved in withholding information.\n\nAlternatively, some might have thought that Reagan himself was directly involved in withholding information, while others might have believed he was innocent.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'm going to guess that around 50% of Americans believed Reagan was withholding information.\n\nSo, my answer is C. 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
