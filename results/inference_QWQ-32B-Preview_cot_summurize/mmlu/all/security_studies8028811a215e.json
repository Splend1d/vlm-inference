The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), \"the Compton effect.\" EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns.\nB. A nuclear detonation produces a shockwave resulting from a rise in atmospheric pressure and dynamic overpressure sufficient to destroy concrete structures. Blast effects were generally used by military planners to calculate casualty rates in a nuclear attack: It was estimated that 50 percent living in a five mile radius of a one-mgt airburst would be killed or wounded by blast effects.\nC. Nuclear reactions in the initial nuclear detonation or the fallout can cause radiation poisoning, as irradiated debris is picked up by the nuclear fireball and lofted into the atmosphere. A dirty bomb uses chemical high-explosive to disperse radioactive material, relying on radiation to produce a lethal effect. Panic set off by even a limited dispersion of radioactive material might be more costly in terms of the disruption it causes than actual casualties or damage to property produced by a dirty bomb detonation; some observers believe that the blast itself causes the greatest amount of damage.\nD. All of the above\n"

Each of these effects can cause significant damage and harm to people and infrastructure.\n\nA. Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP): When a nuclear weapon detonates, it releases a burst of gamma rays that interact with the Earth's atmosphere, producing a powerful electromagnetic pulse. This pulse can damage or destroy electronic equipment over a wide area, potentially causing widespread power outages and disrupting communication systems. The thermal light pulse from the explosion can also cause flash blindness and retinal burns, while the blast can cause severe skin burns.\n\nB. Blast Effects: The shockwave generated by a nuclear explosion can cause extensive damage to buildings and other structures. The overpressure from the blast can collapse buildings, shatter windows, and cause injuries or deaths to people in the vicinity. Military planners have historically used blast effects to estimate casualty rates in nuclear attacks. For example, it was estimated that a one-megaton airburst could result in 50% fatalities or injuries within a five-mile radius due to blast effects alone.\n\nC. Radiation Poisoning: Nuclear reactions during the initial detonation and the subsequent fallout can release large amounts of radioactive material into the environment. This radiation can cause acute and long-term health effects, including radiation sickness, cancer, and genetic mutations. A dirty bomb, which combines conventional explosives with radioactive material, aims to disperse radioactive contaminants over a wide area, causing panic and contamination. While the blast itself may cause immediate damage, the psychological impact of radioactive contamination can lead to significant social and economic disruption.\n\nIn summary, nuclear weapons have multifaceted and devastating effects, including EMP, thermal radiation, blast waves, and radioactive fallout. These effects can result in immediate destruction, long-term health risks, and widespread societal disruption."
