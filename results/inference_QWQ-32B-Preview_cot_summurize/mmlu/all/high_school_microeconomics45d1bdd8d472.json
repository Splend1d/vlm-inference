                    "text": "So I've got this question about Nancy and her choices. She can spend an hour studying for an exam, mowing the lawn for $6, or babysitting for $8. And we know she chose to study. The question is asking which statement is true based on that choice.\n\nLet me try to understand this. So, opportunity cost is about what you give up when you make a choice, right? If Nancy chooses to study, her opportunity cost is the next best alternative she doesn't choose. In this case, the next best thing would be babysitting, since it pays $8, which is more than mowing the lawn.\n\nSo, option A says that the benefit from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8. That makes sense because if she chooses to study instead of babysitting, it must be that the benefit she gets from studying is higher than what she would have earned from babysitting.\n\nOption B says the opportunity cost of studying is $14, which is less than the benefit received from studying. Wait, where does $14 come from? Is that the sum of mowing and babysitting? That doesn't make sense. Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative, which is babysitting at $8, not $14. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says Nancy is indifferent between studying and mowing the lawn. But she chose to study over mowing, so she must prefer studying to mowing, right? So, she's not indifferent; she prefers studying.\n\nOption D says Nancy's behavior is irrational because babysitting was clearly superior to all other options. But she chose to study, which means she values studying more than babysitting. So, it's not irrational; it's just that the benefit from studying is higher for her than the $8 from babysitting.\n\nWait, but how do we know that the benefit from studying is higher than $8? Because she chose to study. If she preferred the $8, she would have chosen babysitting. So, her choice indicates that the benefit from studying is greater than $8.\n\nSo, going back to option A, it seems correct. The benefit from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8.\n\nOption B is wrong because opportunity cost isn't $14; it's $8.\n\nOption C is wrong because she prefers studying to mowing.\n\nOption D is wrong because her choice is rational; she values studying more than babysitting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nBut let me double-check. Opportunity cost is indeed the value of the next best alternative, which is babysitting at $8. If she chooses to study, it must be that the benefit from studying is greater than $8.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
