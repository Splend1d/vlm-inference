                    "text": "Let's see, I need to figure out who can ask the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion. The options are:\n\nA. Only the main parts of the UN like the Security Council, General Assembly, ECOSOC, Trusteeship Council, and the Secretariat.\n\nB. Any international organization can ask for an opinion.\n\nC. The General Assembly and Security Council can ask about any legal question, and other UN organs and specialized agencies can too, but they need permission from the General Assembly.\n\nD. The main UN organs and also states, but only if the General Assembly says it's okay.\n\nHmm, I think I need to recall what I know about the ICJ and how it works.\n\nFirst off, the International Court of Justice is the primary judicial organ of the United Nations. It's based in The Hague, Netherlands, and it settles legal disputes between states and gives advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized UN organs and agencies.\n\nSo, advisory opinions are non-binding interpretations of law that the court provides when asked by certain entities.\n\nNow, looking at option A, it says only the principal organs of the UN can request advisory opinions. Those are the Security Council, General Assembly, ECOSOC, Trusteeship Council, and the Secretariat.\n\nBut I think I remember that other entities can also request advisory opinions, not just these principal organs.\n\nOption B says all international organizations can request an advisory opinion. That seems too broad. Probably, there are restrictions on who can ask the ICJ for an advisory opinion.\n\nOption C seems more detailed. It says the General Assembly and Security Council can ask about any legal question, and other UN organs and specialized agencies can too, but they need authorization from the General Assembly.\n\nThat sounds familiar. I think the General Assembly and Security Council have a more straightforward path to request advisory opinions, while others need to get permission first.\n\nOption D mentions that principal organs and states can request, but states only if authorized by the General Assembly. I'm not sure about states being able to request advisory opinions directly.\n\nLet me check what the UN Charter says about this.\n\nAccording to the UN Charter, Chapter XIV, Article 96, specifically states:\n\n\"1. The General Assembly or the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any legal question.\n\n2. Other organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies which are parties to the Statute may request advisory opinions on legal questions arising within the scope of their activities.\n\n3. The Secretary-General may bring to the attention of the Court, under Article 65 of the Statute of the Court, any matter which may arise affecting the interests of the United Nations.\"\n\nSo, from this, it's clear that the General Assembly and Security Council can request advisory opinions on any legal question. Other UN organs and specialized agencies can also request advisory opinions but only on legal questions arising within the scope of their activities, and they have to be parties to the Statute of the ICJ.\n\nThere's no mention of states being able to request advisory opinions directly. So, option D seems incorrect because it includes states being authorized by the General Assembly to request advisory opinions, which isn't supported by the Charter.\n\nOption C seems to align closely with what the Charter says. It specifies that the General Assembly and Security Council can request advisory opinions on any legal question, and other UN organs and specialized agencies can do so on questions within their scope of activities, provided they are authorized by the General Assembly.\n\nWait, but Article 96(2) says \"other organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies which are parties to the Statute may request advisory opinions on legal questions arising within the scope of their activities.\"\n\nIt doesn't explicitly say they need authorization from the General Assembly, but perhaps that's implied or specified elsewhere.\n\nLet me look further.\n\nIn practice, other UN organs and specialized agencies do need to be authorized by the General Assembly to request advisory opinions. This is to ensure that there's coordination and that the requests are consistent with the overall work of the United Nations.\n\nSo, option C seems accurate in that regard.\n\nOption A is too restrictive because it doesn't account for other UN organs and specialized agencies that can also request advisory opinions, albeit with some conditions.\n\nOption B is too broad, as not all international organizations have the right to request advisory opinions from the ICJ.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the role of states.\n\nCan states request advisory opinions from the ICJ?\n\nAccording to the UN Charter, states can bring disputes before the ICJ if they accept its jurisdiction, but advisory opinions are different.\n\nAdvisory opinions are requested by specific UN organs and, with authorization, other entities, but not directly by states.\n\nSo, option D is incorrect because it includes states being authorized by the General Assembly to request advisory opinions, which isn't supported by the Charter.\n\nHence, the best answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
