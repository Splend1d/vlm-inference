A witness for the defendant testified to the defendant's non-culpability at the grand jury proceeding. The witness was later called as a defense witness at the trial. During his direct examination, defendant's attorney asked him, \"Is it not true that the defendant could not have performed the abortion on the decedent since he was assisting you in another abortion at the time?\" The witness answers in the negative and states that the defendant did, in fact, perform the abortion on the girl. The defendant's attorney then assails the witness's testimony as a recent fabrication, and asks the witness if he had not stated to a grand jury that the defendant was not guilty of performing the abortion, thus causing the death of the girl. The prosecutor objects to this question. The trial judge should rule that this question is\n\nA. objectionable, because the defendant's attorney did not lay a proper foundation for impeaching his own witness.\nB. objectionable, because a party may not impeach his own witness.\nC. unobjectionable, because a witness's testimony before a grand jury is more reliable because it occurred shortly after the abortion was allegedly performed.\nD. unobjectionable, because a party can impeach his own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a trial where a doctor is being prosecuted for manslaughter after a girl died during an alleged abortion. There's a witness who testified at the grand jury that the doctor didn't do the abortion, but at the trial, he says the doctor did perform it. The doctor's attorney wants to point out this inconsistency by asking if the witness told something different at the grand jury. The prosecutor objects, and I need to decide if the question is okay or not.\n\nOption A says it's objectionable because there's no proper foundation for impeaching their own witness. I think impeachment is when you try to show that a witness is not credible, maybe they're lying or mistaken. So, if the attorney is trying to do that to their own witness, maybe there's a rule about that.\n\nOption B says it's objectionable because a party can't impeach their own witness. That sounds plausible. Usually, you bring witnesses to help your case, so why would you want to make them look bad? Maybe there's a legal rule that prevents that.\n\nOption C says it's okay because the grand jury testimony is more reliable since it was closer to the event. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The issue is whether the attorney can impeach their own witness, not about the reliability of the testimony.\n\nOption D says it's unobjectionable because a party can impeach their own witness with a prior inconsistent statement. That sounds like maybe the attorney can show that the witness said something different before, to question their reliability now.\n\nI need to think about this. In trials, attorneys often try to impeach witnesses from the other side to undermine their credibility. But impeaching your own witness seems different. Maybe there are specific rules about that.\n\nLet me consider Option B first. If it's true that a party can't impeach their own witness, then the question should be objected to, and the judge should sustain the objection. But I have a feeling that's not entirely accurate.\n\nWait, I remember that in some cases, a party can impeach their own witness if certain conditions are met. For example, if the witness goes off-script and says something harmful, the attorney might need to impeach them to minimize damage.\n\nOption D mentions prior inconsistent statements. Maybe that's allowed even with your own witness. If the witness is saying something now that contradicts what they said before, perhaps the attorney can bring up the prior statement to show the inconsistency.\n\nBut I also recall that there might be rules about laying a foundation for impeachment. Maybe the attorney needs to ask certain questions first to establish that the witness made a different statement earlier.\n\nLooking back at Option A, it says the attorney didn't lay a proper foundation. Maybe that's key here. Perhaps before asking about the grand jury testimony, the attorney needs to establish that the witness said something different at that earlier proceeding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attorney needs to ask the witness about the prior statement to give them a chance to explain why they're saying different things now.\n\nI think the concept of laying a foundation is important in impeachment. You need to make sure that the witness is aware of the prior statement and has a chance to clarify or explain any discrepancies.\n\nIn this case, the attorney is asking the witness if they testified differently at the grand jury. Maybe that's sufficient to lay the foundation.\n\nBut I'm still unsure about whether a party can impeach their own witness. Option B says no, they can't, but Option D suggests they can, at least with prior inconsistent statements.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that a party can't generally impeach their own witness, but there are exceptions, such as when the witness makes a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nIn evidence law, there might be specific provisions about when and how a party can impeach their own witness.\n\nLet me think about the purpose of impeachment. It's to challenge the credibility of a witness, to suggest that their current testimony might not be reliable.\n\nIf a party calls a witness to support their case, they probably want that witness to be credible. So, why would they want to impeach them?\n\nOne reason might be that if the witness says something harmful or inconsistent with what they previously stated, the attorney might feel compelled to address that to prevent the jury from thinking their case is weaker.\n\nHowever, there might be strategic reasons not to impeach your own witness, as it could backfire and make the witness seem even less credible.\n\nDespite that, I think the law allows for impeachment of your own witness in certain circumstances, particularly when there's a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nIn fact, I seem to recall that evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by your own witness can be admitted for impeachment purposes, but there might be restrictions on how you can use it.\n\nPerhaps the attorney can introduce the prior statement to impeinate the witness, but they can't vouch for the truth of that statement; they're just showing the inconsistency.\n\nGiven that, Option D might be the correct answer: the question is unobjectionable because a party can impeach their own witness with a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nBut I should also consider Option A, which says the question is objectionable because there's no proper foundation laid for impeachment.\n\nMaybe the attorney needs to ask more questions to establish that the witness indeed made a different statement at the grand jury before asking about it directly.\n\nFor example, the attorney could first ask the witness about their grand jury testimony and whether they recall saying something different. Then, if the witness doesn't admit to it, the attorney could potentially introduce evidence of the prior statement.\n\nSo, perhaps the attorney needs to lay a better foundation by first asking about the witness's recollection of what they said at the grand jury.\n\nIn this scenario, the attorney jumps straight to asking if the witness said something at the grand jury, which might not be sufficient.\n\nTherefore, Option A could be correct: the question is objectionable because the foundation isn't properly laid.\n\nBut I'm still leaning towards Option D, as I think prior inconsistent statements can be used to impeach your own witness.\n\nMaybe both A and D have merit, but in this specific case, since the attorney is asking about the grand jury testimony directly without first establishing that the witness made a different statement, it might be insufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just asking if the witness testified differently at the grand jury is enough to lay the foundation.\n\nI need to decide which one makes more sense.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is D: unobjectionable, because a party can impeach their own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nThe attorney is trying to point out that the witness said something different earlier, which calls into question the witness's current testimony.\n\nEven though it's their own witness, the attorney can still use the prior inconsistent statement for impeachment purposes.\n\nTherefore, the question should be allowed, and the objection should be overruled.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
