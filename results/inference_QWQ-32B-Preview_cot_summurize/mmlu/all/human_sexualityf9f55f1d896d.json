                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about attitudes toward premarital and extramarital sex over the past few decades. The options are:\n\nA. remained constant; remained constant\n\nB. become less permissive; become more accepting\n\nC. remained constant; become less accepting\n\nD. become more permissive; become less accepting\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"premarital sex\" and \"extramarital sex\" mean. Premarital sex is sexual activity before marriage, and extramarital sex is sexual activity outside of marriage, like adultery.\n\nNow, I need to think about how society's attitudes have changed towards these over time.\n\nStarting with premarital sex, I know that in many Western countries, attitudes have become more accepting over the past few decades. For example, in the 1950s and 60s, there was a lot more stigma around premarital sex, but nowadays, it's pretty common and accepted. So, I would say attitudes have become more permissive towards premarital sex.\n\nOn the other hand, extramarital sex is a different story. Adultery is still generally considered unacceptable in many societies, and there hasn't been a major shift towards accepting it. In fact, I think attitudes may have become even less accepting in some ways, especially with the emphasis on fidelity in relationships.\n\nSo, if attitudes toward premarital sex have become more permissive and attitudes toward extramarital sex have become less accepting, that seems to match option D.\n\nBut let me double-check. Option D says \"become more permissive; become less accepting.\" That sounds right because more permissive means more accepting, and less accepting means more disapproving.\n\nOption A says both remained constant, but I don't think that's accurate because premarital sex attitudes have changed.\n\nOption B says become less permissive toward premarital sex and more accepting toward extramarital sex. That seems opposite to what I think has happened.\n\nOption C says remained constant toward premarital sex and become less accepting toward extramarital sex. But again, I think premarital sex attitudes have changed.\n\nTherefore, D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any exceptions or variations across different cultures or generations. For instance, in some conservative communities, attitudes toward premarital sex might still be strict. But the question seems to be referring to general attitudes over the past few decades in a broad sense, probably in Western societies.\n\nAlso, I recall that in some surveys and studies, there has been a trend towards more permissive attitudes toward premarital sex but maintaining strong disapproval of extramarital sex. So, that aligns with option D.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if \"less accepting\" is the same as \"more permissive.\" No, \"less accepting\" means more disapproving, which would correspond to less permissive. So, for extramarital sex, less accepting means more disapproval, which makes sense.\n\nFor premarital sex, \"become more permissive\" means more accepting, which matches my earlier thought.\n\nSo, overall, D seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
