                    "text": "I'm trying to understand the concept of proportionality in the context of a victim state responding to an aggressor. The question presents four options, and I need to determine which one correctly describes the principle of proportionality.\n\nOption A says that the victim state may use the same means and intensity of force as the aggressor. This sounds like a form of tit-for-tat response, where the retaliation matches the aggressor's actions in terms of means and intensity. But I'm not sure if proportionality allows for exact matching or if it's more about being necessary and reasonable.\n\nOption B suggests that the victim state may use any means to defeat and incapacitate the aggressor. This seems quite broad and unrestricted. Using any means without limitations could potentially lead to excessive force and may not align with the principle of proportionality, which I believe is about balancing the response to the threat or attack.\n\nOption C states that the victim state may only use such means and force as is necessary to defeat the aggressor. This sounds more in line with what I've learned about proportionality in international law, where the response should be limited to what is necessary to achieve the legitimate aim, which in this case is to defeat the aggressor.\n\nOption D says that the victim state can do nothing without Security Council approval. This seems to refer to the United Nations Security Council and its role in authorizing the use of force. While the Security Council does have a role in maintaining international peace and security, I'm not sure if this directly relates to the principle of proportionality.\n\nLooking back, proportionality is a principle in international law that restricts the means and methods of warfare and requires belligerents to discriminate between combatants and non-combatants and to avoid excessive damage and unnecessary suffering. In the context of self-defense, proportionality requires that the response be appropriate to the scale and nature of the attack.\n\nGiven this, option C seems to capture the essence of proportionality by emphasizing that the means and force used should be necessary to defeat the aggressor, implying a limitation to what is strictly needed, without going beyond that.\n\nOption A might be too rigid, as it requires matching the means and intensity of the aggressor, which might not always be proportional, especially if the aggressor has superior force.\n\nOption B is too permissive and could lead to responses that are excessive and unnecessary, violating the principle of proportionality.\n\nOption D seems to be more about the legality of using force in international law, particularly regarding the UN Charter, which generally prohibits the use of force except in self-defense or with Security Council authorization. While important, it doesn't directly address the principle of proportionality in the context of self-defense.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option C: The victim state may only use such means and force as is necessary to defeat the aggressor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
