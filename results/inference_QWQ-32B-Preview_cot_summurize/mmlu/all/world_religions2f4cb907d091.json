                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on my Buddhist deities, but I think I can figure this one out. So, the question is about a bodhisattva who helps guide the souls of dead children to salvation. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Guan-yin - I know Guan-yin is a very compassionate bodhisattva, often associated with mercy and kindness. In Chinese Buddhism, Guan-yin is very popular and is sometimes compared to the Virgin Mary in Christianity for the way people venerate her.\n\nB. Kannon - This seems similar to Guan-yin, actually. I think Kannon is the Japanese name for Guan-yin. So, maybe they're the same figure, just different names in different cultures.\n\nC. Ojizo-sama - I've heard of Ojizo-sama, especially in Japanese culture. From what I remember, Ojizo-sama is associated with protecting children and travelers. There are often small statues of Ojizo-sama by the roadside, and people believe they watch over lost souls, particularly children.\n\nD. Amitabha - Amitabha is a Buddha, not a bodhisattva, right? He's famous for his pure land, where people go after death if they invoke his name. But I don't recall him specifically being associated with guiding dead children.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I think the answer might be C. Ojizo-sama, because of the association with protecting children and guiding their souls. But I'm not entirely sure, especially since Guan-yin is also very compassionate and might have roles related to children as well.\n\nLet me try to recall more specifics. In Japanese Buddhism, Ojizo-sama is often depicted as a benevolent figure, sometimes wearing a hat and a staff, and he's associated with the mantra \"Namu Ojizousama.\" People often place small offerings like toys or clothes near his statues, believing that he looks after deceased children until they can be reborn.\n\nOn the other hand, Guan-yin, or Kannon, is more broadly associated with compassion and often invoked for various kinds of aid, including protecting women and children. But specifically for guiding dead children, I think Ojizo-sama has a more direct association.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should cross-reference these figures in different traditions. Guan-yin is venerated in Chinese Buddhism and has counterparts in other East Asian countries, like Kannon in Japan and Kwanza in Korea. Ojizo-sama seems to be more specific to Japanese Buddhism.\n\nAlso, Amitabha is a Buddha, not a bodhisattva, so that rules him out for this question since it specifies a bodhisattva.\n\nSo, between Guan-yin and Ojizo-sama, I think Ojizo-sama has a more specific role in guiding the souls of dead children. Guan-yin is more general in her compassion and assistance.\n\nTherefore, I would go with C. Ojizo-sama.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
