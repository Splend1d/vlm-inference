Inferential statistics allow researchers to make inferences about a population based on sample data, and they can help determine whether observed differences are likely due to chance or to the effect of the treatment or intervention being studied.\n\nDescriptive statistics, on the other hand, are used to summarize and describe the basic features of the data in a study, such as means, medians, and standard deviations, but they do not allow for conclusions about the population or the significance of differences between groups.\n\nA field experiment is a type of research design where the study is conducted in a real-world setting, but it is not a statistical method for determining significance.\n\nStandard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values, but it does not provide information about the significance of differences between group means.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. inferential statistics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
