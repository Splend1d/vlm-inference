                    "text": "Let's see which statement about the calcium atom is correct. I need to recall some basic atomic structure here.\n\nFirst, calcium is an element with the atomic number 20. That means it has 20 protons in its nucleus. The atomic number defines the number of protons, which in turn determines the element's identity.\n\nOption A says, \"It contains 20 protons and neutrons.\" Hmm, that suggests that there are 20 protons and 20 neutrons, totaling 40 nucleons. But actually, the number of neutrons can vary in different isotopes of calcium. So, while many calcium atoms have 20 neutrons, not all do. Therefore, this statement isn't universally true for all calcium atoms.\n\nOption B says, \"It contains 20 protons and 20 electrons.\" In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons, so this is generally true for neutral calcium atoms. But if the calcium atom has a charge, meaning it's an ion, the number of electrons could be different. So, this might not always be the case.\n\nOption C says, \"It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons.\" This seems a bit unclear. Does it mean 20 of each? That would be 20 protons, 20 neutrons, and 20 electrons. But as we saw, the number of neutrons can vary, and the number of electrons depends on the charge of the atom. So, this doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption D says, \"All atoms of calcium have a mass of 40.078 u.\" The atomic mass of calcium is approximately 40.078 atomic mass units (u), but this is the average mass taking into account the different isotopes and their abundances. Individual calcium atoms have masses corresponding to their specific isotopes, such as calcium-40, calcium-42, etc., but not necessarily 40.078 u exactly.\n\nSo, none of these options seem completely accurate in all cases. However, among them, option B is the most accurate for neutral calcium atoms, but it doesn't account for possible ions. Option A is incorrect because the number of neutrons can vary. Option C is unclear and probably incorrect. Option D is incorrect because individual atoms have masses corresponding to their isotopes, not the average atomic mass.\n\nMaybe the question is expecting the most common scenario, which would be option B for neutral atoms. But strictly speaking, since the question says \"all atoms of calcium,\" and considering that calcium can form ions, option B isn't always true.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Perhaps the question is testing the understanding that calcium has 20 protons, and depending on the context, the other particles can vary.\n\nI think the best answer among the options given is B, but with the understanding that it's true for neutral calcium atoms. Maybe the question assumes neutrality unless stated otherwise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
