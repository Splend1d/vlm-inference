We need to find the total distance it travels.\n\nFirst, I need to find the distance from (-4,6) to (0,0), and then from (0,0) to (4,3), and add those two distances together.\n\nI recall that the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in a plane is given by the formula:\n\nDistance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nSo, let's apply this formula to find the distance from (-4,6) to (0,0):\n\nDistance 1 = sqrt((0 - (-4))^2 + (0 - 6)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-6)^2) = sqrt(16 + 36) = sqrt(52)\n\nWait, sqrt(52) can be simplified. 52 = 4 * 13, so sqrt(52) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(13) = 2*sqrt(13).\n\nOkay, so Distance 1 is 2*sqrt(13).\n\nNext, find the distance from (0,0) to (4,3):\n\nDistance 2 = sqrt((4 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nSo, the total distance traveled by the ant is Distance 1 plus Distance 2, which is 5 + 2*sqrt(13).\n\nLooking at the options, option D matches this: 5 + 2*sqrt(13).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, distance from (-4,6) to (0,0):\n\nDifference in x: 0 - (-4) = 4\n\nDifference in y: 0 - 6 = -6\n\nSo, sqrt(4^2 + (-6)^2) = sqrt(16 + 36) = sqrt(52) = 2*sqrt(13). That seems correct.\n\nSecond, distance from (0,0) to (4,3):\n\nDifference in x: 4 - 0 = 4\n\nDifference in y: 3 - 0 = 3\n\nSo, sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5. That's correct.\n\nAdding them up: 5 + 2*sqrt(13). So, option D is indeed the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 + 2\\sqrt{13}} \\]"
