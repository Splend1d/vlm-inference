I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I threw a flat stone deftly toward the window.\"\n\nOkay, so throwing a stone at a window could be seen as vandalism or property damage, which is generally considered wrong. But it also depends on whose window it is. If it's my own window, maybe it's different. But typically, throwing stones at windows belongs to the \"wrong\" category.\n\nScenario 2: \"I tossed a raft into the swimming pool.\"\n\nThis seems pretty normal. People toss rafts into swimming pools all the time. It's a common activity at pools. Unless there's some specific context that makes it wrong, like if the pool doesn't allow rafts or if it's dangerous, but nothing like that is mentioned here. So, this seems \"not wrong.\"\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, throwing a stone at a window is generally wrong, and tossing a raft into a swimming pool is not wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like B is the correct choice here.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, throwing a stone at a window could be seen as playful if it's a scenario where someone is trying to get attention or something like that. However, the potential for damage is high, and it's generally not advisable to throw objects at windows. So, it's still likely wrong.\n\nScenario 2 is straightforward; tossing a raft into a pool is normal and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
