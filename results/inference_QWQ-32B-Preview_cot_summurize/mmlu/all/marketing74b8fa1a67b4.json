So, team-based selling is when a group of people from different parts of a company work together to sell products or services to a customer. The question is asking about the primary objective of this approach.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Match various functional areas of the company with customer needs.\n\nThis sounds plausible. Different team members might represent different departments like sales, technical support, customer service, etc., and they can align their expertise to meet specific customer requirements. So, by having a team, the company can ensure that all aspects of the customer's needs are covered.\n\nB. Distribute the work involved in managing an account.\n\nThis also makes sense. Managing a large account can be a lot of work, and having a team allows the workload to be shared among multiple people. This can lead to better efficiency and possibly deeper relationships with the customer since multiple people are involved.\n\nC. Equitably manage the sales bonus pool.\n\nI'm not sure about this one. While managing bonuses might be important, it doesn't seem like the primary objective of team-based selling. It might be a consideration, but I think the main focus is more on serving the customer better.\n\nD. Create multiple points of contact between the customer and the company.\n\nThis is similar to option A, but it's more about having various touchpoints rather than matching functional areas with needs. Having multiple points of contact can be beneficial for communication and building relationships, but I wonder if it's the primary objective.\n\nHmm, between A and B, I'm leaning towards A because it seems to emphasize aligning the company's capabilities with customer needs, which is a fundamental aspect of selling. Option B is more about managing workload, which, while important, might not be the primary goal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the primary objective is a combination of both A and B. But since I have to choose one, I'll go with A.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
