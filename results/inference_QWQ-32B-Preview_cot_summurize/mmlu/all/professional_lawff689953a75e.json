                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option would most help the owner's defense that selling the materials is constitutionally protected speech. So, the owner is being charged under a new state obscenity statute for selling or offering to sell obscene printed or video materials. The police entered the bookstore, looked at the shelves, bought some magazines showing actual sexual intercourse, and then arrested the owner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes obscenity in this context and how it relates to free speech protections under the Constitution. I know that the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but there are exceptions, and obscenity is one of them. So, if the materials are considered obscene, they might not be protected.\n\nI recall that in determining whether material is obscene, courts often use the Miller test, which has three prongs:\n\n1. Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest.\n\n2. Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by state law.\n\n3. Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\n\nSo, if the materials meet these criteria, they can be considered obscene and thus not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.\n\nB. The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.\n\nC. The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.\n\nD. 85% of the citizens of the state believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior.\n\nI need to see which of these would most help the owner's defense that the sale of these materials is constitutionally protected speech.\n\nOption A says that the materials depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct. This might be relevant because if the conduct is normal, it might be less likely to be considered prurient or patently offensive. However, even depictions of normal sexual conduct can be considered obscene if they lack serious value and meet the other criteria.\n\nOption B states that the materials consisted of serious scientific studies. This seems directly relevant to the third prong of the Miller test, which considers whether the work has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. If the materials are scientific studies, they might have serious value, which could argue against them being obscene.\n\nOption C mentions that the police didn't have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore. This seems more related to the legality of the search and seizure rather than the nature of the materials themselves. While a lack of a warrant could potentially lead to suppression of evidence, it doesn't directly address whether the speech is protected or not.\n\nOption D says that 85% of the state's citizens believe that selling sexually explicit material doesn't contribute to antisocial behavior. This might relate to community standards, which are considered in the first prong of the Miller test. However, community standards are about what is acceptable in terms of prurience and offensiveness, not about the perceived harm of selling such materials.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems most directly helpful to the owner's defense. If the materials are serious scientific studies, they likely have scientific value, which would fail the third prong of the Miller test, meaning the materials couldn't be considered obscene.\n\nOption A might help somewhat by suggesting that the conduct isn't deviant, but it doesn't directly address the value of the materials.\n\nOption C could potentially help by getting the evidence suppressed, but it doesn't speak to whether the speech is protected or not.\n\nOption D might influence the view of community standards, but again, it's not as directly relevant as option B.\n\nTherefore, I think option B would be most helpful to the owner's defense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
