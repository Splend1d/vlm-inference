                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Which of the following sites has monumental earthworks with concentric ridges in a semicircle that date from around 3,500 years ago?\" And the options are A. Caral, B. Stonehenge, C. Poverty Point, and D. Gobekli Tepe.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some information about each of these sites.\n\nStarting with A. Caral: I think Caral is in Peru and is one of the oldest civilizations in the Americas. It's known for its pyramids and monumental architecture, but I don't remember anything specific about concentric ridges.\n\nNext, B. Stonehenge: That's in England, right? It's famous for its stone circles, which are arranged in a circular pattern. But concentric ridges in a semicircle don't sound like Stonehenge to me.\n\nOption C. Poverty Point: I believe this is a site in Louisiana, USA, known for its earthworks. I think it has some concentric ridges, but I'm not sure about the shape or the age.\n\nLastly, D. Gobekli Tepe: That's in Turkey, and it's one of the oldest known megalithic sites, predating Stonehenge by thousands of years. It's known for its T-shaped stone pillars, but again, not for earthworks with concentric ridges.\n\nThe question specifies \"monumental earthworks with concentric ridges in a semicircle\" dating back around 3,500 years ago.\n\nLet me think about Poverty Point first. I recall that Poverty Point is an ancient settlement built by a group of hunter-gatherers in present-day Louisiana. It's known for its elaborate earthworks, which include several concentric, elliptical ridges.\n\nBut I need to confirm if these ridges are in a semicircle and if the site dates back to around 3,500 years ago.\n\nFrom what I remember, Poverty Point was occupied from about 1700 to 1100 BCE, which would make it approximately 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. So, around 3,500 years ago fits within that timeframe.\n\nNow, about the shape: Are the ridges at Poverty Point in a semicircle? I think they are more like concentric ellipses or C-shaped ridges. Maybe semicircular is a way to describe them.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nCaral: As I recall, Caral is in the Peruvian highlands and is dated to about 2600 BCE to 2000 BCE. It's known for its pyramidal structures made of adobe, not earthworks with concentric ridges.\n\nStonehenge: Located in Wiltshire, England, it's a Neolithic and Bronze Age monument consisting of a circular setting of large standing stones. It dates back to about 3000 BCE to 2000 BCE. While it has a circular arrangement, it doesn't feature earthworks with concentric ridges.\n\nGobekli Tepe: This is in southeastern Turkey and is even older, dating back to around 9000 BCE to 8000 BCE. It's known for its stone megaliths arranged in circular structures, but again, no earthworks with concentric ridges.\n\nSo, compared to these options, Poverty Point seems to be the only site that features monumental earthworks with concentric ridges, and its dating matches the time period specified in the question.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. Poverty Point.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
