So, the options are:\n\nA. long-lasting positive effects on attitudes and productivity.\n\nB. long-lasting negative effects on attitudes and productivity.\n\nC. positive effects on attitudes but little or no impact on productivity.\n\nD. positive effects on attitudes initially but, over time, increasingly negative effects on both attitudes and productivity.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what a four-day workweek means. Typically, it's compressing the standard 40-hour workweek into four days instead of five. So, instead of working eight hours a day for five days, you might work ten hours a day for four days.\n\nNow, considering attitudes and productivity, I need to think about how this change might affect employees.\n\nPositively, a four-day workweek could lead to better work-life balance. Employees might appreciate having an extra day off, which could improve their satisfaction and morale. This could, in turn, positively affect their attitudes towards work.\n\nAs for productivity, some studies suggest that working fewer days but longer hours might not necessarily decrease productivity. In fact, some employees might be more focused and productive during their longer workdays because they have more extended periods to focus on tasks without the usual five-day interruptions.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that longer workdays could lead to burnout or fatigue, which might negatively impact productivity over time.\n\nGiven these points, let's look back at the options.\n\nOption A suggests long-lasting positive effects on both attitudes and productivity. While it's possible that attitudes improve, the impact on productivity might not be uniformly positive in the long run due to potential burnout.\n\nOption B proposes long-lasting negative effects on both attitudes and productivity. But if employees are happier with an extra day off, it's unlikely that attitudes would turn negative unless productivity suffers significantly.\n\nOption C says there are positive effects on attitudes but little to no impact on productivity. This seems plausible because the extra day off could improve morale without necessarily affecting overall output, especially if the work is compressed efficiently.\n\nOption D suggests positive effects on attitudes initially but increasingly negative effects on both attitudes and productivity over time. This could happen if the initial excitement of an extra day off wears off, and the longer workdays begin to take a toll on employees' well-being.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option C is the most reasonable conclusion based on general assumptions. The four-day workweek likely improves attitudes due to better work-life balance but may not have a significant impact on productivity if the work is managed effectively.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the actual effects can vary depending on the industry, the nature of the work, and how the policy is implemented. Some jobs might be more suited to a compressed workweek than others.\n\nIn conclusion, without specific data, the best general assumption is that the four-day workweek has positive effects on attitudes but little or no impact on productivity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
