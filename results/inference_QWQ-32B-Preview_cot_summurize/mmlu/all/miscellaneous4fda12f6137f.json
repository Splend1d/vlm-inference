I'm trying to figure out which one of these\u2014fire, lightning, water, or sunlight\u2014best exemplifies an agent that gradually changes Earth's surface by moving bits of rock, soil, and other materials from one place to another and depositing them elsewhere. This process sounds a lot like erosion and deposition, which are key concepts in how Earth's surface changes over time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these options represents in terms of Earth's processes.\n\nA. Fire: Fire can certainly have an impact on Earth's surface. For example, forest fires can burn vegetation, which might lead to soil exposure and increased erosion. Volcanic eruptions are another type of fire-related event that can deposit lava and ash, altering the landscape. However, fire seems more immediate and less gradual in its effects compared to some other options.\n\nB. Lightning: Lightning is a powerful natural phenomenon that can cause fires, split trees, and even create glass when it strikes sand (fulgurites). While it can have localized effects on the landscape, it doesn't seem to be a primary agent in the gradual shaping of Earth's surface through the continuous movement of materials.\n\nC. Water: Water is well-known for its role in shaping Earth's surface. It can erode rocks and soil through processes like rainfall, river flow, and ocean waves, and then deposit these materials elsewhere, such as in deltas or along coastlines. This happens over both short and long timescales, but especially gradually over time.\n\nD. Sunlight: Sunlight is crucial for many Earth processes, including photosynthesis and the water cycle. It can also cause rocks to expand and contract through thermal stress, leading to weathering. However, compared to water, its role in moving and depositing large amounts of material seems less direct and gradual.\n\nConsidering the options, water seems to be the most fitting example of an agent that gradually shapes Earth's surface by moving and depositing materials. It's involved in continuous processes like rainfall, runoff, and sediment transport, which occur over extended periods and have cumulative effects on the landscape.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. Water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
