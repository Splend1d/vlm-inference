Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior, which includes mental processes like thinking, feeling, and perceiving, as well as behaviors like actions and reactions. Biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with each other and their environments. Cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses. The scientific method is a systematic procedure for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. So, among these options, psychology is the field that specifically focuses on mental processes and behavior."
