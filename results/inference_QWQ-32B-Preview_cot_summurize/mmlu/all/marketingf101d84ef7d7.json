                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Information collected for the first time specifically for a marketing research study is called:\" and then there are options: A. Secondary research. B. Primary research. C. Soft research. D. Experimental research.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out which one of these terms refers to information that's collected specifically for a particular marketing research study for the first time.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with A, secondary research. I think secondary research is when you use information that has already been collected by someone else, maybe from books, articles, or online databases. So, it's existing data that you're reusing for your study. That doesn't match the description in the question because it's not collected specifically for your study.\n\nNext, B, primary research. I believe primary research is when you collect data directly for your own study, often through methods like surveys, interviews, observations, or experiments. This sounds like it could be the answer because it's information collected specifically for your marketing research study.\n\nOption C, soft research. I'm not sure what this is. I haven't heard this term before in the context of research. Maybe it's a type of research that's not as rigorous or something, but I'm not sure. It doesn't sound right for this context.\n\nOption D, experimental research. This seems like a type of research where you manipulate variables to see the effect on another variable. It's a method of collecting data, but it's more about the approach you take rather than the source of the data. So, it might be a way to conduct primary research, but it's not specifically about collecting information for the first time for a study.\n\nGiven this, it seems like primary research is the most appropriate answer because it involves collecting data specifically for your study, as opposed to using existing data like in secondary research.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The question says \"for the first time specifically for a marketing research study.\" So, it's\u5f3a\u8c03\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u800c\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002Primary research fits that description because you're gathering new data specifically for your study.\n\nSecondary research, as I understand it, uses already existing data, so that doesn't fit.\n\nSoft research isn't a term I'm familiar with in this context, so I'll ignore that for now.\n\nExperimental research is a method of collecting data, but it's still a type of primary research because you're collecting new data.\n\nSo, overall, primary research seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way to interpret the question. Maybe \"for the first time\" refers to pioneering research or something, but I don't think that's what it's getting at. It seems to be more about whether the data was collected specifically for this study or not.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is B. Primary research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
