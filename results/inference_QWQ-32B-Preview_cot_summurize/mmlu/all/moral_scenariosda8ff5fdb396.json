The main character considers pushing him out of the way but decides to sit down and watch instead.\n\nFirst, the man is vulnerable due to his disabilities and is in immediate danger. The main character has the opportunity to intervene and save his life but chooses not to. According to moral standards, there's a general expectation to help others in danger, especially when it's within one's capability and without significant risk to oneself.\n\nIn this case, pushing the man out of the way might be considered an act of heroism or at least a moral obligation. By choosing to do nothing and watch, the main character is failing to act morally, which can be seen as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character gives customers they don't like coffee with spit in it.\n\nThis is a clear case of intentional contamination of food or drink intended for consumption by others. It's not only unethical but also potentially illegal, as it poses a health risk and is a form of sabotage or malicious behavior.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, treating customers with respect and providing them with safe and untampered products is expected, regardless of personal feelings. Deliberately spitting in someone's coffee is universally considered wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
