The options are dependent, independent, interdependent, and collaborative. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. The workers have demarcated tasks, which means their jobs are clearly defined and probably don't overlap much. Also, the line managers are distant, so they aren't overseeing everything closely all the time.\n\nOption A is dependent. That might suggest that the workers rely heavily on each other or on the managers for directions. But in this scenario, the tasks are demarcated, meaning each worker has their own responsibilities, so they might not need to depend on each other as much.\n\nOption B is independent. This could make sense because with demarcated tasks and distant managers, workers might need to work on their own without much oversight or collaboration with others.\n\nOption C is interdependent. This usually means that workers rely on each other to complete their tasks, which might not be the case here since the tasks are demarcated, suggesting they are separate.\n\nOption D is collaborative. Collaboration implies that workers are working together, sharing ideas, and perhaps overlapping in their tasks, which doesn't seem to fit here because the tasks are distinct and managers are distant.\n\nGiven this, independent seems to fit best. The workers are likely to be self-sufficient in their assigned tasks and don't need to rely heavily on others or on constant managerial input.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if the workers might still need to depend on each other for certain things, even if their tasks are demarcated. For example, maybe one's output is another's input. In that case, they would be interdependent.\n\nHowever, the question emphasizes demarcated tasks, which suggests that their work is separated, and managers are distant. So, while there might be some interdependence, it's not the primary characteristic.\n\nAlso, collaborative implies a higher level of teamwork and shared responsibility, which doesn't align with distant managers and demarcated tasks.\n\nDependent seems to suggest that workers need a lot of support or directions from managers, but with managers being distant, that might not be the case. Instead, workers might need to be more autonomous.\n\nTherefore, independent seems to be the most appropriate choice. The workers are responsible for their own defined tasks and operate with a degree of autonomy due to the distant management structure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
