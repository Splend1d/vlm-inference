                    "text": "So I've got this question about a t-test and significance levels, and I need to figure out what it means when a psychologist says her results are \"significant at the .01 level.\" The options are about chances of incorrectly rejecting or retaining the null hypothesis, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a t-test is. A t-test is a statistical test used to determine if there's a significant difference between the means of two groups. In psychology, this could be used to compare, say, the effectiveness of two different therapies or the difference in scores between a control group and an experimental group.\n\nNow, the term \"significant at the .01 level\" refers to the significance level, often denoted as alpha (\u03b1). This is the threshold set by the researcher to decide when to reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis (H0) usually states that there's no significant difference between the groups being compared.\n\nIn this case, alpha is set at 0.01, which means there's a 1% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This is also known as a Type I error.\n\nSo, option A says: \"there is a 1% chance that she will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis.\" That sounds like a Type I error, which aligns with the alpha level of 0.01.\n\nOption B says: \"there is a 1% chance that she will incorrectly retain the null hypothesis.\" Incorrectly retaining the null hypothesis would be a Type II error, which is related to beta (\u03b2) and the power of the test, not the significance level alpha.\n\nOption C says: \"there is a 99% chance that she will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense because 99% is not the significance level here. Alpha is 1%, so the probability of incorrectly rejecting H0 should be 1%, not 99%.\n\nOption D says: \"there is a 99% chance that she will incorrectly retain the null hypothesis.\" Again, this seems off. 99% isn't directly related to the alpha level, and incorrectly retaining H0 is a Type II error, which is not directly related to alpha.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option A seems correct. The significance level of 0.01 means there's a 1% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about what \"significant at the .01 level\" really means. When a result is significant at the 0.01 level, it means that the p-value obtained from the t-test is less than or equal to 0.01. The p-value is the probability of observing the data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true.\n\nSo, if the p-value is less than 0.01, and we set alpha at 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis. The risk we're taking is that there's a 1% chance that we're wrong in rejecting H0, meaning that in reality, H0 is true, but we've got data that suggests otherwise just by random chance.\n\nThis again supports option A.\n\nOption B is about incorrectly retaining H0, which is a Type II error, and that's related to beta, not alpha. The significance level alpha is about controlling the Type I error rate, not the Type II error rate.\n\nOption C is just incorrect because alpha is 1%, not 99%.\n\nOption D is also incorrect for the same reason.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A: there is a 1% chance that she will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis.\n\nI think that makes sense, but I'll double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to remember that the significance level alpha is the probability of a Type I error, which is rejecting H0 when it is true. So, alpha = P(reject H0 | H0 is true).\n\nHere, alpha is set at 0.01, so P(reject H0 | H0 is true) = 0.01, which matches option A.\n\nOption B is about P(fail to reject H0 | H0 is false), which is beta, the Type II error rate, and that's not related to alpha.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
