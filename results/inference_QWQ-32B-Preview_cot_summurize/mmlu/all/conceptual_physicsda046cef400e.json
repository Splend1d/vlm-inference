                    "text": "To find the average speed of the gazelle, we can use the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average speed} = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{total time}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the gazelle travels a distance of 2 kilometers in a time of one-half hour, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average speed} = \\frac{2 \\text{ km}}{0.5 \\text{ h}}\n\\]\n\nTo divide by a fraction (since 0.5 hour is the same as 1/2 hour), we can multiply by its reciprocal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{0.5} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the gazelle is 4 kilometers per hour.\n\nHowever, let's double-check this calculation to ensure accuracy. Another way to think about it is to consider that in one hour, the gazelle would travel twice the distance it travels in half an hour, because one hour is twice as long as half an hour. So, if in 0.5 hours it travels 2 km, in 1 hour it would travel:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ km} \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the average speed is indeed 4 km/h.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 1 km/h\n\nB. 2 km/h\n\nC. 4 km/h\n\nD. greater than 4 km/h\n\nThe correct answer is C. 4 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
