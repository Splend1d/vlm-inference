                    "text": "So, this 25-year-old woman is 19 weeks pregnant, and her dad had classic hemophilia. She's come in for a prenatal check-up, and an amniotic fluid sample was taken for a karyotype, which showed the fetus is XY\u2014so it's a boy. We need to tell her about the risks for her baby regarding hemophilia.\n\nFirst off, hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects blood clotting. Classic hemophilia, also known as hemophilia A, is caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII. It's an X-linked recessive disorder. That means the gene for hemophilia is on the X chromosome.\n\nLet's recall how X-linked recessive inheritance works. Females have two X chromosomes, so they need both copies of the gene to be affected to have the disease. If they have one normal and one affected gene, they're carriers but usually don't have symptoms. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, so if their single X chromosome has the affected gene, they will have the disease.\n\nIn this case, the patient's father had classic hemophilia. So, her father has hemophilia A, which means he has one X chromosome with the hemophilia gene and one Y chromosome.\n\nNow, the patient is a female, and her father passed on his Y chromosome to her brothers (if any) but his X chromosome to her. So, she inherited one X chromosome from her father, which could be the one with the hemophilia gene, and one from her mother.\n\nWait, but her father has hemophilia, so his X chromosome has the hemophilia gene. Therefore, the patient inherited that X chromosome from her father.\n\nSo, the patient is a carrier of hemophilia because she has one affected X chromosome and one normal X chromosome.\n\nNow, she's pregnant, and the fetus is XY, meaning it's a boy. So, the baby inherited one X chromosome from the mother and one Y chromosome from the father (the patient's partner).\n\nSince the patient is a carrier, she has one normal X and one affected X. So, there's a 50% chance that she passes on the normal X and a 50% chance she passes on the affected X to the fetus.\n\nIf she passes on the affected X, the fetus will have the hemophilia gene on his X chromosome and will have hemophilia because males are hemizygous for the X chromosome.\n\nIf she passes on the normal X, the fetus will have a normal clotting factor VIII and won't have hemophilia.\n\nSo, the risk for the infant to have hemophilia is 50%.\n\nBut let's double-check the options:\n\nA. The infant will neither have hemophilia nor be a carrier.\n\nB. The infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia.\n\nC. The infant has a 50% risk for being a carrier.\n\nD. The infant has a 75% risk for hemophilia.\n\nFirst, since the infant is XY, meaning it's a boy, boys cannot be carriers of X-linked recessive disorders; they either have the disease or they don't. Carriers are females who have one affected X and one normal X.\n\nSo, option C, which talks about a 50% risk of being a carrier, doesn't apply to a male infant. He can't be a carrier; he either has hemophilia or he doesn't.\n\nOption A says the infant will neither have hemophilia nor be a carrier. But we know there's a 50% chance he could have hemophilia, so this isn't accurate.\n\nOption D says there's a 75% risk for hemophilia, which is higher than the actual risk.\n\nOption B says there's a 50% risk for hemophilia, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. The patient is a carrier (heterozygous for the hemophilia gene), and she's having a boy. So, indeed, there's a 50% chance the boy will inherit the affected X chromosome and have hemophilia.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option B: the infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia.\n\nBut the question is, which should you tell the patient regarding her infant?\n\nGiven that, perhaps there's more to consider. The karyotype showed XY, so it's a boy, and as we've established, there's a 50% chance he has hemophilia.\n\nHowever, the question might be testing whether we understand that males can't be carriers of X-linked recessive disorders. Carriers are females who have one affected X and one normal X.\n\nSo, confirming that, for X-linked recessive disorders, males are either affected or not affected; they don't carry the gene without expressing the disease.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct choice: the infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the infant, being male, cannot be a carrier.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is a risk of hemophilia.\n\nOption D overestimates the risk.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
