                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about the tripartite system and the 11+ exam. So, the tripartite system was used in the UK, right? Let me see what I remember about it.\n\nFirst off, the tripartite system was introduced after World War II as part of education reform. It divided secondary education into three types of schools: grammar schools, technical schools, and secondary modern schools. The idea was to provide different paths based on students' abilities and aptitudes.\n\nNow, the 11+ exam was used to determine which type of school a student would go to. It was a selective exam taken by students at the age of 11, at the end of their time in primary school.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. popular schools that lay outside their catchment area\n\nI don't think this is correct. The 11+ was about selecting students for specific types of schools based on their abilities, not about choosing popular schools outside their local area.\n\nB. private, public and comprehensive schools\n\nThis doesn't seem right either. The tripartite system was about grammar, technical, and secondary modern schools, not about private, public, and comprehensive schools. Comprehensive schools came later, as I recall, as a different approach to secondary education.\n\nC. grammar, technical, and secondary modern schools\n\nThis matches what I know about the tripartite system. The 11+ was used to sort students into these three types of schools based on their academic performance in the exam.\n\nD. polytechnics, colleges and universities\n\nNo, polytechnics, colleges, and universities are part of higher education, not secondary education. The 11+ was for secondary school entry.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be C. grammar, technical, and secondary modern schools.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. The tripartite system was indeed composed of grammar schools for students who scored highest in the 11+ exam, technical schools for those who showed aptitude in technical subjects, and secondary modern schools for the majority who didn't qualify for grammar or technical schools.\n\nYes, that sounds accurate. Therefore, option C is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
