Karen is working on her self-esteem and self-efficacy, which means she's trying to build her confidence in her own abilities. After three months of therapy, she's noticed improvement, which is great! Now, the question is asking which strategy her therapist would NOT ask her to employ to further raise her sense of self-efficacy. So, we need to identify which of the options isn't a helpful strategy for building self-efficacy.\n\nFirst, let's recall what self-efficacy is. It's basically about believing in your ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task. There are several ways to boost self-efficacy, and I think I remember some of them from psychology classes.\n\nOption A is \"Seek positive feedback from friends.\" Getting positive feedback can certainly boost one's confidence because it reinforces that you're doing well and appreciated by others. So, this seems like a positive strategy.\n\nOption B is \"Put in daily practice on the tasks she wishes to improve on.\" Practice is key to improving skills, and as you get better, your confidence in your abilities naturally increases. So, this makes sense as a way to boost self-efficacy.\n\nOption C is \"Find others her age and ability who excel at tasks she is interested in.\" This might be referring to finding role models or peers who are successful in areas she's interested in. Observing others who are skilled can provide inspiration and standards to aspire to, which could enhance her belief in her own abilities. So, this also seems like a beneficial strategy.\n\nOption D is \"Avoid potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in.\" Hmm, this one stands out because it suggests avoiding tasks that she's not good at yet. Now, avoiding challenges might seem like a way to protect one's self-esteem in the short term, but in the long run, it doesn't help build self-efficacy. To increase confidence in your abilities, you need to face challenges and learn from them, even if you make mistakes along the way.\n\nIn fact, one of the main ways to develop self-efficacy is through mastery experiences\u2014successfully completing tasks that are challenging but achievable. Avoiding tasks you're not proficient in means you're not giving yourself the opportunity to master those tasks and thereby boost your self-efficacy.\n\nAdditionally, avoiding challenges can lead to a lack of growth and may even reinforce feelings of inadequacy because you're not testing your abilities and seeing what you're capable of.\n\nSo, compared to the other options, which all involve active steps to improve and build confidence, option D suggests avoidance, which is generally counterproductive for building self-efficacy.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Avoid potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
