This can stimulate economic activity, including increased consumption and investment. However, it can also lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency, making exports more expensive and imports cheaper. As a result, exports may decrease and imports may increase, leading to a worsening of the balance of trade.\n\nOption A is incorrect because an appreciation of the currency due to expansionary monetary policy can make exports less competitive, potentially worsening the balance of trade.\n\nOption B is incorrect because expansionary monetary policy can affect imports by making them cheaper due to currency appreciation, thus increasing import volumes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because expansionary monetary policy can affect exports by making them more expensive due to currency appreciation, potentially decreasing export volumes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
