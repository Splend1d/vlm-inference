                    "text": "So I have this problem here: Helium effuses through a pinhole 5.33 times faster than an unknown gas. I need to figure out what that unknown gas is likely to be from the options given: CO2, CH4, C5H12, or C8H18. Okay, effusion is about how fast a gas escapes through a small hole, right? And apparently, helium does this much faster than this unknown gas.\n\nI remember that the rate of effusion of a gas is related to its molar mass. The lighter the gas, the faster it effuses. That makes sense because lighter molecules move faster at the same temperature. There's a formula for this, Graham's law of effusion, which says that the rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass of the gas. So, rate1 / rate2 = sqrt(molar mass2 / molar mass1).\n\nIn this case, helium is effusing 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas. So, rate of helium is 5.33 times rate of unknown gas. Let's denote helium as gas 1 and the unknown gas as gas 2. So, rate1 = 5.33 * rate2.\n\nPlugging into Graham's law: rate1 / rate2 = sqrt(molar mass2 / molar mass1)\n\nSo, 5.33 = sqrt(molar mass2 / molar mass of helium)\n\nI know the molar mass of helium is 4 g/mol. So, 5.33 = sqrt(molar mass2 / 4)\n\nTo find molar mass2, I can square both sides: 5.33^2 = molar mass2 / 4\n\nCalculating 5.33 squared: 5.33 * 5.33 = 28.4089\n\nSo, 28.4089 = molar mass2 / 4\n\nNow, molar mass2 = 28.4089 * 4 = 113.6356 g/mol\n\nOkay, so the molar mass of the unknown gas is approximately 113.64 g/mol. Now, I need to look at the options and see which one has a molar mass close to that.\n\nOption A: CO2\n\nCarbon dioxide, CO2: atomic mass of carbon is about 12 g/mol, oxygen is about 16 g/mol, so 12 + 2*16 = 44 g/mol.\n\nThat's way less than 113.64 g/mol.\n\nOption B: CH4\n\nMethane, CH4: carbon 12 g/mol, hydrogen 1 g/mol each, so 12 + 4*1 = 16 g/mol.\n\nEven smaller than CO2.\n\nOption C: C5H12\n\nPentane, C5H12: carbon 12 g/mol each, hydrogen 1 g/mol each, so 5*12 + 12*1 = 60 + 12 = 72 g/mol.\n\nCloser, but still less than 113.64 g/mol.\n\nOption D: C8H18\n\nOctane, C8H18: carbon 12 g/mol each, hydrogen 1 g/mol each, so 8*12 + 18*1 = 96 + 18 = 114 g/mol.\n\nThat's very close to 113.64 g/mol.\n\nSo, the unknown gas is most likely C8H18, octane.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check the molar masses to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nHelium: 4 g/mol \u2013 correct.\n\nCO2: 12 + 2*16 = 44 g/mol \u2013 correct.\n\nCH4: 12 + 4*1 = 16 g/mol \u2013 correct.\n\nC5H12: 5*12 + 12*1 = 60 + 12 = 72 g/mol \u2013 correct.\n\nC8H18: 8*12 + 18*1 = 96 + 18 = 114 g/mol \u2013 correct.\n\nAnd my calculation for the molar mass of the unknown gas: 5.33^2 = 28.4089, times 4 is 113.6356 g/mol, which rounds to 113.64 g/mol.\n\nOctane is 114 g/mol, which is very close. So, the answer should be D. C8H18.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see how the other options compare in terms of effusion rates.\n\nUsing Graham's law again, let's calculate the expected ratio for each option.\n\nFirst, CO2 with molar mass 44 g/mol.\n\nRateHe / RateCO2 = sqrt(molar mass CO2 / molar mass He) = sqrt(44 / 4) = sqrt(11) \u2248 3.32\n\nSo, helium should effuse about 3.32 times faster than CO2.\n\nBut in the problem, helium effuses 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas. 3.32 is less than 5.33, so CO2 is too heavy.\n\nWait, no. If CO2 is 44 g/mol, and helium is 4 g/mol, the ratio is 3.32, which is less than 5.33. But the problem states that helium effuses 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas. So, if CO2 only has a ratio of 3.32, that's less than 5.33, meaning the unknown gas is heavier than CO2.\n\nSimilarly, for CH4 at 16 g/mol:\n\nRateHe / RateCH4 = sqrt(16 / 4) = sqrt(4) = 2\n\nSo, helium effuses 2 times faster than methane. But in the problem, it's 5.33 times faster, so methane is too light.\n\nFor C5H12 at 72 g/mol:\n\nRateHe / RateC5H12 = sqrt(72 / 4) = sqrt(18) \u2248 4.24\n\nStill less than 5.33, meaning the unknown gas is heavier than C5H12.\n\nFor C8H18 at 114 g/mol:\n\nRateHe / RateC8H18 = sqrt(114 / 4) = sqrt(28.5) \u2248 5.34\n\nThat's very close to the given ratio of 5.33.\n\nSo, indeed, C8H18 is the most likely candidate.\n\nMaybe there's a slight discrepancy in the molar mass due to rounding or the precision of the atomic masses used.\n\nBut overall, C8H18 is the best fit among the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
