                    "text": "So I've got this question here about affective commitment in organizations. It's asking which of the options\u2014job satisfaction, productivity, job motivation, or turnover\u2014the level of affective commitment is least predictive of. I need to figure out which one doesn't tie in as closely with affective commitment as the others do.\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand what affective commitment is. From what I recall, affective commitment refers to an employee's emotional attachment to and identification with the organization. It's about how much an employee feels they belong and want to be part of the organization. It's different from continuance commitment, which is more about staying because of the benefits or the costs of leaving, and normative commitment, which is about feeling obliged to stay.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: job satisfaction. I think affective commitment and job satisfaction are pretty closely linked. If someone is affectively committed, they probably enjoy their job and are satisfied with it. So, I would expect a strong predictive relationship there.\n\nOption B: productivity. Affectively committed employees are likely to be more engaged and put in more effort, which should translate to higher productivity. So, this seems like it should be predictive as well.\n\nOption C: job motivation. Again, if someone is affectively committed, they probably have higher intrinsic motivation to perform well because they identify with the organization's goals. So, this should be predictive too.\n\nOption D: turnover. This is interesting. Affectively committed employees are less likely to leave the organization because they have a strong emotional bond. So, you'd think that affective commitment would be a good predictor of lower turnover rates.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the option where affective commitment is least predictive. So, if affective commitment is strongly related to all of these, which one stands out as the least predictive?\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Perhaps it's not about which one is least related, but which one might have other stronger influences.\n\nLet's consider job satisfaction. While affective commitment is important, job satisfaction can also be influenced by other factors like job characteristics, pay, relationships with coworkers, etc. So, maybe affective commitment is just one of several predictors of job satisfaction.\n\nSimilarly, productivity can be affected by skills, resources, management practices, etc., in addition to commitment.\n\nJob motivation can be influenced by personal goals, career aspirations, and external factors.\n\nTurnover, on the other hand, is more directly related to commitment. If someone is highly committed, they're less likely to leave, and if they're not committed, they're more likely to look for other opportunities.\n\nSo, perhaps turnover is more directly predicted by affective commitment compared to the other options.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the least predictive. So, if turnover is more directly predicted by commitment, then the least predictive would be one of the others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the relationship between affective commitment and job satisfaction is so strong that it's almost redundant. In that case, job satisfaction might be the least predictive because it's already a component of commitment.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I should consider the direction of the relationships.\n\nAffective commitment is likely to cause job satisfaction, productivity, and job motivation, and to reduce turnover. So, it's a predictor of these outcomes.\n\nBut job satisfaction could also influence commitment, so there's a reciprocal relationship there.\n\nProductivity and motivation might also influence commitment, but perhaps to a lesser extent.\n\nTurnover is more of a behavioral outcome that's directly influenced by commitment.\n\nSo, perhaps job satisfaction is the least predictive because it's more of a correlate of commitment rather than an outcome.\n\nAlternatively, maybe turnover is the most predictive, so the least would be one of the others.\n\nI need to think about this differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider empirical research on this topic. I recall that affective commitment has been shown to be strongly related to organizational citizenship behavior, organizational identification, and lower turnover intentions.\n\nIn terms of job satisfaction, there's a strong positive relationship, but it's not always perfectly correlated because satisfaction can be influenced by other factors.\n\nProductivity might be influenced by commitment, but also by other variables like job design and resources.\n\nJob motivation is likely to be influenced by commitment, but again, there are other factors at play.\n\nTurnover is a behavioral outcome that's influenced by commitment, but also by external job opportunities and economic conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps affective commitment is less predictive of job satisfaction because satisfaction can vary even among highly committed employees depending on other factors like pay or work conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's least predictive of productivity because productivity can be influenced more by technical skills and resources than by commitment.\n\nWait, but commitment should still influence how much effort someone puts in, which affects productivity.\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider that affective commitment is more about the emotional bond and identification, which may not directly translate into higher productivity if the employee lacks the necessary skills or resources.\n\nIn that case, perhaps productivity is the least predictive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe job motivation is the least predictive because motivation can come from various sources, not just organizational commitment.\n\nFor example, someone might be motivated by personal achievement, regardless of their commitment to the organization.\n\nSo, perhaps affective commitment is less predictive of job motivation compared to the other options.\n\nOn the other hand, turnover is a behavior that's more directly linked to commitment levels.\n\nSo, maybe job motivation is the least predictive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps job satisfaction is the least predictive because it's already a component of commitment.\n\nWait, no. Job satisfaction is related to commitment, but they're not the same thing.\n\nI think I need to look back at some literature or recall specific studies on this.\n\nI remember that affective commitment is positively related to job satisfaction, but that satisfaction can exist without high commitment, and vice versa.\n\nFor example, someone might be satisfied with their job because of high pay, but not necessarily be emotionally attached to the organization.\n\nSimilarly, someone could be affectively committed but dissatisfied if they feel their contributions aren't recognized.\n\nSo, there's a relationship, but it's not perfect.\n\nNow, considering productivity, affective commitment should lead to higher productivity because committed employees are more likely to go above and beyond, be more engaged, and contribute more to the organization.\n\nHowever, productivity can also be influenced by other factors like skill level, work environment, and support from management.\n\nSo, perhaps affective commitment is a important predictor of productivity, but not the only one.\n\nJob motivation is likely to be influenced by affective commitment, but again, there are other motivators like personal goals, career advancement, and external rewards.\n\nTurnover is more directly related to commitment levels. Highly committed employees are less likely to leave, while less committed employees are more likely to look for other opportunities.\n\nSo, in terms of prediction, affective commitment should be a strong predictor of turnover intentions and actual turnover behavior.\n\nGiven that, perhaps job satisfaction is the least predictive because it's more of a correlate of commitment rather than an outcome.\n\nAlternatively, maybe job motivation is the least predictive because motivation can be driven by\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20 beyond organizational commitment.\n\nI'm still not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider that affective commitment is more about the relationship between the employee and the organization, while job motivation is more about the individual's drive and goals, which may or may not be aligned with the organization's goals.\n\nIn that case, affective commitment might predict certain types of motivation, like organizational citizenship behavior, but not all forms of job motivation.\n\nSo, perhaps job motivation is the least predictive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps productivity is the least predictive because productivity is more about performance outcomes, which can be influenced by a wide range of factors beyond commitment, such as skill level and work conditions.\n\nIn contrast, turnover is more directly related to commitment levels.\n\nSo, maybe productivity is the least predictive.\n\nWait, but commitment should still influence productivity through engagement and effort.\n\nI'm getting stuck here.\n\nMaybe I should consider that affective commitment is more about the emotional bond, which may not directly translate into higher productivity if the employee lacks the necessary skills or resources to be productive.\n\nIn that case, affective commitment might not be as predictive of productivity as it is of, say, turnover.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps job satisfaction is the least predictive because satisfaction can fluctuate based on various factors, even if commitment remains high.\n\nFor example, an employee might be committed to the organization but dissatisfied with a particular aspect of their job, like their immediate supervisor or certain work conditions.\n\nSo, in that case, affective commitment might not predict job satisfaction as strongly as it predicts turnover.\n\nAlternatively, maybe job motivation is the least predictive because motivation can come from internal sources unrelated to organizational commitment.\n\nFor instance, an employee might be highly motivated to perform well because they take pride in their work or have personal goals unrelated to the organization.\n\nIn that case, affective commitment might not be as predictive of job motivation as it is of turnover.\n\nI think this is the direction I should go.\n\nSo, to sum up, affective commitment is likely to be least predictive of job motivation because motivation can be driven by various internal and external factors beyond the employee's emotional attachment to the organization.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. job motivation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
