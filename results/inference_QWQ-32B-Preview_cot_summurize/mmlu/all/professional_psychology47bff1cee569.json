The options are:\n\nA. Functional behavioral assessment\n\nB. Work sample\n\nC. Norm-referenced test\n\nD. Ecological assessment\n\nHmm, let's see what each of these means.\n\nFirst, a functional behavioral assessment (option A). I think this is used to understand why someone behaves a certain way, especially when it's a problem behavior. It looks at the triggers and consequences that maintain the behavior. So, it does involve observation, and it considers variables that impact behavior.\n\nNext, a work sample (option B). This sounds like an assessment where someone performs a task or a set of tasks that are similar to what they would do in a real job. It's more about demonstrating skills and abilities rather than observing behavior in a setting.\n\nThen, a norm-referenced test (option C). This is a type of test where an individual's performance is compared to a norm group. It's used to see how someone stands in relation to their peers. Examples include IQ tests or achievement tests. It doesn't really focus on observational methods or environmental variables.\n\nFinally, an ecological assessment (option D). This term isn't as familiar to me, but I think it has something to do with looking at the environment and how it affects behavior. Ecology is about the relationship between organisms and their environment, so an ecological assessment might examine how different elements in the setting influence behavior.\n\nGiven that, both functional behavioral assessment and ecological assessment seem relevant, but the question specifies that it uses observational methods to examine physical and psychological variables in a given environment.\n\nA functional behavioral assessment does involve observation, but its main focus is on understanding the function of the behavior, like what causes it and what maintains it. It might look at environmental factors, but its primary goal is to address behavior problems.\n\nAn ecological assessment, on the other hand, seems more broadly focused on the environment and how it impacts behavior, considering both physical and psychological variables.\n\nLooking back at the question: \"An assessment that uses primarily observational methods to examine and understand the physical and psychological variables that impact behavior in a given environment or setting.\"\n\nThis sounds a lot like an ecological assessment because it emphasizes the examination of the environment and how it influences behavior, considering both physical and psychological factors.\n\nFunctional behavioral assessment is more specific to behavior problems and their functions, whereas ecological assessment seems more holistic, looking at the entire environment and its impact on behavior.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D. Ecological assessment.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why it's not the other options.\n\nOption B, work sample, is about demonstrating job skills, not about observing behavior in an environment to understand variables affecting it.\n\nOption C, norm-referenced test, is about comparing an individual's performance to a norm group, again not focused on observational methods or environmental variables.\n\nOption A, functional behavioral assessment, while observational and focusing on behavior, is more targeted towards understanding the reasons behind specific behaviors, particularly problematic ones, rather than broadly examining physical and psychological variables in the environment.\n\nSo, ecological assessment seems to fit the description most accurately.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
