The options are:\n\nA. they cannot reproduce.\n\nB. they do not have a human genetic profile.\n\nC. they are genetically and functionally identifiable as parts of the male or female potential parents.\n\nD. all of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Lee and George's perspective is on this issue. I think they are philosophers or ethicists who have written about the beginning of human life and when something should be considered a human being with full moral status.\n\nI remember that they argue that ova and sperm are not human beings because they lack certain characteristics that are essential to being a human being. Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A says \"they cannot reproduce.\" Well, ova and sperm are gametes, and their function is to combine to form a zygote, which can develop into an embryo, fetus, and eventually a baby. So, in a way, they are part of the reproductive process, but individually, neither an ovum nor a sperm can reproduce on its own. So, maybe this is a point they make.\n\nOption B says \"they do not have a human genetic profile.\" Hmm, actually, both ova and sperm do have human genetic material. Each carries half the genetic information needed to make a human being. So, this seems incorrect. Maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nOption C says \"they are genetically and functionally identifiable as parts of the male or female potential parents.\" This seems plausible because ova come from females and sperm from males, and they carry the genetic material of their respective parents.\n\nOption D is \"all of the above,\" but since I'm doubting option B, maybe D isn't correct.\n\nLet me try to recall their arguments more carefully. I think Lee and George emphasize that ova and sperm are gametes, which are specialized cells produced by reproductive organs. They argue that these cells are parts of the parents, not separate human beings.\n\nFrom that perspective, option C seems most accurate because they are identifying ova and sperm as parts of the parents, specifically as gametes that carry half the genetic material and have the function of reproduction.\n\nOption A, about not being able to reproduce, might be a supporting point, but perhaps not the main reason. And option B seems incorrect because they do have human genetic material.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is C: they are genetically and functionally identifiable as parts of the male or female potential parents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Lee and George make multiple points, and D is the correct answer. But based on my current understanding, I'm leaning towards C.\n\nI should probably look up their actual arguments to be sure, but since this is a practice question, I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
