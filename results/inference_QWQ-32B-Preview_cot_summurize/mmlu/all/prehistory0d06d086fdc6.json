                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which option correctly matches Montezuma with the capital he ruled from. So, first things first, who was Montezuma?\n\nI recall that Montezuma was an Aztec emperor. Specifically, Montezuma II was the ninth ruler of the Aztec Empire. So, if he was an Aztec emperor, that means he ruled from the Aztec capital.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Maya; Tikal.\n\nB. Aztec; Tenochtitl\u00e1n.\n\nC. Teotihuac\u00e1nos; Teotihuac\u00e1n.\n\nD. Zapotec; Monte Alb\u00e1n.\n\nOption A mentions the Maya and Tikal. Tikal was indeed a major Maya city, but Montezuma was Aztec, not Maya. So, that doesn't match.\n\nOption B says Aztec; Tenochtitl\u00e1n. That sounds right because Tenochtitl\u00e1n was the capital of the Aztec Empire. Montezuma II ruled from there.\n\nOption C mentions the Teotihuac\u00e1nos and Teotihuac\u00e1n. Teotihuac\u00e1n was an important city in pre-Columbian Mexico, but it predates the Aztec Empire. The Teotihuac\u00e1nos were a previous civilization.\n\nOption D is about the Zapotec and Monte Alb\u00e1n. Monte Alb\u00e1n was the capital of the Zapotec civilization, which was in Oaxaca, Mexico.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the correct answer should be B. Aztec; Tenochtitl\u00e1n.\n\nBut just to double-check, was Montezuma indeed the ruler of millions of people from this capital?\n\nWell, the Aztec Empire was one of the most powerful civilizations in Mesoamerica at its peak, and Tenochtitl\u00e1n was a massive city, estimated to have had a population of about 200,000 to 300,000 people at the time of Spanish contact. The entire Aztec Empire likely had several million people under its control.\n\nSo, yes, Montezuma ruled over millions of people from the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Aztec; Tenochtitl\u00e1n.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
