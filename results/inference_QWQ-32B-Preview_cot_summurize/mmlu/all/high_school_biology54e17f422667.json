This is an example of codominance because both alleles are fully expressed in the phenotype. Codominance occurs when neither allele is recessive, and both contribute to the observable characteristics.\n\nTo elaborate:\n\n- **Codominance**: Both alleles are expressed equally in the heterozygote. In blood typing, IA and IB are codominant; hence, type AB blood shows both A and B antigens.\n\n- **Epistasis**: One gene masks or interferes with the expression of another gene. This is not the case in standard ABO blood typing.\n\n- **Polygenic**: Involves multiple genes contributing to a single trait, such as skin color or height. Blood type is determined by a single gene with multiple alleles.\n\n- **Linkage**: Refers to genes being located close to each other on the same chromosome and therefore tending to be inherited together. This is not directly related to the expression of the A and B antigens in blood typing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. codominance."
