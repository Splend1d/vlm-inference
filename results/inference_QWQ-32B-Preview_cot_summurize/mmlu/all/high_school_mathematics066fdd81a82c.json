                    "text": "So I have this function, f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5, and I need to find f(-2). I'm a bit rusty on how to substitute negative numbers into functions, especially with higher powers. But let's give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the function again to keep it clear:\n\nf(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5\n\nNow, I need to find f(-2), which means I'll plug in x = -2 into the function. So, everywhere there's an x, I'll replace it with -2.\n\nLet's do this step by step.\n\nStarting with the first term: 8x^3\n\nPlugging in x = -2:\n\n8*(-2)^3\n\nHmm, I need to remember that exponents come before multiplication, so I'll calculate (-2)^3 first.\n\n(-2)^3 = -8\n\nBecause negative times negative is positive, and then negative times positive is negative. So, -2 * -2 = 4, and then 4 * -2 = -8.\n\nSo, 8*(-8) = -64\n\nAlright, first term is -64.\n\nNext term: -6x^2\n\nPlugging in x = -2:\n\n-6*(-2)^2\n\nAgain, exponents first: (-2)^2 = 4\n\nBecause negative times negative is positive.\n\nSo, -6*4 = -24\n\nWait, but negative times positive is negative, so it should be -24.\n\nHold on, but the term is -6x^2, and x^2 is positive, so -6 times positive is negative.\n\nSo, that's -24.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let's double-check.\n\n(-2)^2 = 4, that's correct.\n\nThen, -6 * 4 = -24\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, second term is -24.\n\nMoving on to the third term: -4x\n\nPlugging in x = -2:\n\n-4*(-2) = 8\n\nBecause negative times negative is positive.\n\nSo, third term is 8.\n\nLast term: +5\n\nThis is just a constant, so it doesn't change.\n\nSo, now I need to add up all these terms:\n\n-64 + (-24) + 8 + 5\n\nLet's add them step by step.\n\nFirst, -64 + (-24) = -88\n\nThen, -88 + 8 = -80\n\nFinally, -80 + 5 = -75\n\nSo, f(-2) = -75\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. -75\n\nC. -64\n\nD. -24\n\nIt looks like option B is -75, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nf(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5\n\nf(-2) = 8*(-2)^3 - 6*(-2)^2 - 4*(-2) + 5\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n8*(-2)^3 = 8*(-8) = -64\n\n-6*(-2)^2 = -6*(4) = -24\n\n-4*(-2) = 8\n\n+5 = 5\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n-64 + (-24) = -88\n\n-88 + 8 = -80\n\n-80 + 5 = -75\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think the answer is -75, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
