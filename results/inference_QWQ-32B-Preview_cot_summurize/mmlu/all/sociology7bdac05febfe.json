                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these options isn't a characteristic of totalitarian societies. So, first things first, I should probably understand what a totalitarian society is.\n\nFrom what I know, a totalitarian society is one where the government has total control over every aspect of public and private life. It's a system where the state tries to dictate and regulate all aspects of society, including the economy, politics, and social behavior. So, characteristics of totalitarian societies would likely include strong control mechanisms, limited individual freedoms, and a centralized authority.\n\nOption A is \"indoctrination and propaganda.\" That sounds like something a totalitarian government would use to maintain control and ensure that the population thinks and behaves in ways that align with the state's ideology. So, that seems like it would be a characteristic.\n\nOption B is \"freedom of movement for citizens.\" Hmm, freedom of movement sounds like a right that allows people to move around without restrictions. In a totalitarian society, where the state has extensive control, I would think that freedom of movement might be restricted. For example, the government might control where people can travel or require permits for movement. So, this seems like it might not be a characteristic of totalitarian societies.\n\nOption C is \"one-party rule.\" That makes sense because in a totalitarian system, having multiple political parties would likely lead to a diversity of opinions and potentially challenge the authority of the ruling party. So, having one-party rule helps maintain the centralized control.\n\nOption D is \"a centrally planned economy.\" Again, in a totalitarian society, the government would likely control the economy to ensure that resources are allocated in a way that supports the state's goals.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, A, C, and D seem like they would be characteristics of totalitarian societies. Option B, \"freedom of movement for citizens,\" seems to be at odds with the idea of total control. Therefore, I think B is the answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there are any totalitarian societies where freedom of movement is allowed. I can't think of any off the top of my head. In history, totalitarian regimes like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union were known for restricting movement. For example, the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe prevented people from leaving the communist bloc without permission.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm confident that B, \"freedom of movement for citizens,\" is not a characteristic of totalitarian societies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
