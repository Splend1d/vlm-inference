                    "text": "To determine which of these substances releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body, we need to look at their energy yields per gram. The energy yield is typically measured in kilocalories (kcal) or kilojoules (kJ) per gram.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. One gram of glucose\n\nGlucose is a carbohydrate, and carbohydrates generally provide about 4 kcal per gram. So, one gram of glucose would yield approximately 4 kcal.\n\nB. One gram of palmitic acid\n\nPalmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid with 16 carbon atoms. Fats and fatty acids typically provide about 9 kcal per gram. Therefore, one gram of palmitic acid would yield approximately 9 kcal.\n\nC. One gram of leucine\n\nLeucine is an amino acid, which is a building block of proteins. Proteins generally provide about 4 kcal per gram. So, one gram of leucine would yield approximately 4 kcal.\n\nD. One gram of alcohol\n\nAlcohol, specifically ethanol, provides about 7 kcal per gram. Therefore, one gram of alcohol would yield approximately 7 kcal.\n\nNow, let's compare the energy yields:\n\n- Glucose: 4 kcal/g\n\n- Palmitic acid: 9 kcal/g\n\n- Leucine: 4 kcal/g\n\n- Alcohol: 7 kcal/g\n\nFrom this comparison, it's clear that palmitic acid releases the most energy per gram when completely oxidized in the body.\n\nIt's important to note that while fats provide more energy per gram, carbohydrates and proteins are essential for other bodily functions and energy balance. Additionally, the metabolism of different macronutrients can vary depending on the body's needs and metabolic state.\n\nIn summary, one gram of palmitic acid releases the most energy among the given options when completely oxidized in the body.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
