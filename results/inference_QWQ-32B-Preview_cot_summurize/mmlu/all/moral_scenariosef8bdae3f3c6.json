Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, putting the cat on the porch when your allergic niece is visiting might seem considerate because you're trying to prevent her from having an allergic reaction. However, depending on the situation, it could be seen as neglecting the cat's needs if it's left outside without supervision or appropriate care. But generally, taking precautions to protect someone with allergies is not morally wrong; it's responsible.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking your son to the dentist for braces to correct his crooked teeth is a common and acceptable practice. It's about improving his dental health and appearance, which is a standard parental responsibility.\n\nSo, neither scenario involves something that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
