This system is fundamental in computing and digital electronics because it corresponds to the two states that can be represented in these systems, such as \"on\" and \"off\" or \"high\" and \"low\" voltage levels.\n\nOption A, 0, is incorrect because while 0 is a digit in the binary system, it is not the total number of digits.\n\nOption B, 1, is also incorrect for the same reason; 1 is a digit in binary, but it doesn't represent the total count of digits in the system.\n\nOption D, 10, might be misleading because in binary, \"10\" represents the decimal number 2. However, in the context of the question, which is asking for the number of digits in the binary system, \"10\" is not correct because it's a two-digit number in binary, but the system itself has only two unique digits: 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the right choice is C. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
