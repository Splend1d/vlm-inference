                    "text": "So Max went into this mini-mart, pulled out a gun, and told the cashier to empty the register. He was probably pretty nervous and looking out for the police. Then, the cashier tried to grab the gun, Max dropped it, and it went off, killing a customer nearby. Now, Max is being charged with first-degree murder. I need to figure out what's likely to happen here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what first-degree murder means. From what I know, first-degree murder usually involves an intentional killing that's premeditated, meaning the person planned it ahead of time. But in this case, it seems like the shooting was accidental. Max didn't intend to kill anyone; he was just trying to rob the place.\n\nOption A says he'll likely be acquitted because he lacked the necessary intent for first-degree murder. That makes sense to me. Since he didn't intend to kill anyone, maybe he shouldn't be charged with first-degree murder.\n\nOption B says he'll be acquitted because the cashier's actions were the proximate cause of the death. Proximate cause refers to the direct cause of an event. In this case, the cashier tried to grab the gun, which led to Max dropping it and it discharging. So, maybe the cashier's actions are to blame. But I'm not sure if that would acquit Max completely.\n\nOption C says he'll be convicted because any death that's a natural and probable consequence of a felony is first-degree murder. Hmm, that sounds like the felony murder rule. In some places, if someone dies during the commission of a felony, like robbery, the person committing the felony can be charged with murder, even if it was accidental. So, maybe this is a possibility.\n\nOption D says he'll be convicted because intent to commit serious bodily harm is assumed when a deadly weapon is used. So, maybe by using a gun, it's assumed that he intended to cause serious harm, which could lead to a murder charge.\n\nI need to think about which one is most likely. First, regarding intent: Max didn't intend to kill anyone; he was just robbing the store. So, option A seems plausible. But then there's the felony murder rule, which might apply here because a death occurred during the commission of a felony.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if a death occurs during the commission of a dangerous felony, like robbery, the person committing the felony can be charged with murder, even if the death was accidental. So, option C might be correct.\n\nOption D mentions that intent to commit serious bodily harm is assumed when a deadly weapon is used. That could be relevant, but in this case, Max didn't use the gun to harm anyone intentionally; he just brandished it to carry out the robbery.\n\nI think the key here is the felony murder rule. Since the death occurred during the robbery, which is a felony, Max could be charged with murder. So, option C seems likely.\n\nBut let's consider option A again. If Max lacked the intent to kill, maybe he shouldn't be charged with first-degree murder. Maybe he'd be charged with a different degree of murder or manslaughter.\n\nAlternatively, option B suggests that the cashier's actions were the proximate cause. But proximate cause is usually determined by whether the death was a direct result of the defendant's actions, not someone else's.\n\nIn this case, Max's actions led to the situation where the gun was present and ultimately discharged. So, it's likely that his actions are considered the proximate cause, even if the cashier tried to grab the gun.\n\nOption D assumes intent to commit serious bodily harm when a deadly weapon is used. While using a gun does imply potential for harm, in this specific instance, Max didn't actually use the gun to harm anyone; he just brandished it to force the cashier to give him money.\n\nAfter considering all options, I think option C is the most likely: Max will be convicted because any death that is a natural and probable consequence of a felony is first-degree murder.\n\nBut I should note that laws vary by jurisdiction, and some places might handle this differently. In some places, the felony murder rule might apply only to certain felonies or under specific circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the death was accidental and not intended by Max might be a factor in sentencing or in reducing the charge to manslaughter or second-degree murder.\n\nBut based on the options given and assuming the felony murder rule applies, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
