                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the best way for the purchaser to respond to the seller's answer, especially regarding the separate defense about the earlier lawsuit. The purchaser thinks that the previous lawsuit was entirely different and irrelevant to the current case. So, I need to consider the options provided and decide which one is the most appropriate.\n\nOption A is to file a reply that includes a denial of the separate defense. I'm not sure about this because I think in civil procedure, after the defendant answers the complaint, the plaintiff might have the opportunity to reply to certain matters, but I'm not entirely clear on whether a reply is the right place to deny a separate defense.\n\nOption B is to move for sanctions against the seller for asserting a frivolous defense. Hmm, that seems a bit aggressive right off the bat. Maybe if the defense is truly without merit, but perhaps it's better to first address the relevance of the defense.\n\nOption C is to move to amend the complaint to add allegations about the differences between the lawsuits. I'm not sure if this is necessary. The purchaser believes the earlier lawsuit was factually completely different, but does that need to be alleged in the complaint? It seems like the focus should be on the current claim.\n\nOption D is to move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant. This seems promising. If the earlier lawsuit is irrelevant to the current breach of contract claim, then perhaps it shouldn't be part of the proceedings.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. In civil litigation, particularly in federal court, the rules regarding pleadings and defenses are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nFirst, Rule 8(c) requires a party to state any affirmative defenses in its answer. A separate defense is likely being asserted as an affirmative defense here. So, the seller is raising this previous lawsuit as a defense to the current breach of contract claim.\n\nThe purchaser believes this is irrelevant because the previous lawsuit was factually different. So, the question is whether this defense is something that should be considered in this case.\n\nIn terms of relevance, evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence, and if that fact is of consequence in determining the action. (Rule 401)\n\nHere, the seller is alleging that the purchaser has a history of filing frivolous lawsuits, specifically mentioning a previous contract claim that was lost. The seller seems to be suggesting that this history calls into question the validity of the current claim.\n\nBut, as the purchaser points out, the earlier lawsuit was factually completely different. So, is this history relevant to the current claim?\n\nWell, perhaps the seller is trying to imply something about the purchaser's credibility or the merit of the current claim. However, in contract actions, the focus should be on the specific agreement and breach at issue, not on the plaintiff's litigation history.\n\nMoreover, prior litigation, especially if it was factually different and involved a different party, may not be directly relevant to the current dispute. It could be seen as an attempt to smear the purchaser's reputation rather than to address the merits of the current claim.\n\nGiven that, it seems appropriate for the purchaser to challenge the relevance of this separate defense.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Filing a reply to deny the separate defense\u2014this might be necessary if the defense raises new matters that need to be addressed, but I'm not sure it's the most direct approach.\n\nB. Moving for sanctions\u2014this seems like a heavy-handed approach unless it's clear that the defense is frivolous.\n\nC. Moving to amend the complaint\u2014this doesn't seem directly relevant because the complaint is about the current breach, not about comparing it to previous lawsuits.\n\nD. Moving to strike the separate defense as irrelevant\u2014this appears to be the most direct and appropriate response.\n\nSo, option D seems like the best choice.\n\nTo support this, the purchaser can file a motion to strike the separate defense pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), which allows the court to order striking of redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter from any pleading.\n\nIn this motion, the purchaser can argue that the separate defense regarding the previous lawsuit is irrelevant to the current breach of contract claim. The purchaser can cite to the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 402, which provides that irrelevant evidence is not admissible.\n\nFurthermore, the purchaser can argue that allowing this defense would unnecessarily complicate the proceedings and potentially prejudice the purchaser by introducing irrelevant matters to the jury.\n\nThe purchaser should also prepare to address any arguments the seller might make in support of the defense's relevance, such as attempting to impeach the purchaser's credibility or to show a pattern of litigious behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, moving to strike the separate defense as irrelevant appears to be the purchaser's best response in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
