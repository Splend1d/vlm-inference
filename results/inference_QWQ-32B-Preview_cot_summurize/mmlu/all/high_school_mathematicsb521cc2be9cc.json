                    "text": "So I need to find the greatest common factor of 252 and 96. The options are 6, 24, 5, and 12. I'm not super confident with this, but let's give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I remember that the greatest common factor, or GCF, is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the biggest number that goes into both 252 and 96.\n\nOne way to find the GCF is to list all the factors of each number and then find the largest one they have in common. But that seems time-consuming, especially for bigger numbers. Is there a better way?\n\nI think there is something called the Euclidean algorithm that can help with this. I've heard of it, but I'm not sure how it works. Maybe I can look it up or recall how it goes.\n\nOkay, the Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCF of two numbers also divides their difference. So, you can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and then find the GCF of the difference and the smaller number. You repeat this process until you get a remainder of zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF.\n\nLet me try that with 252 and 96.\n\nFirst, divide 252 by 96. 96 times 2 is 192, which is less than 252. 96 times 3 is 288, which is too big. So, 96 times 2 is 192. Subtracting 192 from 252 gives 60.\n\nNow, I need to find the GCF of 96 and 60. Divide 96 by 60. 60 times 1 is 60, which is less than 96. 60 times 1 is 60. Subtracting 60 from 96 gives 36.\n\nNext, find the GCF of 60 and 36. Divide 60 by 36. 36 times 1 is 36, which is less than 60. 36 times 1 is 36. Subtracting 36 from 60 gives 24.\n\nNow, find the GCF of 36 and 24. Divide 36 by 24. 24 times 1 is 24, which is less than 36. 24 times 1 is 24. Subtracting 24 from 36 gives 12.\n\nNext, find the GCF of 24 and 12. Divide 24 by 12. 12 times 2 is 24, which equals 24. Subtracting 24 from 24 gives 0.\n\nSo, the last non-zero remainder is 12. Therefore, the GCF of 252 and 96 is 12.\n\nLooking back at the options, 12 is one of them. So, the answer should be D. 12.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there's another way to confirm this. Maybe by factoring both numbers into primes.\n\nLet's factor 252 and 96.\n\nStarting with 252:\n\n252 divided by 2 is 126.\n\n126 divided by 2 is 63.\n\n63 divided by 3 is 21.\n\n21 divided by 3 is 7.\n\n7 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 252 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7, or 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 7.\n\nNow, factoring 96:\n\n96 divided by 2 is 48.\n\n48 divided by 2 is 24.\n\n24 divided by 2 is 12.\n\n12 divided by 2 is 6.\n\n6 divided by 2 is 3.\n\n3 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 96 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3, or 2\u2075 \u00d7 3.\n\nNow, to find the GCF, we take the lowest power of each prime factor present in both factorizations.\n\nFor 2, the lowest power is 2\u00b2 (since 2\u00b2 is in 252 and 2\u2075 is in 96).\n\nFor 3, the lowest power is 3\u00b9 (since 3\u00b2 is in 252 and 3\u00b9 is in 96).\n\nThere's no 7 in the factorization of 96, so we don't include it.\n\nTherefore, the GCF is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b9 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nThis matches the result I got from the Euclidean algorithm. So, I'm confident that 12 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if any of the larger options divide both numbers. The options are 6, 24, 5, and 12.\n\nWe've already found that 12 divides both, but let's see about 24.\n\nDoes 24 divide 252? 24 times 10 is 240, which is less than 252. 24 times 11 is 264, which is too big. So, 24 doesn't divide 252 evenly. Therefore, 24 can't be the GCF.\n\nWhat about 6? 6 divides both 252 (252 \u00f7 6 = 42) and 96 (96 \u00f7 6 = 16). But 6 is smaller than 12, so it can't be the greatest common factor.\n\nOption 5 is not a factor of either number, I think. 5 doesn't divide 252 or 96 evenly, since neither number ends with a 5 or 0.\n\nSo, indeed, the greatest common factor is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
