                    "text": "So I've got this statistics problem here. It says that the correlation between two variables is r = 0.19. Then it asks what the new correlation would be if we add 0.23 to all values of the x-variable, double every value of the y-variable, and interchange the two variables. And I have to choose among these options: A. 0.19, B. 0.42, C. 0.84, or D. -0.19.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how correlation coefficients behave under different transformations of the variables. Correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables, and it's unitless. So, adding a constant to one variable or multiplying by a constant should affect the correlation in specific ways.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Adding a constant to the x-variable:**\n\n   Adding a constant to all values of x shifts the data horizontally but doesn't change the shape or the strength of the linear relationship. So, the correlation should remain the same.\n\n   Therefore, adding 0.23 to all x-values shouldn't affect the correlation. It still remains r = 0.19.\n\n2. **Multiplying the y-variable by a constant:**\n\n   Multiplying all y-values by a constant changes the scale of y but doesn't affect the linear relationship's strength or direction. Correlation is scaled-invariant, meaning it doesn't change when you multiply variables by constants.\n\n   So, doubling all y-values shouldn't change the correlation either. It remains r = 0.19.\n\n3. **Interchanging the two variables:**\n\n   Swapping x and y shouldn't affect the correlation because correlation is symmetric. That is, corr(x, y) = corr(y, x).\n\n   So, interchanging x and y won't change the correlation from r = 0.19.\n\nGiven these points, it seems like none of the transformations affect the correlation coefficient. So, the new correlation should still be 0.19.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nLet me think about the formula for the correlation coefficient:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}} \\]\n\nNow, let's see how each transformation affects this formula.\n\nFirst transformation: add 0.23 to all x-values.\n\nIf x becomes x + 0.23, then the mean of x also increases by 0.23, so \\( \\bar{x} \\) becomes \\( \\bar{x} + 0.23 \\).\n\nThen, \\( x_i - \\bar{x} = (x_i + 0.23) - (\\bar{x} + 0.23) = x_i - \\bar{x} \\), so the numerator and denominator remain the same.\n\nSimilarly, for y doubled: y becomes 2y.\n\nThen, \\( y_i - \\bar{y} = 2y_i - 2\\bar{y} = 2(y_i - \\bar{y}) \\).\n\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[ \\sum (x_i - \\bar{x}) \\cdot 2(y_i - \\bar{y}) = 2 \\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) \\]\n\nAnd the denominator becomes:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\cdot \\sum [2(y_i - \\bar{y})]^2} = \\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\cdot 4 \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2} = 2 \\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2} \\]\n\nSo, the correlation coefficient becomes:\n\n\\[ r' = \\frac{2 \\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{2 \\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}} = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}} = r \\]\n\nSo, doubling y doesn't change the correlation.\n\nFinally, interchanging x and y just swaps the roles, but since correlation is symmetric, it remains the same.\n\nTherefore, after all these transformations, the correlation should still be 0.19.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A is 0.19, which seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me consider the transformations in sequence.\n\nStarting with r = 0.19.\n\n1. Add 0.23 to all x-values: r remains 0.19.\n\n2. Double all y-values: r remains 0.19.\n\n3. Interchange x and y: r remains 0.19.\n\nSo, the final correlation should be 0.19.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interchanging step affects something, but I don't see how, since correlation is symmetric.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"what is the new correlation if 0.23 is added to all values of the x-variable, every value of the y-variable is doubled, and the two variables are interchanged?\"\n\nMaybe the transformations are applied in sequence: first add to x, then multiply y, then interchange.\n\nOr maybe all transformations are applied simultaneously.\n\nBut in either case, as per the properties of correlation, adding a constant to x, multiplying y by a constant, and interchanging x and y should not change the correlation coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 0.19.\n\nUnless... unless multiplying y by a negative constant changes the sign of the correlation. But in this case, it's multiplied by 2, which is positive, so the sign remains the same.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
