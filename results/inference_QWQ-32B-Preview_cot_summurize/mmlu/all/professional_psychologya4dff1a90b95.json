                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about when children start using certain memory strategies like rehearsal, elaboration, and organization. The options are ages 2-3, 5-7, 9-10, and 13-15. I need to think about child development and how memory strategies evolve over time.\n\nFirst, I know that very young children, like 2-3 year olds, are still developing their basic memory skills. They can remember things for short periods and learn through repetition, but I don't think they deliberately use strategies like elaboration or organization yet. So, option A seems too early.\n\nNext, ages 5-7 are when kids are starting school, and they're learning more formal ways of processing information. They might be taught some memory techniques, but I'm not sure if they're regularly using elaboration and organization on their own yet. Maybe they're beginning to, but it might not be consistent.\n\nAges 9-10 are a bit older, and by this point, children have more developed cognitive skills. They can understand relationships between concepts and might be better at organizing information. Elaboration, which means adding more details to memories to make them more meaningful, could also be something they start doing more deliberately.\n\nFinally, ages 13-15 are adolescents, who are even more cognitively advanced. They should definitely be using these strategies, but the question is whether they begin to use them regularly at this stage or earlier.\n\nI think the key here is \"deliberately and regularly.\" So, it's not just\u5076\u5c14 using these strategies but making them a consistent part of how they approach learning and remembering things.\n\nLet me consider some examples. For rehearsal, which is repeating information to remember it, even young children do this, but maybe not always deliberately. Elaboration involves adding meaning or connections to the information, which might require a certain level of metacognitive awareness. Organization is about structuring information in a way that makes it easier to recall, like categorizing items.\n\nI recall that Piaget's theory suggests that around age 7, children move into the concrete operational stage, where they can think logically about concrete events and manipulate information in their mind. This might be when they start using some memory strategies more effectively.\n\nHowever, another theory by Vygotsky emphasizes the role of social interaction in cognitive development. According to him, children learn strategies from more knowledgeable others, like parents and teachers, and internalize them over time.\n\nConsidering that, maybe by ages 5-7, with guidance from adults, children start to use these strategies more deliberately, even if not perfectly.\n\nBut option C, 9-10 years, seems like a time when they might have more\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027 in applying these strategies, having had more experience in school and learning different subjects.\n\nOn the other hand, option D, 13-15, is adolescence, when cognitive abilities are further refined, and metacognition is more developed. They might be more adept at choosing and applying the right memory strategies for different tasks.\n\nBut the question is when they begin to deliberately and regularly use these strategies. So, it might not be in adolescence, but earlier.\n\nMaybe around ages 9-10, as option C suggests. By then, they have several years of school experience and have likely been taught various study techniques.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's earlier, around 5-7 years old, as they start formal education.\n\nI need to think about what research says about this. I remember that children's use of memory strategies increases with age, and that instruction can significantly impact when they start using these strategies.\n\nThere's something called the \"strategy training\" approach, where children are taught specific memory techniques, and studies have shown that even young children can benefit from such training.\n\nHowever, without formal instruction, children might not spontaneously use these strategies until they are older and their cognitive abilities have matured.\n\nIn everyday settings, without explicit teaching, maybe children start using these strategies more regularly around ages 9-10.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up some information on this.\n\nWait, I don't have access to external resources right now, so I need to rely on what I know.\n\nLet me consider that rehearsal is a simpler strategy and might be used earlier, while elaboration and organization are more complex and require higher cognitive skills.\n\nPerhaps children start using rehearsal earlier, say around ages 5-7, but elaboration and organization later, around ages 9-10.\n\nBut the question mentions all three strategies together, so maybe they begin to use them all deliberately and regularly around the same time, perhaps when they have sufficient cognitive maturity.\n\nGiven that, option C, 9 to 10 years, seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's between options B and C, and I need to choose the best one.\n\nIf I had to pick, I would go with C, 9 to 10 years, because by that age, children have more developed executive functions and metacognitive skills, which are necessary for effectively using these memory strategies.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure.\n\nLet me consider that in preschool and early elementary school, children are learning the basics of reading and writing, and they might be introduced to some memory techniques, like using mnemonics or organizing information into categories.\n\nSo, maybe by ages 5-7, they are beginning to use some strategies, but not yet regularly.\n\nThen, by ages 9-10, they have more practice and are more likely to regularly apply these strategies.\n\nTherefore, option C seems more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it varies greatly among individuals, and some children might start using these strategies earlier if they are advanced or have been taught them explicitly.\n\nBut in general, for the average child, ages 9-10 might be when they begin to deliberately and regularly use rehearsal, elaboration, and organization as memory strategies.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. 9 to 10 years of age.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
