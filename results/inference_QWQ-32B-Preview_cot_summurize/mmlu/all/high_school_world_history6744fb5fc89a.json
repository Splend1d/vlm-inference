                    "text": "Let's see. This excerpt is from the Shu Jing, which is an ancient Chinese text, and it's from around the 6th century BCE. It talks about Yi Yin sacrificing to the former king and presenting the heir-king before the shrine of his grandfather. Then, Yi Yin describes the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor to instruct the young king.\n\nSo, there's a lot going on here. It mentions the Xia dynasty and how they cultivated virtue, leading to no calamities from Heaven, and how their spirits and even birds and beasts were peaceful and happy in their natural ways. But then their descendant didn't follow that example, so Heaven sent down calamities, and the Shang king came in, bringing sagely prowess and generous gentleness.\n\nNow, the young king is being instructed to carry on this virtue, and it's emphasized that everything depends on how he starts his reign. It talks about the former king paying careful attention to the bonds that hold men together, and there are warnings to revere and act virtuously.\n\nAlso, it says that the ways of Heaven are not invariable; they bring blessings to good-doers and miseries to evil-doers. If the king isn't virtuous, whether in large or small things, it will lead to the ruin of the ancestral temple.\n\nNow, the question is asking which phrase can be seen as a statement of the roots of Daoist beliefs. So, I need to think about what Daoist beliefs are and see which phrase aligns with that.\n\nDaoism, or Taoism, is a philosophy and religion that emphasizes living in harmony with the Dao, which is the natural order or way of the universe. It values simplicity, naturalness, and the balance of opposites, like yin and yang.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. \"Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess.\"\n\nThis seems to be praising the Shang king for his wise and powerful rule. It doesn't directly relate to Daoist beliefs about living in harmony with nature or the Dao.\n\nB. \"The former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together.\"\n\nThis is about social bonds and governance, focusing on how the former king paid attention to the relationships among people. While important, it doesn't directly speak to Daoist principles about nature or the Dao.\n\nC. \"The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature.\"\n\nThis phrase mentions that birds and beasts lived according to their nature, which aligns with Daoist ideals of living naturally and in harmony with one's true nature.\n\nD. \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings.\"\n\nThis seems more like a statement about cosmic justice, where actions have consequences based on morality. It's similar to the idea of karma in other traditions, but not specifically Daoist.\n\nSo, between these options, C seems to be the one that most closely aligns with Daoist beliefs, as it refers to living according to one's nature, which is a key Daoist concept.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. Daoism also emphasizes harmony with the natural world and minimal interference in natural processes. The phrase about birds and beasts enjoying their existence according to their nature seems to embody that idea.\n\nAdditionally, Daoism often contrasts with Confucianism, which focuses more on social bonds and moral duties. So, options A and B might be more aligned with Confucian ideals, while C is more in line with Daoist thoughts.\n\nOption D introduces the concept of Heaven responding to human actions, which is more aligned with the idea of heavenly mandate in Confucianism rather than Daoist principles.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: \"The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
