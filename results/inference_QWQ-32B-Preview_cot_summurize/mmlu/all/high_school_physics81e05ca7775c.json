                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a proton moving through a magnetic field. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nA proton is traveling at an initial speed of 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 meters per second, and it enters a region with a constant magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla. The initial velocity vector of the proton makes a 30-degree angle with the magnetic field. I need to find the proton's speed 4 seconds after it enters the magnetic field.\n\nLooking at the options, they are all different speeds, but interestingly, option C is the same as the initial speed. Is speed conserved in this scenario?\n\nFirst, I need to recall how a magnetic field affects a moving proton. I know that a magnetic field exerts a force on a moving charge, and the force is given by the Lorentz force law:\n\nF = q(v \u00d7 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- F is the force on the charge\n\n- q is the charge of the particle\n\n- v is the velocity vector of the particle\n\n- B is the magnetic field vector\n\n- \u00d7 denotes the cross product\n\nThe direction of the force is perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field vectors, which means that the magnetic force always acts perpendicular to the motion of the particle.\n\nNow, since the force is perpendicular to the velocity, it doesn't change the speed of the particle, only the direction of its velocity. This is because the work done by the magnetic force is zero (since force and displacement are perpendicular), so no energy is transferred to the particle, and thus its kinetic energy remains constant.\n\nWait a minute, if the kinetic energy remains constant, that means the speed shouldn't change, right? Because kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2, and mass is constant.\n\nSo, if the kinetic energy doesn't change, the speed should stay the same as the initial speed. That would make the answer option C, 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\nBut let me think about this again. Maybe there's something I'm missing. The problem says the velocity vector makes a 30-degree angle with the magnetic field. Does that affect the speed?\n\nActually, no. The component of the velocity parallel to the magnetic field isn't affected by the magnetic force, and the component perpendicular to the field experiences a force that causes it to move in a circular path. But overall, the speed should remain constant.\n\nLet me see if there's an equation that describes the speed as a function of time in a magnetic field.\n\nI know that the period of the circular motion for a charged particle in a magnetic field is given by:\n\nT = 2\u03c0m / (|q|B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- T is the period\n\n- m is the mass of the particle\n\n- q is the charge\n\n- B is the magnetic field strength\n\nBut this gives the time it takes to complete one full circle, not the speed as a function of time.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the trajectory of the proton in the magnetic field.\n\nWhen a charged particle enters a uniform magnetic field at an angle, its motion can be decomposed into two components:\n\n1. Parallel to the magnetic field: this component of the velocity remains unchanged because there's no force acting on it.\n\n2. Perpendicular to the magnetic field: this component causes the particle to move in a circular path due to the magnetic force.\n\nSo, the overall path is a helix, with the axis of the helix aligned with the magnetic field.\n\nNow, since the speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector, and neither component is changing in magnitude (only direction), the overall speed should remain constant.\n\nLet me check if there's any acceleration that could change the speed.\n\nThe magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity, so it only changes the direction of the velocity, not its magnitude. Therefore, the speed should remain constant.\n\nWait, but maybe there's some deceleration due to radiation or something, but that's probably beyond the scope of this problem.\n\nGiven that it's a constant magnetic field and ignoring any relativistic effects or radiation, the speed should remain constant.\n\nSo, after 4 seconds, the speed should still be 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the speed.\n\nIs there any possibility that the magnetic field could do work on the proton, changing its kinetic energy? No, because the force is always perpendicular to the displacement, so the work done is zero.\n\nAlternatively, is there any component of the force that could act along the direction of motion, accelerating or decelerating the proton? Again, no, because the force is always perpendicular to the velocity.\n\nTherefore, the speed remains constant.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The speed of the proton after 4 seconds should be the same as its initial speed, which is 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.5 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ m/s}} \\]"
