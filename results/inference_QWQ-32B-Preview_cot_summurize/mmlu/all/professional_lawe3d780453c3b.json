                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about impeachment. So, impeachment is a pretty serious process in the U.S. government that can lead to the removal of high-ranking officials like the president, vice president, and other civil officers. The question is asking which statement about impeachment isn't true. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Grounds include treason and bribery.\" I know that impeachment isn't just about criminal acts; it's broader than that. Treason and bribery are indeed specified in the Constitution as grounds for impeachment. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"Grounds include high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Hmm, this sounds familiar. Yes, the Constitution mentions \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" as grounds for impeachment. This is a bit vague, which allows for a wide range of offenses to be considered impeachable. So, this also seems accurate.\n\nOption C: \"A majority vote in the House is necessary to invoke charges of impeachment.\" Impeachment proceedings start in the House of Representatives. From what I recall, it only takes a majority vote in the House to impeach someone, meaning more than 50% of the members voting in favor. So, this appears to be correct.\n\nOption D: \"A three-fourths vote in the Senate is necessary to convict and remove from office.\" Now, this one rings a bell, but I think there might be a mistake here. I remember that in the Senate, it's not a three-fourths vote that's required to convict and remove someone from office. Let me think... isn't it actually a two-thirds majority that's needed in the Senate to convict and remove an impeached official?\n\nIf I'm right, then option D is incorrect because it states that a three-fourths vote is necessary, whereas, in reality, it's two-thirds. To confirm, let's recall that after the House impeaches someone, the case goes to the Senate for a trial, and a two-thirds majority vote is required in the Senate to convict and remove the official from office.\n\nSo, if my memory serves me correctly, the correct requirement is a two-thirds vote in the Senate, not three-fourths. Therefore, option D is the statement that's not true about impeachment.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- A: Correct, treason and bribery are grounds for impeachment.\n\n- B: Correct, high crimes and misdemeanors are also grounds.\n\n- C: Correct, a majority vote in the House is needed to impeach.\n\n- D: Incorrect, it's two-thirds, not three-fourths, in the Senate to convict and remove.\n\nHence, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
