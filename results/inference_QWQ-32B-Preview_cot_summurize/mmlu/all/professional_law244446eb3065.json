                    "text": "In a negligence case like this, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff\u2014the pedestrian in this scenario. The pedestrian needs to demonstrate that the painting company failed in their duty of care, which led to the ladder falling and causing injury. Let's break down each option to understand which one is the most accurate.\n\nOption A suggests that the pedestrian must prove negligence \"beyond all reasonable doubt.\" This standard is typically reserved for criminal cases, where the stakes are higher, and the accused faces potential imprisonment. In civil cases, such as this negligence action, the standard is lower. Therefore, option A is not accurate.\n\nOption B states that the pedestrian must prove negligence by a \"preponderance of the evidence.\" This is the standard burden of proof in civil cases. It means that it is more likely than not, or greater than 50%, that the painting company was negligent. This seems plausible.\n\nOption C says that the painting company must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it was not negligent. In most civil cases, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the defendant's negligence, not the other way around. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption D mentions a \"rebuttable presumption of negligence\" under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. Res ipsa loquitur is a legal doctrine that allows a jury to infer negligence from the mere occurrence of an accident, provided certain conditions are met. However, res ipsa loquitur is not automatically applied in every case; it depends on the circumstances. In some jurisdictions, it might apply to ladder accidents, but it's not universally applicable.\n\nGiven these explanations, option B seems to be the most accurate statement regarding the burden of proof in this negligence action. The pedestrian must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the painting company was negligent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
