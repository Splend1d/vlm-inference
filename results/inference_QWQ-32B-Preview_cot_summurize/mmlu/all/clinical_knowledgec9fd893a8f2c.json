Let's see, I think the heart has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. And as for valves, I remember there are valves that control the flow of blood in and out of the heart. I think there are four valves: the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves. So, if that's correct, then the heart has four valves and four chambers. That would make option B the right answer. But let me double-check.\n\nFirst, the chambers of the heart: There are indeed two atria (singular: atrium) and two ventricles, making a total of four chambers. The atria receive blood into the heart, and the ventricles pump blood out of the heart.\n\nNow, the valves: The heart has four valves that ensure blood flows in the correct direction.\n\n1. Tricuspid valve: located between the right atrium and the right ventricle.\n\n2. Pulmonary valve: located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery.\n\n3. Mitral valve: located between the left atrium and the left ventricle.\n\n4. Aortic valve: located between the left ventricle and the aorta.\n\nSo, with four chambers and four valves, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, I've heard someone mention that the heart has two atrioventricular (AV) valves and two semilunar valves. Let's see: the tricuspid and mitral valves are the atrioventricular valves, and the pulmonary and aortic valves are the semilunar valves. So, in total, that's still four valves.\n\nMaybe someone is getting confused between the number of valves and chambers, but based on my understanding, the heart has four chambers and four valves.\n\nLet me see if any of the other options make sense.\n\nOption A says two valves and two chambers. That can't be right because, as I just thought, there are four chambers and four valves.\n\nOption C says two valves and four chambers. That's incorrect because there are four valves.\n\nOption D says four valves and two chambers. Again, that's not right because there are four chambers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: four valves and four chambers.\n\nI think I've got it figured out now. The heart has four chambers and four valves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
