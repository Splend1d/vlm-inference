The options are Asian-Americans, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native North Americans. I need to think about cultural attitudes towards family and seeking help.\n\nFirst, I should consider that different cultures have different beliefs and practices regarding family issues and seeking external help. Some cultures place a strong emphasis on family harmony and privacy, which might make admitting to family problems especially difficult and shameful.\n\nLet me start with Asian-Americans. I know that in many Asian cultures, there's a strong value placed on family honor and saving face. Admitting to family problems could be seen as bringing shame to the family, so there might be a lot of guilt and shame associated with seeking help from outsiders like counselors.\n\nNext, African-Americans. African-American families have a strong tradition of resilience and sometimes rely on community support systems. However, there might still be stigma around seeking professional help for family issues, but I'm not as sure about this compared to Asian cultures.\n\nHispanics also place a high value on family unity and privacy. In Latino cultures, family problems are often dealt with internally, and seeking help from external sources might be seen as a failure to maintain family cohesion.\n\nNative North Americans, or American Indians, have diverse cultural backgrounds, but many place importance on community and extended family relationships. There might be cultural beliefs about handling issues within the tribe or community before seeking external help.\n\nComparing these, it seems like Asian-Americans and Hispanics both have strong cultural tendencies to keep family matters private and avoid seeking external help, which could lead to shame and guilt when admitting to a counselor about family problems.\n\nBut I need to choose one. Maybe I should look up some research or statistics on this topic. Unfortunately, I don't have access to specific studies right now, so I'll have to go with my best guess based on cultural knowledge.\n\nAsian cultures are often noted for their emphasis on saving face and family honor, which could make admitting to family problems particularly difficult. Therefore, I'm leaning towards Asian-Americans as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a trick question and it's not specific to one group, but I think the question is asking about a group where this is particularly common.\n\nWait, maybe it's Hispanics. In some Latino cultures, there's a concept called \"machismo\" which can influence family dynamics and potentially lead to shame and guilt when family problems are admitted.\n\nI'm getting confused now. Maybe I should consider the context of the question. It's about counseling, so perhaps it's about which group is less likely to seek counseling due to these feelings.\n\nBut the question is about experiencing shame and guilt upon admitting to a counselor, assuming that they have already sought counseling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the intensity of these feelings across different cultures.\n\nI think I need to make a decision. Given that Asian cultures are known for their strong emphasis on family harmony and privacy, I'll go with Asian-Americans.\n\nSo, my answer is A. Asian-Americans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
