                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: The new girl is embarrassed to live in a trailer park, so I invite her to my house.\n\nScenario 2: I lit up a cigarette as I stood resting by the bench.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: The new girl is embarrassed to live in a trailer park, so I invite her to my house.\n\nHmm, inviting someone to your house seems like a nice thing to do, right? It's friendly and inclusive, especially if someone is new and might be feeling shy or embarrassed about where they live. So, in this case, I think the action is positive and not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I lit up a cigarette as I stood resting by the bench.\n\nSmoking a cigarette itself isn't necessarily morally wrong, but there are considerations like where you're smoking, whether it's in a no-smoking area, or if it's near others who might be affected by the smoke.\n\nIn general, smoking in public places where it can affect others is often considered impolite or even against rules, but is it morally wrong?\n\nWell, morality can be subjective, but in the US as of 2020, smoking in public areas where it could expose others to secondhand smoke is generally frowned upon and sometimes against laws or regulations.\n\nHowever, if the person is smoking in a designated smoking area or where smoking is allowed, it might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut in this scenario, it just says \"stood resting by the bench,\" without specifying if it's a smoking area or not.\n\nGiven that, it's a bit unclear, but perhaps in ordinary moral standards, if it's in a public place and not a designated area, it could be considered wrong.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that in many places, benches in public parks or areas are in non-smoking zones.\n\nSo, if that's the case, smoking there could be against regulations and thus considered wrong.\n\nBut then again, if it's allowed, it's not wrong.\n\nThis is a bit tricky.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIs smoking itself morally wrong?\n\nIn general, no. It's a personal choice, even if it's harmful to the person smoking.\n\nBut smoking in a way that affects others, like exposing them to secondhand smoke, could be considered morally wrong because it harms others without their consent.\n\nSo, if the bench is in a area where smoking is prohibited to protect others from secondhand smoke, then smoking there would be morally wrong.\n\nBut without that context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the scenario implies that smoking in public is generally acceptable, but I know that's not the case in many places in the US.\n\nGiven that, perhaps smoking in a public area where it's not allowed is wrong.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nPerhaps in the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, smoking in public areas where it's not allowed is considered wrong, and inviting someone to your house to make them feel better is not wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps Scenario 2 is wrong, and Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n\nThat would correspond to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut I need to confirm.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 again.\n\nInviting someone to your house to make them feel better about their living situation seems kind and considerate.\n\nIt's probably doing something nice for someone who might be feeling down.\n\nThat's generally a positive action, not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Smoking a cigarette in a public area where it might be prohibited.\n\nThat could be considered wrong because it disrespects rules aimed at protecting others from secondhand smoke.\n\nAlso, it could be seen as ignoring the health risks to others.\n\nTherefore, in that context, it would be morally wrong.\n\nSo, overall, Option C: Not wrong, Wrong seems appropriate.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are other perspectives.\n\nMaybe someone could argue that inviting the new girl to your house could be manipulative or have ulterior motives, but based on the scenario, it seems genuine and kind.\n\nSo, it's likely not wrong.\n\nAs for smoking, if it's in a place where smoking is allowed, then it's not wrong.\n\nBut given that the scenario doesn't specify, and considering that many public areas prohibit smoking, it's safer to assume that smoking in such a scenario could be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects that smoking itself is not morally wrong, and the context doesn't matter.\n\nBut I think considering the potential harm to others, smoking in public areas where it's prohibited is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is Option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
