                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about a 4-year-old girl who's healthy otherwise, and she's here for a routine check-up. During the exam, the doctor hears some heart murmurs and needs to figure out what might be causing them. So, I need to think about what these murmurs could indicate and pick the most likely diagnosis from the options given.\n\nFirst, there's a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border. Okay, a grade 2/6 murmur is relatively mild. Systolic ejection murmurs happen during systole, which is when the heart is pumping blood out. The location is the upper left sternal border, which is near where the aortic valve is.\n\nThen, it says S2 is widely split and doesn't change with breathing. S2 is the second heart sound, which is the closing of the aortic and pulmonary valves. A split S2 can be normal in children, but if it's widely split and doesn't vary with respiration, that might suggest something else.\n\nAlso, there's a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. Diastole is when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. Mid-diastolic murmurs can be due to blood flowing back through a valve or through a hole in the heart.\n\nThe exam shows no other abnormalities, which means there are no extra sounds, no vibrations, and the child looks healthy.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Aortic stenosis - that's narrowing of the aortic valve. A systolic ejection murmur could be consistent with that, but aortic stenosis usually causes a harsh, crescendo-decrescendo murmur, and it might be louder than grade 2/6. Also, aortic stenosis doesn't typically cause a mid-diastolic murmur.\n\nB. Atrial septal defect (ASD) - that's a hole in the wall between the two atria. ASDs can cause a systolic ejection murmur due to increased flow through the pulmonary valve. The widely split S2 is also consistent with ASD because there's delayed closure of the pulmonary valve due to increased blood flow to the lungs. Additionally, a mid-diastolic murmur could be due to increased blood flow across the mitral valve during diastole.\n\nC. Coarctation of the aorta - that's a narrowing of the aorta, which can cause a systolic murmur due to turbulence. However, coarctation typically causes other signs like decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities or differences in blood pressure between arms and legs. There might also be a murmur heard over the area of coarctation, but it's not typically described as a systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border.\n\nD. Mitral valve prolapse - that's when the mitral valve bulges back into the left atrium during systole. It can cause a mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur. However, in this case, the murmur described is a systolic ejection murmur and a mid-diastolic murmur, which doesn't really fit with mitral valve prolapse.\n\nConsidering all this, option B, atrial septal defect, seems to fit best with the findings: systolic ejection murmur, widely split S2 that doesn't vary with respiration, and a mid-diastolic murmur.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
