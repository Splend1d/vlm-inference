Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny\u2026We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\"\nSim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819\nThe author of this text expresses a belief in which of the following as requirements for a properly functioning legal system?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this text by Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar. It's pretty dense, but I think if I break it down, I can get a handle on what he's saying.\n\nFirst, he's talking about the identity of the people he's addressing. They're a mix of aborigines and Spaniards, Americans by birth but Europeans by law. It sounds like there's a lot of confusion about who they are and where they stand in terms of ownership and presence in their country.\n\nHe mentions that their position is \"most extraordinary and complicated.\" They've been passive politically and are now struggling to achieve liberty, which seems especially difficult because they've been treated almost worse than slaves, robbed of their freedom and even the right to exercise any kind of authority.\n\nInteresting point: he says they've been ruled more by deceit than by force, and degraded by vice more than by superstition. That suggests that the methods used to control them weren't just physical but also manipulative and corrupting.\n\nThen he talks about slavery being the daughter of darkness and how an ignorant people is easily led to their own destruction. Ambition and intrigue take advantage of their lack of knowledge in politics, economics, and civic matters. They end up confusing illusion with reality, license with liberty, treachery with patriotism, and vengeance with justice.\n\nIf such a people manages to achieve liberty, Bol\u00edvar believes they will soon lose it because they lack the understanding of what true happiness and liberty entail. He seems to be saying that happiness comes from practicing virtue, that the rule of law is stronger than the rule of tyrants because laws are inflexible and benefit everyone by their austerity.\n\nHe emphasizes that proper morals are the foundation of law, and that practicing justice is practicing liberty.\n\nOkay, now the question is asking about what the author believes are requirements for a properly functioning legal system. The options are:\n\nA. Truth and religion\n\nB. Freedom and democracy\n\nC. Intelligence and order\n\nD. Morality and justice\n\nLooking back at the text, Bol\u00edvar stresses the importance of morals and justice as the bases of law. He says, \"proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\"\n\nSo, it seems like morality and justice are key components for him in a functioning legal system.\n\nOption D directly matches this.\n\nOption A mentions truth and religion, but while he does talk about superstition, it's not presented as a requirement for a legal system. In fact, he seems critical of superstition.\n\nOption B talks about freedom and democracy, but while he mentions liberty, it's more about the practice of justice and morals being the foundation of law, not necessarily democracy.\n\nOption C mentions intelligence and order. He does mention the importance of knowledge and how ignorance leads to being easily manipulated, but he doesn't specifically list intelligence as a requirement for the legal system. Order might be implied, but it's not as directly stated as morality and justice.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: Morality and justice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
