Average inventory is calculated as the sum of the beginning and ending inventories divided by 2:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{ Beginning Inventory } + \\text{ Ending Inventory }}{2} \\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{200,000 + 300,000}{2} = \\frac{500,000}{2} = 250,000 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the inventory turnover:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover} = \\frac{500,000}{250,000} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, Baxter's inventory turnover for the year is 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
