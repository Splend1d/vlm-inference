                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about research on women who have had abortions and what the outcomes are regarding their psychological and emotional well-being. There are four options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct based on current research.\n\nOption A says that subsequent problems in sexual adjustment and in relationships with men are common. Hmm, I've heard that some people believe abortion can lead to relationship issues, but I'm not sure if that's backed by research. I think it's important to look at studies that have been done on this topic.\n\nOption B states that most women who have abortions think no more about the event than they would about having a wisdom tooth removed. This seems a bit dismissive of the emotional aspect of abortion. While some women may feel this way, I doubt that's the case for most. Abortion is a significant life event, and I suspect that many women reflect on it in some way.\n\nOption C says that the psychological consequences are no worse than they are for women who have chosen to continue their pregnancies and give birth. This is an interesting point. Some studies might suggest that the psychological impact of abortion is similar to that of giving birth, especially if we consider the stress and emotional turmoil that can come with parenthood.\n\nOption D claims that the experience frequently has serious psychological consequences, usually in the form of guilt and depression. This is a common belief among certain groups, but again, I need to consider what research actually says.\n\nI recall that there have been many studies on this topic, and sometimes the findings can be conflicting. Some research suggests that abortion can lead to psychological issues, while other studies find no such link or even suggest that carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term can have worse outcomes.\n\nI think the key here is to consider the overall consensus in the scientific community. Mental health professionals and major medical organizations generally agree that while some women may experience emotional distress after an abortion, the majority do not experience serious psychological problems.\n\nIn fact, the American Psychological Association has stated that a single abortion performed on an otherwise unwanted pregnancy does not pose a psychological hazard for most women. They base this on reviews of numerous studies.\n\nSo, considering that, option C seems the most accurate. It suggests that the psychological consequences are no worse than for women who choose to continue their pregnancies. This aligns with the idea that both choices come with their own set of emotional challenges, and neither is inherently more damaging than the other.\n\nOption A seems too broad, implying that problems in sexual adjustment and relationships are common, which isn't supported by the general consensus. Option B might underestimate the emotional significance of abortion for some women, and option D overstates the frequency of serious psychological consequences.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option C: the psychological consequences are no worse than they are for women who have chosen to continue their pregnancies and give birth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
