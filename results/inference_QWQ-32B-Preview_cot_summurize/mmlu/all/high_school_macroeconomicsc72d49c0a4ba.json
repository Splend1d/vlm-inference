                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. So, we have a scenario where $1000 is deposited into a checking account, and as a result, excess reserves increase by $700. We need to find out what the reserve ratio must be based on this information.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the basic concepts here. In banking, when a customer deposits money into a checking account, the bank is required to hold a certain portion of that deposit as reserves. This required portion is determined by the reserve ratio, which is set by the central bank. The reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that banks are required to hold as reserves and not lend out.\n\nSo, if the reserve ratio is, say, 10%, then for every $100 deposited, the bank must hold $10 as reserves and can lend out the remaining $90.\n\nNow, in this question, we have a deposit of $1000, and excess reserves increase by $700. Excess reserves are the reserves that a bank holds beyond what is required by the reserve ratio. So, if a bank has excess reserves, it means that after setting aside the required reserves, it still has some money left over that it's not lending out.\n\nLet's denote the reserve ratio as 'r'. So, the required reserves for the $1000 deposit would be 1000 * r.\n\nThe total reserves that the bank now has would be the required reserves plus the excess reserves. According to the problem, the excess reserves increase by $700, which means that after setting aside the required reserves, the bank has an additional $700 that it's not required to hold.\n\nSo, total reserves = required reserves + excess reserves\n\nGiven that the deposit is $1000, and the excess reserves increase by $700, we can set up the equation:\n\nTotal reserves = 1000 * r + 700\n\nBut wait, actually, the total reserves would be equal to the required reserves plus the excess reserves. However, in this case, since the deposit is $1000, and the bank is holding required reserves of 1000 * r and excess reserves of $700, the total reserves would be 1000 * r + 700.\n\nBut perhaps I need to think about this differently. Maybe I should consider that the increase in deposits leads to an increase in reserves, and part of that increase is required reserves and part is excess reserves.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nWhen a bank receives a deposit of $1000, it must hold a certain amount as required reserves based on the reserve ratio, and any amount beyond that is excess reserves.\n\nSo, required reserves = 1000 * r\n\nExcess reserves = total reserves - required reserves\n\nBut in this case, it's stated that excess reserves increase by $700.\n\nWait, perhaps the bank's reserves increase by the full amount of the deposit, which is $1000, and out of that, $700 is excess reserves.\n\nSo, total increase in reserves = $1000\n\nRequired reserves = 1000 * r\n\nExcess reserves = total reserves - required reserves = 1000 - 1000 * r\n\nBut the problem says that excess reserves increase by $700, so:\n\n1000 - 1000 * r = 700\n\nNow, I can solve for r.\n\n1000 - 1000 * r = 700\n\nSubtract 1000 from both sides:\n\n-1000 * r = 700 - 1000\n\n-1000 * r = -300\n\nNow, divide both sides by -1000:\n\nr = (-300) / (-1000)\n\nr = 0.3\n\nSo, the reserve ratio is 30%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 70%\n\nB. 30%\n\nC. 40%\n\nD. 90%\n\nOption B is 30%, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to look at this.\n\nSometimes in banking, the money multiplier comes into play, which is related to the reserve ratio. The money multiplier is 1 / r, and it shows how much the money supply can increase based on the initial deposit.\n\nBut in this specific question, we're only dealing with the initial deposit and the resulting excess reserves, so I think the approach I took is sufficient.\n\nTo double-check, let's assume the reserve ratio is 30%. Then, for a $1000 deposit, the required reserves would be 1000 * 0.3 = $300.\n\nIf the bank has $1000 in deposits and must hold $300 as required reserves, any additional reserves beyond $300 are excess reserves.\n\nIf the bank's reserves increase by $1000 (from the deposit), and required reserves are $300, then excess reserves would be 1000 - 300 = $700, which matches the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the reserve ratio must be 30%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
