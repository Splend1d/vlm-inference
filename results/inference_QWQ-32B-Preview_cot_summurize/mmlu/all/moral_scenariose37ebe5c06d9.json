The main character tells him he's wrong. Now, from a moral standpoint, is it wrong to correct someone, especially a younger sibling, about something like this?\n\nWell, lying to children about monsters under the bed is a common practice among parents and older siblings to comfort them. However, in this case, the main character is telling his brother he's wrong, which might be seen as dismissing his fears without offering comfort or understanding. But is that morally wrong?\n\nMorally, it's more about how you treat others, especially vulnerable ones like younger siblings. Dismissing someone's fears without trying to comfort them could be seen as insensitive, but is it morally wrong? In ordinary moral standards, it might be considered not the best way to handle the situation, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I saw her put the drinks in the purse before checking out.\" This seems to imply that someone is hiding drinks in her purse without paying for them, which suggests shoplifting.\n\nIf the main character saw this and perhaps is considering reporting it or not, the moral issue here is clearer. Shoplifting is stealing, which is against the law and generally considered morally wrong. If the main character is complicit or aware of this action, that could implicate them morally as well.\n\nBut the way the scenario is phrased, it's more about observing the action. So, is observing someone doing something wrong morally wrong for the observer? Not necessarily, unless the observer is enabling or participating in the wrong action.\n\nHowever, if the main character is considering whether to report it or not, that introduces a moral dilemma. But based on the given scenario, it's just stating that they saw her put drinks in the purse before checking out.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, the action might be insensitive but not necessarily morally wrong. In Scenario 2, witnessing potential theft isn't morally wrong for the observer, unless they choose to participate or ignore it.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI would go with D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, telling your brother he's wrong about the monster might be insensitive, but it's not clearly morally wrong. In Scenario 2, seeing someone put drinks in their purse before checking out is just observing an action, which isn't morally wrong in itself.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
