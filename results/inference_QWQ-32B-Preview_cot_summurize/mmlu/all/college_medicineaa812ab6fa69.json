That must be pretty tough for him, especially since calculus is a big part of engineering. Now, the question is, which response shows that he's likely to do better on future exams. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. He decides that the first test is always harder than the others.\n\nWell, sometimes the first test can be tougher, but assuming that without knowing is maybe not the best approach. It might give him a false sense of security for the next tests. So, maybe not the best sign for improvement.\n\nB. He says the teacher graded his exam harder because she doesn\u2019t like him.\n\nBlaming the teacher for the grade doesn't seem productive. It doesn't address his own performance or what he can do to improve. In fact, it might even create animosity towards the teacher, which could affect his performance in class. This doesn't suggest he's likely to improve.\n\nC. He says it was due to some home circumstances that won\u2019t be present during the next exam.\n\nIf there were indeed special circumstances affecting his performance, and those won't happen again, then maybe his performance will improve. But this relies on external factors rather than any change in his own approach or effort. It's possible he might do better, but it's not necessarily because he's doing something different.\n\nD. He critiques his study methods and tries to find out which led to poor returns.\n\nThis seems like a really positive response. By analyzing his study methods and identifying what wasn't working, he's taking active steps to improve. This shows self-reflection and a willingness to adapt his strategies, which are key to improvement.\n\nComparing all these, option D seems to indicate the highest likelihood of improvement because it shows that Tyler is taking responsibility for his learning and is proactively trying to fix what wasn't working. The other options either blame external factors or make assumptions without taking personal action.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
