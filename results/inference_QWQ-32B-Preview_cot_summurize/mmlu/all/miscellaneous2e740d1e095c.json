I know that nominal GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy in current prices, but real GDP adjusts for inflation. So, I think real GDP is somehow related to nominal GDP adjusted by a price index.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. money supply - that's the total amount of money in circulation, right? I don't think that's used to calculate real GDP.\n\nB. unemployment rate - that's the percentage of the labor force that's without work but available for work. Doesn't seem relevant to calculating real GDP.\n\nC. government's budget deficit - that's the difference between government spending and revenue. Again, not directly related to GDP calculation.\n\nD. GDP deflator - I think this is a price index that measures the level of prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy. This sounds like it could be used to adjust nominal GDP to get real GDP.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is D. GDP deflator. Real GDP is nominal GDP divided by the GDP deflator, multiplied by 100 to adjust for price changes.\n\nWait, actually, I think the formula is real GDP equals nominal GDP divided by the GDP deflator, times 100. Yeah, that makes sense because the GDP deflator is a measure of price level, so dividing nominal GDP by that and multiplying by 100 would give you the constant dollar value.\n\nLet me double-check. If the GDP deflator is 110, that means prices have increased by 10% since the base year. So, to find the real GDP, which is in base year prices, I would divide the nominal GDP by 110 and multiply by 100.\n\nFor example, if nominal GDP is 1100 and the deflator is 110, then real GDP would be (1100 / 110) * 100 = 1000. That makes sense because it's adjusting for the 10% inflation.\n\nSo, yes, real GDP is calculated by dividing nominal GDP by the GDP deflator and multiplying by 100.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. GDP deflator.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
