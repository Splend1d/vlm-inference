                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about goal-setting theory. So, motivation is indeed a complex process, and goal-setting theory is one way to understand how goals influence our behavior and motivation. The question presents four statements and asks which one is incorrect based on goal-setting theory.\n\nFirst, let's recall what goal-setting theory is all about. It's a motivational theory that suggests that setting specific and challenging goals can lead to better performance. The theory emphasizes that goals direct attention and effort, increase persistence, and encourage the development of task strategies.\n\nOption A says: \"goals serve two purposes: they are a basis for motivation and they direct behaviors.\" This sounds accurate. Goals do motivate us by providing a target to aim for, and they also direct our behaviors by guiding our actions towards achieving those targets.\n\nOption B states: \"goal attainment is maximized when goals are specific and highly difficult.\" Hmm, this seems familiar. In goal-setting theory, specificity and difficulty of goals are indeed important factors. Specific goals are clearer and provide a precise target, which can enhance performance. Difficult goals are thought to lead to higher performance because they challenge individuals to exert more effort. However, there might be a catch here regarding how difficult the goals are.\n\nOption C says: \"goal attainment is maximized when frequent feedback is given.\" Feedback is a crucial component of goal-setting theory. It allows individuals to monitor their progress, make adjustments if necessary, and stay on track to achieve their goals. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption D: \"worker participation in goal-setting is also good.\" Yes, involving workers in the goal-setting process can increase their commitment and buy-in, which in turn can enhance motivation and performance.\n\nNow, looking back at option B, it says that goal attainment is maximized when goals are specific and highly difficult. While specificity is definitely beneficial, the term \"highly difficult\" might be a bit misleading. In goal-setting theory, goals that are challenging but attainable are optimal. If goals are too difficult, to the point of being unattainable, they can lead to frustration and decreased motivation. Therefore, the correct phrasing should be that goals should be specific and challenging, but not necessarily highly difficult to the point of being unrealistic.\n\nSo, I think the incorrect statement is option B, because it doesn't account for the attainability of the goals. Goals should be challenging, but also achievable with effort and commitment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
