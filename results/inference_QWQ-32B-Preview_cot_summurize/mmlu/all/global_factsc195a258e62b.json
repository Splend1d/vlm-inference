However, the question specifies children between the ages of 5-14. According to the ILO's 2013 report titled \"Marking progress against child labour: Global estimates and trends 2000-2012,\" there were about 98 million children aged 5-14 in child labor globally in 2012.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 5 million\n\nB. 30 million\n\nC. 150 million\n\nD. 500 million\n\nNone of these options exactly match the reported figure of approximately 98 million for children aged 5-14 in 2012. However, option C states \"150 million,\" which is closest to the actual number among the given choices, although it significantly overestimates the figure for that age group.\n\nIt's important to note that the total number of child laborers aged 5-17 was around 168 million in 2012, and the number for ages 5-14 was lower, at about 98 million. If the question intended to refer to all child laborers aged 5-17, then none of the options accurately represent the total. But based on the age range specified (5-14), the closest option is C. 150 million, though it is not precise.\n\nFor reference, here's a breakdown from the ILO report:\n\n- Ages 5-11: 45.7 million\n\n- Ages 12-14: 52.1 million\n\n- Total ages 5-14: approximately 98 million\n\n- Ages 15-17: around 70 million\n\n- Total ages 5-17: approximately 168 million\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer based on the options provided would be C. 150 million, acknowledging that it is an approximation and not the exact figure.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nInternational Labour Organization.
