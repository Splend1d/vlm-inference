The options are A. 1:3, B. 1:4, C. 1:6, and D. 1:9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities by division. So, in this case, the ratio of pears to apples is the number of pears divided by the number of apples.\n\nSimon used 3 pears and 9 apples. So, the ratio is 3 to 9. I can write this as 3:9 or as a fraction 3/9.\n\nI know that ratios can be simplified, just like fractions. To simplify 3:9, I can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.\n\n3 \u00f7 3 = 1\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\nSo, the simplified ratio is 1:3.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 1:3, B is 1:4, C is 1:6, and D is 1:9.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. 1:3.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of pears to apples in the fruit salad. I have 3 pears and 9 apples, which is indeed 1:3 when simplified.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes ratios can be expressed in different ways, but in this context, it's straightforward.\n\nI don't think I need to consider the total number of fruits or anything else; the question specifically asks for the ratio of pears to apples.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is A. 1:3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
