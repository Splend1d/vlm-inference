The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business.\"\n\u2014The New York Times, October 15, 1905\nWhich of the following groups would have most likely supported the scenario described in this passage?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see what this passage is saying. It talks about how economic necessity has forced women out of their homes and into the world of business, and because of that, they now eat in public places without men. It also mentions that this has created a new phase in the restaurant business. So, it's about women entering the workforce and changing social norms.\n\nNow, the question is asking which group would most likely support this scenario. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Ku Klux Klan.\n\nI know that the Ku Klux Klan is a racist organization that also has attitudes against women's rights. They are known for their white supremacist views and have historically opposed equality for women and minorities. So, they probably wouldn't support women entering the workforce and changing traditional gender roles.\n\nB. American Temperance Union.\n\nThis group was focused on promoting abstinence from alcohol and later played a role in the prohibition movement. While they might have had some views on women's roles, their main focus was on temperance. It's not clear that they would necessarily support women working outside the home or eating in public unescorted by men. In fact, some temperance movements were associated with traditional gender roles.\n\nC. National Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nThis organization was founded to achieve women's suffrage, meaning the right to vote. They were advocates for women's rights and equality. Given that, they would likely support women entering the workforce and participating more fully in public life, including eating in public without male accompaniment.\n\nD. Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\n\nThis group was prominent in the Civil Rights Movement, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, fighting for racial equality. While they advocated for civil rights, their primary focus was on racial issues rather than women's roles in society. Although they supported overall equality, their main agenda was geared towards ending racial discrimination.\n\nConsidering these options, the group that would most likely support the scenario described in the passage is the National Woman Suffrage Association. They were dedicated to women's rights and equality, which aligns with the changes mentioned in the passage.\n\nSo, the answer is C. National Woman Suffrage Association.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
