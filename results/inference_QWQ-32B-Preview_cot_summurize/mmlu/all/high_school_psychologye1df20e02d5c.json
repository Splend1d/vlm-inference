                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says, \"Mechanical energy is transduced to electrochemical energy by...\" and then gives four options: glandular effectors, muscular effectors, pressure receptors, and rods and cones.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what transduction means in this context. Transduction is the process of converting one form of energy into another. So here, it's about changing mechanical energy into electrochemical energy.\n\nNow, let's think about each option:\n\nA. Glandular effectors: Glands are parts of the body that secrete substances, like hormones or enzymes. I don't think they directly convert mechanical energy into electrochemical energy. They might respond to chemical signals, but I don't recall them being involved in energy transduction in this way.\n\nB. Muscular effectors: Muscles are responsible for movement and generate mechanical force. They do use electrochemical signals to contract, but in this case, they're converting electrochemical energy into mechanical energy, not the other way around. So, this seems backwards.\n\nC. Pressure receptors: These are sensory receptors that respond to pressure or mechanical stimulation. They're found in the skin, joints, and internal organs. When they're deformed by pressure, they generate electrical signals that the nervous system can interpret. This sounds like they're converting mechanical energy into electrochemical energy, which is what the question is asking for.\n\nD. Rods and cones: These are photoreceptor cells in the retina that detect light and convert it into electrochemical signals for the brain. So, they transduce light energy into electrochemical energy, not mechanical energy.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it seems like pressure receptors are the most likely answer. They directly convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, which is the definition of transduction from mechanical to electrochemical energy.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the roles of each option again:\n\n- Glandular effectors: More about secretion in response to signals, not about energy transduction.\n\n- Muscular effectors: Convert electrochemical signals into mechanical movement.\n\n- Pressure receptors: Convert mechanical pressure into electrochemical signals.\n\n- Rods and cones: Convert light into electrochemical signals.\n\nSo, pressure receptors are the ones that fit the description in the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
