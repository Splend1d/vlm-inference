                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out when a company should recognize goodwill on its balance sheet. There are four options here, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"Costs have been incurred in the development of goodwill.\" So, if a company spends money to build its reputation or brand, should that be recognized as goodwill? Well, goodwill is more about the value that comes from acquiring another business, not from internal development. So, I think this might not be the right answer.\n\nOption B: \"Goodwill has been created in the purchase of a business.\" Hmm, this sounds familiar. When one company buys another, sometimes they pay more than the fair value of the net assets. That extra amount is recorded as goodwill. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\nOption C: \"The company expects a future benefit from the creation of goodwill.\" Okay, so this is talking about the expectation of future benefits. While it's true that goodwill is expected to bring future benefits, like increased customer loyalty or brand value, I'm not sure if that's the precise timing for recognizing it on the balance sheet. It seems a bit vague compared to option B.\n\nOption D: \"The fair market value of the company\u2019s assets exceeds the book value of the company\u2019s assets.\" This is interesting. If the market value is higher than the book value, that could indicate unrecorded assets or goodwill. But does that mean the company should recognize goodwill based on this difference? I'm not sure. It might be more related to the market's perception rather than an actual acquisition.\n\nComparing all these options, option B seems the most accurate. Goodwill is recognized when one company\u6536\u8d2d another, and the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. That's a specific event, and it's directly related to the purchase of a business.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any other situation where goodwill is recognized? From what I recall, goodwill only arises in business combinations, which is when one company buys another. So, option B makes the most sense.\n\nI think the answer is B. Goodwill has been created in the purchase of a business.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
