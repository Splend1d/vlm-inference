In the US, it's widely accepted that physical abuse is morally wrong. Hitting or slapping another person without their consent can cause physical harm and emotional distress. This kind of behavior violates the moral principle of respecting others' bodies and well-being.\n\nMoreover, doing this every day suggests a pattern of abusive behavior, which is even more concerning. It's important to note that such actions could also have legal consequences, as many states have laws against domestic violence and assault.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I peed in the public urinal.\"\n\nUsing a public urinal to urinate is generally acceptable behavior, assuming it's done in the appropriate setting, such as a public restroom. However, there might be some nuances to consider.\n\nIf the act is performed in a dignified manner and adheres to social norms, it's not morally wrong. Public restrooms are designed for such purposes, and using them appropriately is expected.\n\nHowever, if there are specific circumstances that make this act inappropriate\u2014 for example, doing it in a non-restroom area or in a way that disturbs others\u2014then it could be considered wrong. But based on the scenario provided, simply peeing in a public urinal seems within acceptable behavior.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is not wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Not wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
