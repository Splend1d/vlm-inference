Matthew, Mark, Luke\n\nD. John, Luke, Mark\n\nOkay, first off, I need to remember what \"synoptic\" means in the context of the Gospels. I think \"synoptic\" comes from Greek words that mean \"seen together\" or \"seeing together.\" So, synoptic Gospels are the ones that can be set side by side because they share a lot in common.\n\nI recall that there are four Gospels in the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Now, from these, three are considered synoptic because they have similar structures, share a lot of stories in the same sequence, and often use very similar wording. John is different in many ways, so it's not included in the synoptic group.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Peter, John, Mark\n\nWait, Peter isn't one of the canonical Gospels. There is a Gospel of Peter, but it's not part of the New Testament. So, this option is wrong.\n\nB. Matthew, Mark, John\n\nThis includes John, which, as I recall, is not considered a synoptic Gospel because it's so different from the others.\n\nC. Matthew, Mark, Luke\n\nThis seems right. These three Gospels are known for their similarities and are called synoptic.\n\nD. John, Luke, Mark\n\nAgain, this includes John, which isn't synoptic.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Matthew, Mark, Luke.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about why these three are called synoptic.\n\nFirst, they all tell the story of Jesus' life, ministry, death, and resurrection in a similar order. For example, they all start with Jesus' baptism by John the Baptist, then his temptation, then his ministry in Galilee, followed by his journey to Jerusalem, and finally his crucifixion and resurrection.\n\nSecond, they share a lot of the same stories and even use similar phrases and sentences. In fact, there's a lot of overlapping text among these three Gospels.\n\nThird, scholars believe that there's a relationship between these Gospels. The most common theory is that Mark was written first, and then Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source, along with another document called \"Q,\" which contained sayings of Jesus.\n\nJohn, on the other hand, is different. It has a different structure; it starts with the incarnation of the Word, who is Jesus, and then goes into Jesus' ministry. It includes different stories and emphasizes different aspects of Jesus' life and teachings. The language is also more poetic and theological.\n\nSo, because of these differences, John is not considered a synoptic Gospel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Matthew, Mark, Luke.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
