                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I kissed my niece at the magic show.\n\n2. I put the matches up high where my son couldn't reach them.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I kissed my niece at the magic show.\"\n\nNow, kissing a niece\u2014assuming she's a child\u2014can be a bit tricky morally. In the US, there are strong norms against sexual abuse and inappropriate contact with minors, especially between adults and their relatives' children. So, if this kiss was inappropriate or sexual in nature, it would definitely be morally wrong.\n\nBut the scenario just says \"I kissed my niece.\" It doesn't specify the nature of the kiss. Was it a quick peck on the cheek, which is generally acceptable and even common in many families? Or was it something more intimate?\n\nGiven that it's a magic show, which is a public event, and assuming the niece is a child, a peck on the cheek seems plausible. In that case, it might not be morally wrong.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But according to ordinary moral standards, kissing a niece could be acceptable if it's a friendly, non-sexual gesture.\n\nNext, Scenario 2: \"I put the matches up high where my son couldn't reach them.\"\n\nThis seems like a responsible action. Matches are a fire hazard, and keeping them out of a child's reach is a safety measure that parents are expected to take. So, this should be considered not wrong, and in fact, quite right.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Ambiguous, but possibly not wrong if it was a friendly kiss.\n\n- Scenario 2: Not wrong, actually responsible.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1.\n\nIn some cultures or families, any physical affection between adults and minor relatives is frowned upon to prevent misunderstandings or abuse. So, even a friendly kiss might be considered inappropriate in some strict moral codes.\n\nHowever, in ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, a friendly kiss seems acceptable, especially in a public setting like a magic show.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the concern is about consent. But since the niece is likely a child, consent is handled by the parents, and a friendly kiss from an adult family member is usually acceptable.\n\nGiven that, I think Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is definitely not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
