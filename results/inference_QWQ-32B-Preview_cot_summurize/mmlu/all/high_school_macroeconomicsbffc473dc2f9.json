                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics question. So, we've got the economy at full employment, and wages and prices are flexible. Then, there's a decline in aggregate demand, and we need to see how this affects GDP and the price level in both the short run and the long run. The options are a bit confusing, so I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what full employment means. Full employment is when all the available labor resources are being used efficiently, and unemployment is only due to frictional or structural reasons, not cyclical unemployment. So, in this state, the economy is producing at its potential GDP.\n\nNow, aggregate demand (AD) is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time. If AD declines, that means people are demanding less of those goods and services at each price level.\n\nSince wages and prices are flexible, the economy can adjust over time. Let's think about what happens in the short run and then in the long run.\n\n**Short Run:**\n\nIn the short run, when AD declines, the AD curve shifts to the left. At the initial price level, there's now less demand for goods and services, so firms might start to lower their prices to sell what they have. This means the price level falls.\n\nWith lower prices, firms might see their revenues decrease, which could lead them to produce less and maybe even lay off workers. So, GDP would fall because there's less production.\n\nBut wait, the question says wages and prices are flexible. So, if prices fall, and wages are also flexible, wages might adjust downward as well. Lower wages could make production cheaper for firms, which might encourage them to produce more. However, if AD has fallen, even with lower wages, if there's less demand, firms might not increase production.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe I should think about the AD-AS model.\n\nIn the short run, with AD decreasing, and assuming short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) is upward sloping, the leftward shift of AD would lead to a new equilibrium with lower GDP and lower price level.\n\nSo, in the short run, both GDP and the price level fall.\n\n**Long Run:**\n\nIn the long run, wages and prices are fully flexible, so the economy should move back to its full employment level, which is potential GDP. But, with AD having declined, how does this play out?\n\nIf wages and prices are flexible, and the economy was initially at full employment, a decline in AD would lead to excess capacity and unemployment. This would put downward pressure on wages and prices. As wages fall, the cost of production decreases, which shifts the SRAS curve to the right.\n\nThis rightward shift of SRAS would help to increase GDP and lower the price level further.\n\nBut, since AD has declined, the new equilibrium might still have a lower price level, but GDP could return to its potential level.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory to option D, which says falls in the short run for both GDP and price level, but in the long run, GDP doesn't change, and the price level falls.\n\nLet me see: if AD declines, in the short run, GDP and prices fall. Then, in the long run, with flexible wages and prices, the economy adjusts. Lower wages shift SRAS to the right, which increases GDP and lowers prices further.\n\nHowever, if AD has declined, even with lower wages, if there's less demand, firms might not produce as much as before. So, maybe GDP doesn't fully return to its potential level.\n\nBut the question assumes flexible wages and prices, and in the long run, the economy should reach full employment again.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the long-run aggregate supply curve (LRAS), which is vertical at the potential GDP level.\n\nSo, in the long run, the economy will be back at the LRAS, which is at potential GDP, regardless of the AD, assuming flexible prices and wages.\n\nBut if AD has declined, and the economy is at LRAS, does that mean the price level has adjusted such that AD equals SRAS equals LRAS at potential GDP?\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at it differently.\n\nLet's consider that in the long run, with flexible prices and wages, the economy always returns to potential GDP, and the price level adjusts accordingly.\n\nSo, if AD declines, in the long run, the price level will be lower, but GDP will be at potential.\n\nThat seems to align with option A: in the short run, both GDP and price level fall, and in the long run, GDP doesn't change (stays at potential), and the price level continues to fall.\n\nWait, but option A says \"no change\" in long-run GDP, which could imply staying at potential GDP.\n\nSimilarly, option D says no change in long-run GDP and no change in the price level.\n\nBut according to my reasoning, in the long run, GDP stays at potential, but the price level is lower compared to before the AD decline.\n\nSo, perhaps \"no change\" in long-run GDP means staying at potential, and \"falls\" in the price level means the price level is lower than before.\n\nBut option D says falls in short-run GDP and price level, and no change in long-run GDP and price level.\n\nThat seems inconsistent with my understanding.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that in the long run, after adjustments, GDP is back to potential, and the price level is lower.\n\nBut option D says no change in long-run price level, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps \"no change\" in long-run GDP means staying at potential, and \"no change\" in price level means that after adjustments, the price level stabilizes at a new lower level, so there's no further change.\n\nBut that seems a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the long run, after all adjustments, both GDP and price level remain stable at their new levels.\n\nBut according to the AD-AS model, in the long run, with flexible prices and wages, the economy should be at potential GDP, but with a lower price level if AD has declined.\n\nThis makes me think that option A is the correct one: in the short run, both GDP and price level fall, and in the long run, GDP returns to its potential level, and the price level is lower.\n\nBut option A says \"no change\" in long-run GDP, which could mean staying at potential, and \"falls\" in long-run price level, which aligns with my understanding.\n\nOption D says \"no change\" in long-run GDP and \"no change\" in long-run price level, which doesn't make sense to me in this context.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
