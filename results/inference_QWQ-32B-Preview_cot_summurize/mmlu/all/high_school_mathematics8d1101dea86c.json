                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two species of ants, Species A and Species B, and they grow differently over time. Species A doubles every day, and Species B triples every day. On Day 0, there are 30 ants in total, and on Day 5, there are 3281 ants. We need to find out how many of those 3281 ants are of Species A.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s say that on Day 0, there are \\(a\\) ants of Species A and \\(b\\) ants of Species B. So, we have:\n\n\\[a + b = 30\\]\n\nNow, since Species A doubles every day, the number of Species A ants on Day 5 will be \\(a \\times 2^5\\), because it doubles for 5 days. Similarly, Species B triples every day, so the number of Species B ants on Day 5 will be \\(b \\times 3^5\\).\n\nGiven that the total number of ants on Day 5 is 3281, we can write:\n\n\\[a \\times 2^5 + b \\times 3^5 = 3281\\]\n\nLet's calculate \\(2^5\\) and \\(3^5\\):\n\n\\[2^5 = 32\\]\\[3^5 = 243\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[32a + 243b = 3281\\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\(a + b = 30\\)\n\n2. \\(32a + 243b = 3281\\)\n\nWe can solve this system to find the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\(a\\):\n\n\\[a = 30 - b\\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\(a\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[32(30 - b) + 243b = 3281\\]\n\nLet's distribute the 32:\n\n\\[960 - 32b + 243b = 3281\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[960 + 211b = 3281\\]\n\nSubtract 960 from both sides:\n\n\\[211b = 2321\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 211:\n\n\\[b = \\frac{2321}{211} = 11\\]\n\nSo, there are 11 ants of Species B on Day 0.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for \\(a\\):\n\n\\[a = 30 - 11 = 19\\]\n\nTherefore, on Day 0, there are 19 ants of Species A and 11 ants of Species B.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many ants of Species A there are on Day 5. Since Species A doubles every day, on Day 5, the number of Species A ants will be:\n\n\\[a \\times 2^5 = 19 \\times 32 = 608\\]\n\nSo, the number of Species A ants on Day 5 is 608.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check our calculations to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, we had:\n\n\\[a + b = 30\\]\\[32a + 243b = 3281\\]\n\nWe solved for \\(a = 30 - b\\), and substituted:\n\n\\[32(30 - b) + 243b = 3281\\]\\[960 - 32b + 243b = 3281\\]\\[960 + 211b = 3281\\]\\[211b = 2321\\]\\[b = 11\\]\n\nThen, \\(a = 19\\), and \\(19 \\times 32 = 608\\).\n\nEverything seems correct. Therefore, the number of Species A ants on Day 5 is 608.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 608, which matches our answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{608} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
