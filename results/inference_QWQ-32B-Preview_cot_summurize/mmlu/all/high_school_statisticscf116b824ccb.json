                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the relationship between studying time and grades on a final exam. The equation given is Grade = 50.25 + 10.2(h), where h is the number of hours studied. The question is asking how a student\u2019s grade will be affected if she studies for two hours, and there are a few options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this equation is telling me. It seems like a linear equation where the grade is dependent on the number of hours studied. The 50.25 is a starting point, maybe like a base grade, and then for every hour studied, the grade increases by 10.2 points.\n\nSo, if a student studies for two hours, I need to plug h = 2 into the equation to find out the grade.\n\nLet me do that:\n\nGrade = 50.25 + 10.2*(2)\n\nFirst, multiply 10.2 by 2:\n\n10.2 * 2 = 20.4\n\nThen add that to 50.25:\n\n50.25 + 20.4 = 70.65\n\nSo, if a student studies for two hours, their grade would be 70.65.\n\nBut the question is asking how the grade will be affected, not what the exact grade is. I think it wants to know the change in grade compared to studying zero hours.\n\nSo, if h = 0:\n\nGrade = 50.25 + 10.2*(0) = 50.25 + 0 = 50.25\n\nAnd for h = 2:\n\nGrade = 70.65\n\nTherefore, the increase in grade is 70.65 - 50.25 = 20.4 points.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Her grade will go up by 40.05 points.\n\nB. Her grade will go up by 20.4 points.\n\nC. Her grade will remain unchanged.\n\nD. Her grade will down by 10.2 points.\n\nOption B seems to match the calculation I just did. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see the coefficient of h, which is 10.2. This means for every hour studied, the grade increases by 10.2 points. So, for two hours, it should be 2 * 10.2 = 20.4 points increase.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any other factor or if I'm interpreting the question correctly.\n\nThe question says \"how a student\u2019s grade will be affected if she studies for two hours.\" It doesn't specify compared to not studying at all, but given the options, it seems to be comparing studying two hours to studying zero hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the total grade, but the options are all about the change in grade.\n\nOption A, 40.05, is perhaps if someone misapplied the equation, like doing 2 * (50.25 + 10.2), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C suggests no change, which would be wrong because the grade does increase with studying hours based on the equation.\n\nOption D suggests a decrease, but the coefficient is positive, so studying more should increase the grade.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B, a increase of 20.4 points.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the equation is Grade = 50.25 + 10.2h, and h is in hours.\n\nIf h = 2, Grade = 50.25 + 20.4 = 70.65\n\nIf h = 0, Grade = 50.25\n\nDifference: 70.65 - 50.25 = 20.4\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking about the effect of studying two hours, and someone might think that it's per hour, but no, the coefficient is already per hour.\n\nSo, studying two hours would be twice the coefficient.\n\nI think I'm confident with option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
