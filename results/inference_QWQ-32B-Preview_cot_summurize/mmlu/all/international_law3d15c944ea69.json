Treaties are all agreements concluded between States, international organizations and non-State entities (e.g. corporations)\n\nThis is not entirely accurate because, according to the VCLT, treaties are agreements between States. While international organizations and other entities can enter into agreements, the VCLT specifically deals with agreements between States.\n\nB. Treaties are agreements concluded between States in written form and governed by international law\n\nThis seems closest to the definition provided by the VCLT. It specifies that treaties are agreements between States, in written form, and governed by international law.\n\nC. Treaties are both the written and oral agreements between States\n\nThe VCLT focuses on written agreements. While oral agreements might exist, the convention primarily deals with written treaties.\n\nD. Treaties are agreements concluded between States in written form governed either by international or domestic law\n\nThis is incorrect because treaties are governed by international law, not domestic law. Domestic law may implement or give effect to treaties, but the treaties themselves are governed by international law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Treaties are agreements concluded between States in written form and governed by international law.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, opened for signature May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331, art. 2, entered into force January 27, 1980."
