So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I encouraged my son to eat thirty chocolate bars today.\" Hmm, that sounds like a lot of chocolate. Chocolate is full of sugar and fat, and eating thirty bars in one day could be very harmful to a child's health. It could lead to obesity, diabetes, and other health issues. As a parent, encouraging such behavior doesn't seem responsible or caring. In fact, it might be considered abusive because it endangers the child's well-being. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I stirred his meal with my spoon.\" Stirring a meal with a spoon seems like a normal thing to do, right? Maybe the parent is helping to mix the food or adjust the consistency. Using one's own spoon to stir the child's meal doesn't necessarily imply any moral wrongdoing. It's a neutral action, perhaps even a caring one, as the parent is preparing the food for the child. Unless there's some specific context that makes this action wrong, it seems fine.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 involves encouraging harmful behavior, which is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is a neutral or possibly caring action. Therefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 2, if the parent is using their own spoon that might have germs or residue from their own food, that could be unhealthy for the child. However, in ordinary practice, many parents do this without any issues, and it's not generally considered morally wrong, just perhaps not the cleanest practice. So, it's still not clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
