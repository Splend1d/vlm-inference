It's asking about a specific situation where one state wants to annex a territory that has a population ethnically related to its own, but that territory is currently controlled by another state. The options are nationalism, resource dispute, irredentism, and positional dispute. I need to pick the most appropriate term for this scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nNationalism is a political ideology that focuses on the interests of a particular nation, often emphasizing national identity and culture. It can lead to a desire to unite all people of the same nationality under one state, but it's more broad than just annexing a specific territory.\n\nA resource dispute is when states conflict over natural resources, like oil, water, or minerals. That doesn't seem to fit here because the question is about annexing a territory based on ethnic relations, not resources.\n\nIrredentism is the idea that a country has a right to reclaim and annex territories that it considers part of its \"natural\" or \"historic\" boundaries, often based on ethnic or cultural ties. This sounds a lot like the situation described in the question.\n\nA positional dispute might refer to a conflict over territorial boundaries or strategic locations, but it's not a standard term in international relations like the others. Maybe it's similar to a border dispute, but again, the focus here is on ethnic relations.\n\nGiven these definitions, irredentism seems to be the most fitting term for the situation described. It specifically involves the desire to annex territories based on ethnic or cultural ties.\n\nTo confirm, let's think of some historical examples. For instance, Italy's annexation of Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol from Austria after World War I was an irredentist move because it was based on the ethnic Italian population in that region. Similarly, Germany's annexation of the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in 1938 was justified on irredentist grounds, claiming to protect German-speaking populations.\n\nIn both cases, the annexation was driven by the desire to incorporate territories with ethnically related populations under the control of the \"mother\" state.\n\nNationalism could be a motivating factor behind irredentism, but it's not specific enough to describe the exact situation of annexing a territory with an ethnically related population.\n\nResource disputes are about material interests, not ethnic ties.\n\nPositional disputes seem more about strategic locations or borders, not necessarily about ethnicity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Irredentism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
