When developing a new training program for a large company, it's important to first understand what the company needs and what skills or knowledge the employees lack. A needs analysis helps identify these gaps and determines what the training should focus on.\n\nOption B, job evaluation, seems related but it's more about assessing the worth of a job within the organization, which might not directly relate to training needs.\n\nSummative evaluation (option C) is usually done after the training to assess its overall effectiveness, not before developing it.\n\nFormative evaluation (option D) is conducted during the development process to improve the training, but I think needs analysis comes before that, to define what needs to be evaluated in the first place.\n\nSo, I believe needs analysis is the first step.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
