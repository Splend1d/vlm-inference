                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem about a shrinking planet. Let's see what it's asking. I'm standing on the surface of a planet, and it shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter, but its mass stays the same. I need to find out how my weight would change in this scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how weight is calculated. Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity, and it's given by the formula:\n\n\\[w = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant,\n\n- \\(M\\) is the mass of the planet,\n\n- \\(m\\) is my mass,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the radius of the planet.\n\nSo, weight is inversely proportional to the square of the radius of the planet.\n\nNow, in this problem, the planet's diameter shrinks to one-tenth of its original size. Since diameter is twice the radius, if the diameter is reduced to one-tenth, the radius is also reduced to one-tenth of its original size. So, the new radius \\(r'\\) is:\n\n\\[r' = \\frac{r}{10}\\]\n\nNow, let's plug this into the weight formula to see how weight changes.\n\nThe new weight \\(w'\\) would be:\n\n\\[w' = \\frac{GMm}{(r')^2} = \\frac{GMm}{\\left(\\frac{r}{10}\\right)^2} = \\frac{GMm}{\\frac{r^2}{100}} = 100 \\times \\frac{GMm}{r^2} = 100w\\]\n\nSo, the new weight is 100 times the original weight.\n\nWait a minute, that seems counterintuitive. If the planet is shrinking, you'd think that the gravity might get stronger, but 100 times seems like a lot. Let me double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the relationship between diameter and radius. Diameter \\(d = 2r\\), so if the diameter is reduced to one-tenth, \\(d' = \\frac{d}{10}\\), then \\(r' = \\frac{d'}{2} = \\frac{d}{20}\\). But originally, \\(r = \\frac{d}{2}\\), so \\(r' = \\frac{r}{10}\\), which matches what I had before.\n\nSo, plugging back into the weight formula:\n\n\\[w' = \\frac{GMm}{(r')^2} = \\frac{GMm}{\\left(\\frac{r}{10}\\right)^2} = \\frac{GMm}{\\frac{r^2}{100}} = 100 \\times \\frac{GMm}{r^2} = 100w\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, you would weigh 100 times as much on the shrunken planet.\n\nBut, let me think about this in terms of gravitational acceleration, \\(g\\), which is given by:\n\n\\[g = \\frac{GM}{r^2}\\]\n\nSo, weight \\(w = mg\\).\n\nIf the radius is reduced to \\(r' = \\frac{r}{10}\\), then the new gravitational acceleration \\(g'\\) is:\n\n\\[g' = \\frac{GM}{(r')^2} = \\frac{GM}{\\left(\\frac{r}{10}\\right)^2} = \\frac{GM}{\\frac{r^2}{100}} = 100 \\times \\frac{GM}{r^2} = 100g\\]\n\nTherefore, the weight would be:\n\n\\[w' = m g' = m \\times 100g = 100w\\]\n\nAgain, this confirms that the weight increases by a factor of 100.\n\nMaybe I can approach this differently to confirm. Let's think about the relationship between weight and radius.\n\nSince \\(w \\propto \\frac{1}{r^2}\\), if \\(r\\) is reduced to \\(\\frac{r}{10}\\), then \\(w\\) should be multiplied by \\(\\left(\\frac{r}{r'}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{r}{\\frac{r}{10}}\\right)^2 = (10)^2 = 100\\).\n\nSo, again, the weight increases by 100 times.\n\nAlternatively, consider that gravity follows the inverse-square law with respect to distance from the center of mass. So, halving the radius would quadruple the gravity, reducing the radius by a factor of three would increase gravity by a factor of nine, and so on. Therefore, reducing the radius by a factor of ten should increase gravity by a factor of 100.\n\nThis seems consistent across different approaches.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. For example, is there any effect due to the planet's density changing, or its internal structure? The problem says the mass remains the same, so density would increase as volume decreases, but in the formula for weight, only mass and radius matter, not density.\n\nSo, as long as mass remains constant and the radius is reduced to one-tenth, the weight should increase by a factor of 100.\n\nWait, but in reality, if a planet shrinks significantly, there might be physical constraints or changes in its composition that could affect gravity, but I think for the purposes of this problem, we can ignore those complexities and stick to the basic gravitational formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 100 times as much.\n\nBut let's look back at the options:\n\nA. 1/100 as much\n\nB. 10 times as much\n\nC. 100 times as much\n\nD. 1000 times as much\n\nSo, C is the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A, 1/100 as much, would be the case if the radius increased by a factor of 10, since \\(w \\propto \\frac{1}{r^2}\\). But in this problem, the radius is decreasing, so weight should increase, not decrease.\n\nOption B, 10 times as much, would be the case if the radius was reduced by a factor of \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), but that's not the case here.\n\nOption D, 1000 times as much, would require an even greater reduction in radius, which isn't the case here.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is C. 100 times as much.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
