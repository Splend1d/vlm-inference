War of 1812.\n\nTo provide some context, Francis Scott Key was a lawyer and amateur poet who witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor by British ships during the war. The fort withstood the attack, and in the dawn's early light, Key saw the American flag still flying, which inspired him to write the poem that later became the national anthem of the United States.\n\nThe War of 1812 was fought between the United States and the British Empire, primarily over issues of trade restrictions and British support for Native American tribes against American expansion. The war also had significant implications for the development of American national identity and pride."
