Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.\nGhana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, addressing the Organization of African Unity, 1963\nThe speaker in the passage above is espousing which of the following causes?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Kwame Nkrumah, who was the president of Ghana, and he's speaking at the Organization of African Unity in 1963. He's talking about unity among African states and how political independence isn't enough to overcome the problems left by colonial rule. He's asking which African country can say they've fully harnessed their financial structures, banking institutions, material resources, and human energies for their own development and national aspirations. He also mentions that they need a union based on common purpose, planning, and endeavor to contribute to world peace.\n\nNow, the question is asking which cause the speaker is espousing: nationalism, socialism, pan-Africanism, or neocolonialism.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Nationalism: This is about putting one's own nation's interests first, focusing on self-governance and sovereignty. But in the passage, Nkrumah is talking about unity among African states, not just focusing on individual nations. So, nationalism doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nB. Socialism: This is an economic and political system where the means of production are owned collectively, often by the state, to benefit the society as a whole. While Nkrumah was a socialist and did promote socialist policies in Ghana, the passage is more about political unity among African countries rather than specific economic systems. So, socialism might be part of his overall ideology, but it's not the main cause he's espousing in this speech.\n\nC. Pan-Africanism: This is a movement that advocates for the political and cultural unity of African people and nations. It emphasizes solidarity among Africans and people of African descent around the world. Given that Nkrumah is talking about the need for African states to unite and work together for their common development and to overcome the legacies of colonialism, this seems to align closely with pan-Africanist ideals.\n\nD. Neocolonialism: This refers to the practice of powerful countries maintaining influence and control over former colonies through economic, political, or other non-military means. Nkrumah was actually a strong critic of neocolonialism; he wrote a book called \"Neo-Colonialism, the Last Stage of Imperialism.\" In this passage, he's discussing the need for African states to unite and manage their own resources, which is contrary to neocolonialism.\n\nSo, considering the context and the content of the speech, it seems that Nkrumah is espousing pan-Africanism. He's emphasizing the need for African states to come together in a union based on common goals and efforts to achieve their national aspirations and contribute to world peace.\n\nI think the answer is C. Pan-Africanism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
