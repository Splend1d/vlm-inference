                    "text": "So, I've got this scenario here: Suzy decides to go to the prom with Dylan, and Max, who was probably hoping to go with Suzy, gets really mad about it. But instead of, you know, blowing up or something, he puts all his energy into his artwork. And the question is, which defense mechanism is Max using?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Displacement\n\nB. Sublimation\n\nC. Rationalization\n\nD. Repression\n\nOkay, first, I need to remember what each of these means.\n\nDisplacement is when someone redirects their emotions from the original source to something else, usually something safer. Like, if you're mad at your boss, but can't tell him, so you go home and yell at your spouse instead.\n\nSublimation is when someone channels their unacceptable impulses into something socially acceptable or even productive. Like, someone with a lot of aggression might become a boxer or a lawyer, channeling that aggression into a career.\n\nRationalization is when someone makes up excuses to justify their behavior or feelings, to make themselves feel better.\n\nRepression is when someone pushes uncomfortable thoughts or feelings deep down, so they don't have to deal with them.\n\nIn this scenario, Max is feeling furious because Suzy chose Dylan over him, but instead of acting on that fury, maybe towards Suzy or Dylan, he's putting all his energy into his artwork.\n\nSo, is he displacing his anger? Well, sort of, because he's redirecting his emotions from the original source to his artwork. But displacement often involves taking the emotion and putting it onto another person, not necessarily into an activity.\n\nSublimation sounds a lot like what's happening here. He's taking his negative emotions, his fury, and channeling them into something productive and positive, which is his artwork.\n\nRationalization wouldn't fit here because there's no indication that he's making up excuses for his feelings or actions.\n\nRepression also doesn't seem to fit because he's not trying to push his feelings away; he's actually expressing them, just in a different way.\n\nSo, between displacement and sublimation, which one is it?\n\nDisplacement is more about shifting the emotion to another target, like person or object, whereas sublimation is about transforming the emotion into something positive and constructive.\n\nIn this case, Max is taking his fury and using it as fuel for his artwork. He's not really directing his fury at another person or thing; he's transforming it into something creative.\n\nSo, sublimation seems to be the better fit here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Sublimation.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about it again.\n\nIf he was displacement, maybe he would take his fury out on someone else, like snapping at his friends or something, but that's not what's happening. He's channeling it into his artwork.\n\nSublimation is specifically about converting negative emotions or impulses into positive actions, which is exactly what he's doing.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. Sublimation is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
