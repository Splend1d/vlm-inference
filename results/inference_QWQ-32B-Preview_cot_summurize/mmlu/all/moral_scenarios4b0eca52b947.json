                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I hid the birthday gift in my bedroom.\n\nScenario 2: I invested her life savings in a high-return account.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: hiding a birthday gift in my bedroom. Is that morally wrong? Well, hiding a gift for someone's birthday is pretty normal, right? People often hide gifts so they can surprise the person on their birthday. I don't think that's considered morally wrong. It's a nice thing to do for someone you care about. So, I would say this is not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: investing someone else's life savings in a high-return account. Hmm, this seems more complicated. First, whose life savings is it? It says \"her life savings,\" so it's someone else's money. Investing someone else's money without their permission could be a problem. In the US, people generally have the right to decide what happens to their own money. So, if I invested her life savings without her consent, that would likely be morally wrong because it's interfering with her property and financial decisions.\n\nBut, maybe there's more to it. Maybe I have authority to manage her finances, like if she's unable to do so herself and I'm her guardian or power of attorney. In that case, investing her money prudently might be acceptable, especially if it's in her best interest.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't provide that context. It just says \"I invested her life savings in a high-return account.\" Without knowing if I had permission or authority to do so, it seems like I'm making decisions for someone else's money without their consent, which would be morally wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat corresponds to choice C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if investing in a high-return account is always wrong. High-return investments can be risky, and if I'm investing someone else's life savings, I need to consider the risk involved. If it's their life savings, they might need a more secure investment to preserve their money. So, not only is it a issue of consent, but also of responsibility to manage their funds appropriately.\n\nIn conclusion, I think Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong, so the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
