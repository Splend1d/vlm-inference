                    "text": "So I've got this question here about bank reserves and I need to figure out the reserve ratio and how much excess reserves the bank has. Let's see what I've got.\n\nThe bank has $500 in checking deposits, and it's required to reserve $50. Okay, so first, I need to understand what the reserve ratio is. I think the reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that the bank is required to hold in reserve. So, if the bank has $500 in deposits and must reserve $50, then the reserve ratio should be $50 divided by $500, right?\n\nLet me calculate that: $50 / $500 = 0.1, which is 10%. So, the reserve ratio is 10%.\n\nNow, what about excess reserves? Excess reserves are the amount of reserves the bank has beyond what is required. So, if the bank has to reserve $50, and let's say it has more than that, the excess would be the total reserves minus the required reserves.\n\nBut wait, the question only says the bank is required to reserve $50, and it has $500 in checking deposits. Does that mean the bank only has $50 in reserves, or does it have more?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to assume that the bank has more reserves than just the required $50. But the question doesn't specify how much total reserves the bank has, only the required reserves.\n\nOh, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the $50 is the required reserve, and the bank has more than that in its total reserves, and I need to find out how much more.\n\nBut actually, the question says \"the bank is required to reserve $50\", which I interpret as the required reserve is $50. If the bank has more than that, that's excess reserve.\n\nBut in this case, it doesn't specify how much total reserves the bank has, only the required reserves. So, maybe I need to assume that the bank has only the required reserves, meaning no excess reserves.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because option A says $450 in excess reserves, and option C says 90% reserve ratio with $450 in excess reserves, which seems contradictory.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look at it differently. Maybe the reserve ratio is 10%, as I calculated, and then excess reserves would be total reserves minus required reserves.\n\nBut again, it doesn't specify total reserves. Maybe it's assuming that the bank has a certain amount of reserves beyond what's required.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. 10 percent $450 in excess reserves\n\nB. 90 percent $50 in excess reserves\n\nC. 90 percent $450 in excess reserves\n\nD. 10 percent $50 in excess reserves\n\nI already think the reserve ratio is 10%, so options B and C with 90% seem incorrect.\n\nSo, between A and D, both have 10% reserve ratio, which matches my calculation.\n\nNow, to find excess reserves, I need to know total reserves minus required reserves.\n\nBut the question only gives required reserves ($50), not total reserves.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it this way: if the reserve ratio is 10%, and deposits are $500, then required reserves are $50, as I calculated.\n\nIf the bank has more than $50 in reserves, the excess is the total reserves minus $50.\n\nBut the question doesn't say how much total reserves the bank has; it only mentions the required reserves.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to assume that the bank has only the required reserves, meaning excess reserves are zero.\n\nBut that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bank has $500 in deposits and is required to reserve 10%, which is $50, and perhaps it has more reserves beyond that.\n\nBut without knowing total reserves, I can't determine excess reserves.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the bank has $500 in deposits and $50 in required reserves, and the rest is excess reserves.\n\nBut that would mean excess reserves are $500 - $50 = $450, which is option A.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct because deposits are liabilities, and reserves are assets.\n\nActually, reserves are kept against deposits to meet potential withdrawals.\n\nSo, if the bank has $500 in deposits and is required to keep $50 in reserve, any reserves above $50 would be excess reserves.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify how much total reserves the bank has; it only gives the required reserves.\n\nTherefore, I can't determine the excess reserves without knowing total reserves.\n\nHowever, since it's a multiple-choice question, and option A says 10% reserve ratio and $450 in excess reserves, maybe that's intended.\n\nBut that would mean the bank has total reserves of $500, which seems high for deposits of $500.\n\nWait, no, reserves are typically a fraction of deposits, but if the bank chooses to hold more, that's up to them.\n\nBut in this case, if the bank has $500 in deposits, required reserves of $50, and total reserves of $500, then excess reserves would be $500 - $50 = $450, which matches option A.\n\nAlternatively, if the bank has only $50 in total reserves, then excess reserves would be zero, but that's not an option.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option A is correct: 10% reserve ratio and $450 in excess reserves.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because the question doesn't specify total reserves.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the bank has reserves equal to deposits, meaning $500 in reserves for $500 in deposits, and required reserves are $50, so excess reserves are $450.\n\nBut that seems like an unusually high reserve ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reserve ratio is 10%, required reserves are $50, and excess reserves are zero, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, option D has 10% reserve ratio and $50 in excess reserves, which wouldn't make sense if required reserves are $50 and total reserves are $100, but that's not aligning correctly.\n\nI think I need to stick with option A: 10% reserve ratio and $450 in excess reserves.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
