                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the energy from electromagnetic waves in a cavity relates to the temperature and how that energy can be used to melt ice. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, recall that the energy density of electromagnetic waves in a cavity at thermal equilibrium is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The total energy density \\( u \\) is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ u \\propto T^4 \\]\n\nThis means that if the temperature is increased by a factor of two, the energy density increases by a factor of \\( 2^4 = 16 \\).\n\nNow, the energy available to melt ice in a fixed amount of time depends on the energy density and the volume of the cavity. Assuming the volume remains constant, the energy available for melting ice is directly proportional to the energy density. Therefore, if the energy density increases by a factor of 16, the energy available for melting ice also increases by a factor of 16.\n\nThe amount of ice that can be melted is proportional to the energy available, provided that the latent heat of fusion of ice remains constant (which it does, assuming the pressure is constant). Therefore, if the energy available increases by a factor of 16, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time also increases by a factor of 16.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
