                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about virtual memory systems that use pages, and it gives us three statements, I, II, and III, and asks which of them are true. The options are A. I only, B. II only, C. I and II, D. I and III. So, I need to evaluate each statement individually and see which ones hold true for paged virtual memory systems.\n\nStarting with statement I: \"The virtual address space can be larger than the amount of physical memory.\" Hmm, I think this is a fundamental concept of virtual memory. Virtual memory allows a process to have a larger address space than the available physical memory by using disk storage to hold parts of the process that aren't currently in use. So, the virtual address space can indeed be larger than physical memory. That makes sense. So, I believe statement I is true.\n\nNext, statement II: \"Programs must be resident in main memory throughout their execution.\" Wait a minute, that doesn't sound right. One of the main points of virtual memory is that it allows programs to be larger than physical memory, meaning that not all parts of a program need to be in main memory at the same time. The operating system can load parts of the program into memory as needed and swap out other parts to disk. So, programs don't have to be entirely resident in main memory all the time. In fact, that's one of the benefits of virtual memory. So, I think statement II is false.\n\nNow, statement III: \"Pages correspond to semantic characteristics of the program.\" Hmm, this one is a bit tricky. Pages in virtual memory are fixed-size blocks of memory that are used for mapping virtual addresses to physical addresses. They are usually managed by the operating system and the hardware memory management unit (MMU). Semantic characteristics of a program would relate to the meaning and structure of the code, like functions, variables, and data structures.\n\nI don't think pages correspond directly to these semantic characteristics. Pages are more about the memory layout and how memory is divided for management purposes, not about the program's semantics. So, I believe statement III is false.\n\nPutting it all together, only statement I is true. So, the correct answer should be A. I only.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where statement II could be true? Maybe in certain systems or under specific conditions. Well, in some real-time systems or embedded systems, there might be constraints that require programs to be entirely in memory, but in general, for virtual memory systems, it's not necessary. So, I stick with my initial assessment that statement II is false.\n\nAnd for statement III, pages are just blocks of memory; they don't have any knowledge or correspondence to the program's semantic features. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. I only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
