                    "text": "Let's see. The question is about lactose and which statement is correct regarding it. So, I need to think about what I know about lactose and evaluate each option.\n\nOption A says: \"Is always the cause of milk intolerance.\" Hmm, I know that lactose is a sugar found in milk and dairy products. Milk intolerance is often referred to as lactose intolerance, which means people have trouble digesting lactose because they lack the enzyme lactase needed to break it down. So, in that sense, lactose is the cause of milk intolerance. But I'm a bit unsure if it's always the case because sometimes people might be intolerant to other components in milk, like proteins. But primarily, milk intolerance is due to lactose. So, maybe A is correct.\n\nOption B says: \"Cannot be digested in the human gut.\" Well, actually, lactose can be digested in the human gut, but only if the individual has sufficient lactase enzyme. Lactase breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose, which can then be absorbed. So, for people who have enough lactase, lactose is digested. But for those who don't, it cannot be digested properly, leading to symptoms. So, this statement isn't entirely accurate because it can be digested with the right enzyme.\n\nOption C says: \"Intolerance is present in up to 20% of the population.\" I think this is an underestimation. I recall that lactose intolerance is quite common worldwide, and in some populations, it's as high as 75% or more. For example, in some Asian and African countries, lactose intolerance is nearly universal among adults. In contrast, in Northern European populations, it's much lower, maybe around 5-15%. So, saying up to 20% seems too low when considering the global population.\n\nOption D says: \"Is excluded on a low FODMAP diet.\" I know that FODMAP stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols. Lactose is a disaccharide, so it falls under the FODMAPs category. Low FODMAP diets are used to manage symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by restricting certain fermentable carbohydrates, including lactose. So, yes, lactose is excluded or limited on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nConsidering all options, A seems plausible, but I'm a bit uneasy about it because there might be other causes of milk intolerance. Option B is not entirely accurate. Option C seems incorrect due to the higher global prevalence of lactose intolerance. Option D seems correct. Maybe there's more than one correct answer here.\n\nWait, perhaps both A and D are correct. But the question seems to be asking for a single best answer. Maybe I need to choose the most accurate one.\n\nLet me think again. A says \"always the cause of milk intolerance.\" But as I thought earlier, while lactose is the primary cause, there might be rare cases where intolerance is due to other components in milk. However, for the vast majority, it's lactose.\n\nOption D is definitely correct because lactose is a FODMAP and is restricted in a low FODMAP diet.\n\nPerhaps the question allows for only one answer, and in that case, I might need to choose the most relevant one, which could be D, as it directly relates to dietary management, or A, as it pertains to the cause of intolerance.\n\nBut considering the accuracy, I think D is the best answer because A might not be entirely accurate due to the possibility of other causes of milk intolerance, even if they are rare.\n\nSo, I'll go with D: \"Is excluded on a low FODMAP diet.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
