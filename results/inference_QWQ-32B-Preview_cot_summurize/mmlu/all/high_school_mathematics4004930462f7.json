                    "text": "To find the shortest distance from the origin to the given circle, I first need to understand the equation of the circle and its properties.\n\nThe given equation is:\n\n\\[x^2 - 24x + y^2 + 10y + 160 = 0\\]\n\nThis seems like a general equation of a circle, but I'm more familiar with the standard form \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\nSo, I should probably complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms to rewrite this equation in standard form.\n\nFirst, for the \\(x\\) terms:\n\n\\[x^2 - 24x\\]\n\nTo complete the square:\n\nTake half of the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is -24, half of that is -12, and then square it to get 144.\n\nSo, \\(x^2 - 24x\\) becomes \\((x - 12)^2 - 144\\).\n\nNext, for the \\(y\\) terms:\n\n\\[y^2 + 10y\\]\n\nHalf of 10 is 5, squared is 25.\n\nSo, \\(y^2 + 10y\\) becomes \\((y + 5)^2 - 25\\).\n\nNow, plug these back into the original equation:\n\n\\[(x - 12)^2 - 144 + (y + 5)^2 - 25 + 160 = 0\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 144 - 25 + 160 = 0\\]\n\n\\[(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0\\]\n\n\\[(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9\\]\n\nSo, the standard form of the circle is:\n\n\\[(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9\\]\n\nThis tells me that the center of the circle is at \\((12, -5)\\) and the radius is \\(\\sqrt{9} = 3\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the shortest distance from the origin \\((0, 0)\\) to this circle.\n\nTo find the shortest distance from a point to a circle, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\\text{shortest distance} = \\text{distance from point to center} - \\text{radius}\\]\n\nFirst, find the distance from the origin to the center of the circle.\n\nUsing the distance formula:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(12 - 0)^2 + (-5 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\\]\n\nThen, subtract the radius:\n\n\\[13 - 3 = 10\\]\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the completion of the square:\n\nFor \\(x\\):\n\n\\[x^2 - 24x \\rightarrow (x - 12)^2 - 144\\]\n\nFor \\(y\\):\n\n\\[y^2 + 10y \\rightarrow (y + 5)^2 - 25\\]\n\nPlugging back in:\n\n\\[(x - 12)^2 - 144 + (y + 5)^2 - 25 + 160 = 0\\]\n\nCombining constants:\n\n\\[-144 - 25 + 160 = -9\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nCenter at \\((12, -5)\\), radius 3.\n\nDistance from origin to center:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{12^2 + (-5)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\\]\n\nShortest distance:\n\n\\[13 - 3 = 10\\]\n\nSeems solid. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach it another way.\n\nAlternatively, I could parameterize the circle and find the minimum distance, but that would be more complicated and time-consuming.\n\nOr, I could consider the line connecting the origin to the center of the circle and find the point on the circle along that line.\n\nThe direction from the origin to the center is along the vector \\((12, -5)\\).\n\nUnit vector in that direction:\n\n\\[\\left( \\frac{12}{13}, \\frac{-5}{13} \\right)\\]\n\nThen, the point on the circle closest to the origin would be the center minus the radius in that direction:\n\n\\[(12, -5) - 3 \\left( \\frac{12}{13}, \\frac{-5}{13} \\right) = \\left(12 - \\frac{36}{13}, -5 + \\frac{15}{13}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{156 - 36}{13}, \\frac{-65 + 15}{13}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{120}{13}, \\frac{-50}{13}\\right)\\]\n\nThen, the distance from the origin to this point is:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{120}{13}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{-50}{13}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{14400 + 2500}{169}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16900}{169}} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\\]\n\nSame answer as before. So, it confirms that the shortest distance is indeed 10.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10\n\nB. 16\n\nC. 24\n\nD. 12\n\nOption A is correct.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
