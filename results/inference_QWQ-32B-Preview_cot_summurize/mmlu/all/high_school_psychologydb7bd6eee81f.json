I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with A, phonemes. I think phonemes are the smallest units of sound in a language. Like, different sounds that make up words. For example, in the word \"cat,\" there are three phonemes: /k/, /\u00e6/, and /t/. So, phonemes are about sounds, right?\n\nOption B, phenotypes. Hmm, I'm not sure what this has to do with language. I think phenotype is a term used in biology, referring to the observable characteristics of an organism, like height or color, which are determined by both genetics and environment. So, that doesn't seem related to language at all.\n\nOption C, semantics. I know that semantics has to do with meaning in language. It's the study of meaning in words, phrases, and sentences. But it seems too broad here. The question is asking for the smallest units of meaning, and semantics is more about how meaning is constructed and understood in language overall.\n\nOption D, morphemes. I think morphemes are the smallest meaningful units in language. They can't be divided any further without losing their meaning. For example, in the word \"unhappiness,\" \"un-\" is a morpheme meaning \"not,\" \"happy\" is a morpheme meaning a state of mind, and \"-ness\" is a morpheme turning the adjective into a noun. So, each part is a morpheme with its own meaning.\n\nComparing these, phonemes are about sounds, phenotypes are unrelated to language, semantics is about meaning in general, and morphemes are the smallest units of meaning.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be D, morphemes.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's double-check.\n\nPhonemes are indeed the smallest units of sound, but they don't carry meaning on their own. For example, the phoneme /k/ doesn't mean anything by itself; it's just a sound.\n\nSemantics deals with meaning, but it's not a unit; it's the study of meaning.\n\nPhenotypes are totally off-topic here.\n\nMorphemes, however, are the smallest meaningful units. Even if they are sounds, it's their meaning that counts, not just the sound itself.\n\nFor example, the morpheme \"dog\" means a specific animal. If you break it down into phonemes /d/, /o/, /g/, none of these alone have the meaning of the animal. So, \"dog\" as a morpheme is the smallest unit that carries that specific meaning.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D, morphemes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
