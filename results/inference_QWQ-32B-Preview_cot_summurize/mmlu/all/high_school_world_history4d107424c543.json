Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment?\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this quote from Walter Rodney's book \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa.\" He's talking about who's responsible for Africa's underdevelopment, and he points fingers at the imperialist system operated by Western European capitalists. He says this system drained Africa's wealth and made it impossible for Africa to develop quickly.\n\nNow, the question is asking which option best supports Rodney's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment. Let's look at each choice:\n\nOption A: The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations.\n\nHmm, the slave trade was definitely a major aspect of European colonization and had devastating effects on Africa. Europeans, especially from Britain, France, and Portugal, were heavily involved in capturing and selling African people as slaves. This led to a massive loss of population, disruption of societies, and overall underdevelopment in Africa.\n\nOption B: The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market.\n\nWait a minute, Rodney is focusing on Western European capitalists here. While it's true that Arab merchants also participated in the slave trade, Rodney might not see them as the primary culprits in this context. He's specifically blaming Western European capitalists for Africa's underdevelopment, so this option might not directly support his assertion.\n\nOption C: The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company did establish colonies in South Africa, and this was part of the broader European colonization of Africa. These colonies were set up for economic exploitation, including resource extraction and control over trade routes. So, this seems relevant to Rodney's argument about European exploitation leading to African underdevelopment.\n\nOption D: The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia.\n\nTrade can be beneficial for both parties, but in the context of imperialism, trade often exploited weaker parties. However, Ethiopia is known for being one of the few African nations that managed to resist European colonization. So, perhaps the trade links here weren't as exploitative as in other parts of Africa. Maybe this isn't the best support for Rodney's assertion.\n\nConsidering all this, options A and C seem most directly related to Western European capitalist exploitation of Africa. Option A highlights the slave trade, which was a key aspect of European imperialism in Africa, while option C points to the establishment of colonies for economic gain.\n\nPerhaps option A is stronger because the slave trade had such a profound and negative impact on Africa's development, depleting its workforce and destabilizing societies. On the other hand, option C represents a different phase of colonization, where Europeans directly controlled territories and extracted resources.\n\nMaybe both could support Rodney's assertion, but if I had to choose one that best supports his view, I'd go with option A, the aggressive expansion of the slave trade. It directly ties into the idea of Western European capitalists draining Africa's wealth and human resources, which aligns closely with what Rodney is arguing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
