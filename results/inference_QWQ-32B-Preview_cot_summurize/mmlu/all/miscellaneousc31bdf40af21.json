So, the correct answer is C. 10.\n\nHere's a bit more about it: Bowling is a sport where players roll a bowling ball down a lane towards a set of pins. The primary objective is to knock down as many pins as possible. A strike occurs when all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball of a frame. This is the highest-scoring single roll in bowling and can lead to bonus points depending on the subsequent rolls in the next frame."
