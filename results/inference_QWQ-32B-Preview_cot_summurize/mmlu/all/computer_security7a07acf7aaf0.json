Then, it gives four options: Base Signal Station, Base Transmitter Station, Base Transceiver Station, and Transceiver Station. I need to choose the one that matches the description.\n\nFirst, I should understand what an Access Point in 802.11 is. I know that 802.11 refers to the Wi-Fi standard, and an Access Point is essentially a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a network. So, it both sends and receives signals to communicate with wireless devices.\n\nNow, the question is comparing this to something that mobile operators use for signal coverage. Mobile operators, like cell phone companies, have base stations that facilitate communication between mobile devices and the network.\n\nLet me look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: Base Signal Station. I'm not familiar with this term. It doesn't sound like a standard term in mobile networks. Maybe it's a made-up option to see if I know the correct term.\n\nOption B: Base Transmitter Station. This sounds like a station that only transmits signals, but in mobile networks, base stations need to both transmit and receive signals to communicate with mobile devices. So, this might not be the complete picture.\n\nOption C: Base Transceiver Station. This sounds promising because \"transceiver\" means it can both transmit and receive signals. That matches the function of an Access Point in Wi-Fi, which also needs to both send and receive data.\n\nOption D: Transceiver Station. This is similar to Option C but doesn't include \"Base.\" In mobile networks, the term \"Base Transceiver Station\" or BTS is commonly used, whereas \"Transceiver Station\" might be too general.\n\nGiven this, I think Option C, Base Transceiver Station, is the correct answer. It aligns with the function of an Access Point in 802.11 and matches what mobile operators use for signal coverage.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that in cellular networks, the BTS is responsible for communicating with mobile devices within its coverage area, similar to how an AP handles communication with Wi-Fi devices in its range.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C. Base Transceiver Station.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
