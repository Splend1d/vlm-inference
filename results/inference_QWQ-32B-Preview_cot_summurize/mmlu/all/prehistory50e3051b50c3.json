So, the correct answer is C.\n\nRandall White is an anthropologist who has studied the evolution of human culture, particularly focusing on the Upper Paleolithic period, which spans from about 50,000 to 10,000 years ago. During this time, there was a significant increase in the production and use of personal ornaments, such as beads, pendants, and other decorative items.\n\nWhite argues that these adornments were not just random decorations but served a meaningful purpose in expressing individual identity and social status. He suggests that the careful selection and arrangement of these items allowed individuals to communicate aspects of their identity, such as their group affiliation, social rank, or personal achievements.\n\nThis view contrasts with some other interpretations that might see these adornments as primarily functional or as indicators of long-distance trade. While it's possible that some adornments had practical uses or were obtained through trade, White emphasizes their role in self-expression and social differentiation.\n\nTherefore, according to White, the increasing prevalence of personal adornment in the Upper Paleolithic reflects a growing importance placed on individual identity and the ways in which people chose to present themselves to others.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nWhite, R.
