Let's see what each option is saying.\n\nOption A: \"John's duty to return to Mary the car that he borrowed from her.\" Hmm, this seems like a duty related to property. Mary has the right to have her car returned since she owns it, and John has the duty to give it back. That sounds like a duty corresponding to a right in property, which I think is similar to a right to goods.\n\nOption B: \"John's duty to allow Mary to pursue goals that she values.\" This seems more about personal liberty and autonomy. It's about Mary having the right to pursue her own goals, and John has the duty not to interfere with that. That feels more like a right to freedom or liberty, not specifically to goods and services.\n\nOption C: \"John's duty to not harm Mary.\" This is about personal safety and well-being. Mary has the right to not be harmed, and John has the duty to refrain from harming her. This is a fundamental right to safety, but again, it's not directly about goods and services.\n\nOption D: \"John's duty to not commit suicide.\" This seems more about John's own actions regarding his own life. It's not directly about a duty towards Mary or regarding goods and services.\n\nNow, thinking about rights to goods and services, I think this is about economic rights or rights to certain provisions. For example, the right to access certain goods or services, perhaps provided by the government or by others.\n\nOption A seems most directly related to goods, since a car is a tangible good. Options B and C are more about personal liberties and safety, which are important but not specifically about goods and services. Option D is about John's own actions, not about duties towards Mary or rights to goods and services.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is A. John's duty to return the car to Mary corresponds to Mary's right to her property, which is a good.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a better way to look at this.\n\nRights to goods and services could include things like the right to own property, the right to buy and sell goods, or the right to access certain services. In that case, option A fits well because it's about the right to own property (the car) and the duty to respect that right by returning the borrowed car.\n\nOptions B and C are more about personal rights and duties concerning respect for personhood and safety, which are different categories.\n\nOption D is about John's own right to life, which is a separate issue.\n\nTherefore, I believe option A is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
