                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: find the quotient of 5.04 divided by 0.7. And there are some options: A. 0.72, B. 0.702, C. 10.0571, and D. 7.2. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a quotient is. Quotient is just the result you get when you divide one number by another. So, in this case, it's 5.04 divided by 0.7.\n\nNow, dividing decimals can be a bit tricky, but there's a way to make it easier. I remember that you can adjust the decimal points in both numbers to turn the divisor into a whole number. The divisor here is 0.7, so I can multiply both the dividend (5.04) and the divisor (0.7) by 10 to eliminate the decimal in the divisor.\n\nSo, multiplying both by 10:\n\n5.04 \u00d7 10 = 50.4\n\n0.7 \u00d7 10 = 7\n\nNow, the problem becomes 50.4 divided by 7.\n\nThat seems simpler. Now, I need to divide 50.4 by 7.\n\nLet me see:\n\n7 goes into 50 seven times because 7 \u00d7 7 = 49.\n\nSubtract 49 from 50, which leaves 1.\n\nThen, bring down the 4, making it 14.\n\n7 goes into 14 two times exactly, because 7 \u00d7 2 = 14.\n\nSo, the quotient is 7.2.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 7.2 matches this.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about moving the decimal points another way. Since both numbers were multiplied by 10, the decimal places are adjusted accordingly, and the quotient should remain the same.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the decimals to fractions.\n\n5.04 is the same as 504/100.\n\n0.7 is the same as 7/10.\n\nSo, dividing fractions means multiplying by the reciprocal.\n\nSo, (504/100) \u00f7 (7/10) = (504/100) \u00d7 (10/7).\n\nSimplify that:\n\n504 \u00d7 10 = 5040\n\n100 \u00d7 7 = 700\n\nSo, 5040 / 700.\n\nNow, simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator can be divided by 10.\n\n5040 \u00f7 10 = 504\n\n700 \u00f7 10 = 70\n\nSo, 504 / 70.\n\nNow, divide both by 7.\n\n504 \u00f7 7 = 72\n\n70 \u00f7 7 = 10\n\nSo, 72 / 10 = 7.2.\n\nAgain, I get 7.2.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the original numbers.\n\n5.04 divided by 0.7.\n\nI know that 5.04 is a little more than 5, and 0.7 is a little less than 1.\n\nSo, dividing a number by a fraction (or a decimal less than 1) makes the result larger.\n\nFor example, 5 divided by 0.5 is 10.\n\nSo, in this case, 5.04 divided by 0.7 should be more than 5.\n\nLooking at the options, 0.72 and 0.702 are less than 1, which doesn't make sense because 5.04 divided by 0.7 should be greater than 5.\n\n10.0571 is possible, but according to my calculations, it's 7.2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the decimal places.\n\nIn division, the number of decimal places in the quotient depends on the dividends and divisors.\n\nBut in this case, since both have one decimal place, and after adjustment, it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can plug in the options and see which one multiplied by 0.7 gives me 5.04.\n\nLet's try option D, 7.2.\n\n7.2 \u00d7 0.7 = ?\n\n7 \u00d7 0.7 = 4.9\n\n0.2 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.14\n\nAdd them up: 4.9 + 0.14 = 5.04.\n\nPerfect, it matches.\n\nSo, indeed, the correct answer is D. 7.2.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
