Let's see what it's asking.\n\n\"A woman transmits color blindness to her son although she herself displays normal color vision. The defect transmitted by this woman represents a characteristic of her\n\nA. Y chromosome\nB. dominant genes\nC. genotype\nD. phenotype\"\n\nAlright, first things first, color blindness is typically a sex-linked recessive trait, and since it's related to the X chromosome. Men have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X chromosomes.\n\nSo, if a woman is a carrier for color blindness, that means she has one normal X chromosome and one X chromosome with the color blindness gene. Since she has one normal chromosome, she displays normal color vision, but she can pass the color blindness gene to her children.\n\nHer son, who receives her X chromosome and his father's Y chromosome, will express the color blindness if he inherits her X chromosome with the defective gene, because he doesn't have another X chromosome to mask the recessive trait.\n\nNow, the question is asking what this defect represents in terms of her:\n\nA. Y chromosome - but women don't have a Y chromosome, so that can't be right.\n\nB. dominant genes - color blindness is recessive, so that doesn't fit.\n\nC. genotype - that's her genetic makeup, including both the normal and the defective genes.\n\nD. phenotype - that's her observable characteristics, which in this case is normal color vision.\n\nHmm. The defect is part of her genetic makeup, but she doesn't express it phenotypically because it's recessive.\n\nSo, the defect is present in her genotype but not in her phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. genotype.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nIf she has the defective gene but doesn't express it, that means it's in her genotype but not affecting her phenotype.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the characteristic being referred to is her genotype, because that's where the defect exists, even though it's not\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6765\u7684.\n\nYeah, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\n"
