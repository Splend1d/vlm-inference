From what I've read, life expectancy can vary based on various factors including race and gender.\n\nGenerally, women tend to live longer than men, regardless of race. So, between men and women, women have higher life expectancies. Also, in the United States, African Americans often have lower life expectancies compared to whites due to various socioeconomic and health factors.\n\nSo, if I consider all other things being equal, which might not always be the case in reality, but assuming that, then a white woman would likely have the highest life expectancy among the options given.\n\nLet me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Comparing men and women: Women generally live longer than men.\n\n2. Comparing blacks and whites: Whites generally have higher life expectancies than blacks.\n\nSo, combining these two factors:\n\n- A black man would likely have the lowest life expectancy.\n\n- A white woman would likely have the highest life expectancy.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. A white woman.\n\nBut I should check if there's any exception or if there's data that contradicts this general trend.\n\nI recall that in some studies, African American women have higher life expectancies than white men, but still lower than white women. So, in that case, C. A black woman might live longer than B. A white man, but not longer than D. A white woman.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that life expectancy can be influenced by many factors such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and genetic factors. The question says \"all other things being equal,\" so we have to assume that these external factors are controlled for.\n\nGiven that, I think D. A white woman is likely to live the longest.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any data that suggests otherwise.\n\nI've heard that in some countries or specific populations, there might be different trends, but in the United States, the general trend is that white women have the highest life expectancy.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
