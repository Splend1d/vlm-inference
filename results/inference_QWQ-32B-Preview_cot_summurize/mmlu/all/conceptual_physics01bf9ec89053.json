The airspeed is the speed of the airplane relative to the air, while the groundspeed is the speed of the airplane relative to the ground. The wind speed affects the groundspeed.\n\nIn this scenario, the airplane is pointing north with an airspeed of 40 km/h, and there is a 30 km/h crosswind coming from the west (since it's at right angles to the airplane's direction). This means the wind is blowing from the west to the east, perpendicular to the airplane's heading.\n\nTo find the groundspeed, we need to consider both the airplane's airspeed and the wind speed vectorially, because they are acting at right angles to each other. Essentially, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the resultant groundspeed.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Airspeed (A) = 40 km/h (north)\n\n- Wind speed (W) = 30 km/h (east)\n\n- Groundspeed (G) = ?\n\nSince the wind is perpendicular to the airplane's heading, the groundspeed can be calculated as:\n\nG = \u221a(A\u00b2 + W\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nG = \u221a(40\u00b2 + 30\u00b2) = \u221a(1600 + 900) = \u221a2500 = 50 km/h\n\nTherefore, the groundspeed of the airplane is 50 km/h.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 50 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
