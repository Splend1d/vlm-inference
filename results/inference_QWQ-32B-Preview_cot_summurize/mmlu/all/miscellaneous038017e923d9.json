                    "text": "Let's see. I remember that the Triple Crown in horse racing consists of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. It's a big deal when a jockey wins all three in the same year.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the youngest jockey ever to win the Triple Crown, and it's set in 1978. The options are Jerry Bailey, Steve Cauthen, Willie Shoemaker, and Pasquale Devito.\n\nFirst, I know that Willie Shoemaker was a very famous jockey known for his small stature and long career. He set records for the most wins and earnings. But I'm not sure if he was the youngest to win the Triple Crown.\n\nJerry Bailey is another prominent jockey who had a successful career, winning the Triple Crown multiple times, but again, I don't know if he was the youngest in 1978.\n\nPasquale Devito doesn't ring any bells for me. I might not know much about him.\n\nThen there's Steve Cauthen. I think he was a notable jockey in the 1970s and 1980s. I seem to recall that he achieved some youth records.\n\nLet me think about it. In 1978, Steve Cauthen rode Affirmed to victory in all three races of the Triple Crown. Affirmed was the eleventh horse to win the Triple Crown.\n\nWhat makes this notable is Steve Cauthen's age at the time. I believe he was quite young, which is why this question is focusing on that aspect.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that Steve Cauthen was 17 years old when he won the Triple Crown in 1978. That would make him the youngest jockey to achieve this feat.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nJerry Bailey: He won the Triple Crown in 1986 and 1995, but he was older than 17 when he did so.\n\nWillie Shoemaker: He had a long career and was a legend, but I don't think he won the Triple Crown at a very young age. In fact, I think his first Triple Crown win was in 1957 on Bold Ruler, and he was already in his twenties by then.\n\nPasquale Devito: I'm not sure about his achievements in relation to the Triple Crown.\n\nTherefore, it seems that Steve Cauthen is the correct answer here. He was the youngest jockey to win the Triple Crown in 1978.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Steve Cauthen went on to have a successful career, winning the Eclipse Award as Outstanding Jockey in 1983 and 1984.\n\nSo, to summarize, in 1978, Steve Cauthen became the youngest jockey ever to win horse racing's Triple Crown.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
