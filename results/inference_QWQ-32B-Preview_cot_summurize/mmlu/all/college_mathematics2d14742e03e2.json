                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about rings and ideals. So, let's see what it's asking. We have a ring R with a multiplicative identity, and U is an additive subgroup of R with the property that for any u in U and any r in R, the product ur is also in U. This means U is a right ideal of R. The problem states that R has exactly two right ideals, and we need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some definitions. A ring R with a multiplicative identity is called a unital ring or a ring with unity. An additive subgroup U of R is a right ideal if for every u in U and every r in R, ur is in U. Similarly, there are left ideals, but here we're dealing with right ideals.\n\nNow, the problem says that R has exactly two right ideals. What are these two ideals? In any ring, there are always at least two ideals: the zero ideal {0} and the entire ring R itself. So, these must be the two right ideals in this case. That means R has no nontrivial right ideals.\n\nI remember that rings with no nontrivial right ideals are called simple rings. So, R is a simple ring.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nI. R is commutative.\n\nII. R is a division ring (that is, all elements except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses).\n\nIII. R is infinite.\n\nI need to determine which of these must be true given that R is a simple ring with unity.\n\nLet's consider each statement one by one.\n\nStatement I: R is commutative.\n\nIs every simple ring with unity commutative? I don't think so. For example, the ring of n x n matrices over a field, for n > 1, is a simple ring (since its only two-sided ideals are {0} and itself), but it's not commutative. However, in this problem, we're dealing with right ideals, not two-sided ideals. Wait, in the case of rings with unity, right ideals and left ideals behave similarly in some ways.\n\nBut actually, the ring of n x n matrices over a field has many right ideals if n > 1, so it doesn't have exactly two right ideals. Maybe my example doesn't apply here.\n\nLet me think differently. Is there a non-commutative simple ring with exactly two right ideals? Well, if R is a division ring, then it has no nontrivial right ideals because every nonzero element has an inverse, so any right ideal containing a nonzero element must be the whole ring. So, division rings have exactly two right ideals: {0} and R.\n\nBut the problem is asking if R must be commutative. So, if R is a division ring, it doesn't have to be commutative; for example, the quaternions form a non-commutative division ring. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, option A (I only) is incorrect.\n\nStatement II: R is a division ring.\n\nAs I just thought, if R is a division ring, then it has exactly two right ideals: {0} and R. So, this seems plausible. But is this necessarily true?\n\nWait, is every simple ring with unity a division ring? I'm not sure. Maybe not. Are there simple rings that are not division rings?\n\nLet me think about the ring of integers modulo a prime, Z/pZ, where p is prime. This is a field, so it's a division ring, and hence it has exactly two right ideals. Similarly, any field has exactly two right ideals.\n\nBut are there simple rings that are not division rings? I think there are. For example, the ring of n x n matrices over a division ring is simple, but it's not a division ring unless n = 1.\n\nWait, but as I thought earlier, the ring of n x n matrices over a division ring has many right ideals if n > 1, so maybe it doesn't have exactly two right ideals.\n\nLet me check this. In the ring M_n(D) of n x n matrices over a division ring D, with n > 1, there are right ideals corresponding to matrices whose columns are in certain subspaces. So, indeed, there are more than two right ideals. Therefore, this example doesn't apply here.\n\nSo, perhaps in the case where R has exactly two right ideals, it must be a division ring.\n\nLet me try to prove this.\n\nSuppose R is a ring with unity and has exactly two right ideals: {0} and R.\n\nI need to show that every nonzero element of R has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nLet a be a nonzero element of R. Consider the right ideal generated by a, which is Ra = {ra | r \u2208 R}.\n\nSince R has only two right ideals, Ra must be either {0} or R.\n\nBut a \u2208 Ra, and a \u2260 0, so Ra cannot be {0}. Therefore, Ra = R.\n\nIn particular, 1 \u2208 Ra, so there exists some r \u2208 R such that a r = 1.\n\nTherefore, a has a right inverse, r.\n\nSimilarly, consider the right ideal aR = {a r | r \u2208 R}.\n\nAgain, since R has only two right ideals, aR must be either {0} or R.\n\nIf aR = {0}, then a r = 0 for all r \u2208 R.\n\nBut we already have a r = 1 for some r, so aR cannot be {0}. Therefore, aR = R.\n\nIn particular, 1 \u2208 aR, so there exists some s \u2208 R such that s a = 1.\n\nTherefore, a has both a right inverse r and a left inverse s.\n\nNow, in a ring with unity, if an element has both a left inverse and a right inverse, then these inverses are equal, and a is invertible.\n\nTo see this, note that s a = 1 and a r = 1.\n\nTherefore, s = s (a r) = (s a) r = 1 r = r.\n\nSo, s = r, and a has a two-sided inverse, which is s = r.\n\nTherefore, every nonzero element a in R has an inverse, so R is a division ring.\n\nTherefore, statement II must be true.\n\nNow, statement III: R is infinite.\n\nIs R necessarily infinite? No, because there are finite division rings. For example, the finite field F_p, where p is a prime, is a finite division ring.\n\nTherefore, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, only statement II must be true.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is \"II only\", which seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about right ideals, and I've shown that if R has exactly two right ideals, then R is a division ring.\n\nHowever, the problem is multiple choice, and option D is \"I and II only\", which would be that R is commutative and a division ring.\n\nBut as I saw earlier, R being a division ring does not imply that it is commutative; for example, the quaternions are a non-commutative division ring.\n\nTherefore, statement I is not necessarily true, even if statement II is true.\n\nHence, the correct answer should be option B: II only.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose R is a division ring. Then, as I argued, it has exactly two right ideals: {0} and R.\n\nConversely, if R has exactly two right ideals, then R is a division ring.\n\nFurthermore, not all division rings are commutative, so statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nAnd, as finite fields exist, R does not have to be infinite.\n\nTherefore, only statement II must be true.\n\nSo, the answer is B. II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
