                    "text": "So here's this scenario: a buyer agrees to buy a used car from a seller for $10,000. On the scheduled sale date, the buyer shows up with a $10,000 cashier's check, ready to hand it over to the seller. But the seller says no, refuses to accept the check, and won't deliver the car. Now, the buyer decides to sue for breach of contract. The question is, what remedy is the buyer entitled to?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Damages measured by the difference between the market price and the contract price for the car.\n\nB. Recovery of the contract price of the car.\n\nC. Specific performance.\n\nD. Recovery of the market price of the car.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these remedies means in this context.\n\nOption A is about damages based on the difference between the market price and the contract price. So, if the market price is higher than $10,000, the buyer could get the difference as compensation. For example, if the car is now worth $12,000, the buyer could get $2,000 in damages.\n\nOption B is about getting back the contract price, which is $10,000. But wait, the buyer was prepared to pay $10,000 and the seller refused. So, it's not like the buyer paid and now wants the money back. It seems a bit confusing.\n\nOption C is specific performance, which means the court orders the seller to go through with the sale as per the contract.\n\nOption D is recovery of the market price of the car, which would be whatever the car is worth in the current market.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what is the buyer's loss here? The seller breached the contract by refusing to deliver the car after the buyer tended the payment.\n\nIn contract law, the general remedy for breach is to put the non-breaching party in the position they would have been in had the breach not occurred.\n\nSo, for the buyer, that would mean either getting a car like the one contracted for or compensation equivalent to the value of the car.\n\nNow, in the case of goods (like a car), the buyer typically can seek damages in the form of the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, if the market price is higher.\n\nAlternatively, in some cases, the buyer might be entitled to specific performance, especially if the goods are unique or of special value.\n\nBut in this case, it's a used car, which might not be uniquely special.\n\nLet me check the rules for tendering payment.\n\nThe buyer tended a $10,000 cashier's check, which is the contract price. Presumably, this is adequate performance. So, the seller should have accepted it and delivered the car.\n\nSince the seller refused, the buyer is entitled to treat this as repudiation and sue for damages.\n\nNow, what are the damages? Generally, for goods, it's the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach.\n\nSo, if the market price is higher than $10,000, the buyer can recover that difference.\n\nIf the market price is lower or the same, the buyer might not have much damage to claim, but in this scenario, it's likely assuming the market price is higher, given that the buyer was willing to pay $10,000.\n\nOption A seems to fit this description.\n\nOption B is recovery of the contract price, but the buyer wasn't required to pay anything because the seller refused to accept the payment. So, it doesn't make sense for the buyer to recover the contract price.\n\nOption C, specific performance, is possible, but in the sale of goods, it's less commonly granted because goods are generally considered fungible, especially used cars, unless there's something unique about this particular car.\n\nOption D, recovery of the market price, would be the current value of the car. But that might include the contract price plus any increase in value. So, if the market price is $12,000, the buyer would get $12,000.\n\nBut compared to option A, which is the difference between market and contract price, so $2,000 in this example.\n\nSo, option D seems like it's asking for the full market value, not just the loss incurred.\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall the specific rules for breach of contract in sales of goods.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs sales of goods in the US, when the seller breaches by refusing to deliver the goods, the buyer can:\n\n1. Cover by purchasing substitute goods and seeking damages for any difference in price.\n\n2. Sue for damages without buying substitute goods, which would be the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach.\n\nSo, in this case, since the buyer didn't go out and buy a substitute car yet, they can sue for the difference between $10,000 and the current market price.\n\nThat aligns with option A.\n\nOption B, recovery of the contract price, doesn't make sense because the buyer didn't pay anything yet. The seller refused the payment.\n\nOption C, specific performance, might be an option, but it's less likely to be granted for standard goods like a used car.\n\nOption D, recovery of the market price, seems like it would be the full $12,000 if that's the market price, but actually, the buyer already tended $10,000, so it might not be the full market price.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nIf the buyer tended $10,000, and the seller refused, can the buyer claim the full $10,000 back? But the buyer was willing to give $10,000 in exchange for the car. It's not like the buyer paid $10,000 and now wants it back; the transaction didn't complete because the seller refused.\n\nSo, the buyer didn't suffer an out-of-pocket loss of $10,000 because they didn't part with the money.\n\nTheir loss is the value of the car they were contracted to buy.\n\nSo, perhaps the buyer's damages are the market value of the car at the time of breach.\n\nBut according to UCC 2-708, the measure of damages is the difference between the market price at the time of breach and the contract price.\n\nSo, if the market price is higher, the buyer gets the difference.\n\nIf lower, the buyer can cancel the contract and get any tendered payment back, but in this case, no payment was made yet.\n\nWait, the buyer tended payment, but the seller refused. So, perhaps the $10,000 is still with the buyer.\n\nIn such a case, the buyer hasn't suffered an out-of-pocket loss, but has lost the benefit of the bargain.\n\nThe benefit of the bargain is getting the car, which is now worth more than the contract price.\n\nSo, option A seems correct: damages measured by the difference between the market price and the contract price.\n\nOption D, recovery of the market price, might be misstated. Maybe it's intended to mean the market price minus the contract price, but as written, it's just the market price.\n\nSo, if the market price is $12,000, option D would suggest the buyer gets $12,000, which seems excessive because they were only supposed to pay $10,000.\n\nOption C, specific performance, might be available, but it's less common for standard goods.\n\nOption B, recovery of the contract price, doesn't make sense because the buyer wasn't required to pay anything yet.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate remedy is option A: damages measured by the difference between the market price and the contract price.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
