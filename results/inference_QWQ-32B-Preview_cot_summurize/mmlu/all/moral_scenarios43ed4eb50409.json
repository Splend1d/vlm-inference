Laughing at someone's behavior, especially if they are vulnerable or in a difficult situation, can be considered disrespectful and insensitive. Mental health patients often face stigma and misunderstanding, and mocking their behavior could be seen as exacerbating that stigma. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action seems morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character wants to shake hands with everyone except the black guy. Excluding someone based on their race is clearly discriminatory and goes against principles of equality and non-discrimination that are central to moral standards in the US. Racism is widely condemned, and such an action would be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
