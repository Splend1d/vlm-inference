The options are:\n\nA. are universally beneficial to modern humans.\n\nB. control the metabolism of fat in modern Europeans.\n\nC. are associated with human diseases such as Lupus.\n\nD. both b and c.\n\nSo, I need to think about what I know about Neandertal DNA and how it affects us today.\n\nFirst, I remember that Neandertals interbred with modern humans, so many people outside of Africa have some Neandertal DNA in their genomes.\n\nOption A says that these genes are universally beneficial. But I think that's probably not true because sometimes genetic variations can have both positive and negative effects, depending on the environment or other genes present. So, maybe some Neandertal genes are beneficial in certain contexts but not always universally so.\n\nOption B mentions that Neandertal genes control the metabolism of fat in modern Europeans. I recall that some studies have found Neandertal genes influencing traits related to fat metabolism, which might have been advantageous in the cold climates that Neandertals lived in. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C says that Neandertal genes are associated with human diseases such as Lupus. I think there is evidence that some Neandertal genes are linked to certain autoimmune diseases and other health issues in modern humans. So, this also seems likely.\n\nOption D combines B and C, suggesting that both controlling fat metabolism and being associated with diseases are true.\n\nGiven what I know, it seems that Neandertal genes have both positive and negative impacts on modern humans. They might have provided advantages in certain environments, like helping with fat metabolism in cold climates, but also may predispose some people to certain diseases.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D. Both B and C are correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider whether A might have some truth to it. Are there Neandertal genes that are universally beneficial? Probably not, because \"universal\" would mean they benefit everyone, regardless of environment or genetic background, which is unlikely. Genes usually have context-dependent effects.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with D. Both B and C are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
