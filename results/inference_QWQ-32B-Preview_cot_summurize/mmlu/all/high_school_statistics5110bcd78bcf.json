The company has offices in five countries, and it's known that people from different countries have varying views on smoking due to local social structures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between the sampling techniques mentioned: stratified sample, cluster sample, and simple random sample.\n\nA simple random sample is where every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected, and the selection is made randomly without any grouping or stratification. It's straightforward, but in this case, since there are differences between countries, a simple random sample might not capture these differences proportionally.\n\nOption C says that a simple random sample is the simplest method, which is true, but simplicity isn't always the best criterion for choosing a sampling method, especially when there are known variations within the population.\n\nOption D claims that a simple random sample is the only method that gives unbiased results. That's not entirely accurate. While simple random sampling is unbiased, other methods like stratified and cluster sampling can also provide unbiased estimates if performed correctly. So, I think option D is incorrect.\n\nNow, between stratified and cluster sampling, I need to see which one is more appropriate here.\n\nA stratified sample involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics and then sampling from each stratum. In this case, the strata would be the five different countries. The idea is to ensure that each country is represented in the sample, which makes sense because we know that views on smoking vary by country.\n\nA cluster sample, on the other hand, involves dividing the population into clusters (which are groups that ideally mirror the overall population), and then randomly selecting entire clusters to include in the sample. In this scenario, the five offices in different countries could be considered clusters.\n\nHowever, in cluster sampling, the clusters should be as heterogeneous as the overall population, meaning that each cluster should reflect the diversity of the entire population. But in this case, since views vary by country, each cluster (country) is likely homogeneous within itself but heterogeneous compared to other clusters. This might not be ideal for cluster sampling because it could lead to higher sampling error if the clusters are very different from each other.\n\nStratified sampling, in contrast, would allow the company to ensure representation from each country and account for the differences between countries in their analysis. This seems more appropriate given that the views on smoking vary by country.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is option A: stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata\u2014namely, the five offices in five different countries.\n\nThis approach will help ensure that the sample accurately reflects the diversity of opinions across the different countries, leading to a more reliable estimate of the proportion of employees in favor of banning smoking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
