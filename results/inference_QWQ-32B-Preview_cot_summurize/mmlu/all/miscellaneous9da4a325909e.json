So, first, I should probably look up when each of them lived.\n\nStarting with Mark Twain. I know he was a famous writer, and I think he was born in the 19th century. Let me check his birth and death years. Okay, Mark Twain was born in 1835 and died in 1910. So, he was alive until 1910, which is in the 20th century.\n\nNext, Thomas Edison. He was a inventor, right? I think he was also from the 19th century. Let's see, he was born in 1847 and died in 1931. So, he was alive well into the 20th century.\n\nSigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. I believe he was born in the mid-19th century and lived into the 20th century. Let me confirm: born in 1856, died in 1939. Yep, he was alive in the 20th century.\n\nNow, Ulysses S. Grant. He was a general in the Civil War and later became president. I think he was from the 19th century. Let's check his dates: born in 1822 and died in 1885. So, he died in the 19th century, before the 20th century began in 1901.\n\nWait a minute, the 20th century started in 1901, right? So, anyone who died before 1901 wasn't alive in the 20th century.\n\nSo, Grant died in 1885, which means he wasn't alive in the 20th century. Whereas the others all died in the 20th century.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D, Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's double-check the dates.\n\nMark Twain: 1835-1910, so yes, alive in the 20th century.\n\nThomas Edison: 1847-1931, also alive in the 20th century.\n\nSigmund Freud: 1856-1939, same thing.\n\nUlysses S. Grant: 1822-1885, died before the 20th century started.\n\nSo, it seems clear that Grant was not alive in the 20th century.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
