Skinner was well known for his work involving the behavioral perspective.\n\nSkinner was a prominent psychologist who focused on behaviorism, which emphasizes the role of environmental factors in shaping behavior. He is best known for his work with operant conditioning, where behaviors are modified through reinforcement and punishment. His theories and experiments, particularly using the Skinner Box, have had a significant impact on understanding how behaviors are learned and maintained.\n\nOption A, the biological perspective, focuses on how physical processes in the body and brain influence behavior, which was not Skinner's primary area of study.\n\nOption C, the cognitive perspective, deals with mental processes such as memory, perception, and problem-solving, which Skinner largely ignored in favor of observable behaviors.\n\nOption D, the psychodynamic perspective, emphasizes unconscious processes and early life experiences in shaping behavior, a view that Skinner disagreed with, preferring to focus on current environmental influences.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The behavioral perspective."
