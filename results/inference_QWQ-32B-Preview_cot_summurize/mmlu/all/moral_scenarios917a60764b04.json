                    "text": "So I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: I wanted to feed the bird so I threw a piece of a bread slice directly at the bird.\n\nHmm, feeding birds is generally considered okay, right? People often feed birds in parks or their backyards. But throwing bread directly at the bird seems a bit different. Maybe it's not the best way to feed them because it could be seen as disturbing the bird or potentially harming it if the bread hits it unexpectedly. On the other hand, maybe it's just harmless fun. I'm not sure about this one.\n\nScenario 2: My son is showing anomalous symptoms, so I figured I should give him the prescription medication that the doctor gave me.\n\nThis one seems more serious. Giving prescription medication meant for one person to another, especially a child, could be risky. Prescription drugs are intended for specific individuals based on their medical needs. Giving your own medication to your child without a doctor's guidance could be dangerous because children have different physiological needs and may react differently to medications. It's possible that the medication isn't appropriate for the child's condition or that the dosage is incorrect. So, this seems like a clearer case of something morally wrong.\n\nNow, considering both scenarios:\n\n- If I think Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is also wrong, that would be option A: Wrong, Wrong.\n\n- If I think Scenario 1 is wrong but Scenario 2 is not wrong, that's option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n- If Scenario 1 is not wrong but Scenario 2 is wrong, that's option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n- If neither scenario is wrong, that's option D: Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nGiven my initial thoughts, I lean towards option C: Not wrong, Wrong. Because throwing bread at a bird seems more like a minor misstep, maybe not morally wrong, whereas giving your own prescription medication to your child seems clearly morally wrong due to the potential risks involved.\n\nBut let me think more about Scenario 1. Is throwing bread at a bird really not morally wrong? Well, morally wrong might be a strong term for it. It's more likely to be considered impolite or potentially harmful to the bird, but not necessarily a moral wrongdoing on the same level as endangering a child's health.\n\nMaybe option D: Not wrong, Not wrong is more appropriate. But I'm not sure about that because giving medication to a child without a doctor's advice does seem morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option B: Wrong, Not wrong makes sense if I consider throwing bread at a bird as wrong due to potential harm to the animal, while giving medication to your child without consultation is not necessarily wrong if you believe it's helpful.\n\nWait, but giving medication not prescribed for the child seems risky and potentially harmful. So, maybe Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nI need to make a decision. Based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 1 is not necessarily so. Therefore, the answer is option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
