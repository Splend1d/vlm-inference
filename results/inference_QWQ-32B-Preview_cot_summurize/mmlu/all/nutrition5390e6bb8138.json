The general recommendation is to consume an additional 340 calories per day in the second trimester and an additional 450 calories per day in the third trimester compared to non-pregnant levels. However, the option provided suggests \"an additional 200 kCal throughout pregnancy,\" which might be a simplified or approximate guideline. It's important for pregnant women to consult with their healthcare providers for personalized nutrition advice based on their specific health and pregnancy circumstances."
