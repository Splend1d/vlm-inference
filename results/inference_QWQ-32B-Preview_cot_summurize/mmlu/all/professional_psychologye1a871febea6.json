                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to compare Asian and Asian-American therapy clients to Anglo clients based on what experts say. So, there are four options here:\n\nA. They prefer a less directive therapeutic approach.\n\nB. They are more focused on the present moment rather than the past or future.\n\nC. They do better when setting goals is put off.\n\nD. They often talk about emotional issues as physical symptoms.\n\nHmm, I need to think about which one is most accurate according to experts.\n\nFirst, option A says they prefer a less directive approach. I think in some cultures, especially Asian ones, there might be a preference for the therapist to be more of a guide rather than telling them what to do. So, maybe A is correct.\n\nOption B mentions being more grounded in the here-and-now. I know that in some therapies, like mindfulness-based approaches, focusing on the present is important, and maybe Asian clients value that more. But I'm not sure if that's universally true.\n\nOption C says they respond better when goal-setting is delayed. I'm not sure about that. In therapy, goal-setting is usually important for most clients, regardless of their background.\n\nOption D talks about expressing emotional problems as physical symptoms. I've heard that in some cultures, it's more acceptable to talk about physical issues rather than emotional ones. So, maybe D is also a valid point.\n\nLet me consider this more carefully. I recall that in some Asian cultures, there might be stigma around mental health, so clients might present physical symptoms instead of emotional ones. That makes sense for option D.\n\nAlso, in terms of therapeutic approach, there might be a preference for a more indirect or less directive style, which is option A.\n\nOption B about being more grounded in the here-and-now\u2014maybe that's more related to certain therapeutic techniques like mindfulness, which might be more aligned with some Asian philosophical traditions. But I'm not sure if that's a universal characteristic of Asian clients.\n\nOption C about delaying goal-setting\u2014I don't recall any specific information about that being particularly relevant to Asian or Asian-American clients.\n\nSo, between A and D, which one is more frequently pointed out by experts?\n\nI think both might be accurate, but perhaps D is more commonly highlighted because of the way emotional issues are expressed in some Asian cultures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is more frequently mentioned because it relates to the therapeutic approach that might be more acceptable to these clients.\n\nMaybe the answer is both A and D, but since I have to choose one, I need to decide which one is more emphasized by experts.\n\nLet me think about the cultural context. In many Asian cultures, there's a emphasis on harmony and indirect communication. So, a less directive therapeutic approach might be preferred because it allows the client to explore their thoughts and feelings at their own pace without feeling pressured.\n\nOn the other hand, expressing emotional problems as physical symptoms is also a well-documented phenomenon in cross-cultural psychology. It's known as somatization, where psychological distress is manifested through physical complaints.\n\nGiven that, perhaps D is more universally applicable to Asian and Asian-American clients.\n\nBut A could also be relevant, depending on the therapist's approach and the client's preferences.\n\nMaybe the answer is D, because it's a common pattern observed in cross-cultural therapy settings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps experts point out both A and D, but if I have to choose one, maybe D is more frequently mentioned.\n\nWait, the question says \"the experts frequently point out that the former...\" and \"the former\" refers to Asian and Asian-American therapy clients.\n\nSo, it's asking which characteristic is most frequently pointed out by experts regarding Asian and Asian-American clients compared to Anglo clients.\n\nGiven that, I think D is more likely to be the answer because it pertains to how clients present their issues, which is a crucial aspect for therapists to be aware of.\n\nOption A is about therapeutic approach preference, which might be important, but perhaps not as universally applicable or as frequently highlighted as D.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with D: Asian and Asian-American therapy clients are likely to express emotional problems as somatic symptoms compared to Anglo clients.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
