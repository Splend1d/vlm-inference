The question is: \"According to Stevenson, moral disagreements involve:\n\nA. disagreement in interest.\n\nB. disagreement in belief.\n\nC. disagreement in theory.\n\nD. disagreement in practice.\"\n\nI need to recall Stevenson's perspective on moral disagreements. I think he was a philosopher who worked on ethical language and the meaning of moral terms. I believe he is associated with the emotive theory of ethics, which suggests that moral statements express emotions or attitudes rather than factual claims.\n\nGiven that, I need to think about how moral disagreements would be characterized in his view. If moral statements express feelings or attitudes, then disagreements in morality might involve disagreements in these expressed emotions or attitudes.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Disagreement in interest. Interest might relate to what someone values or finds important. If moral statements express attitudes towards certain actions or states of affairs, then disagreements could be about differing interests or values.\n\nB. Disagreement in belief. Beliefs are about what is factually the case. If moral statements are not about factual claims but about emotions, then perhaps disagreements aren't primarily about beliefs.\n\nC. Disagreement in theory. This might refer to differing theoretical frameworks or moral theories. While people may hold different moral theories, Stevenson's emotivism suggests that moral statements are more about attitudes than about theoretical positions.\n\nD. Disagreement in practice. This could refer to disagreements in action or behavior. While moral disagreements may lead to different practices, Stevenson's focus seems to be on the expressive function of moral language rather than on practical differences per se.\n\nConsidering Stevenson's emotivism, I think the core of moral disagreements lies in differing attitudes or interests rather than in beliefs or theoretical differences. So, option A, \"disagreement in interest,\" seems most aligned with his view.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe Stevenson discussed moral disagreements in terms of both beliefs and interests. I recall that he might have considered that moral discourse involves both an expressive function and a persuasive function. So, people might disagree in their emotional attitudes (interests) and also try to influence others' beliefs about the facts relevant to those attitudes.\n\nHowever, since the question seems to be asking for the type of disagreement involved according to Stevenson, and given that emotivism emphasizes the expressive aspect of moral language, I think the primary disagreement is in interests or attitudes.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option A, \"disagreement in interest.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
