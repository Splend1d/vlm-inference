                    "text": "Let's see. I've got this question here: \"What part of the world was once known as Cathay?\" and the options are China, India, Iran, and Indonesia. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nI think Cathay is an old name for China. I've heard it referred to like that in some books or movies, you know, like in Marco Polo's time or something. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look it up or think about it more.\n\nLet me recall what I know about Marco Polo. He was a Venetian traveler who went to Asia in the 13th century and his travels introduced Europe to China. In his book, \"The Travels of Marco Polo,\" he referred to the country he visited as Cathay. So that makes me think it's China.\n\nBut maybe Cathay refers to a specific region in China, not the whole country. Or perhaps it's a different country altogether. I shouldn't assume too quickly.\n\nLet me consider the other options. India is a possibility, but I don't recall India being called Cathay. India was often referred to as Hindustan or Bollywood, but not Cathay, I think.\n\nIran used to be called Persia, right? I don't think Cathay was ever a name for Iran.\n\nIndonesia is in Southeast Asia, known for its islands. I don't think it was called Cathay either.\n\nSo, going back to China, I recall that in medieval Europe, China was often referred to as Cathay. The term seems to have come from the Persian word for China, which is \"Khitan.\" The Khitans were a nomadic people who lived in northeastern China and Mongolia around the 10th century.\n\nSo, Cathay might be a corruption of Khitan. That would make sense, as Europeans getting their information from Persia or other Middle Eastern sources might have used that term.\n\nMoreover, in English, the term Cathay was used to describe northern China, while Mangi referred to southern China during the time of the Yuan dynasty.\n\nIn modern literature, T.S. Eliot's poem \"The Waste Land\" mentions \"Summer night in Boston, Ladies' half holiday, Coping with the traffic, Coping with the heat, Frustration of desire, The whole long summer through, The summer evening pushes back its chair, And then takes up the talk again, And then the talk dies, and the night comes on, And then the city is asleep, And the river flows on, And the boats go up and down, And
