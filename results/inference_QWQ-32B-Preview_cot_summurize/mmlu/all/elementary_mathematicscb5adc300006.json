Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that in an equation, both sides are equal. So, 3 plus some number p equals 15. I need to find out what that p is. Maybe I can think of it like this: if I have 3 apples and someone gives me some more apples, and now I have 15 apples, how many apples did that person give me? That makes sense.\n\nSo, to find p, I can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. That way, I'll isolate p on one side. Let's do that:\n\n3 + p - 3 = 15 - 3\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\np = 12\n\nOkay, so according to this, p equals 12. Now, let's check the options. Option C is 12, so that seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can plug in the values from the other options to see if they work.\n\nLet's try option A: p = 3\n\n3 + 3 = 6, which is not equal to 15. So, that's not right.\n\nOption B: p = 5\n\n3 + 5 = 8, which is also not 15.\n\nOption C: p = 12\n\n3 + 12 = 15, which matches the equation.\n\nOption D: p = 18\n\n3 + 18 = 21, which is too big.\n\nSo, only option C satisfies the equation. I think I've got it right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of undoing the operation. Since the equation is 3 plus p equals 15, to find p, I need to undo the addition of 3 by subtracting 3 from both sides. That again leads me to p = 12.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider what number, when added to 3, gives 15. Well, starting from 3, I need to get to 15. If I count up from 3 to 15, I'm adding 12. So, p must be 12.\n\nI feel confident with this answer now. It's clear that p equals 12, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
