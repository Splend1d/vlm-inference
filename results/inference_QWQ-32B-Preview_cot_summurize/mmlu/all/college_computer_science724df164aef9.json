                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these language features requires stack-based storage allocation instead of static allocation. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nFirst, option A: recursive procedures. Recursion is when a function calls itself, possibly multiple times, and each call needs its own set of local variables. In static allocation, memory is allocated at compile time, which means the amount of memory for each function's local variables is fixed. But with recursion, especially if the depth of recursion isn't known ahead of time, you need a way to handle an unknown number of function calls, each with their own local variables. That's where the stack comes in\u2014it can dynamically allocate memory for each function call as needed. So, recursive procedures typically require stack-based allocation.\n\nOption B: arbitrary goto's. Goto statements allow jumping to different parts of the code, but I don't see how that directly relates to memory allocation. Static allocation should handle goto statements just fine, as long as the memory for variables is allocated appropriately. Goto's don't inherently require dynamic memory allocation.\n\nOption C: two-dimensional arrays. Arrays can be statically allocated if their sizes are known at compile time. Even two-dimensional arrays can be allocated statically. You just need to know the dimensions ahead of time. So, unless the sizes are determined at runtime, there's no need for stack-based allocation here.\n\nOption D: integer-valued functions. Functions that return integer values don't necessarily require stack-based allocation. If the function is not recursive and doesn't have local variables that need dynamic allocation, static allocation should suffice.\n\nConsidering all these, it seems like option A, recursive procedures, is the one that requires stack-based storage allocation rather than static allocation. The stack allows for the dynamic allocation of memory for each recursive call, which is essential when the recursion depth isn't known ahead of time.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about whether any of the other options might also require stack-based allocation.\n\nFor option B, arbitrary goto's, I can't think of a scenario where goto's would necessitate stack-based allocation. Goto's are more about control flow than memory management.\n\nFor option C, two-dimensional arrays, as long as the sizes are known at compile time, static allocation is sufficient. If the sizes are determined at runtime, then dynamic allocation might be needed, but that would typically involve the heap, not the stack.\n\nFor option D, integer-valued functions, again, unless there's recursion or dynamic scoping involved, static allocation should handle them just fine.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is A, recursive procedures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
