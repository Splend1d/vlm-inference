                    "text": "Let's see. I've got this question about general partnerships and profit sharing. So, in a general partnership, partners agree on certain terms, and in this case, they've only agreed on voting percentages, which are unequal. I need to figure out which statement best describes how they share profits.\n\nOption A says that partners share in proportion to their contributions to the capital and assets of the partnership. Hmm, that sounds plausible. Often, in partnerships, profits are divided based on how much each partner has invested or contributed. But the question mentions that they've only agreed on voting percentages, not on how they share profits or contributions. So, maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B says that partners share in proportion to their voting percentage. Okay, that makes sense too. If they've agreed on voting percentages, maybe their profit sharing is based on those same percentages. That seems logical, especially since voting rights might correlate with their investment or influence in the partnership.\n\nOption C says that partners share equally. Well, if they've agreed on unequal voting percentages, it's unlikely that they share profits equally. That would be inconsistent, right? So, this option probably isn't correct.\n\nOption D says that partners cannot share until they unanimously agree upon a distribution. That seems a bit extreme. In partnerships, usually, there are agreed-upon rules for profit sharing, even if they have to refer to default rules set by law. Saying that they can't share until they unanimously agree might paralyze the partnership. So, this doesn't sound right.\n\nLet me think again. In a general partnership, if the partners haven't agreed on how to share profits and losses, most jurisdictions have default rules. For example, in many places, profits and losses are shared equally among partners, regardless of their capital contributions or voting rights. But in this case, they have agreed on voting percentages, which are unequal.\n\nWait, maybe the voting percentages imply some sort of ownership or contribution level. If that's the case, perhaps the profit sharing is based on those voting percentages. But the question doesn't specify that the voting percentages are based on contributions. Voting rights could be based on different factors, like the amount of work each partner puts in, or their experience, or other agreements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the profit sharing is determined by the partners' contributions to the capital and assets, as option A suggests. But again, the question only mentions that they've agreed on voting percentages, not on contributions.\n\nOption D seems too extreme, as I thought earlier. It's unlikely that partners can't share profits until they unanimously agree each time.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is option B: partners share in proportion to their voting percentage. It's directly related to what they have agreed upon, which is the voting percentages.\n\nBut let me check if there's any legal principle that supports this. In many partnership laws, if partners haven't agreed on profit sharing, it defaults to equal sharing. However, if they have agreed on something, like voting percentages, maybe that agreement can be interpreted to include profit sharing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the voting percentages are only for decision-making within the partnership, and profit sharing is a separate matter. If that's the case, then perhaps option A is correct, that they share based on their contributions.\n\nWait, but the question says they've only agreed on voting percentage and the voting shares are unequal. It doesn't mention any agreement on profit sharing or contributions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the default rule applies, which is equal sharing of profits, unless otherwise agreed. But they haven't agreed on profit sharing; they've only agreed on voting percentages.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is correct: partners share equally.\n\nBut that seems contradictory because if voting percentages are unequal, you'd think that their shares in the partnership, including profits, would be unequal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the voting percentages indicate their ownership percentages, and thus their profit sharing percentages.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Let's consider an example. Suppose there are two partners, Alice and Bob. Alice has 60% voting rights, and Bob has 40%. If they haven't specified how to share profits, but have agreed on voting rights, perhaps their profit sharing is in line with their voting rights.\n\nBut again, maybe voting rights are separate from profit sharing. Perhaps Alice has more voting rights because she has more experience or she handles more responsibilities in the partnership, but her profit share is different.\n\nGiven that, perhaps without a specific agreement on profit sharing, the default rule applies, which is equal sharing.\n\nBut I feel like that might not be the case here. Maybe in some jurisdictions, the voting percentages are taken as indicative of the partners' interests in the partnership, including profit sharing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the profit sharing is determined by the partners' capital contributions, as option A suggests.\n\nBut the question doesn't mention anything about capital contributions; it only mentions voting percentages.\n\nI think the key here is that they've only agreed on voting percentages, and those are unequal.\n\nGiven that, and looking at the options:\n\nA: Sharing based on contributions. But contributions aren't mentioned.\n\nB: Sharing based on voting percentage. That seems directly related to what they've agreed upon.\n\nC: Equal sharing. But voting percentages are unequal, so equal sharing might not make sense.\n\nD: Can't share until unanimous agreement. That seems impractical.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most appropriate.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor.\n\nPerhaps there's a legal principle that states that in the absence of an agreement on profit sharing, it defaults to equal sharing, regardless of voting percentages.\n\nIf that's the case, then option C would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the voting percentages are taken as the basis for profit sharing in the absence of a specific agreement on profit sharing.\n\nIn that case, option B would be correct.\n\nGiven that, and since the question is about which statement best describes the profit sharing relationship, and they've only agreed on voting percentages, I think option B is the best answer.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Partners share in proportion to their voting percentage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
