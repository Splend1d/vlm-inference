Specifically, these mutations affect genes that are essential for the proper functioning of the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing components of cells.\n\nMitochondrial DNA is inherited solely from the mother, which is why LHON often follows a maternal inheritance pattern. The most common mutations associated with LHON are G11778A, G3460A, and T14484C, all of which occur in mtDNA.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. mitochondrial DNA.\n\nOptions A, B, and C refer to nuclear chromosomes, which are not the source of the mutations causing Leber's hereditary optic atrophy."
