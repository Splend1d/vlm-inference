                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this multiple-choice question about the absence of a political party solely dedicated to labor and working-class issues in the United States. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that the absence proves U.S. politicians are not concerned about serving working-class constituencies. Hmm, that seems a bit too straightforward. Just because there isn't a single party focused solely on labor doesn't necessarily mean that politicians don't care about working-class issues. Both major parties, Democrats and Republicans, have policies that aim to address working-class concerns, albeit in different ways. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption B suggests that it's due to government restrictions on the political activities of labor unions. I do know that there have been regulations on how unions can engage in politics, like the Taft-Hartley Act, which limits union political expenditures. But I'm not sure if these restrictions are severe enough to prevent the formation of a labor party. Maybe this could be a contributing factor, but it might not be the main reason.\n\nOption C states that it reflects the difficulty of unifying a party around a single issue in a \"winner-take-all\" format. This seems plausible. The U.S. has a first-past-the-post electoral system, which tends to favor a two-party system. Third parties often struggle to gain traction because of this system, and focusing on a single issue like labor might make it harder to appeal to a broad enough base to be competitive. So, this could be a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nOption D says that it demonstrates that, in the United States, most political issues regarding workers have been decided in the workers' favor. This seems optimistic and perhaps naive. While the U.S. has made progress in labor rights over the years, there are still many issues and controversies surrounding workers' rights, income inequality, and the like. It's unlikely that all workers' issues have been satisfactorily resolved.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems the most reasonable. The difficulty of unifying a party around a single issue in a winner-take-all system is a significant barrier to the formation of a labor party in the U.S. The electoral system tends to marginalize third parties, and focusing solely on labor issues might not appeal to enough voters to make a labor party viable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
