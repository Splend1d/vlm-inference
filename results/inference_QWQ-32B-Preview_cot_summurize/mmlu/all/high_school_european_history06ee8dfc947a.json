                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Roland Doregel\u00e8s about the announcement of mobilization in France in 1914, leading up to World War I. It's a pretty intense scene, with people reacting strongly to the news of war. Let's see what it's saying and try to understand the inference about Clemenceau.\n\nFirst, there's this sense of urgency and excitement in the way the narrator describes running to the Rue Drout and reading the announcement about mobilization starting on August 2nd. It's directed at a million and a half Frenchmen, so it's a big deal. The narrator is described as \"dead tired but exhilarated,\" which suggests a mix of exhaustion from the events and excitement about what's to come.\n\nThen, the narrator goes back to the newspaper office and bursts into Clemenceau's office, telling him, \"Paris is singing, sir!\" Clemenceau replies, \"It will be all right then.\" So, from this interaction, we're supposed to infer something about Clemenceau's feelings or thoughts about the situation.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. was disgusted to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war\n\nB. had grave doubts about France's ability to win a war against Germany\n\nC. would one day serve as prime minister of France\n\nD. was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war\n\nLet's consider each one.\n\nOption A suggests disgust. But from Clemenceau's response, \"It will be all right then,\" it doesn't seem like he's disgusted. If he was disgusted, he might have reacted differently, maybe with disappointment or anger. But his response is more positive.\n\nOption B mentions grave doubts about France's ability to win. Again, his response seems optimistic. \"It will be all right then\" suggests that he's reassured by the fact that Paris is reacting with joy. If he had grave doubts, he might have expressed concern or skepticism.\n\nOption C is about Clemenceau eventually becoming prime minister. While it's historically accurate that Clemenceau did serve as prime minister of France, especially during World War I, this option is more about his future role rather than inferring his state of mind from this specific interaction. So, it might not be the best fit for the inference based on this passage.\n\nOption D says he was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war. This seems to align well with his response. \"It will be all right then\" implies that he's reassured or relieved by the public's positive reaction to the mobilization.\n\nSo, between the options, D seems the most fitting. He's not disgusted; he's not expressing doubts; and while his future political role is known, it's not directly inferable from this specific interaction. Therefore, the inference that he was relieved by the public's joyful reaction to the war seems the most accurate based on the text.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
