I've learned that things like burning fossil fuels and deforestation release a lot of gases like carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.\n\nOption B seems silly. Politicians talking a lot wouldn't cause global warming; it's more about their policies and actions. Option C mentions CFCs, which I know are involved in depleting the ozone layer, but I'm not sure if they directly cause global warming. And option D, while forest fires do release greenhouse gases, I don't think they're the main cause of global warming. It's probably more of a contributing factor.\n\nSo, I think A is the best answer because it's widely accepted that human activities increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
