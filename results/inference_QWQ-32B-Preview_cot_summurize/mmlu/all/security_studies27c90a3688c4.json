                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the postcolonial approach. I need to pick the statement that's true within this perspective. First, I should understand what postcolonialism is all about. It's a school of thought that looks at the cultural and political legacy of colonialism, right? It examines how colonial experiences continue to shape the world, especially in terms of power relations between former colonies and colonizers.\n\nOption A says: \"The international system is shaped through colonised discourse that establishes notions of certain states as inferior to others.\" This sounds familiar. Postcolonial theory often critiques how Western narratives and discourses have categorized non-Western societies as inferior, primitive, or backward. This discourse persists in international relations, influencing how states are perceived and treated on the global stage. So, this seems like a valid point.\n\nOption B: \"European practices of free trade and democracy are best suited to creating a peaceful and stable international system.\" Hmm, this sounds more like a neoliberal or classical liberal perspective. Postcolonialism is critical of such universal claims, arguing that what works for one region may not work for another due to different historical and cultural contexts. It questions the idea that Western models are superior or universally applicable. So, this doesn't align with postcolonial thought.\n\nOption C: \"With the end of the Second World War and gradual dissolution of the British Empire, much of postcolonialism is redundant.\" This seems misguided. Postcolonialism isn't just about the existence of colonial empires; it's about the lasting effects of colonialism after formal independence. Many argue that neocolonialism persists through economic domination, cultural imperialism, and unequal power relations. So, even after decolonization, postcolonial analysis remains relevant.\n\nOption D: \"Colonial power exists only through the military actions of occupying states.\" This is too narrow. Postcolonial theory emphasizes that power operates in multiple dimensions\u2014economic, cultural, ideological, etc.\u2014beyond just military force. Colonial power can be exerted through control of resources, imposition of languages and education systems, and shaping global norms and institutions. So, this option underestimates the complexity of colonial power.\n\nComparing all these, Option A seems to be the most accurate within the postcolonial approach. It highlights the role of discourse in maintaining hierarchies in the international system, which aligns with postcolonial critiques of how knowledge and representation are used to justify and perpetuate inequality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
