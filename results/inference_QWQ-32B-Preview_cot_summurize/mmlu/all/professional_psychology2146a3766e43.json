                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to recall Kohlberg's cognitive-developmental theory on gender-role acquisition. I think he proposed several stages that children go through as they understand their gender identity.\n\nFirst, there's something about gender identity, where kids start to label themselves as boys or girls. Then, there's gender stability, which is the understanding that their gender remains the same over time. After that, there's gender constancy, which is the understanding that gender remains the same across different situations and appearances.\n\nBut the question is asking for the initial stage. Let me think. Gender identity seems like it would be the first step\u2014knowing whether you're a boy or a girl. Before you can understand that your gender stays the same over time (stability), you need to know what your gender is.\n\nWait, but there's also gender affirmation mentioned in the options. I'm not sure what that is exactly. Maybe it's related to confirming their gender identity through social roles or something. But I think it's not the initial stage.\n\nSo, between gender identity, gender stability, and gender constancy, I think gender identity is the first step. You have to know your gender before you can understand that it's stable and constant.\n\nBut let me double-check. Kohlberg's theory is about how children develop an understanding of gender, and it progresses from a basic awareness of gender to a more sophisticated understanding of its constancy.\n\nI think the sequence is:\n\n1. Gender identity: recognizing and labeling one's own gender.\n\n2. Gender stability: understanding that their gender remains the same over time.\n\n3. Gender constancy: understanding that gender is invariant across different contexts and appearances.\n\nSo, the initial stage should be gender identity.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. gender affirmation\n\nB. gender identity\n\nC. gender constancy\n\nD. gender stability.\n\nI think B, gender identity, is the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure about \"gender affirmation.\" I think it might not be a standard term in Kohlberg's theory. Maybe it's included to confuse me.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider all options.\n\nIf gender identity is the first stage, then that would make sense. But maybe gender stability is the initial stage.\n\nWait, no. You need to know your gender identity before you can understand its stability.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be completely sure, I should review Kohlberg's theory.\n\nKohlberg proposed that children go through three stages of gender development:\n\n1. Gender identity: children can label themselves as boy or girl (around age 2-3).\n\n2. Gender stability: understanding that their gender remains the same over time (around age 3-5).\n\n3. Gender constancy: understanding that gender is invariant across different situations and appearances (around age 5-7).\n\nSo, according to this, gender identity is indeed the initial stage.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. gender identity.\n\nBut wait, the question is worded a bit tricky. It says \"identifies which of the following as the initial stage of gender-role acquisition.\"\n\nI need to make sure that gender identity is indeed the first stage in gender-role acquisition according to Kohlberg.\n\nYes, it makes sense. First, you have to know your gender to start acquiring gender roles associated with it.\n\nSo, I'm confident that B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
