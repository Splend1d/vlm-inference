                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about sexual behavior among different ethnic groups. The question is: \"________ men, on average, begin engaging in sexual intercourse approximately two years later than ________ men do.\" And we have to fill in the blanks with the options provided.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Mexican Americans and whites; African Americans\n\nB. Mexican Americans; African Americans and whites\n\nC. African Americans; whites and Latinos\n\nD. Whites; African Americans and Latinos\n\nI need to recall or think about which group tends to start having sex later compared to others. I know that there are studies on sexual behavior and age of first intercourse across different ethnic groups in the US.\n\nFrom what I remember, African American men tend to start having sex at a younger age compared to white and Latino men. So, if that's the case, then the first blank should be the groups that start later, which would be whites and Latinos, and the second blank would be African Americans.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A says Mexican Americans and whites begin later than African Americans. But Latinos include Mexican Americans, so maybe this is partially correct.\n\nOption B says Mexican Americans begin later than African Americans and whites. That might not be accurate if whites also start later than African Americans.\n\nOption C says African Americans begin later than whites and Latinos, but I think it's the opposite.\n\nOption D says whites begin later than African Americans and Latinos. That doesn't align with what I recall.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. The sentence is \"________ men begin engaging in sexual intercourse approximately two years later than ________ men do.\"\n\nSo, the first blank is for the group that starts later, and the second blank is for the group that starts earlier.\n\nIf African American men start earlier than whites and Latinos, then the first blank should be whites and Latinos, and the second blank should be African Americans.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: Mexican Americans and whites begin later than African Americans. That could be possible, but it specifies Mexican Americans and whites, not including Latinos in general.\n\nOption B: Mexican Americans begin later than African Americans and whites. That might not be accurate if whites also begin later than African Americans.\n\nOption C: African Americans begin later than whites and Latinos. That seems incorrect based on my initial thought.\n\nOption D: Whites begin later than African Americans and Latinos. Again, that doesn't align with my recall.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider that Latinos include Mexican Americans, and perhaps there are differences within Latino subgroups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that Mexican Americans and whites begin later than African Americans, which is option A.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because I think whites and Latinos may have similar patterns, with African Americans starting earlier.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nIf I choose option A: Mexican Americans and whites begin later than African Americans. That would mean that African Americans start earlier, which aligns with my initial thought.\n\nOption B: Mexican Americans begin later than African Americans and whites. That would suggest that both African Americans and whites start earlier than Mexican Americans.\n\nOption C: African Americans begin later than whites and Latinos. That seems contrary to what I think I know.\n\nOption D: Whites begin later than African Americans and Latinos. Again, that doesn't align with my recall.\n\nSo, between these options, option A seems the most plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that African Americans start earlier than both whites and Latinos, so whites and Latinos start later than African Americans.\n\nBut option A says Mexican Americans and whites start later than African Americans.\n\nIs it possible that Mexican Americans start later than African Americans but not necessarily all Latinos?\n\nI'm a bit confused because Latinos include Mexican Americans, but there might be differences within Latino subgroups.\n\nMaybe I need to think about average ages of first intercourse across these groups.\n\nI recall that African American men tend to start having sex at a younger age compared to white and Latino men, on average.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then whites and Latinos start later than African Americans.\n\nTherefore, the first blank should be whites and Latinos, and the second blank should be African Americans.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: Mexican Americans and whites; African Americans.\n\nBut does \"Mexican Americans and whites\" represent whites and Latinos collectively?\n\nWell, Mexican Americans are a subset of Latinos, but not all Latinos are Mexican Americans.\n\nSo, perhaps this option is partially correct, but it might be excluding other Latino groups.\n\nOption B: Mexican Americans; African Americans and whites.\n\nThis would suggest that Mexican Americans start later than both African Americans and whites.\n\nBut if African Americans start earlier than whites, then this might not be accurate.\n\nOption C: African Americans; whites and Latinos.\n\nThis would suggest that African Americans start later than whites and Latinos, which contradicts my initial thought.\n\nOption D: Whites; African Americans and Latinos.\n\nThis would suggest that whites start later than African Americans and Latinos, which also contradicts my recall.\n\nGiven these options, option A seems the most plausible, even though it might not include all Latino subgroups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that whites begin engaging in sexual intercourse approximately two years later than African Americans do, and Latinos have similar patterns to whites.\n\nIn that case, maybe option A is the best choice among the given options.\n\nTherefore, I will go with option A: Mexican Americans and whites begin engaging in sexual intercourse approximately two years later than African Americans do.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
