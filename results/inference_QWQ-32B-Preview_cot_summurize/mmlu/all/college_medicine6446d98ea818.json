We need to find which of the given options represents a DNA segment that has undergone both a point mutation and a deletion.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a point mutation and a deletion are:\n\n1. **Point Mutation**: This is a change in a single nucleotide base. It could be a substitution, where one base is replaced by another, or a insertion, where an extra base is added.\n\n2. **Deletion**: This is when one or more nucleotide bases are removed from the sequence.\n\nIn this case, the problem specifies both a point mutation and a deletion have occurred.\n\nLet's look at the original sequence again: 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019\n\nNow, let's examine each option to see which one fits the criteria of having both a point mutation and a deletion.\n\n**Option A: 5\u2019 \u2013 GCATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019**\n\nCompare this to the original:\n\nOriginal: GGATCCTCATG\n\nOption A: GCATCCTCATG\n\nDifference: The second G is changed to C.\n\nThis seems like a point mutation where G \u2192 C, but there is no deletion here. So, this only has a point mutation, not both.\n\n**Option B: 5\u2019 \u2013 TGATCCCAG \u2013 3\u2019**\n\nCompare this to the original:\n\nOriginal: GGATCCTCATG\n\nOption B: TGATCCCAG\n\nThis looks different in multiple places, and also seems shorter. Let's count the bases:\n\nOriginal has 13 bases: G G A T C C T C A T G\n\nOption B has 9 bases: T G A T C C C A G\n\nSo, there are deletions here. But it's not clear if there's a specific point mutation along with the deletions. It seems like multiple changes have occurred, but it's not straightforward to trace.\n\n**Option C: 5\u2019 \u2013 GGTCCTCATC \u2013 3\u2019**\n\nCompare this to the original:\n\nOriginal: GGATCCTCATG\n\nOption C: GGTCCTCATC\n\nDifference: The fourth base A is changed to T, and the last base G is deleted.\n\nSo, here we have a point mutation (A \u2192 T) and a deletion of the last G. This fits the criteria of both a point mutation and a deletion.\n\n**Option D: 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCATG \u2013 3\u2019**\n\nCompare this to the original:\n\nOriginal: GGATCCTCATG\n\nOption D: GGATCCATG\n\nDifference: The sixth base T is deleted.\n\nThis only shows a deletion, no point mutation.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option C seems to be the correct answer because it has both a point mutation (A \u2192 T) and a deletion (the last G is missing).\n\nHowever, let's double-check to make sure.\n\nOriginal sequence: 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019\n\nOption C: 5\u2019 \u2013 GGTCCTCATC \u2013 3\u2019\n\nLet's align them:\n\nOriginal: GGATCCTCATG\n\nOption C: GGTCCTCATC\n\n- First two bases: GG (no change)\n\n- Third base: A \u2192 T (point mutation)\n\n- Fourth to eighth bases: TCC (no change)\n\n- Ninth base: A (no change)\n\n- Tenth base: T (no change)\n\n- Eleventh base: G is missing (deletion)\n\nYes, this matches our earlier assessment.\n\nOption A only has a point mutation, Option B has multiple changes that are not clearly a single point mutation and deletion, and Option D only has a deletion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
