I recall that in some groups, different elements can have the same square. For example, consider the group of integers under addition. Let's take a = 1 and b = -1. Then a \u2260 b, but a\u00b2 = 1\u00b2 = 1 and b\u00b2 = (-1)\u00b2 = 1, so a\u00b2 = b\u00b2. This is a counterexample, so Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\n\nI need to recall what a dihedral group is. Dihedral groups represent the symmetries of a regular polygon, including both rotations and reflections. The rotations in a dihedral group correspond to rotating the polygon by multiples of 360\u00b0 divided by the number of sides.\n\nFor example, in D\u2099, the dihedral group of order 2n, the rotations form a subgroup of order n. This subgroup is cyclic because it is generated by a single element, usually denoted by r, where r represents a rotation by 360\u00b0/n.\n\nSo, the set of rotations in a dihedral group does indeed form a cyclic subgroup. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement 1 is false.\n\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
