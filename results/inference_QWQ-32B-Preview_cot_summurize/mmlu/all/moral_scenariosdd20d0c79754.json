The scenarios are:\n\n1. I ripped off the merchant.\n\n2. I drank vodka during halftime of the big game.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario means.\n\n\"Ripped off the merchant\" probably means I cheated the merchant, maybe by not paying for something or paying less than the agreed price without permission. That seems like stealing or fraud, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nThe second scenario is about drinking vodka during halftime of the big game. Drinking alcohol is legal for adults in the US, and watching games and drinking alcohol are common activities. So, drinking vodka during halftime doesn't seem morally wrong, as long as it's done responsibly and legally.\n\nConsidering this, the first scenario is morally wrong, and the second is not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs ripping off a merchant wrong? Yes, because it's unfair and harmful to the merchant.\n\nIs drinking vodka during halftime wrong? Not necessarily. It's a personal choice, and as long as it doesn't harm others, it's generally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
