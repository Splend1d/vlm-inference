                    "text": "So I've got this question about MergeSort and which data structures allow it to run in O(n log n) time. The options are singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and arrays. I need to figure out which of these allow MergeSort to maintain its O(n log n) time complexity.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how MergeSort works. MergeSort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges them back together. The key steps are dividing the list, sorting the sublists, and merging them.\n\nNow, the time complexity of MergeSort is O(n log n) because it divides the list into log n levels and at each level, it processes all n elements during the merge step.\n\nThe question is about which data structures allow this time complexity to be maintained. So, I need to think about how the choice of data structure affects these steps.\n\nLet's consider each data structure one by one.\n\n**I. A singly linked list**\n\nSingly linked lists allow traversal in one direction only, from the head to the tail. Splitting a linked list in half can be done in O(n) time by finding the middle using the two-pointer technique. Merging two sorted linked lists can also be done in O(n) time, where n is the total number of elements in both lists.\n\nSince both splitting and merging can be done in linear time, and the division is logarithmic, the overall time complexity should remain O(n log n). So, it seems like a singly linked list should work fine for MergeSort in O(n log n) time.\n\n**II. A doubly linked list**\n\nDoubly linked lists allow traversal in both directions, which can be useful in some algorithms. However, for MergeSort, the ability to traverse in both directions isn't necessarily beneficial because MergeSort primarily requires splitting and merging, which can be done with forward traversal only.\n\nSimilar to singly linked lists, splitting and merging can be done in O(n) time, so the overall time complexity should still be O(n log n). Therefore, a doubly linked list should also allow MergeSort to work in O(n log n) time.\n\n**III. An array**\n\nArrays are random-access data structures, meaning you can access any element in constant time, O(1). This property is very useful for MergeSort because splitting the array into halves can be done by calculating indices, which is O(1) operation. Merging also benefits from random access, as you can easily compare elements from different halves without traversing the array.\n\nHowever, one potential issue with arrays is that merging might require additional space. In the standard MergeSort for arrays, we often use a temporary array to merge the sorted halves, which is O(n) space. But in terms of time complexity, merging two sorted subarrays still takes O(n) time, so the overall time complexity remains O(n log n).\n\nTherefore, arrays also allow MergeSort to work in O(n log n) time.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard that MergeSort might not be as efficient on arrays due to the overhead of copying elements during the merge step, whereas linked lists might be more efficient because you can just rearrange pointers. But in terms of time complexity, it's still O(n log n) for both.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like all three data structures\u2014singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and arrays\u2014allow MergeSort to work in O(n log n) time.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any catch here.\n\nIs there any data structure among these three where MergeSort wouldn't run in O(n log n) time?\n\nLooking back, in singly linked lists, splitting requires traversing to the middle, which is O(n), and merging is O(n). Similarly, in doubly linked lists, it's the same. In arrays, splitting is O(1), and merging is O(n). So, in all cases, the time complexity remains O(n log n).\n\nI think the answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\nBut the options include \"None,\" \"III only,\" \"I and II only,\" and \"I, II, and III.\" Since I think all three allow MergeSort to work in O(n log n) time, D should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a consideration I'm missing regarding the data structures.\n\nLet me think about the merging step in more detail.\n\nIn linked lists, merging can be done in-place by rearranging pointers, which is efficient. In arrays, merging typically requires an auxiliary array, which adds space complexity, but not time complexity.\n\nHowever, there is an in-place merge sort for arrays, but it's more complicated and doesn't maintain the O(n log n) time complexity as consistently as the standard MergeSort with an auxiliary array.\n\nBut the question is about time complexity, not space complexity. So, even if arrays require extra space for merging, the time complexity remains O(n log n).\n\nTherefore, I stick with D. I, II, and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
