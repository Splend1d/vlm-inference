                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a man who owns real estate in fee simple, which means he has complete ownership over the property. Then, he transfers a life estate in it to a friend for the friend's lifetime. A life estate means that the friend can use and enjoy the property during his lifetime, but the original owner still retains the fee simple title, which passes to his heirs after his death.\n\nNow, the fee simple owner dies, and at this point, the life estate owner conveys his interest to his children. Then, the deceased fee simple owner's son sues the children, claiming that the life estate is now broken and he owns the property absolutely. The question is asking whether the children of the life estate owner have an enforceable interest in the property.\n\nLet's analyze the options one by one.\n\nOption A: No, the life estate was broken when the owner of the fee simple interest died.\n\nWell, in a standard life estate, the life tenant has the right to use the property during their lifetime, but the fee simple reverts to the original owner or their heirs upon the life tenant's death. However, in this case, the fee simple owner died first, before the life tenant. So, does that break the life estate?\n\nI think in this scenario, since the fee simple owner died first, the life estate would continue as long as the life tenant is alive. The fee simple interest might pass to the fee simple owner's heirs, but the life estate is still in place as long as the life tenant is alive. So, perhaps the life estate isn't broken by the death of the fee simple owner.\n\nOption B: No, the life estate owner is not allowed to convey his interest to other persons.\n\nIs this true? Generally, life tenants have the right to convey their life estate interest to others, unless there are specific restrictions placed on the life estate at the time of its creation. If there are no such restrictions, then the life tenant should be able to convey his interest to his children.\n\nSo, this option seems incorrect because life tenants typically can convey their life estate interest.\n\nOption C: Yes, the life estate owner became the owner in fee simple when the original fee simple owner predeceased him.\n\nWait a minute. If the original fee simple owner dies before the life tenant, does the life tenant then become the fee simple owner?\n\nI don't think so. In a standard life estate, the life tenant only has a life estate interest, not the full fee simple. The fee simple interest would typically pass to the original owner's heirs upon his death, regardless of whether the life tenant is still alive.\n\nSo, it seems unlikely that the life estate owner automatically becomes the fee simple owner when the original fee simple owner dies.\n\nOption D: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.\n\nThis seems consistent with general property law. Life tenants can usually convey their life estate interest to others, subject to any restrictions that may have been placed on the life estate.\n\nGiven that, it seems like option D is the correct answer.\n\nBut let's think about the lawsuit filed by the deceased fee simple owner's son. He's claiming that the life estate is now broken and he owns the property absolutely. If the life estate was properly conveyed to the children, do they have an enforceable interest?\n\nWell, if the life estate was validly conveyed to the children, then they should have an enforceable life estate interest in the property, coexisting with whatever interest the fee simple owner's heirs have.\n\nBut since the fee simple owner died first, his interest would pass to his heirs, and the life estate would continue as long as the life tenant (or in this case, the children who received the life estate) are alive.\n\nSo, the son of the deceased fee simple owner might own the fee simple interest, but the children have a life estate interest that continues until the life tenant's death.\n\nTherefore, the children do have an enforceable interest in the property, which is their life estate interest.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be D: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.\n\nOptions A, B, and C seem incorrect based on this analysis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
