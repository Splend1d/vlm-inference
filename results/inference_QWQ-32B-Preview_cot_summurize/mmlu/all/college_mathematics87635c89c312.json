                    "text": "To determine how many nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices exist, we need to consider the properties of trees and count the distinct structures up to isomorphism.\n\nFirst, recall that a tree is a connected acyclic graph. For a graph with \\( n \\) vertices, a tree has exactly \\( n-1 \\) edges. So, for \\( n = 5 \\), a tree will have \\( 5 - 1 = 4 \\) edges.\n\nOur task is to find all nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices. Two graphs are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices that preserves adjacency.\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **List all possible trees with 5 vertices:**\n\n   Since trees are acyclic and connected, we can start by considering different possible degree sequences or different center structures.\n\n2. **Consider the possible degrees of vertices:**\n\n   In a tree with 5 vertices, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) (since there are 4 edges). Also, a tree must have at least two leaves (vertices of degree 1).\n\n3. **Case 1: One vertex of degree 4 (central vertex):**\n\n   - One vertex is connected to all other four vertices.\n   - This forms a star graph \\( K_{1,4} \\).\n\n4. **Case 2: One vertex of degree 3:**\n\n   - Choose one vertex with degree 3.\n   - The remaining vertices must connect in such a way to maintain connectivity and acyclicity.\n\n   Let's subdivide this case:\n\n   - Subcase 2.1: The remaining vertices have degrees 2, 1, 1.\n\n     - The degree 3 vertex is connected to three other vertices, each of which may or may not be connected further.\n\n     - However, since the graph is a tree, no cycles are allowed.\n\n     - This configuration would look like a central vertex connected to three leaves, but one of the leaves is connected to another vertex, making it degree 2.\n\n     - Wait, but in this setup, if one of the degree 1 vertices is connected to another vertex, it would violate the tree property or create a cycle.\n\n     - Actually, in this subcase, it's similar to the previous case but with one branch having an additional edge.\n\n     - This seems to be a path graph where the central vertex has degree 3.\n\n   - Subcase 2.2: The degrees are 3, 2, 2, 1.\n\n     - This would involve the degree 3 vertex connected to three other vertices, two of which have degree 2 and one has degree 1.\n\n     - This configuration is different from the previous one.\n\n5. **Case 3: All vertices have degree at most 2:**\n\n   - This would be a path graph where vertices are connected in a linear fashion.\n\n   - In this case, the degrees would be 1, 2, 2, 2, 1.\n\n6. **List and visualize the trees:**\n\n   - **Tree 1:** Star graph \\( K_{1,4} \\) with one central vertex connected to four leaves.\n\n   - **Tree 2:** One vertex of degree 3 connected to two vertices of degree 2 and one vertex of degree 1.\n\n     - Wait, this seems similar to the previous subcase.\n\n   - **Tree 3:** A path graph with vertices connected in a straight line: 1-2-3-4-5, where degrees are 1,2,2,2,1.\n\n7. **Check for isomorphism:**\n\n   - **Tree 1:** Star graph \\( K_{1,4} \\).\n\n   - **Tree 2:** Central vertex with degree 3 connected to two degree 2 vertices, which each connect to a leaf.\n\n     - This is different from the star graph because the star graph has only one central vertex connected directly to all leaves, whereas in this tree, the degree 2 vertices act as intermediaries.\n\n   - **Tree 3:** Path graph with all vertices in a straight line.\n\n8. **Verify if there are more possibilities:**\n\n   - Is there a tree with a different structure that isn't isomorphic to any of these?\n\n   - For example, a tree where one vertex has degree 3, connected to one degree 2 vertex and two degree 1 vertices.\n\n     - But this seems similar to Tree 2.\n\n   - Or a tree where one vertex has degree 3, connected to three degree 1 vertices, which is the star graph.\n\n     - Which is Tree 1.\n\n   - The path graph is distinct because its degrees are different.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n\n   - There are three nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices:\n\n     1. Star graph \\( K_{1,4} \\).\n\n     2. Tree with one vertex of degree 3 connected to two degree 2 vertices, each connected to a leaf.\n\n     3. Path graph with degrees 1,2,2,2,1.\n\nTherefore, the number of nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."
