                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick which one is an example of capital as an economic resource. So, first, I should understand what capital means in economics.\n\nI remember that in economics, capital refers to assets that are used to produce goods and services. It's different from financial capital, which is more about money. So, physical capital would be things like machinery, buildings, and tools that help produce stuff.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. A cement mixer - that sounds like a machine used in construction to mix cement. So, that seems like a physical asset used to produce something, which fits the definition of capital.\n\nB. A barrel of crude oil - crude oil is a natural resource, right? It's raw material that can be used to produce other things like gasoline or plastics. But is it considered capital? I think natural resources are categorized separately from capital.\n\nC. A registered nurse - a person with a specific skill set. In economics, people and their skills are considered human capital, which is a bit different from physical capital. Human capital is more about the skills and knowledge that people have, which contribute to production.\n\nD. A share of corporate stock - this seems more like financial capital. Stocks represent ownership in a corporation, and they are traded on financial markets. It's a financial asset, not a physical one used directly in production.\n\nSo, comparing these options, A, the cement mixer, seems to be the best example of capital as an economic resource. It's a physical asset specifically used in the production process.\n\nWait a minute, but what about the share of corporate stock? Could that be considered capital? Well, in a broader sense, financial capital is important for businesses to acquire physical capital, but in the context of this question, which seems to be asking about physical capital, stock might not be the best answer.\n\nAnd the barrel of crude oil, is that capital or a natural resource? I think it's primarily considered a natural resource, especially since it's in its raw form. It hasn't been processed or used in production yet.\n\nAs for the registered nurse, while their skills are valuable in production, human capital is often categorized separately from physical capital.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A, the cement mixer, as it is a physical asset directly used in the production of goods or services.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
