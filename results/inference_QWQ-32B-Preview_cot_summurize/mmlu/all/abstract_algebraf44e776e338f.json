                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to factor the polynomial \\(x^4 + 4\\) into linear factors in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5[x] \\). That means I'm working with coefficients modulo 5, and I need to express this polynomial as a product of linear terms like \\( (x - a) \\), where \\( a \\) is some element in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nFirst, I should recall that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) consists of the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, and all operations are performed modulo 5.\n\nSo, the polynomial is \\( x^4 + 4 \\). I need to find its roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), because each root will give me a linear factor.\n\nLet me try plugging in each element of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) to see if it's a root.\n\nStart with \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 0^4 + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4 \\), which is not congruent to 0 mod 5.\n\nNext, \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\( 1^4 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\), which is congruent to 0 mod 5. So, \\( x = 1 \\) is a root. That means \\( (x - 1) \\) is a factor.\n\nNow, \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\( 2^4 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20 \\), which is congruent to 0 mod 5. So, \\( x = 2 \\) is also a root. Thus, \\( (x - 2) \\) is another factor.\n\nNext, \\( x = 3 \\):\n\n\\( 3^4 + 4 = 81 + 4 = 85 \\), which is congruent to 0 mod 5. So, \\( x = 3 \\) is a root, meaning \\( (x - 3) \\) is a factor.\n\nFinally, \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\( 4^4 + 4 = 256 + 4 = 260 \\), which is congruent to 0 mod 5. So, \\( x = 4 \\) is also a root, and \\( (x - 4) \\) is a factor.\n\nWait a minute, all elements of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) except 0 are roots of this polynomial. But that can't be right because a polynomial of degree 4 can have at most 4 roots, unless it's the zero polynomial.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 0^4 + 4 = 4 \\), which is not 0 mod 5. Correct.\n\nFor \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\( 1^4 + 4 = 5 \\), which is 0 mod 5. Correct.\n\nFor \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\( 2^4 = 16 \\), \\( 16 + 4 = 20 \\), which is 0 mod 5. Correct.\n\nFor \\( x = 3 \\):\n\n\\( 3^4 = 81 \\), \\( 81 + 4 = 85 \\), which is 0 mod 5. Correct.\n\nFor \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\( 4^4 = 256 \\), \\( 256 + 4 = 260 \\), which is 0 mod 5. Correct.\n\nHmm, so all non-zero elements of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) are roots of \\( x^4 + 4 \\). That means the polynomial can be factored as \\( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) \\).\n\nBut wait, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), \\( -1 \\) is the same as \\( 4 \\), \\( -2 \\) is \\( 3 \\), and so on, because \\( -1 + 5 = 4 \\), \\( -2 + 5 = 3 \\), etc.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is \\( (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1) \\). In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), \\( x + 2 = x - 3 \\), since \\( 2 \\equiv -3 \\) mod 5, and \\( x + 1 = x - 4 \\), since \\( 1 \\equiv -4 \\) mod 5.\n\nWait, actually, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), \\( -2 \\equiv 3 \\), and \\( -1 \\equiv 4 \\). So \\( x + 2 = x - 3 \\), and \\( x + 1 = x - 4 \\).\n\nBut in option A, it's \\( (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1) \\), which would be \\( (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 1)(x - 4) \\), since \\( x + 2 = x - 3 \\) and \\( x + 1 = x - 4 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nBut earlier, I found that the roots are 1, 2, 3, and 4, so the factorization should be \\( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) \\), which seems to match option A, considering the equivalences.\n\nBut let me check if there are any repeated roots or if the polynomial can be factored differently.\n\nGiven that all four roots are distinct and correspond to the non-zero elements of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), and since the polynomial is of degree 4, it should factor completely into these linear factors without repetition.\n\nTherefore, the factorization should be \\( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) \\).\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. \\( (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1) \\)\n\nB. \\( (x + 1)^4 \\)\n\nC. \\( (x - 1)(x + 1)^3 \\)\n\nD. \\( (x - 1)^3(x + 1) \\)\n\nOption A seems to match, considering the equivalences in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nBut to be thorough, let's expand \\( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) \\) and see if it equals \\( x^4 + 4 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5[x] \\).\n\nFirst, compute \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\):\n\n\\( x^2 - 5x + 4 \\). In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), \\( -5x \\equiv 0x \\), so this simplifies to \\( x^2 + 4 \\).\n\nNext, compute \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\):\n\n\\( x^2 - 5x + 6 \\). Again, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), \\( -5x \\equiv 0x \\), and 6 \u2261 1 mod 5, so this is \\( x^2 + 1 \\).\n\nNow, multiply \\( (x^2 + 4)(x^2 + 1) \\):\n\n\\( x^4 + x^2 + 4x^2 + 4 \\) = \\( x^4 + 5x^2 + 4 \\). In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), \\( 5x^2 \\equiv 0 \\), so this is \\( x^4 + 4 \\), which matches the original polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the factorization is correct.\n\nOption A appears to be the same, considering that \\( (x - 2)(x + 2) = (x - 2)(x - 3) \\) and \\( (x - 1)(x + 1) = (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), as established earlier.\n\nThus, the answer should be A.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B: \\( (x + 1)^4 \\). This would expand to \\( x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 \\), which in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) is \\( x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1 \\) (since 4 \u2261 -1 and 6 \u2261 1), which is not equal to \\( x^4 + 4 \\). So, incorrect.\n\nOption C: \\( (x - 1)(x + 1)^3 \\). Let's expand this:\n\nFirst, \\( (x + 1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 \\). In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), this is \\( x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 \\).\n\nThen, \\( (x - 1)(x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1) = x^4 + 3x^3 + 3x^2 + x - x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 - 2x - 1 \\). In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), this is \\( x^4 + 2x^3 - 2x - 1 \\), which is not equal to \\( x^4 + 4 \\). So, incorrect.\n\nOption D: \\( (x - 1)^3(x + 1) \\). Let's expand this:\n\nFirst, \\( (x - 1)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1 \\). In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), this is \\( x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4 \\) (since -3 \u2261 2 and -1 \u2261 4).\n\nThen, \\( (x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4)(x + 1) = x^4 + x^3 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x^2 + 3x + 4x + 4 = x^4 + 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 7x + 4 \\). In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), this is \\( x^4 + 3x^3 + 2x + 4 \\), which is not equal to \\( x^4 + 4 \\). So, incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is A.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), \\( -2 \\equiv 3 \\) and \\( -1 \\equiv 4 \\), so \\( (x - 2)(x + 2) = (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), and \\( (x - 1)(x + 1) = (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), which matches the factorization I found earlier.\n\nThus, the answer is A."
