                    "text": "So I have this problem about linear transformations, and I'm a bit stuck. Maybe you can help me understand how to approach it.\n\nThe problem says: \"If f is a linear transformation from the plane to the real numbers and if f(1, 1) = 1 and f(-1, 0) = 2, then f(3, 5) = ?\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. 9\n\nB. 8\n\nC. 0\n\nD. -5\"\n\nAlright, so first things first, I know that a linear transformation from the plane (which is R\u00b2) to the real numbers (R) is essentially a linear functional. That means it should satisfy two properties:\n\n1. Additivity: f(u + v) = f(u) + f(v) for any vectors u and v in R\u00b2.\n\n2. Homogeneity: f(cu) = c * f(u) for any vector u in R\u00b2 and any scalar c.\n\nGiven that, I need to find f(3,5) based on the values f(1,1) = 1 and f(-1,0) = 2.\n\nI think the key here is to express the vector (3,5) as a linear combination of the vectors (1,1) and (-1,0), since I know the values of f on those vectors.\n\nSo, let's see if I can write (3,5) as a linear combination of (1,1) and (-1,0). That is, find scalars a and b such that:\n\na*(1,1) + b*(-1,0) = (3,5)\n\nLet me set up the equations for this:\n\na*1 + b*(-1) = 3 \u2192 a - b = 3\n\na*1 + b*0 = 5 \u2192 a = 5\n\nFrom the second equation, a = 5. Plugging that into the first equation:\n\n5 - b = 3 \u2192 b = 2\n\nSo, (3,5) = 5*(1,1) + 2*(-1,0)\n\nNow, since f is linear, f(3,5) = f(5*(1,1) + 2*(-1,0)) = 5*f(1,1) + 2*f(-1,0)\n\nI know f(1,1) = 1 and f(-1,0) = 2, so:\n\nf(3,5) = 5*1 + 2*2 = 5 + 4 = 9\n\nSo, the answer should be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using matrices or something else.\n\nSince f is a linear transformation from R\u00b2 to R, it can be represented by a 1x2 matrix, say [c d], such that f(x,y) = c*x + d*y.\n\nGiven that f(1,1) = 1, that gives:\n\nc*1 + d*1 = 1 \u2192 c + d = 1\n\nAnd f(-1,0) = 2:\n\nc*(-1) + d*0 = 2 \u2192 -c = 2 \u2192 c = -2\n\nPlugging c = -2 into the first equation:\n\n-2 + d = 1 \u2192 d = 3\n\nSo, f(x,y) = -2*x + 3*y\n\nNow, f(3,5) = -2*3 + 3*5 = -6 + 15 = 9\n\nAgain, I get 9. That matches my first method.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using the properties of linear functionals or something else.\n\nAlternatively, since we're dealing with a linear transformation from R\u00b2 to R, it's essentially a linear functional, and the set of all such functionals forms the dual space of R\u00b2.\n\nBut I think for this problem, the approach I took is sufficient and correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
