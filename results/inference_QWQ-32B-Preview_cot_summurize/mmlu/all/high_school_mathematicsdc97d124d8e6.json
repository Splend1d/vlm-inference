                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Veronica has a novel with 400 pages, and she wants to know how long it will take her to read it. She reads at a speed of 250 words per minute, and she estimates that there are about 200 words per page. We need to find out how many minutes it will take her to read the entire book, and round it to the nearest minute.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total number of words in the book. Since there are 400 pages and each page has approximately 200 words, I can multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page to get the total words.\n\nTotal words = number of pages \u00d7 words per page\nTotal words = 400 pages \u00d7 200 words/page\nTotal words = 80,000 words\n\nNow, Veronica reads 250 words per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take her to read 80,000 words, I can divide the total number of words by her reading speed.\n\nTime (in minutes) = total words \u00f7 reading speed\nTime = 80,000 words \u00f7 250 words/minute\nTime = 320 minutes\n\nSo, it will take her 320 minutes to read the entire book. Looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 225 minutes\nB. 320 minutes\nC. 400 minutes\nD. 450 minutes\n\nOption B, 320 minutes, matches our calculation. Therefore, the answer is B. 320 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the total number of words:\n\n400 pages \u00d7 200 words/page = 80,000 words. That seems correct.\n\nNow, dividing the total words by the reading speed:\n\n80,000 words \u00f7 250 words/minute. Let's see, 250 words per minute is the same as 250 words per minute. So, to find out how many minutes are needed, we divide the total words by the words per minute.\n\n80,000 \u00f7 250.\n\nI can simplify this division. 250 times 320 is 80,000, as 250 \u00d7 320 = 80,000. So, yes, 320 minutes is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: 250 words per minute is the same as reading one word every 0.4 minutes (since 1 \u00f7 250 = 0.004 minutes per word). But that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that in one minute, she reads 250 words, so for 80,000 words, it would be 80,000 \u00f7 250 = 320 minutes.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see how many minutes are in an hour and how many words she can read in an hour, but since the question is in minutes, it's probably unnecessary.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's any rounding needed. The problem says \"to the nearest minute,\" but since our calculation gave an exact number, 320 minutes, there's no need for rounding.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions that she counted the words on one quarter of a typical page and found approximately 200 words per page. I assume that \"one quarter of a typical page\" might suggest that she counted the words in a portion of the page and then extrapolated to the whole page. But since she arrived at 200 words per page, I'll accept that as the given estimate.\n\nIt's also important to note that reading speed can vary based on factors like readability of the text, interest level, and distractions, but since we're given a constant reading speed, we'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct answer is B. 320 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 320} \\]"
