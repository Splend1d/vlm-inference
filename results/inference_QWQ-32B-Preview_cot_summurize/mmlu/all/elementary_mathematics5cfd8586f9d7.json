                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Gary has 72 cows on his farm, and he has 6 times as many cows as he has horses. We need to find out how many horses he has, and the number sentence given is 72 \u00f7 h = 6, where h represents the number of horses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the equation is telling me. The equation says that when you divide the number of cows (72) by the number of horses (h), you get 6. In other words, the number of cows is 6 times the number of horses. That makes sense because the problem states that he has 6 times as many cows as horses.\n\nSo, the equation is 72 \u00f7 h = 6. To find h, I need to solve for h. How do I do that? Well, division and multiplication are inverse operations, so I can rearrange the equation to find h.\n\nOne way to solve for h is to multiply both sides of the equation by h, which gives:\n\n72 = 6h\n\nNow, to isolate h, I can divide both sides by 6:\n\n72 \u00f7 6 = h\n\nSo, h = 12\n\nTherefore, Gary has 12 horses.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. If Gary has 12 horses and he has 6 times as many cows as horses, then the number of cows should be 12 \u00d7 6 = 72, which matches the given number of cows. So, my answer seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 12 horses\n\nB. 66 horses\n\nC. 78 horses\n\nD. 432 horses\n\nThe correct choice is A. 12 horses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
