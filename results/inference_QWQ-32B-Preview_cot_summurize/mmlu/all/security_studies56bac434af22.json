Expelling foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals, and restricting borders to refugees and migrants.\n\nB. Weak states avoiding alliances with powerful states because alliances often come with conditions like democratization, which might not be in the elites' interest.\n\nC. Hiring private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries to strengthen their forces against internal threats.\n\nD. Engaging in military action to boost their regional status and divert attention from internal issues, especially during economic or social crises.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what \"elites\" are in this context. Elites are usually the powerful groups in society who hold significant economic, political, or social influence. Their strategies would likely be aimed at maintaining or increasing their power, often at the expense of broader societal interests.\n\nOption A suggests that elites might expel foreign workers and restrict immigration. This could be a way to control the population and reduce potential challenges to their power from diverse groups. By promoting nationalism or ethnic unity, elites might strengthen their grip on power. So, this seems like a plausible strategy.\n\nOption B talks about weak states avoiding alliances with powerful states due to conditions like democratization. This might not directly be an \"external strategy\" employed by elites but rather a decision by the state, which could be influenced by elites who prefer to maintain their authoritarian control without external interference. However, it's a bit different from the other options, which seem more proactive.\n\nOption C mentions hiring private military companies or mercenaries. This is definitely an external strategy to\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u5a01\u80c1\u65f6\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5f31\u5c0f\u56fd\u5bb6\u6216\u7cbe\u82f1\u7fa4\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u8eab\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n\nOption D involves engaging in military action to boost regional position and divert attention from internal problems. This is a classic strategy used by leaders to unite the population against an external enemy and distract from domestic issues like economic crises or social unrest.\n\nConsidering these options, I need to decide which ones are external strategies employed by elites. Options A, C, and D all involve actions taken by elites to manage external factors or relationships in order to maintain or enhance their power. Option B seems more like a general state policy that might be influenced by elites but isn't specifically an external strategy they employ.\n\nTherefore, the external strategies elites employ would likely include:\n\n- Expelling foreign workers and restricting borders (Option A)\n\n- Hiring private military companies and mercenaries (Option C)\n\n- Engaging in military action to bolster regional position and divert attention from internal issues (Option D)\n\nThese strategies help elites manage external influences and threats, control their domestic populations, and maintain their grip on power.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A, C, D} \\]"
