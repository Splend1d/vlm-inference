                    "text": "This question is about preserving an issue for appeal in a federal negligence trial, specifically regarding jury instructions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what it means to preserve an issue for appeal. In federal court, parties must generally make a timely objection to preserve an issue for appeal. This is based on the idea that the trial court should have an opportunity to correct any errors before they are raised on appeal.\n\nIn this case, the defendant submitted a proposed jury instruction on contributory negligence before the close of evidence. This is a good start, but submitting a proposed instruction isn't always enough to preserve the issue for appeal. The defendant needs to ensure that the trial court considers and rules on the proposed instruction.\n\nThe judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give, which did not include the defendant's contributory negligence instruction or any instruction on contributory negligence. At this point, the defendant should have objected to the absence of the contributory negligence instruction.\n\nHowever, neither party objected at this stage, nor after the judge had given the instructions. The jury then returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the judge entered judgment accordingly.\n\nNow, the defendant wants to appeal the verdict on the grounds that the judge should have instructed the jury on contributory negligence. The question is whether the defendant has preserved this issue for appeal.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge gave the instructions to the jury.\n\nB. No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.\n\nC. Yes, because the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence.\n\nD. Yes, because the judge's failure to give the defendant's contributory negligence instruction amounted to a ruling on the instruction.\n\nOption A suggests that the defendant didn't preserve the issue because they didn't object after the instructions were given. Option B says the same but refers to when the judge informed the parties of the instructions before giving them. Option C claims that submitting the proposed instruction is sufficient to preserve the issue. Option D argues that the judge's action constitutes a ruling on the instruction.\n\nIn federal court, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51(c) generally requires that to preserve a challenge to a jury instruction, a party must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury is instructed. If the party doesn't do this, the issue is not preserved for appeal, unless the court commits plain error.\n\nIn this scenario, the defendant submitted a proposed instruction but did not object when the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give, nor after the instructions were given. Therefore, the defendant did not formally bring to the court's attention that the contributory negligence instruction was being omitted.\n\nGiven this, it seems that the defendant did not preserve the issue for appeal because they failed to make a timely objection. This aligns with options A and B.\n\nOption C is attractive because the defendant did submit a proposed instruction, but submission alone is usually not enough. The party must also bring to the court's attention that the instruction is being omitted and specify why it should be included.\n\nOption D suggests that the judge's failure to give the instruction amounts to a ruling on it. However, without an objection, it's unclear whether the judge actually considered the proposed instruction and decided to reject it or simply overlooked it.\n\nConsidering the requirements of Rule 51(c), it appears that the defendant did not preserve the issue for appeal because they failed to object at the appropriate time. Therefore, the correct answer is likely either A or B.\n\nBetween A and B, there's a slight difference in timing. Option A refers to failing to object after the judge gave the instructions, while Option B refers to failing to object when the judge informed the parties of the instructions before giving them.\n\nIn practice, the best time to object is when the judge informs the parties of the instructions she plans to give, as this is an opportunity to correct any omissions or errors before the instructions are actually given to the jury.\n\nTherefore, Option B seems more accurate because the defendant should have objected at that stage, when the judge informed the parties of the instructions, and before the instructions were given to the jury.\n\nHowever, since the defendant did not object either before or after the instructions were given, both A and B could be considered correct in different contexts. But in the context of federal procedure, the general rule is that objections to jury instructions must be made before the instructions are given, as per Rule 51(c).\n\nThus, the most precise answer is B: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.\n\nThis ensures that the trial court had the opportunity to address the defendant's concern before the jury was instructed, which is the essence of preserving an issue for appeal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
