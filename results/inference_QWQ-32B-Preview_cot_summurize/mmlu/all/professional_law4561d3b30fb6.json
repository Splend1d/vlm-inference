The building had a commercial space on the first floor, with two apartments above it; one on the second, and another on the third floor. Several years ago, a teacher, in a signed writing, entered a three-year lease agreement with the professor. The teacher agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the professor's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the teacher has continued to pay his rent, and the professor continued to accept it. The professor rented the first floor to a restaurateur, who opened a sushi restaurant there. Within months, there was a citywide hookworm epidemic that was traced to the consumption of raw fish. The city council, in an attempt to protect the public from the parasites, passed an ordinance prohibiting all sushi restaurants from operating in the city. The restaurateur was forced out of business. She locked the doors and left a sign in the window: \"Closed until further notice. \"Within weeks, rats were attracted to the odor from the fish that was left in the restaurant, and the building became infested with them.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a professor who owns a building with a commercial space on the first floor and two apartments on the second and third floors. A teacher rents the third-floor apartment under a three-year lease that expired, but they've continued the arrangement with monthly payments.\n\nThen, the first floor is rented to a restaurateur who opens a sushi restaurant. There's a citywide hookworm epidemic linked to raw fish consumption, so the city passes an ordinance banning sushi restaurants. This forces the restaurateur out of business, and she closes the restaurant, leaving fish inside, which attracts rats and infests the building.\n\nThe teacher can't tolerate the rats and decides to move to another city, serving notice to the professor.\n\nNow, the question is about the teacher's best defense against, I assume, some action by the professor, perhaps for breaking the lease or something similar. The options are:\n\nA. Partial constructive eviction.\n\nB. Partial actual eviction.\n\nC. Constructive eviction.\n\nD. Breach of implied covenant of habitability.\n\nTo determine the best defense, we need to understand these legal concepts.\n\nFirst, **constructive eviction** occurs when a landlord's actions or inactions make the rental property uninhabitable or significantly degrade the quality of the tenancy, forcing the tenant to move out. It's not an actual physical eviction but is constructive because the conditions are such that the tenant feels compelled to leave.\n\n**Partial constructive eviction** might refer to a situation where only a part of the property is rendered uninhabitable, but I'm not entirely sure about this specific term.\n\n**Partial actual eviction** could mean that the landlord has partially excluded the tenant from enjoying the premises, but again, I'm not entirely clear on this term.\n\n**Breach of implied covenant of habitability** refers to the landlord's legal obligation to maintain the property in a habitable condition, meeting basic health and safety standards.\n\nIn this scenario, the building becomes infested with rats due to the restaurateur leaving fish inside the closed restaurant. The teacher can't tolerate the rats and decides to move.\n\nSo, the issue here is the habitability of the apartment due to the rat infestation caused by the restaurant's closure and the leftover fish.\n\nNow, is the professor responsible for this? The professor rented the first floor to the restaurateur, who then caused the problem by leaving fish inside after closing due to the ordinance.\n\nThe teacher might argue that the professor, by allowing the restaurateur to store fish in the closed restaurant, caused the rat infestation, which made the apartment uninhabitable.\n\nThis sounds like a breach of the implied covenant of habitability because the professor, as the landlord, has a responsibility to ensure that the property is habitable, including common areas and managing tenants in a way that doesn't jeopardize the habitability of other units.\n\nAlternatively, it could be considered constructive eviction if the conditions forced the teacher to leave.\n\nHowever, the key here is whether the professor's actions or inactions directly led to the rat infestation.\n\nThe professor rented the first floor to the restaurateur, who then caused the problem by leaving fish inside after closing.\n\nDid the professor cause the rat infestation by permitting the restaurateur to store fish in the closed restaurant?\n\nWell, the professor might argue that he didn't know about the fish being left inside, and that it was the restaurateur's responsibility to maintain the space properly.\n\nBut if the professor knew or should have known about the fish being left inside and the potential for rat infestation, then he might be liable.\n\nGiven that the teacher is seeking a defense, the best argument would be that the professor's actions (or inactions) in allowing the restaurateur to store fish in the closed restaurant led to the rat infestation, making the apartment uninhabitable.\n\nThis would most closely align with **constructive eviction** because the conditions forced the teacher to leave, or **breach of implied covenant of habitability** because the professor didn't maintain the property in a habitable condition.\n\nBetween C and D, I think **constructive eviction** (option C) is a stronger defense because it directly addresses the forced departure due to the landlord's actions.\n\n**Partial constructive eviction** (option A) might be relevant if only part of the apartment was affected, but in this case, the entire apartment is impacted by the rat infestation.\n\n**Partial actual eviction** (option B) seems less applicable because it's not clear that the professor physically excluded the teacher from part of the apartment.\n\nTherefore, the teacher's best defense is likely **constructive eviction** (option C).\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider the implied covenant of habitability (option D).\n\nThe implied covenant of habitability requires that rental properties meet certain health and safety standards. If the rat infestation violates these standards, then the professor has breached this covenant.\n\nBut the teacher's action of moving out might be seen as a remedy for this breach, but it's more about the condition of the property than being forced out.\n\nConstructive eviction, on the other hand, specifically addresses situations where the landlord's actions make the property uninhabitable, forcing the tenant to leave.\n\nGiven that, constructive eviction seems like the more appropriate defense.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Constructive eviction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
