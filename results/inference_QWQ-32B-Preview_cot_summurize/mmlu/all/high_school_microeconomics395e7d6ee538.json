                    "text": "Let's see which statement is true among these options. I need to recall the concepts of marginal social cost, marginal private cost, and externalities.\n\nFirst, marginal social cost (MSC) is the total cost society incurs from producing one more unit of a good or service. It includes both the private costs borne by the producer and any external costs imposed on others.\n\nMarginal private cost (MPC) is the cost incurred by the producer in producing one more unit of a good or service. It doesn't account for any external costs or benefits.\n\nAn externality is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. Negative externalities impose costs on others, while positive externalities provide benefits to others.\n\nOption A says: A marginal social cost = marginal private cost + marginal social benefits.\n\nHmm, this seems off. Marginal social cost should include the marginal private cost plus any marginal external costs, not benefits. Marginal social benefits would be related to marginal social benefit, which is different from marginal social cost.\n\nOption B: Value of externality = marginal social costs.\n\nThis doesn't seem right either. The value of an externality is the cost or benefit imposed on others, which is part of the marginal social cost, but it's not equal to the entire marginal social cost. Marginal social cost is MPC plus the external cost.\n\nOption C: Value of externality = marginal private costs.\n\nNo, marginal private costs are the costs incurred by the producer, not the external costs imposed on others.\n\nOption D: Marginal social cost = marginal private cost + negative externality.\n\nThis seems plausible. If there's a negative externality, it means there are additional costs imposed on society beyond what the producer pays. So, MSC should be MPC plus the negative externality.\n\nWait, but what if there's a positive externality? Would that affect the relationship?\n\nIn the case of a positive externality, the social benefit is greater than the private benefit, but MSC still includes MPC plus any external costs. Positive externalities affect marginal social benefit, not marginal social cost.\n\nSince the question doesn't specify the type of externality, but mentions \"negative externality,\" and in the context of marginal social cost, it makes sense that MSC = MPC + negative externality.\n\nLet me double-check. If there's a negative externality, like pollution from a factory, the MSC would be the MPC plus the cost of the pollution imposed on others.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
