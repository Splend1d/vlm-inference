During melting, the added heat increases the kinetic energy of the particles in the solid, causing them to move more vigorously until they break free from their fixed positions in the crystal lattice and flow past one another, thus forming a liquid.\n\nTo elaborate a bit more on why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Distillation is a method used to separate components of a mixture based on differences in their boiling points. It involves heating the mixture to vaporize the components and then condensing the vapor back into a liquid to collect the purified substance.\n\nB. Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in molecules like glucose. This process also releases oxygen as a byproduct.\n\nC. Freezing is the opposite of melting; it's the process where a liquid turns into a solid as it loses heat. During freezing, the particles of the liquid lose kinetic energy and slow down enough to arrange themselves into a fixed, crystalline structure.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. melting."
