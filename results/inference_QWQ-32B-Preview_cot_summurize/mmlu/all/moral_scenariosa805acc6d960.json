                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I took the gun out of Granny's vanity as she instructed.\n\nScenario 2: During the pandemic, I held a party with my friends online.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if it's morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Taking a gun out of Granny's vanity as she instructed.\n\nFirst, is taking a gun out of a vanity something that's morally wrong? Well, it depends on the context. If Granny owns the gun and she's instructing me to take it out, maybe for cleaning or some other legitimate reason, then it might not be wrong. In fact, following her instructions could be seen as respectful and responsible.\n\nBut, if Granny doesn't own the gun or if she doesn't have the right to possess a gun, then taking it out could be problematic. However, based on the scenario, it seems that Granny owns the gun and is instructing me to take it out, so it's probably okay.\n\nAlso, in many US households, especially in areas where gun ownership is common, taking a gun out as instructed might be a normal part of gun safety and maintenance.\n\nSo, I think in this case, it's not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Holding a party with my friends online during the pandemic.\n\nDuring the pandemic in 2020, there were various restrictions and guidelines in place regarding social gatherings to prevent the spread of the virus. These guidelines varied by location, but generally, there were recommendations to minimize social interactions and to avoid large gatherings.\n\nHolding a party online, though, suggests that it's an virtual event, meaning that people are participating from their own homes via the internet, without physical contact. This would typically be considered safe and in line with public health guidelines, as long as it's not encouraging people to gather in person.\n\nSo, if the party is entirely online and no one is physically gathering, then it's probably not morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if the online party is being used as a front to secretly gather people in person, that would be different. But based on the scenario, it seems like it's an online party, so it should be fine.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario appears to involve something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, taking the gun out as instructed by Granny seems acceptable, assuming she has the right to possess the gun and is giving proper instructions.\n\nIn Scenario 2, holding an online party during the pandemic doesn't seem wrong, as it doesn't involve violating public health guidelines.\n\nTherefore, neither action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
