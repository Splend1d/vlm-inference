The scenarios are:\n\n1. I stuck a knife in his black scabbard.\n\n2. I ran a comb through my husband's hair.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is describing and then judge based on ordinary moral standards.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I stuck a knife in his black scabbard.\"\n\nA scabbard is a sheath for a knife or sword. So, the person is putting a knife into its scabbard. Is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, unless there's more context, like if the knife was stolen or if it was used in a crime, just putting a knife in its scabbard seems like a normal action. It's probably not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I ran a comb through my husband's hair.\"\n\nThis seems like a caring or grooming activity. Running a comb through someone's hair is typically a benign action, maybe even a sign of affection or care. There's nothing inherently wrong with that.\n\nSo, based on this, both scenarios seem not wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe there's some context or some underlying issue that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about Scenario 1 again. If the knife was used in a harmful way, but the action described is just putting it back in the scabbard, that itself doesn't seem wrong. It's what the knife was used for that would determine if something is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, running a comb through someone's hair is generally okay. Unless, maybe, if the husband was asleep and didn't want to be disturbed, but even then, it's more about consideration than morality.\n\nI think in both cases, without additional context suggesting harm or malicious intent, these actions are not morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
