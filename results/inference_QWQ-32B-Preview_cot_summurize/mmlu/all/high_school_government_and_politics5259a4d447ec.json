                    "text": "Let's see what the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did. I know it was a big deal in making sure that everyone could vote, especially in places where there was a lot of discrimination against racial minorities.\n\nOption A says that states have been prohibited from establishing voter identification requirements. Hmm, I think voter ID laws are actually allowed, but there are restrictions and regulations around them. I don't think the Voting Rights Act completely banned voter ID requirements. Maybe it's more about ensuring that such requirements don't discriminate based on race.\n\nOption B says voters must now pass literacy tests before voting. Wait, actually, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was designed to eliminate literacy tests and other barriers that were used to prevent racial minorities from voting. So this one seems backwards. It was meant to get rid of literacy tests, not enforce them.\n\nOption C says voting participation for racial minority voters has increased. That sounds right. The act was intended to increase access to voting for minorities who were historically disenfranchised. If it achieved its goals, then participation should have increased.\n\nOption D mentions that the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18. I think that's correct, but I'm not sure if that was part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. I recall that the 26th Amendment, ratified in 1971, lowered the voting age to 18, but that was a few years after the Voting Rights Act.\n\nLet me think again. The main purpose of the Voting Rights Act was to overcome legal barriers at the state and local levels that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote as guaranteed under the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSo, it's likely that the act led to increased voting participation among racial minorities by removing obstacles like literacy tests, poll taxes, and other discriminatory practices.\n\nOption A seems incorrect because voter ID laws are a different issue, and the act doesn't outright prohibit them.\n\nOption B is definitely wrong because the act aimed to eliminate literacy tests, not impose them.\n\nOption C seems correct based on the act's purpose.\n\nOption D might be correct in terms of the voting age, but I think that change came with the 26th Amendment, not the Voting Rights Act.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is probably C: Voting participation for racial minority voters has increased.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should check what the act specifically did.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibited racial discrimination in voting and introduced federal oversight of voting practices in areas with a history of discrimination. It also allowed for federal examiners to be sent in to register voters and monitor elections.\n\nOne of the key provisions was Section 5, which required certain jurisdictions to get pre-clearance from the federal government before changing voting laws or practices.\n\nThe act also banned literacy tests and other devices that were used to disenfranchise minorities.\n\nSo, by removing these barriers, it's logical that voting participation among racial minorities would increase.\n\nIn fact, there was a significant increase in minority voter registration and turnout in the years following the act's passage.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they describe measures that the act either did not impose or actually worked to eliminate.\n\nOption D, about the voting age, is not directly related to the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\nSo, the answer is C: Voting participation for racial minority voters has increased.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
