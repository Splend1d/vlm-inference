The Song abolished the Confucian civil service exams.\n\nB. The Song sponsored Buddhism to the detriment of Taoism and Confucianism.\n\nC. The Song pursued a less expansive foreign policy.\n\nD. The Song dynasty was originally from outside of China.\n\nI need to figure out which one of these statements is true about how the Song dynasty differed from the Tang.\n\nFirst, I remember that both the Tang and Song dynasties were important periods in Chinese history, but they had some differences in terms of culture, politics, and society.\n\nLet's look at option A: The Song abolished the Confucian civil service exams. I think the civil service exams were actually very important during the Song dynasty. In fact, I believe they placed a greater emphasis on them compared to the Tang dynasty. So, I don't think the Song abolished them; maybe they even expanded them.\n\nOption B: The Song sponsored Buddhism to the detriment of Taoism and Confucianism. During the Tang dynasty, Buddhism was very prominent, and the emperor even had close relationships with Buddhist monks. However, in the Song dynasty, there was a revival of Confucianism, known as Neo-Confucianism, which became the dominant philosophy. So, it seems like the Song might have shifted away from Buddhism and more towards Confucianism. Therefore, this option might be correct because they didn't sponsor Buddhism as much as the Tang did.\n\nOption C: The Song pursued a less expansive foreign policy. The Tang dynasty is known for its expansive empire and cultural influence across Asia. The Song dynasty, on the other hand, is sometimes referred to as the \"Chinese Renaissance\" and is known for its advancements in culture, technology, and economy, but it might have been more focused internally rather than expanding its territories. So, this could also be a possible difference.\n\nOption D: The Song dynasty was originally from outside of China. I don't think this is accurate. Both the Tang and Song dynasties were Chinese dynasties, ruling from within China. The Song dynasty followed the Tang dynasty, and they were both native Chinese dynasties.\n\nSo, between options B and C, I need to decide which one is the most accurate.\n\nOption B suggests that the Song sponsored Buddhism to the detriment of Taoism and Confucianism, but actually, it was the opposite. The Song dynasty saw a revival of Confucianism with the development of Neo-Confucianism, which became the dominant ideology. So, perhaps this option is incorrect.\n\nOption C mentions that the Song pursued a less expansive foreign policy. Given that the Tang dynasty was known for its expansive empire and cultural influence, and the Song dynasty was more focused on internal development and faced pressure from neighboring states like the Liao and Jin, it's possible that their foreign policy was less expansive.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: The Song pursued a less expansive foreign policy.\n\nBut to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nFirst, regarding the civil service exams: The Tang dynasty established the imperial examination system, and the Song dynasty indeed continued and even expanded this system, making it more merit-based and less dependent on aristocratic connections. So, option A is probably incorrect.\n\nSecond, about religion: The Tang dynasty was very open to Buddhism, and many Tang emperors supported Buddhist temples and monasteries. In contrast, the Song dynasty saw a revival of Confucianism, with philosophers like Zhu Xi developing Neo-Confucianism, which emphasized rationality and hierarchical order. So, the Song might have sponsored Confucianism more than Buddhism. Therefore, option B seems incorrect.\n\nThird, foreign policy: The Tang dynasty had a vast empire that extended into Central Asia and had significant interactions with other cultures. The Song dynasty, while still powerful, faced pressures from nomadic empires like the Liao and Jin, and their territory was more confined compared to the Tang. So, it's plausible that their foreign policy was less expansive.\n\nLastly, option D is unlikely because both dynasties were Chinese.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is C: The Song pursued a less expansive foreign policy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
