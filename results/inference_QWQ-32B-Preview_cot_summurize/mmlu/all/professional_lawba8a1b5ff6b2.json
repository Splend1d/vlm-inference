                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. It's about a 14-year-old girl who took a candy bar without paying and was caught by a security guard. She was then accused of stealing it and broke down crying, explaining she was hungry because she didn't eat lunch. Now, at a juvenile delinquency court hearing, the security guard wants to testify about what she said, and the girl's attorney is objecting. We need to find the strongest reason for admitting her statement from the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the statement being admitted in court. The girl's statement was made to the security guard after he accused her of stealing. So, it's important to consider whether this statement is admissible under the rules of evidence, particularly regarding confessions or statements made to non-law enforcement personnel.\n\nOption A says, \"Miranda warnings need not be given to juveniles.\" I know that Miranda warnings are required for juveniles as well as adults when they are in custody and being interrogated by law enforcement. But in this case, the security guard is not law enforcement; he's a private citizen employed by the store. So, maybe Miranda warnings don't apply here, but I'm not sure if that's the strongest reason for admitting the statement.\n\nOption B states, \"the security guard's remark was an accusation, not an interrogation.\" An accusation could still be considered a form of interrogation, especially if it elicits a response from the accused. In this case, the girl responded by crying and explaining her hunger, which seems like a reaction to the accusation. Maybe this is relevant, but I'm not sure it's the strongest reason.\n\nOption C says, \"the security guard was not employed by an agency of the government.\" This is true; the security guard works for a private drug store, not for the government. This might be important because Miranda rights are required for custodial interrogations by government agents. If the guard is not a government agent, maybe different rules apply regarding the admissibility of statements.\n\nOption D is, \"the girl was not in custody.\" Being in custody generally means that a person is under arrest or restrained in a way that they believe they are not free to leave. In this scenario, the security guard grabbed her arm and accused her of stealing, which might make her feel restrained, but it's not clear if she was formally arrested or held against her will.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think the strongest reason for admitting her statement is option C: \"the security guard was not employed by an agency of the government.\" Since the guard is a private citizen, not a government agent, the rules regarding Miranda warnings and custodial interrogations may not apply in the same way. Therefore, the statement might be admissible based on that fact.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that even statements made to private individuals can be admissible in court, provided they are voluntary and not the result of coercion. In this case, the girl broke down and cried after being accused, which might indicate emotional distress, but it doesn't necessarily mean the statement was coerced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is admissible because the girl was not in custody, as per option D. If she wasn't in custody, then Miranda warnings weren't required, and her statement could be admitted. But I'm a bit unsure about whether being grabbed by the arm and accused constitutes being in custody.\n\nComparing options C and D, I think C is stronger because it addresses the status of the person who received the statement. Since the security guard is not a government agent, the statement might be admissible without worrying about Miranda rights.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Miranda warnings are required for juveniles in custody, just like adults, although there might be additional considerations for juveniles.\n\nOption B is perhaps less strong because, even if the remark was an accusation, it still could be considered a form of interrogation if it elicited a response.\n\nTherefore, I believe the strongest reason for admitting her statement is that the security guard was not employed by an agency of the government.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
