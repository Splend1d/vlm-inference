                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, we've got a plaintiff who was injured while diving into a reservoir that's owned by a utility company. The reservoir is open to the public under a license from a federal agency. The plaintiff thinks the company was negligent for not marking an unmarked submerged island, which he hit while diving.\n\nNow, at trial, the plaintiff has called an engineer who's been qualified as an expert in managing reservoirs. We need to figure out which opinion from this expert the court is most likely to admit. Let's look at each option:\n\nOption A: \"The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film I made.\"\n\nHmm, this seems like the expert is offering an opinion on how the accident happened, based on a computer simulation. But, as an expert in reservoir management, does he have the expertise to interpret accidents and create animations? Maybe, but it's a bit tangential to his area of expertise. Courts are generally cautious about admitting opinions that stretch beyond an expert's established field.\n\nOption B: \"The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300.\"\n\nThis seems more relevant to the expert's field. If he's an expert in reservoir management, he should know about safety measures, like marking hazards, and perhaps estimate the time and cost involved in such markings. This opinion directly relates to the expert's area of knowledge, so it seems admissible.\n\nOption C: \"The company was required by federal law to mark the island.\"\n\nWait a minute, interpreting legal requirements is typically within the realm of lawyers and judges, not engineers. Even if the expert is familiar with some regulations, opining on legal obligations might be overstepping. Courts usually don't allow experts to testify about the law; that's for the judge to instruct the jury.\n\nOption D: \"The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.\"\n\nThis is another legal issue. Determining negligence, especially contributory negligence, is a legal question that the jury decides based on the evidence and the law as instructed by the judge. It's not the expert's place to opine on the legal aspects of the case.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, Option B seems the most appropriate. It's directly related to the expert's field of reservoir management, and it provides specific, factual information about what the company could have done in terms of marking the island, including the time and cost involved. This kind of testimony would be helpful for the jury to understand the feasibility of the safety measure in question.\n\nOptions A, C, and D either stretch beyond the expert's qualifications or tread into legal territory that's not appropriate for an expert witness. Therefore, the court is most likely to admit the opinion in Option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
