                    "text": "So this guy came to the doctor complaining about pain in his right shoulder. He says it started after he chopped wood two days ago. The doctor checked his right arm and didn't find any broken bones or spots that hurt when pressed. But when the patient tried to turn his arm outward against some resistance, it hurt. And interestingly, there's no weakness in his arm.\n\nNow, the question is about which tendon, besides the teres minor, is most likely inflamed in this patient. The options are infraspinatus, pectoralis, subscapularis, and supraspinatus.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what's going on here. The patient has shoulder pain after chopping wood, and it hurts when he externally rotates his shoulder against resistance. External rotation of the shoulder is primarily handled by two muscles: the infraspinatus and the teres minor. Both of these muscles are part of the rotator cuff.\n\nSince the teres minor is already mentioned in the question, and we're supposed to identify another tendon that might be inflamed, I should consider the infraspinatus. Both these muscles are involved in external rotation, so if there's inflammation in one, it's possible the other could be affected too, especially given the activity that triggered the pain.\n\nChopping wood involves a lot of repetitive overhead motions, which can strain the rotator cuff muscles. The infraspinatus is a major player in external rotation, so it makes sense that it could be inflamed in this scenario.\n\nLet me consider the other options quickly:\n\n- Pectoralis: The pectoralis major and minor are more involved in movements like flexion and adduction of the shoulder, not so much external rotation. So, it's less likely to be the culprit here.\n\n- Subscapularis: This muscle is involved in internal rotation of the shoulder, not external rotation. Since the pain is during external rotation, it's less probable that the subscapularis is the issue.\n\n- Supraspinatus: This muscle is involved in abduction of the shoulder, not external rotation. While it's part of the rotator cuff, its primary function is different from the teres minor and infraspinatus.\n\nGiven this, the infraspinatus seems to be the most likely candidate for inflammation besides the teres minor.\n\nI should also consider whether both muscles could be involved simultaneously. Since they both contribute to external rotation, it's possible that both could be strained or inflamed from the repetitive motion of chopping wood.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that there's no weakness noted suggests that perhaps the inflammation isn't severe enough to cause significant muscle impairment, which aligns with the idea that it's acute inflammation from recent activity.\n\nIn summary, I think the answer is A. Infraspinatus, because it's involved in external rotation along with the teres minor, and the patient's symptoms suggest inflammation in the muscles responsible for that movement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
