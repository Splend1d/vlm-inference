                    "text": "So I've got this question here about hypothesis testing, and I need to figure out what happens when researchers double the number of experimental units in their study. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what the null hypothesis is. In this case, it's stated that the null hypothesis is false. That means there is actually an effect or a difference that the researchers are trying to detect.\n\nThe significance level is set at 0.05, which is the probability of making a Type I error. A Type I error is when you reject the null hypothesis when it's actually true. But wait, in this scenario, the null hypothesis is false, so rejecting it would actually be correct. That means the probability of a Type I error isn't really relevant here because the null is false.\n\nInstead, since the null is false, the relevant error is Type II error, which is failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's false. The power of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false.\n\nNow, the researchers are changing their experiment to use twice as many experimental units for each treatment. I need to think about how increasing the sample size affects the hypothesis test.\n\nI recall that increasing the sample size generally leads to increased power in a hypothesis test. That makes sense because with more data, you have a better chance of detecting a true effect if there is one.\n\nSo, if power increases, what happens to the probability of a Type II error? Well, power is 1 minus the probability of a Type II error, so if power increases, the probability of a Type II error decreases.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n- Power increases\n\n- Probability of Type II error decreases\n\nNow, what about the probability of a Type I error? The significance level is set at 0.05, and changing the sample size shouldn't affect the Type I error rate, assuming everything else stays the same. The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null when it's true, but in this case, the null is false. However, the probability of a Type I error should remain at 0.05 unless something else changes.\n\nWait, but since the null is false, the concept of Type I error doesn't directly apply here. But I think the question might be considering the general properties of the test.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. The probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error would both decrease.\n\nB. The probability of a Type I error and the power would both increase.\n\nC. The probability of a Type II error and the power would both increase.\n\nD. The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.\n\nGiven what I've thought so far, option D seems plausible because the probability of a Type I error stays at 0.05, and power increases due to the larger sample size.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIncreasing the sample size generally increases the power of the test because it reduces the variability of the estimate. With less variability, it's easier to detect a true effect if there is one.\n\nAlso, since the null is false, the probability of a Type I error isn't directly relevant, but if we consider the test's properties in general, the Type I error rate should remain at the set significance level, which is 0.05.\n\nTherefore, option D makes sense: the probability of a Type I error stays the same, and the power increases.\n\nLet me see if any other option could be correct.\n\nOption A says both Type I and Type II errors decrease. While power increases (which means Type II error decreases), the Type I error remains the same, not decreases, so A is incorrect.\n\nOption B says Type I error and power both increase. But Type I error remains the same, and power increases, so B is incorrect.\n\nOption C says Type II error and power both increase. But if power increases, Type II error decreases, so C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Increasing the sample size increases the power of the test.\n\n- Power is 1 - probability of Type II error, so power increases and Type II error decreases.\n\n- The probability of Type I error remains at the set significance level of 0.05.\n\nHence, option D is correct: the probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
