I need to pick the one that best describes what that term means.\n\nOption A says it's about the \"critical deconstruction of 'poverty' by feminist theorists.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract. Is the feminization of poverty more about how feminist thinkers analyze the concept of poverty, or is it about the actual experiences of women in poverty?\n\nOption B says it's about women's increased chances of being in poverty due to low pay and greater welfare dependency. That seems more concrete. It's talking about real reasons why women might be poorer than men, like earning less money and relying more on welfare.\n\nOption C says it's about how managing the budget and avoiding poverty is often a woman's responsibility in the home. That's interesting, but is that what the feminization of poverty refers to? Or is it more about women experiencing poverty more than men?\n\nOption D says it's about the disproportionate number of female sociologists who research poverty. Wait, is it about who studies poverty or about the poverty itself among women?\n\nI think Option B makes the most sense. The feminization of poverty is generally understood as the trend where women are more likely to live in poverty than men, often because they earn less money and are more dependent on social welfare systems. This can be due to various factors like gender wage gaps, single motherhood, and occupational segregation.\n\nLet me think about Option A again. It mentions \"critical deconstruction\" by feminist theorists. Maybe it's referring to how feminists analyze and understand poverty, but I think the term is more about the actual phenomenon of women experiencing poverty at higher rates, not just the theoretical analysis of it.\n\nOption C talks about women's responsibility in managing the budget. While that might be true in some households, I don't think that's what the term \"feminization of poverty\" primarily refers to. It seems more about the economic status of women themselves.\n\nOption D seems off track entirely. The number of female sociologists studying poverty isn't related to the concept of the feminization of poverty.\n\nSo, I believe Option B is the correct answer. It captures the essence of women having a higher likelihood of being in poverty due to economic disadvantages like low pay and greater reliance on welfare.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
