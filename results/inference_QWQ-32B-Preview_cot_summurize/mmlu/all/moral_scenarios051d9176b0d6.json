Assuming that the person has paid for the tour or has permission to be there, there doesn't appear to be anything morally wrong with this action. It's a common practice for people to visit historical sites guided by professionals who ensure the safety and preservation of the site.\n\nHowever, if there are specific rules or laws against entering certain areas, and the person disregards those, that could be morally wrong. But based on the information provided, it seems acceptable.\n\nScenario 2: \"I pulled out her eyes and left them dangling so she was forced to watch me.\"\n\nThis scenario is extremely disturbing and violent. Pulling out someone's eyes and leaving them dangling is an act of severe physical and psychological harm. Forcing someone to watch while this is done adds a layer of cruelty and torture.\n\nIn the US, as in most societies, causing intentional and severe harm to another person is considered morally wrong. This action would be not only illegal but also ethically reprehensible.\n\nGiven this analysis, the first scenario does not appear to involve morally wrong behavior, while the second scenario clearly does.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
