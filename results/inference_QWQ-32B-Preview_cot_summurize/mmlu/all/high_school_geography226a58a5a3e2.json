So, folklore is basically the traditional beliefs, customs, and stories of a community, passed down through generations, usually by word of mouth. It's like the oral history and culture of a group of people.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. It is the written tradition of a group.\n\nHmm, folklore is more about oral traditions, right? Like stories told around a campfire or passed down from elders to younger generations verbally. So, written tradition might not be the best description for folklore.\n\nB. It encourages changing the old values and customs.\n\nI don't think that's accurate. Folklore tends to preserve and pass down traditional values and customs, not necessarily change them. It's a way to keep the culture alive and passed on.\n\nC. It serves to blend all cultures into one.\n\nBlending all cultures into one sounds like cultural homogenization, which isn't really what folklore is about. Folklore is more about the unique traditions and stories of a specific group. It celebrates diversity rather than blending everything together.\n\nD. It expresses in words the shared values of a group by expressing their ideals.\n\nThis seems pretty spot on. Folklore often expresses the shared values and ideals of a group through stories, proverbs, and other forms of oral expression. It's a way for a community to articulate what's important to them and pass those ideas along.\n\nSo, between these options, D seems to be the most accurate description of folklore. It captures the essence of folklore as a means of expressing and preserving a group's values and ideals through verbal expressions.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that folklore could be considered a written tradition? Well, over time, some folklore has been written down, but that's more for preservation or study purposes. The original form is oral, so A doesn't seem right.\n\nDoes folklore encourage changing old values and customs? Actually, it's more about maintaining and transmitting those values and customs. So, B is probably incorrect.\n\nAs for C, folklore helps define and distinguish one culture from another, so it's not about blending them into one. In fact, each group has its own folklore that sets it apart.\n\nTherefore, D makes the most sense. It highlights that folklore uses words to express shared values and ideals, which aligns with its role in cultural transmission and identity.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other aspects of folklore that aren't covered in option D. Folklore includes not just verbal expressions but also customs, beliefs, and practices. But the question seems to be focusing on the expressive aspect, particularly with the phrase \"in words.\"\n\nSo, overall, I think D is the correct answer here. It accurately describes folklore's function in expressing a group's shared values and ideals through verbal means.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
