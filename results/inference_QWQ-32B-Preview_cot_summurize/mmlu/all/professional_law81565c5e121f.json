                    "text": "A buyer purchased a new convertible from an automobile dealership. A few weeks later, the buyer began smelling a pungent gasoline odor in the vehicle. The buyer immediately took the car to the dealership and told the service manager what was wrong. The service manager indicated that he would take care of the problem and contact the buyer when the car was ready. The next day, the buyer was informed that the problem had been corrected and the car was available for pickup. The buyer then went to the dealership, took possession of his car, and drove off. After traveling about five miles, the buyer again smelled gasoline fumes. Irritated that the problem had not been corrected, the buyer decided to drive back to the dealership. As he was doing so, the car suddenly exploded, and the buyer suffered third-degree bums over 90 percent of his body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the explosion was caused by a defective gas tank that had ruptured. This produced a gasoline leak that was ignited by sparks from the car's underbody. A reasonable inspection would have disclosed the defective gas tank. The trouble the buyer had described to the service manager was indicative of such a problem. If the buyer asserts a claim against the manufacturer of the convertible for damages for his injuries, will the buyer prevail?\n\nA. Yes, if the dealership should have replaced the gas tank.\nB. Yes, because the buyer's injury was caused by the defective gas tank.\nC. No, if the buyer should have realized the gasoline smell presented a hazardous condition and stopped the car before the explosion occurred.\nD. No, unless the gas tank was defective when the car left the manufacturer's plant.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this law problem. It's about a buyer who got a new convertible, had some issues with gasoline odors, took it back to the dealership, and then unfortunately, the car exploded, causing serious burns. Now, the buyer wants to sue the manufacturer for damages. I need to decide if the buyer will prevail based on the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The question is whether the buyer will prevail in a claim against the manufacturer for damages due to injuries sustained from the explosion caused by a defective gas tank.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, if the dealership should have replaced the gas tank.\n\nB. Yes, because the buyer's injury was caused by the defective gas tank.\n\nC. No, if the buyer should have realized the gasoline smell presented a hazardous condition and stopped the car before the explosion occurred.\n\nD. No, unless the gas tank was defective when the car left the manufacturer's plant.\n\nHmm. This seems like a products liability case. In products liability, generally, a manufacturer can be held liable for damages caused by defects in their products, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the principles of products liability. Typically, a plaintiff must prove that the product was defective, the defect existed when it left the manufacturer's control, and that the defect was the cause of the plaintiff's injuries.\n\nIn this case, the defect is a defective gas tank that ruptured, leading to a leak and an explosion due to sparks from the car's underbody. The problem is that the buyer took the car back to the dealership complaining about a gasoline odor, and the service manager assured that the problem would be fixed. After the dealership said the problem was corrected, the buyer took the car back, only to have it explode shortly after.\n\nOption A says yes, if the dealership should have replaced the gas tank. But the question is about the manufacturer, not the dealership. The dealership might have a separate liability, but the question is specifically about the manufacturer.\n\nOption B says yes, because the buyer's injury was caused by the defective gas tank. This seems straightforward. If the injury was caused by a defective product, then the manufacturer could be liable. But I need to consider if there are any defenses or exceptions here.\n\nOption C says no, if the buyer should have realized the gasoline smell presented a hazardous condition and stopped the car before the explosion occurred. This seems to be arguing that the buyer was negligent and perhaps contributed to their own injury by not being cautious enough. This might be relevant in terms of comparative negligence, but if the product is defective, the manufacturer could still be liable despite the plaintiff's negligence.\n\nOption D says no, unless the gas tank was defective when it left the manufacturer's plant. This seems to get at the issue of when the defect occurred. If the defect developed after the product left the manufacturer, the manufacturer might not be liable. But in this case, it's stated that a reasonable inspection would have disclosed the defective gas tank, and the trouble the buyer described was indicative of such a problem. This suggests that the defect was present before the dealership got involved.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\n1. Was there a defect in the product? Yes, a defective gas tank that ruptured.\n\n2. Did the defect cause the injury? Yes, the explosion caused burns.\n\n3. Was the defect present when the product left the manufacturer's control? This is crucial. If the defect occurred later, the manufacturer might not be liable.\n\nBut according to the problem, a reasonable inspection would have disclosed the defective gas tank, and the issues the buyer described were indicative of the problem. This suggests that the defect was there from the beginning, and it wasn't something that happened after the manufacturer sold the car.\n\nAlso, the dealership, upon fixing the problem, didn't actually fix it, which led to the explosion. This might indicate that the dealership was negligent in their repair, but that doesn't absolve the manufacturer from liability if the defect was present originally.\n\nIn products liability, the concept of strict liability often applies, meaning that the manufacturer is liable for defects even if they were not negligent. As long as the defect existed at the time the product left the manufacturer's control, and it caused harm, the manufacturer can be held responsible.\n\nGiven that, option D seems too restrictive. It says no unless the gas tank was defective when it left the manufacturer's plant. But based on the information, it seems that the gas tank was defective at that time.\n\nOption C argues that the buyer should have realized the smell was hazardous and stopped the car. But in products liability, the manufacturer's liability isn't necessarily defeated by the plaintiff's failure to discover or avoid the defect, especially if the product is expected to be safe when used as intended.\n\nOption A is about the dealership's actions, which might be relevant, but the question is about the manufacturer.\n\nOption B seems most straightforward: yes, because the injury was caused by the defective gas tank.\n\nWait, but option D is also tempting because it emphasizes that the defect must have been present when the product left the manufacturer's control. Which makes sense, because if the defect occurred later, the manufacturer might not be liable.\n\nBut in this case, it's stated that a reasonable inspection would have disclosed the defective gas tank, and the problems the buyer described were indicative of the defect. This suggests that the defect was there from the beginning.\n\nSo, perhaps both options B and D are partially correct, but D adds a condition that seems already satisfied based on the facts.\n\nI think the most direct answer is B: yes, because the buyer's injury was caused by the defective gas tank.\n\nThe other options either introduce irrelevant considerations (A and C) or are too limiting given the facts (D).\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
