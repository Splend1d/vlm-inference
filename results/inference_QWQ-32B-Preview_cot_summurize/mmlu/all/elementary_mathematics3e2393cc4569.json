                    "text": "So there are 20 students in Mr. Clark's fourth-grade class, and the entire fourth grade has 5 times as many students as his class. We need to find out which equation helps us determine the total number of students in the entire fourth grade, and the options are:\n\nA. 5 \u00d7 n = 20\n\nB. 5 + 20 = n\n\nC. 20 \u00d7 5 = n\n\nD. 20 \u00f7 n = 5\n\nHmm, let's see. If Mr. Clark's class has 20 students and the entire fourth grade has 5 times as many, that means we have to multiply the number of students in his class by 5 to get the total number of students in the fourth grade.\n\nSo, if n is the total number of students in the fourth grade, then n should be equal to 20 multiplied by 5. That sounds like option C: 20 \u00d7 5 = n.\n\nLet me double-check. Option A says 5 \u00d7 n = 20, which would mean that n is the number we're trying to find, but if we solve for n, it would be n = 20 \u00f7 5, which is 4. But that doesn't make sense in this context because the fourth grade has more students, not fewer.\n\nOption B is 5 + 20 = n, which would make n equal to 25. But that's just adding 5 to the class size, which isn't the same as having 5 times as many students.\n\nOption C is 20 \u00d7 5 = n, which would make n equal to 100. That seems right because if Mr. Clark's class has 20 students and the entire grade has 5 times that, then it should be 100 students.\n\nOption D is 20 \u00f7 n = 5, which would mean n = 20 \u00f7 5 = 4, same as option A, which doesn't make sense here.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is C. 20 \u00d7 5 = n.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
