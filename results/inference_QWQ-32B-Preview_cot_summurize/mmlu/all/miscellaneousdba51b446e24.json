Often in children's games, dogs are colored brown or black, but I'm not certain. Maybe it's green? Like a alien or something funny. Or perhaps it's red, like a friendly robot? Hmm, or blue, like a superhero. I really don't know. Maybe I should look it up online, but since it's a multiple-choice question, I'll take a guess. I think it's B, black. That seems like a common color for a dog character. But I'm not sure at all."
