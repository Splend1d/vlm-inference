Let's see what each option means.\n\nFirst, \"appeal to the people\" is a type of logical fallacy where someone tries to convince others by appealing to their emotions or pre-existing beliefs rather than using sound reasoning or evidence.\n\nOption A is \"argument by consensus.\" Hmm, that sounds similar. \"Argument by consensus\" suggests that something is true because most people believe it. That does seem like appealing to people's beliefs or emotions, especially if the truth doesn't actually depend on popularity.\n\nOption B is \"appeal to beliefs.\" This seems straightforward\u2014it's appealing directly to someone's beliefs. That could be similar to appealing to the people if it's about leveraging those beliefs to make a point without proper evidence.\n\nOption C is \"no true Scotsman.\" I think I've heard of that one. It's a type of fallacy where someone redefines their position to avoid contradiction. For example, if someone says \"all Scotsmen are brave,\" and you provide an example of a Scotsman who isn't brave, they might say \"well, he's no true Scotsman.\" So, this seems different from appealing to the people.\n\nOption D is \"overlooked evidence.\" That sounds like ignoring certain evidence that doesn't support the argument. Again, different from appealing to people's emotions or beliefs.\n\nComparing all these, option A, \"argument by consensus,\" seems the most similar to \"appeal to the people\" because both involve appealing to what many people think or believe, rather than relying on solid evidence or logic.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Argument by consensus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
