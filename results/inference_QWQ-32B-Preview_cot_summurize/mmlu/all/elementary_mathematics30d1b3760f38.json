So, it's somewhere between 71 and 79, inclusive, I guess. But since it's greater than 70 and less than 80, that means it's in the seventies.\n\nNow, options A, B, C, and D are all in the seventies, but only some of them have 7 in the ones place.\n\nLet's look at option A: 71. The ones digit is 1, not 7. So, that can't be the number.\n\nOption B: 73. The ones digit is 3, not 7. So, that's not it either.\n\nOption C: 77. The ones digit is 7. That matches the description.\n\nOption D: 79. The ones digit is 9, not 7.\n\nSo, only option C, which is 77, has 7 in the ones place and is between 70 and 80.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"I have 7 in the ones place\" and \"I am less than 80 but greater than 70.\" So, 77 fits both criteria.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any other numbers between 70 and 80 that have 7 in the ones place. Let's list them out:\n\n71: ones digit is 1\n\n72: ones digit is 2\n\n73: ones digit is 3\n\n74: ones digit is 4\n\n75: ones digit is 5\n\n76: ones digit is 6\n\n77: ones digit is 7\n\n78: ones digit is 8\n\n79: ones digit is 9\n\n80: ones digit is 0, but it's not less than 80 and greater than 70 at the same time.\n\nSo, only 77 has 7 in the ones place in that range.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 77.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
