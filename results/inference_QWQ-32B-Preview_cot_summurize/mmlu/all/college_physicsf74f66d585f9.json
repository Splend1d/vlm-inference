                    "text": "So I've got this question here about blackbodies and how their energy radiation changes with temperature. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nA blackbody is an idealized object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, and it also emits radiation depending on its temperature. The question is about how the energy radiated per second per unit area changes when the absolute temperature is increased by a factor of 3.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between the energy radiated by a blackbody and its temperature. I think this has to do with Stefan-Boltzmann law or something similar.\n\nLet me recall the Stefan-Boltzmann law. It states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a blackbody per unit time (also known as the blackbody's radiance or sometimes flux) is proportional to the fourth power of the blackbody's absolute temperature. The formula is usually written as:\n\nj* = \u03c3 T\u2074\n\nWhere:\n\n- j* is the total energy radiated per unit area per unit time (in watts per square meter, W/m\u00b2).\n\n- \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 5.67 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078 W/m\u00b2K\u2074.\n\n- T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin (K).\n\nSo, according to this law, if the temperature increases, the radiated energy increases a lot because it's to the fourth power.\n\nNow, the question says the absolute temperature is increased by a factor of 3. So, if the initial temperature is T, the new temperature is 3T.\n\nLet's calculate the initial radiated energy per second per unit area:\n\nj_initial = \u03c3 T\u2074\n\nAnd the final radiated energy per second per unit area:\n\nj_final = \u03c3 (3T)\u2074\n\nNow, let's compute (3T)\u2074:\n\n(3T)\u2074 = 3\u2074 * T\u2074 = 81 T\u2074\n\nSo, j_final = \u03c3 * 81 T\u2074 = 81 * \u03c3 T\u2074 = 81 * j_initial\n\nTherefore, the energy radiated per second per unit area increases by a factor of 81.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Decreases by a factor of 81.\n\nB. Decreases by a factor of 9.\n\nC. Increases by a factor of 9.\n\nD. Increases by a factor of 81.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. Increases by a factor of 81.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Yes, it is j* = \u03c3 T\u2074, where j* is the total energy radiated per unit area per unit time.\n\nAnd raising 3 to the fourth power is indeed 81. So, everything seems correct.\n\nI think D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
