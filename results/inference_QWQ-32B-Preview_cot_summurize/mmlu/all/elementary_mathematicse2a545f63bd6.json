So, we start with a certain number of students in a class, and the problem takes us through a couple of events that reduce the number of students in the class. At the end, there are 8 students left, and we need to find out how many there were originally.\n\nFirst, let's define the original number of students as something. I'll call it X. So, X is the number of students at the beginning of the class period.\n\nAccording to the problem, half of the students go to the library at the beginning of the class. So, half of X go to the library. That means X/2 students go to the library, and the remaining students in the class are X - X/2, which is X/2.\n\nLater in the period, half of the remaining students go to the computer lab. So, half of the remaining X/2 students go to the computer lab. Half of X/2 is (X/2)/2, which is X/4.\n\nSo, after this second event, the number of students left in the class is the remaining students after some went to the computer lab. Since X/4 students went to the computer lab, the remaining students are X/2 - X/4, which is X/4.\n\nAccording to the problem, there are 8 students remaining in the class. So, X/4 = 8.\n\nNow, to find X, we can solve this equation by multiplying both sides by 4:\n\nX = 8 * 4\n\nX = 32\n\nSo, the original number of students in the class was 32.\n\nLet me just double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 32 students:\n\n- Half go to the library: 32/2 = 16 go to the library, leaving 16 in the class.\n\n- Then, half of the remaining 16 go to the computer lab: 16/2 = 8 go to the computer lab, leaving 8 in the class.\n\nYes, that matches the problem's statement. So, the answer is 32 students.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 12 students\n\nB. 16 students\n\nC. 24 students\n\nD. 32 students\n\nThe correct choice is D. 32 students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
