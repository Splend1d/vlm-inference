His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nIn European industry, the mining industry as discussed in the passage grew in importance following the invention of\n\nA. the water frame\nB. the spinning jenny\nC. the steam engine\nD. the internal combustion engine\n"

He's upset because his fellow Nihilists are focusing on national liberation instead of building a new society based on common labor. The character has given up his rank and fortune to live among workers, but he feels like there's no real connection or \"fusion\" between him and the workers.\n\nThen, he talks directly to another character named \u00c9tienne about hatworkers in Marseilles who won a lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs and immediately invested it, saying they're going to live without doing anything. The speaker criticizes this idea, suggesting that French workmen want to find a treasure and enjoy it alone in some lazy, selfish corner. He argues that as long as they own anything, they won't be worthy of happiness, and their hatred of the bourgeoisie is just a desire to be bourgeois themselves.\n\nOkay, so the question is about the mining industry growing in importance following the invention of something. The options are:\n\nA. the water frame\n\nB. the spinning jenny\n\nC. the steam engine\n\nD. the internal combustion engine\n\nFirst, I need to recall what these inventions are and their relation to the mining industry.\n\nThe water frame was invented by Richard Arkwright in the 18th century. It was a type of spinning frame that used water power to spin cotton. This was a significant invention in the textile industry, but I'm not sure how directly it relates to mining.\n\nThe spinning jenny was invented by James Hargreaves around the same time. It allowed a single worker to spin multiple spools of thread simultaneously, which also revolutionized the textile industry. Again, not directly related to mining.\n\nThe steam engine, particularly the improvements made by James Watt in the late 18th century, was a game-changer for many industries, including mining. Steam engines were used to pump water out of mines, power mining equipment, and transport minerals. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nThe internal combustion engine came later, in the 19th century, and revolutionized transportation and machinery. While it had impacts on many industries, its influence on mining might have been more in the 20th century with the development of mechanized mining equipment.\n\nGiven that \"Germinal\" is set in the 19th century and discusses the mining industry, and considering the historical context of industrialization, the steam engine seems like the most likely answer.\n\nSo, I think the correct choice is C. the steam engine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
