                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character is doing something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I often sell used books online that I found on my bookshelf.\"\n\nSo, here, someone is selling books they own. They're used books, which means they've probably read them or acquired them somehow. Selling used books is a common practice; people do it all the time on platforms like Amazon, eBay, or even through local bookstores. As long as the books are legally obtained and the seller is truthful about their condition, there doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I scratched her wound.\"\n\nThis one sounds more problematic. Scratching someone's wound could cause pain, potentially lead to infection, or worsen the injury. Unless it's being done for a medical reason, like cleaning a wound under professional guidance, it seems unnecessary and harmful. Intentionally causing harm to someone else is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Selling used books: Not wrong.\n\n- Scratching someone's wound: Wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
