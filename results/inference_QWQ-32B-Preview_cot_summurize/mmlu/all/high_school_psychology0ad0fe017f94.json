The options are stereotyping, scapegoating, out-group homogeneity, and superordinate goals. I think I need to understand what each of these terms means and how they relate to prejudice.\n\nFirst, stereotyping is when we make generalizations about a group of people, assuming that all members of that group share certain characteristics. This can lead to prejudice because it oversimplifies and often inaccurately represents the group.\n\nScapegoating is when a group blames another group for their problems, often unjustly. This can definitely contribute to prejudice as it fosters negative attitudes and sometimes even hostility towards the scapegoated group.\n\nOut-group homogeneity is the tendency to see members of other groups as more similar to each other than members of one's own group. This can lead to prejudice because it ignores the individual differences within the out-group and reinforces the idea that they are all alike in negative ways.\n\nNow, superordinate goals are common goals that require the cooperation of different groups. I think this one is different from the others because it promotes collaboration and shared objectives, which can actually reduce prejudice by bringing groups together and fostering positive interactions.\n\nSo, comparing all these, stereotyping, scapegoating, and out-group homogeneity all seem to contribute to prejudice in different ways. On the other hand, superordinate goals appear to be something that can help reduce prejudice.\n\nTherefore, I believe that superordinate goals are the least likely to contribute to prejudice among the options given.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
