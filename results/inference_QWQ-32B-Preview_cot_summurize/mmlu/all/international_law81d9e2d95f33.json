                    "text": "The term \"equitable result\" in the context of maritime delimitation refers to the goal of achieving a fair and just boundary between adjacent or opposite states' maritime areas, such as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the continental shelf. This concept is central to international law, particularly in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n\nOption A suggests that the equitable result is the only method followed by international courts and tribunals. While it is indeed a fundamental principle, it is not the sole method. Courts and tribunals consider various factors and methods, including the equidistance/special circumstances approach, to reach an equitable solution.\n\nOption B describes an equitable result as what a judge or arbitrator would decide ex aequo et bono, meaning based on their discretion and what they consider fair and equitable. While ex aequo et bono is a method of dispute resolution where the tribunal can decide based on general principles of fairness and justice, in maritime delimitation cases, tribunals typically follow established legal methods and principles rather than purely discretionary approaches. Therefore, this option oversimplifies the process.\n\nOption C captures the essence of the equitable result in maritime delimitation. It involves drawing a provisional equidistance line between states and then adjusting this line to account for relevant circumstances, aiming to achieve a proportionate allocation of maritime spaces. This approach is widely accepted in international law and practice, as outlined in the UNCLOS and confirmed by various judicial decisions, such as the ICJ's Cameroun v. Nigeria (Land and Maritime Boundary) case.\n\nOption D states that achieving an equitable result is an old method no longer applicable today. This is incorrect because the pursuit of an equitable result remains a cornerstone of contemporary maritime delimitation law and practice.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is Option C: An equitable result is what all delimitations of areas of continental shelf and EEZ should achieve, after drawing a provisional 'equidistance line' and adjusting the zone in light of the relevant circumstances and the proportionality test.\n\n**Further Explanation:**\n\nIn maritime delimitation, the process typically starts with the construction of an equidistance line, which is a line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each state is measured. However, this line is only provisional and may need to be adjusted to take into account specific geographical, geological, or other relevant circumstances that could affect the fairness of the delimitation.\n\nThe concept of proportionality is also crucial. It involves ensuring that the delimitation reflects an equitable share of the maritime area in question, considering the respective lengths of the coastlines and other relevant factors. The ultimate aim is to achieve a boundary that is equitable, meaning it is fair and just to all parties involved, taking into account all relevant circumstances.\n\nThis approach has been consistently applied and affirmed by international courts and tribunals, including the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and various arbitration tribunals established under UNCLOS. Therefore, Option C accurately describes the role and significance of the equitable result in maritime delimitation law and practice.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)\n\n- International Court of Justice (ICJ) judgments, such as the Cameroun v. Nigeria (Land and Maritime Boundary) case\n\n- Decisions from arbitration tribunals established under UNCLOS\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n- Equidistance as a starting point\n\n- Adjustment for relevant circumstances\n\n- Proportionality in the delimitation\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe equitable result in maritime delimitation is achieved through a methodical approach that begins with the equidistance line and adjusts it based on relevant circumstances to ensure a proportionate and fair allocation of maritime spaces. This principle is fundamental to international law and is consistently applied in judicial and arbitral decisions related to maritime boundaries.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- Study the provisions of UNCLOS regarding maritime delimitation\n\n- Analyze key judicial decisions, such as those from the ICJ and UNCLOS tribunals, to understand the application of the equitable result principle\n\n- Consider real-world examples of maritime delimitation disputes to see how the principle is applied in practice\n\n**Further Reading:**\n\n- Articles 74 and 83 of UNCLOS\n\n- Jurisprudence from the International Court of Justice and arbitration tribunals\n\n- Scholarly writings on maritime delimitation and the equitable principle\n\n**Note:**\n\nUnderstanding the equitable result in maritime delimitation requires a grasp of both legal principles and practical applications. It is essential to consider how different factors can influence the delimitation process and how international law guides the achievement of fairness and justice in maritime boundary disputes.\n\n"
