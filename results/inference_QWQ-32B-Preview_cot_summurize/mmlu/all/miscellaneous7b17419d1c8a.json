Describing and mapping the building types on a plat map\n\nB. Determining how many cars travel along the highway system\n\nC. Establishing the percentage of adults with a college education\n\nD. Graphing and analyzing economic data for the past century\n\nHmm, let's see. First off, I need to understand what a cultural landscape is. I think it refers to the visible human impact on the environment, like buildings, roads, farms, and such. It's about how people have shaped the physical space around them to suit their cultural practices and needs.\n\nSo, if I'm starting a study on this, I probably want to look at the physical features that reflect the culture of the region. That might include things like architecture, land use patterns, and maybe even how people move around the space.\n\nOption A suggests describing and mapping building types on a plat map. A plat map is a type of map that shows boundaries and lots in a subdivision, right? So, if I map out the building types, I can see how different areas are used\u2014residential, commercial, industrial, and so on. That seems directly related to the cultural landscape because it shows how people have organized their space based on their needs and values.\n\nOption B is about determining how many cars travel along the highway system. While transportation is certainly a part of the cultural landscape, this seems a bit too specific. It's more about traffic volume than about the cultural aspects of the landscape. Maybe if I were studying transportation patterns, but it doesn't seem as comprehensive as option A.\n\nOption C is about establishing the percentage of adults with a college education. That's more demographic data, which can be relevant to culture, but it's not directly about the landscape. It's about the people themselves, not about how they've shaped the physical environment. So, while it's related to culture, it's not as directly connected to the landscape.\n\nOption D is about graphing and analyzing economic data for the past century. Economic data can influence the cultural landscape, but again, it's more abstract and not directly about the physical features of the landscape. It's historical and economic, which might inform the study, but it's not the first step in observing the current cultural landscape.\n\nComparing all these options, option A seems the most directly relevant to studying the cultural landscape. By describing and mapping building types, the geographer can get a visual and spatial understanding of how the culture has manifested in the physical environment. This can reveal a lot about the society's priorities, history, and way of life.\n\nFor example, if there are many religious buildings in a certain area, it might indicate the importance of religion in that community. If there are large industrial buildings, it could suggest a history of manufacturing or commerce. The layout of residential areas can show social structures or planning principles.\n\nMoreover, mapping building types can help identify patterns or changes over time, which is crucial for understanding the development of the cultural landscape.\n\nSo, I think option A is the best choice for a geographer starting a study of the cultural landscape in a specific region.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
