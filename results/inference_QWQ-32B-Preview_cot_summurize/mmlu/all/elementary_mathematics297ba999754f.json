                    "text": "So I have this equation: y + 2.9 = 11. I need to find out what value of y makes this equation true. The options are A. 8.1, B. 8.9, C. 9.1, and D. 13.9. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that in an equation, both sides are equal. So, if y plus 2.9 equals 11, that means y is some number that when you add 2.9 to it, you get 11. To find y, I think I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. How do I do that?\n\nWell, if I have y + 2.9 = 11, and I want to get y by itself, I should subtract 2.9 from both sides of the equation. That way, the +2.9 and -2.9 cancel out on the left side, leaving just y. And on the right side, 11 minus 2.9 should give me the value of y.\n\nLet me try that. So, y + 2.9 - 2.9 = 11 - 2.9. Simplifying, y = 11 - 2.9. Now, what is 11 minus 2.9?\n\nI can think of 11 as 11.0 to make subtraction easier. So, 11.0 - 2.9. Subtracting the decimals, 0 minus 9 can't be done, so I need to borrow 1 from the units place. So, 10 minus 9 is 1, and then 10 (since I borrowed 1) minus 2 is 8. So, 11.0 - 2.9 = 8.1.\n\nTherefore, y = 8.1.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If y is 8.1, and I add 2.9 to it, does it equal 11?\n\nSo, 8.1 + 2.9. Adding the decimals, 1 + 9 is 10, carry over 1, and 8 + 2 is 10, plus the carried over 1 makes 11. Yes, that checks out.\n\nNow, looking at the options, A is 8.1, which matches what I got. But let's just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is 8.9. If y was 8.9, then 8.9 + 2.9 would be 11.8, which is more than 11.\n\nOption C is 9.1. 9.1 + 2.9 is 12, which is even higher.\n\nOption D is 13.9. 13.9 + 2.9 is 16.8, way higher than 11.\n\nSo, clearly, only option A, which is 8.1, makes the equation true.\n\nAlternatively, I could plug in each option into the equation and see which one works, but that might take longer. Since I already know that y = 8.1 from subtracting 2.9 from both sides, and it checks out, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
