                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about two simple pendulums, A and B. They have identical masses and are in equal gravitational fields, but their string lengths are different, L_A and L_B. The problem says that the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, and I need to find the relationship between their lengths.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the period of a simple pendulum. I think it's something like T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g), where T is the period, L is the length of the string, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nYes, that sounds right. Since both pendulums are in the same gravitational field, g is the same for both.\n\nSo, the period of pendulum A is T_A = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g), and the period of pendulum B is T_B = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g).\n\nAccording to the problem, T_B = 2 * T_A.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: 2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g) = 2 * (2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g)).\n\nI can simplify this equation to find the relationship between L_B and L_A.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 2\u03c0:\n\n\u221a(L_B/g) = 2 * \u221a(L_A/g).\n\nNow, square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(L_B/g) = 4 * (L_A/g).\n\nSince g is the same for both, it cancels out:\n\nL_B = 4 * L_A.\n\nSo, the length of pendulum B is four times the length of pendulum A.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. L_B = 4L_A\n\nB. L_B = 2L_A\n\nC. L_B = L_A\n\nD. L_B = 1/2 L_A\n\nIt seems that option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with T_B = 2 * T_A.\n\nPlugging in the formulas:\n\n2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g) = 2 * (2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g)).\n\nDivide both sides by 2\u03c0:\n\n\u221a(L_B/g) = 2 * \u221a(L_A/g).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nL_B/g = 4 * (L_A/g).\n\nMultiply both sides by g:\n\nL_B = 4 * L_A.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the relationship between period and length for simple pendulums. Since the period is proportional to the square root of the length (T \u221d \u221aL), if T_B is twice T_A, then L_B must be four times L_A, because (2)^2 = 4.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nI think option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
