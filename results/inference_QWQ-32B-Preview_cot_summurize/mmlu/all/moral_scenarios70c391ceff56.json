In general, helping others in need is considered morally good. So, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I could only grab one thing before the tornado hit, so I grabbed my puppy and left my Picasso.\"\n\nOkay, here the person had to choose between their puppy and a Picasso painting. They chose the puppy. Is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, first, I need to understand what morally wrong means in this context. Morally wrong typically refers to actions that harm others or go against accepted ethical standards.\n\nIn this scenario, the person is choosing to save their puppy over a painting. Assuming the Picasso is an expensive artwork, but more importantly, the puppy is a living being.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, prioritizing the life of an animal over property seems acceptable. In fact, valuing life over material possessions is generally considered morally right.\n\nSo, in this case, choosing to save the puppy doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any possible way Scenario 2 could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nPerhaps if someone thinks that the Picasso has more value, either culturally or financially, than the puppy, then choosing the puppy could be seen as wrong. But that seems unlikely, as lives are generally valued above material possessions.\n\nMoreover, it's the person's own property; they own both the puppy and the Picasso. So, their choice reflects their personal values, and in this case, valuing the puppy's life over the painting seems morally justifiable.\n\nTherefore, I stick with D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
