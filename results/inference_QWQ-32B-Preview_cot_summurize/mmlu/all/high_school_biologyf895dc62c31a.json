                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about mules. So, mules are these interesting creatures that result from crossing a male donkey and a female horse. They're known for their strength and longevity, but apparently, they have some issues with meiosis, which is the cell division process that produces gametes for reproduction.\n\nThe question is asking which statement about mules is true, given that they generally can't perform successful meiosis. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"They have a relative evolutionary fitness of zero.\" Now, evolutionary fitness is about an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, passing on its genes to the next generation. Since mules can't generally reproduce, you might think that their fitness is zero because they don't contribute to the gene pool. But hold on, mules are still valuable animals; they're used for work and transportation, and people take care of them. So, in a way, they have a role in the ecosystem, even if it's not through natural reproduction. Maybe their fitness isn't zero, especially if humans are involved in their care and propagation.\n\nOption B says: \"Their offspring have less genetic variation than the parents.\" Hmm, but mules don't usually have offspring, since they can't reproduce successfully. So, this statement seems a bit tricky because mules don't typically have offspring to compare genetic variation with. Maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption C says: \"Mutations cannot occur in their genomes.\" That seems unlikely. Mutations are random changes in DNA sequences, and they can happen in any organism, regardless of its reproductive capabilities. So, just because mules can't perform successful meiosis doesn't mean they can't have mutations. In fact, mutations can occur during mitosis or through other processes. So, this statement probably isn't true.\n\nOption D says: \"If crossing-over happens in mules, then it must be limited to prophase of mitosis.\" Crossing-over is when chromosomes exchange genetic material during meiosis, specifically in prophase I. Since mules can't perform successful meiosis, it's unlikely that crossing-over occurs in them. However, the statement is saying that if it does happen, it must be limited to prophase of mitosis. But crossing-over is a meiotic process, not a mitotic one. Mitosis is for somatic cell division, not for producing gametes. So, this seems a bit confused.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the key is understanding that mules can't perform successful meiosis, which means they can't produce viable gametes. That would explain why they can't reproduce sexually. Now, considering evolutionary fitness, if an organism can't reproduce, it doesn't pass on its genes, which would suggest its fitness is zero.\n\nBut wait, in some contexts, fitness isn't just about reproduction; it can also include survival and other factors. Moreover, since mules are often products of human breeding, their existence and care might be sustained artificially, beyond natural selection.\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward answer is option A: They have a relative evolutionary fitness of zero. This makes sense because they can't reproduce and pass on their genes, which is a key component of evolutionary fitness.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption B doesn't make much sense because mules don't typically have offspring. So, talking about their offspring's genetic variation isn't applicable.\n\nOption C is probably false because mutations can occur in any organism's genome, regardless of their reproductive capabilities.\n\nOption D is confusing because crossing-over is a meiotic process, and mules can't perform successful meiosis. So, even if crossing-over were to occur, it wouldn't be during mitosis.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
