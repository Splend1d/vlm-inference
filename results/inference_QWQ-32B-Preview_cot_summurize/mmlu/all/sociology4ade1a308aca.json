The options are:\n\nA. finding out which topics are important to the respondents\n\nB. testing out your computer and printer\n\nC. identifying any problems with the question wording and routing\n\nD. deciding which respondents to leave out of the final sample\n\nFirst, I need to understand what pre-testing a questionnaire really means. From what I recall, pre-testing is like a trial run of your survey before you launch it to the entire target group. It's a way to check if everything is working as planned.\n\nOption A says it's useful for finding out which topics are important to the respondents. Well, that sounds more like the purpose of the actual survey itself, not necessarily the pre-test. Pre-testing is more about ensuring the survey instrument is effective, not about discovering the content importance.\n\nOption B is about testing your computer and printer. That seems way off track. Pre-testing a questionnaire is about the questionnaire design and functionality, not about testing your hardware.\n\nOption C mentions identifying any problems with the question wording and routing. This sounds promising. When you pre-test, you want to make sure that the questions are clear, that there are no confusing phrases, and that the logic in the survey\u2014like skipping questions based on previous answers\u2014is working correctly.\n\nOption D is about deciding which respondents to leave out of the final sample. That doesn't make much sense. The sample selection should be based on your research objectives and target population, not on the pre-test results.\n\nSo, between these options, C seems to be the most accurate. Pre-testing helps you catch issues with how questions are worded and how the survey flows from one question to another.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should think about what else pre-testing could be useful for. For example, it could help you estimate the time it takes to complete the survey, or it could give you an idea of the response rates. However, these aren't listed as options.\n\nAlternatively, pre-testing can also help ensure that the survey is understandable to the target audience and that there are no ambiguities in the questions. This aligns with option C's mention of question wording.\n\nOption A, about finding out which topics are important, might be a goal of the survey, but it's not a direct benefit of pre-testing. Pre-testing is more about refining the tool you're going to use to collect that information.\n\nOption D is confusing. Deciding which respondents to exclude from the final sample isn't typically a function of pre-testing the questionnaire. Sample selection should be based on criteria relevant to your study.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: identifying any problems with the question wording and routing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
