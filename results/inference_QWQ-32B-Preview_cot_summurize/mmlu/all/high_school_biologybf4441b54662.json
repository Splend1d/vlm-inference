                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Which of the following are traits that are affected by more than one gene?\" and there are options A, B, C, and D. I need to figure out which ones refer to traits influenced by multiple genes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means.\n\nOption A is \"Heterozygous traits.\" Heterozygous refers to having two different alleles for a single gene. So, for example, if you have one dominant allele and one recessive allele for a gene, you're heterozygous for that trait. But this is still about a single gene, right? So, I don't think this means the trait is affected by more than one gene.\n\nOption B is \"Pleiotropic traits.\" Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. So, a single gene influences several different characteristics. That's interesting, but it's still just one gene affecting multiple traits, not multiple genes affecting one trait. So, I don't think this is the answer either.\n\nOption C is \"Polygenic traits.\" Polygenic means that multiple genes are involved in determining the trait. So, unlike Mendelian inheritance where one gene controls one trait, polygenic traits are influenced by two or more genes. Examples include height, skin color, and intelligence. These traits show a range of variations because they're not controlled by just one gene. This sounds like what the question is asking for.\n\nOption D is \"Blended alleles.\" I'm not sure what this means exactly. I know that blending inheritance was an old idea before Mendel's work, where traits from parents were thought to blend together in offspring. But in modern genetics, we know that alleles are not blended; they are expressed independently. So, maybe this isn't a accurate term in current genetic understanding. Perhaps it's a misnomer or not relevant to the question.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C, \"Polygenic traits,\" is the correct answer because these are traits affected by more than one gene.\n\nBut let me double-check. The question is asking for traits affected by more than one gene. Heterozygous traits are about having different alleles for a single gene. Pleiotropic traits are about one gene affecting multiple traits. Polygenic traits are about multiple genes affecting one trait. Blended alleles don't really make sense in current genetic terms.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Polygenic traits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
