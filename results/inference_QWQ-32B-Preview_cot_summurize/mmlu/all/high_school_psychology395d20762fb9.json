                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the smallest unit of language that carries meaning is. The options are concept, word, phoneme, and morpheme. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that a word is a unit of language that has meaning and makes sense on its own. Like \"cat\" or \"run.\" Those are complete words that you can understand individually.\n\nA phoneme is a basic unit of sound in a language. For example, in English, the sound /k/ is a phoneme. But phonemes don't have meaning by themselves; they're just sounds that combine to form words.\n\nA concept is more of an idea or a thought. It's not really a unit of language, but rather what language often represents. So, concepts are things like \"love\" or \"happiness,\" which are ideas expressed through language.\n\nNow, a morpheme is a bit tricky. I think it's the smallest unit of language that has meaning. Let me see: in the word \"unhappiness,\" \"un-\" is a prefix, \"happy\" is the root, and \"-ness\" is a suffix. Each of these parts\u2014 \"un-,\" \"happy,\" and \"-ness\"\u2014carries some meaning and can't be broken down further without losing that meaning. So, they are morphemes.\n\nComparing all these, it seems like a morpheme is smaller than a word because a word can be made up of one or more morphemes. Phonemes are smaller than morphemes, but they don't have meaning on their own. Concepts are what language expresses, but they aren't units of language themselves.\n\nTherefore, the smallest unit of language that carries meaning should be the morpheme.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Morpheme.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
