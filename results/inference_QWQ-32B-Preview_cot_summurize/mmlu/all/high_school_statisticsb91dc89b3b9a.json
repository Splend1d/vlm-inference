                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which significance test is appropriate for this experiment. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the experiment is a double-blind randomized study comparing two creams: the old formula and the new formula for acne treatment. Volunteers used one formula on one side of their face and the other formula on the other side. The response variable is the difference in the number of pimples between the old and new formula sides.\n\nOkay, so we have paired data here because each participant is using both formulas, one on each side of their face. This means that the data are not independent; the two measurements are related through the same individual.\n\nGiven that, I think a matched pairs t-test would be appropriate. Let me see why.\n\nA matched pairs t-test is used when you have two related samples or measurements from the same subjects. In this case, each participant has two measurements: one for each side of their face, each treated with a different formula. The interest is in the difference between these paired measurements.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is a two-proportion z-test. That's used when you have two independent groups and you're comparing proportions. But here, it's not about proportions; it's about the difference in the number of pimples, which is a continuous variable. Also, the groups are not independent because the same person is in both \"groups.\"\n\nOption B is a two-sample t-test. This is for comparing means from two independent groups. Again, in this experiment, the groups are not independent because the same individuals are in both groups.\n\nOption D is a chi-square test of independence. That's used for categorical data to see if there's a relationship between two categorical variables. But here, the response variable is the difference in the number of pimples, which is continuous, not categorical.\n\nSo, considering that, the matched pairs t-test seems to be the correct choice. It's designed for situations where you have two related measurements, and you're interested in the mean difference between them.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that the conditions for a matched pairs t-test are met.\n\nFirst, the data should be paired, which they are, since each participant has two measurements.\n\nSecond, the differences should be normally distributed, especially if the sample size is small. But since it's a randomized experiment, and likely there are multiple volunteers, the Central Limit Theorem might apply, making the distribution of the mean difference approximately normal.\n\nThird, the pairs are independent of each other, meaning that the difference for one participant doesn't influence the difference for another participant. Randomization should have taken care of that.\n\nSo, overall, a matched pairs t-test seems appropriate.\n\nLet me just think about whether a paired t-test is the same as a matched pairs t-test. Yes, they are essentially the same thing. \"Paired t-test\" and \"matched pairs t-test\" are used interchangeably.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. A matched pairs t-test.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
