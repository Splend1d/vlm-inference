                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, we have a screenwriter who's just finished a romantic comedy screenplay. A movie studio options the screenplay, pays $5,000 for the rights, and agrees to give the screenwriter 10% of the gross receipts if they decide to produce the movie. Everything seems straightforward up to this point.\n\nThen, at a birthday party for a close friend, the screenwriter realizes they forgot a gift. In a hurry, they grab a piece of paper and write a promise that their friend is entitled to 5% of the proceeds the screenwriter will receive from the movie's distribution. They sign it, put it in an envelope, and hand it to the friend.\n\nNow, the question is about interpreting this promise. The options are:\n\nA. Equitable lien.\n\nB. Conditional assignment.\n\nC. Irrevocable assignment.\n\nD. Gratuitous assignment of future rights.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these terms means.\n\n**Equitable lien:** This is a claim or interest in property that isn't registered but is recognized by a court based on principles of equity. It's usually used to prevent unjust enrichment.\n\n**Conditional assignment:** This is an assignment that takes effect only upon the occurrence of a specified condition.\n\n**Irrevocable assignment:** This is an assignment that cannot be revoked once it's made. It's permanent.\n\n**Gratuitous assignment of future rights:** This is when someone assigns their future rights to another person without receiving anything in return.\n\nLooking back at the scenario, the screenwriter promises to give their friend 5% of the proceeds from the movie's distribution. This seems like the screenwriter is assigning a portion of their future earnings to their friend without getting anything in return, which aligns with a gratuitous assignment of future rights.\n\nLet's consider why the other options might not fit as well.\n\n**Equitable lien:** There's no indication that the friend has a claim on specific property or that the screenwriter is trying to secure a debt. It's more about sharing future earnings rather than creating a lien.\n\n**Conditional assignment:** While assignments can be conditional, in this case, the promise seems straightforward: the friend gets 5% of the proceeds without any specified conditions attached. So, it might not fit the definition of a conditional assignment.\n\n**Irrevocable assignment:** This suggests that once the assignment is made, it can't be undone. However, in many jurisdictions, assignments of future rights can be revoked unless they're supported by consideration. Since this is a gratuitous assignment, it might be revocable unless there are specific legal constraints.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate interpretation seems to be a **gratuitous assignment of future rights**.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
