                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand why, according to Hakim, most part-time work is done by women. There are four options here, and I need to figure out which one she supports.\n\nOption A says that part-time jobs pay relatively high wages and are financially beneficial. But I doubt that's the main reason because often, part-time jobs don't pay as much per hour as full-time jobs, and the total earnings might be lower. So, maybe that's not the primary motivation for women choosing part-time work.\n\nOption B talks about a rational choice to combine employment with their 'home-centred' lives. This sounds plausible because many women might want to balance work and family responsibilities. Choosing part-time work could allow them to engage in employment while still managing household duties and childcare.\n\nOption C mentions that their choices are constrained by structural factors, such as being unable to afford childcare. This also makes sense because financial constraints can limit the options available to women. If they can't afford childcare, they might choose part-time work to be able to care for their children themselves.\n\nOption D says that full-time work is not available in the kinds of occupations that they want to enter. This could be a factor, but it seems a bit limiting. Maybe in some fields there are more part-time positions available, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason across the board.\n\nLooking back at options B and C, they seem the most relevant. Hakim might argue that women choose part-time work either because they make a rational choice to balance work and home life (option B) or because their choices are constrained by external factors like financial limitations (option C).\n\nI think Hakim would support both B and C, but perhaps with more emphasis on one. Maybe she argues that while some women choose part-time work rationally to manage their home and work lives, others are forced into part-time work due to structural constraints like inability to afford childcare.\n\nBut since I have to pick one according to the question, I might go with option C, that their choices are constrained by structural factors. This is because structural factors can limit the options available to women, pushing them towards part-time work even if they might prefer full-time employment under different circumstances.\n\nHowever, option B also has merit, as many women might actively choose part-time work to better manage their personal and professional lives. Maybe Hakim sees both aspects at play.\n\nPerhaps I should look up Hakim's work from 1995 and 1996 to get a better understanding of her perspective. But since that might not be feasible right now, I'll have to make an educated guess based on common arguments in this area.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is C: their choices are constrained by structural factors, such as being unable to afford childcare. This highlights the external barriers that can affect women's employment choices.\n\nBut I should keep in mind that Hakim might have a different perspective, and perhaps emphasizes the choices women make rather than the constraints. Maybe she argues that women rationally choose part-time work because it aligns with their preferences and priorities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she discusses both aspects, but for the purpose of this question, I need to pick the option that best represents her view.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that part-time work might offer more flexibility, which can be attractive for women juggling multiple responsibilities. So, perhaps it's a combination of rational choice and structural constraints.\n\nBut since I have to choose one, I'll go with C, as structural constraints can significantly impact women's employment options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
