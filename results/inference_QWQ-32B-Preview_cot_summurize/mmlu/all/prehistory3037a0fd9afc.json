                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about lithic technology in the Arctic. The options are Clovis Complex, Denali Complex, Folsom Complex, and Nenana Complex. I need to figure out which one is characterized by wedge-shaped cores, micro-blades, bifacial knives, and burins.\n\nFirst, I should recall what each of these complexes is known for. Starting with the Clovis Complex, I remember that it's associated with the first widespread human culture in North America, dating back to around 13,000 years ago. Clovis points are distinctively fluted spear points, but I don't think they are specifically known for wedge-shaped cores or micro-blades.\n\nNext, the Folsom Complex, which succeeded the Clovis culture, is famous for its even more finely made projectile points, called Folsom points, which are smaller and have fluting on both sides. Again, not directly related to wedge-shaped cores or micro-blades.\n\nNow, the Nenana Complex, I think, is associated with some of the earliest human occupations in Alaska, around 12,000 to 14,000 years ago. I recall that Nenana points are small and triangular, and the technology might involve some micro-blades, but I'm not sure about the wedge-shaped cores and burins.\n\nFinally, the Denali Complex, which is also found in Alaska and the Yukon, dates to a later period, around 6,000 to 8,000 years ago. I believe the Denali Complex is characterized by a specific type of lithic technology that includes wedge-shaped cores, micro-blades, bifacial knives, and burins.\n\nLet me double-check that. Wedge-shaped cores are used to produce micro-blades, which are very small, thin stone tools that can be used for various purposes, including being set into handles to create composite tools like knives or saws. Bifacial knives would have been shaped on both sides to create a sharp edge, and burins are tools used for working bone, antler, or wood.\n\nI think the Denali Complex is known for this particular toolkit, which is adapted to the Arctic environment. The other complexes don't match as well with these specific tool types.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is B. Denali Complex.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
