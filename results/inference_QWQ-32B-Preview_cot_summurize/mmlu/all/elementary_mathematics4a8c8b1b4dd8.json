                    "text": "Let's solve the equation step by step. The equation given is y divided by 4 equals 8, which is written as y/4 = 8. To find the value of y, I need to isolate y on one side of the equation.\n\nI remember that whatever operation I perform on one side of the equation, I have to perform the same operation on the other side to keep the equation balanced. Since y is divided by 4, I should do the opposite operation to isolate y. The opposite of division is multiplication. So, I need to multiply both sides of the equation by 4.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\ny/4 * 4 = 8 * 4\n\nOn the left side, the 4 in the denominator and the 4 multiplied on the numerator will cancel each other out, leaving just y.\n\nSo, y = 8 * 4\n\nNow, 8 multiplied by 4 is 32.\n\nTherefore, y = 32\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If y is 32, and I divide it by 4, I should get 8.\n\n32 divided by 4 is indeed 8.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 32.\n\nI think options A, B, and C are there to trick someone who might have done a different operation or made a mistake in calculation. For example, option A is 2, which is 8 divided by 4, but that would be y divided by 4 equals 2, not 8. Option B is 4, which is the divisor in the equation, but not the value of y. Option C is 12, which might be a result of adding 8 and 4, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, definitely, D. 32 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
