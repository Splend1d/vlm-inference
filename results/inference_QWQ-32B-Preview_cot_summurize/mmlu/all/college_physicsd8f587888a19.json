So, the correct answer is A. real.\n\nTo understand why this is the case, let's delve a bit deeper into the properties of Hermitian operators.\n\nA Hermitian operator, denoted as \\( \\hat{H} \\), is one that satisfies the condition:\n\n\\[ \\hat{H}^\\dagger = \\hat{H} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\dagger \\) denotes the Hermitian conjugate. In the context of quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators because their eigenvalues correspond to measurable quantities, and it's crucial that these measurements yield real numbers.\n\nLet's consider an eigenvalue equation for a Hermitian operator \\( \\hat{H} \\):\n\n\\[ \\hat{H} | \\psi \\rangle = a | \\psi \\rangle \\]\n\nwhere \\( | \\psi \\rangle \\) is an eigenvector and \\( a \\) is the corresponding eigenvalue.\n\nTo show that \\( a \\) is real, we can take the inner product of both sides of the equation with the bra \\( \\langle \\psi | \\):\n\n\\[ \\langle \\psi | \\hat{H} | \\psi \\rangle = a \\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle \\]\n\nSince \\( \\hat{H} \\) is Hermitian, \\( \\hat{H}^\\dagger = \\hat{H} \\), and the inner product \\( \\langle \\psi | \\hat{H} | \\psi \\rangle \\) is equal to its own complex conjugate:\n\n\\[ \\langle \\psi | \\hat{H} | \\psi \\rangle = \\langle \\hat{H} \\psi | \\psi \\rangle^* = \\langle \\psi | \\hat{H} | \\psi \\rangle^* \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( \\langle \\psi | \\hat{H} | \\psi \\rangle \\) is real.\n\nNow, from the eigenvalue equation:\n\n\\[ \\langle \\psi | \\hat{H} | \\psi \\rangle = a \\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle \\]\n\nand since \\( \\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle \\) is the norm of the eigenvector and is real and positive, we have:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{\\langle \\psi | \\hat{H} | \\psi \\rangle}{\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle} \\]\n\nGiven that both the numerator and the denominator are real, \\( a \\) must be real.\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are always real.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
