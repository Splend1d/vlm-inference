                    "text": "So John is trying to figure out how much he makes per hour for handing out flyers at a concert. His friend told him he'd earn $49 for 3.5 hours of work. To find his hourly rate, we can use the equation 3.5x = 49, where x is the hourly rate in dollars.\n\nFirst, I need to solve for x in the equation 3.5x = 49. To isolate x, I should divide both sides of the equation by 3.5. So, x = 49 \u00f7 3.5.\n\nNow, let's do the division. 49 divided by 3.5. I know that dividing by a decimal can be a bit tricky, so maybe I can make this easier by eliminating the decimal. I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to move the decimal point one place to the right.\n\nSo, 49 \u00f7 3.5 is the same as 490 \u00f7 35.\n\nNow, 35 times 14 is 490, because 35 \u00d7 14 = 490.\n\nTherefore, x = 14.\n\nSo, John's hourly rate is $14.00.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If he works 3.5 hours at $14 per hour, then 3.5 \u00d7 14 = 49, which matches the total amount he's supposed to earn.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. $14.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
