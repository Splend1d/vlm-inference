                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Trish's resting heart rate is 50 beats per minute. When she exercises, her heart rate increases by 5 beats per minute for every minute she exercises. We need to find out how long it will take for her heart rate to reach 120 beats per minute.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening here. She starts at 50 beats per minute, and for each minute she exercises, her heart rate goes up by 5 beats per minute. So, after 1 minute of exercise, her heart rate would be 50 + 5 = 55 beats per minute. After 2 minutes, it would be 50 + 10 = 60 beats per minute, and so on.\n\nWe can see a pattern here. For every minute of exercise, her heart rate increases by 5 beats per minute. So, if she exercises for m minutes, her heart rate would be 50 + 5m beats per minute.\n\nNow, we need to find out when her heart rate reaches 120 beats per minute. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n50 + 5m = 120\n\nOur goal is to solve for m, which represents the number of minutes she needs to exercise to reach a heart rate of 120 beats per minute.\n\nLet's solve this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract 50 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with m:\n\n50 + 5m - 50 = 120 - 50\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5m = 70\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5 to solve for m:\n\n5m / 5 = 70 / 5\n\nSo, m = 14\n\nTherefore, it will take Trish 14 minutes of exercise to reach a heart rate of 120 beats per minute.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5 minutes\n\nB. 14 minutes\n\nC. 34 minutes\n\nD. 70 minutes\n\nThe correct answer is B. 14 minutes.\n\nTo double-check, let's plug m = 14 back into the equation:\n\n50 + 5(14) = 50 + 70 = 120\n\nYes, that matches the target heart rate.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it in terms of how much the heart rate needs to increase. Starting at 50 beats per minute, to reach 120, the increase needed is 120 - 50 = 70 beats per minute. Since her heart rate increases by 5 beats per minute for each minute of exercise, the time required would be 70 / 5 = 14 minutes. Again, this confirms that the answer is 14 minutes.\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. 14 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
