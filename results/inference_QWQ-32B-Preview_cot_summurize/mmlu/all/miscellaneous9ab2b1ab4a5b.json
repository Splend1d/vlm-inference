I need to find out how many gallons are needed to fill the tank. And I have to choose the most appropriate method to solve this from multiplication, subtraction, estimation, or division.\n\nAlright, let's think about this. The tank's total capacity is 15 gallons, and it's currently holding 7 gallons. To find out how much more I need to add to make it full, I should probably find the difference between the full capacity and the current amount.\n\nSo, that sounds like subtraction to me. I subtract the current amount from the total capacity: 15 gallons minus 7 gallons should give me the amount needed to fill the tank.\n\nLet me write that down: 15 - 7 = 8 gallons.\n\nWait, but let's see if another method makes sense. Multiplication: why would I multiply here? There's no indication that I need to scale something up or find an area or anything like that. So multiplication seems unnecessary.\n\nEstimation: well, I could estimate the amount needed, but since I have exact numbers, estimation isn't the most precise way. It's better to get the exact amount.\n\nDivision: division is used when I need to split something into equal parts or find a rate. Here, I'm just trying to find the difference between two quantities.\n\nSo, subtraction seems to be the most appropriate method here. It directly gives me the exact amount needed to fill the tank.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to look at this. Suppose the tank is 15 gallons full, and it's currently at 7 gallons. What percentage is it full? Well, that might be interesting, but the question is simply asking for the gallons needed to fill it up, not the percentage.\n\nAlternatively, if I was adding gasoline in certain increments, maybe multiplication would come into play, but again, the problem is straightforward: find the difference between the current amount and the full capacity.\n\nSo, I think subtraction is the way to go. It's direct and precise for this situation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
