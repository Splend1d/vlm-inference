                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a wrongful death claim against a hospital. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, there's a patient in the hospital being treated for an illness. The doctor prescribes a mild anesthetic drug to be given intravenously to reduce pain. The prescribed dose is 18.5 milligrams in a saline solution. A nurse arranges for a pharmacy technician to prepare the solution and drug, and then the nurse administers it to the patient. But somehow, the solution given to the patient contains 185 milligrams of the drug, which is ten times more than prescribed. After receiving the drug, the patient has a heart attack and dies.\n\nThe doctor, nurse, and pharmacy technician are all employed by the hospital. Now, if the patient's family files a wrongful death claim against the hospital, what must they prove to recover damages?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The family must identify which specific employee\u2014doctor, nurse, or pharmacy technician\u2014was responsible for the mistake in the dosage.\n\nB. The family must prove the specific negligent act that resulted in the wrong dose being administered.\n\nC. The family must show that hospital administrators were negligent in hiring or supervising one or more of the employees involved.\n\nD. The family must prove that the patient would not have died if given the correct dose of 18.5 milligrams.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, in medical malpractice cases, including wrongful death claims against hospitals, the concept of vicarious liability often comes into play. Vicarious liability means that an employer can be held liable for the negligent acts of its employees committed within the scope of their employment.\n\nIn this case, since the doctor, nurse, and pharmacy technician are all employees of the hospital, the hospital could be held liable for their negligence without the family having to pinpoint exactly who made the mistake.\n\nSo, option A says the family must identify which employee was responsible. But based on vicarious liability, maybe they don't have to do that.\n\nOption B says they must prove the specific negligent act. That seems like it could be part of proving negligence, but I'm not sure if it's the must-prove element.\n\nOption C involves showing that administrators were negligent in hiring or supervising. That sounds more related to negligent hiring or supervision, which is different from the direct negligence of the employees.\n\nOption D is about proving that the patient wouldn't have died with the correct dose. That might be relevant to causation, but I'm not sure if that's the primary thing they need to prove.\n\nLet me recall what's typically required to prove medical malpractice or wrongful death due to medical negligence.\n\nGenerally, to establish a wrongful death claim based on medical negligence, the plaintiff must prove:\n\n1. A duty of care was owed by the healthcare provider to the patient.\n\n2. There was a breach of that duty of care.\n\n3. The breach directly caused the patient's death.\n\n4. Damages resulted from the death.\n\nIn this context, the hospital owes a duty of care to the patient through its employees. If any of its employees breached that duty by administering the wrong dose, and that breach caused the patient's death, then the hospital could be liable.\n\nBut the question is, what must the family prove to recover damages?\n\nOption A seems too specific. They don't necessarily need to identify who exactly made the mistake, as long as they can show that the hospital's employee did something negligent that caused harm.\n\nOption B is about proving the specific negligent act. That seems like it's part of establishing the breach of duty.\n\nOption C is about administrative negligence. That might be relevant in some cases, but it's not necessarily a must-prove element in all medical malpractice cases.\n\nOption D is about proving that the correct dose would have prevented the death. That relates to causation, ensuring that the death was indeed caused by the incorrect dose.\n\nBut in terms of what must be proven, it seems like the family needs to show that the hospital's employee was negligent in some way that led to the incorrect dose being administered, and that this negligence caused the patient's death.\n\nGiven that, option B seems plausible, but I'm still considering whether they must prove the specific negligent act.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about respondeat superior, which is another legal doctrine that makes employers liable for the actions of their employees performed within the scope of their employment.\n\nUnder respondeat superior, the hospital could be liable for the negligence of any of its employees involved in this incident, without the family having to specify who exactly was at fault.\n\nSo, perhaps the family doesn't need to identify the specific employee, which makes option A incorrect.\n\nOption C seems less relevant because it's about administrative negligence, which isn't directly related to the act of administering the wrong dose.\n\nOption D is about causation, which is important, but maybe not the primary element they must prove.\n\nMaybe the key is in understanding what's required to establish negligence against the hospital.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, for a wrongful death claim based on negligence, the plaintiff must prove:\n\n- The hospital had a duty of care to the patient.\n\n- The hospital breached that duty through the negligence of its employees.\n\n- The breach caused the patient's death.\n\n- Damages resulted from the death.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the family needs to prove that the hospital's employee was negligent in administering the wrong dose, which caused the patient's death.\n\nThey may not need to specify exactly who was negligent, as long as it was an employee acting within the scope of employment.\n\nSo, perhaps none of the options A, B, C, or D precisely capture what's necessarily required.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at it differently.\n\nOption A requires identifying which employee was responsible, which, as per respondeat superior, might not be necessary.\n\nOption B is about proving the specific negligent act, which seems like it's part of establishing the breach of duty.\n\nOption C is about administrative negligence, which is separate from the direct negligence of the employees involved.\n\nOption D is about proving that the correct dose would have prevented the death, which relates to causation.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is B, proving the specific negligent act, because to establish negligence, you need to show what specific act or omission by the hospital's employee caused the harm.\n\nBut, in practice, in medical malpractice cases, plaintiffs often don't need to specify exactly who was at fault, as long as it was an employee acting within their duties.\n\nWait, maybe the question is testing whether the family needs to prove which specific employee was negligent, or just that negligence occurred by any of the employees.\n\nGiven that, option A seems less likely to be correct, because under respondeat superior, the identity of the negligent employee might not be necessary.\n\nOption B, proving the specific negligent act, seems more aligned with what's required to establish negligence.\n\nOption C is about administrative negligence, which isn't directly related to the act of administering the wrong dose.\n\nOption D is about causation, which is important but may not be the primary element being tested here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the hospital's liability under respondeat superior, and the family doesn't need to prove which employee was at fault, but just that an employee's negligence caused the harm.\n\nIf that's the case, then option A would be incorrect, and option B might be the right answer.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure.\n\nLet me consider the concept of enterprise liability, where the plaintiff doesn't need to identify the specific tortfeasor within the enterprise, as long as it was one of the enterprise's agents.\n\nIn medical settings, especially with hospitals, enterprise liability might apply, meaning the family doesn't need to pinpoint who exactly made the mistake.\n\nIf that's the case, then option A would be incorrect, and the family wouldn't need to identify which employee was responsible.\n\nOption B, proving the specific negligent act, might still be required to establish that negligence occurred.\n\nBut perhaps in enterprise liability, the plaintiff need only show that a hospital employee's negligence caused the harm, without specifying who.\n\nGiven that, maybe the family doesn't need to prove the specific negligent act, just that negligence occurred by one of the employees.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me look up enterprise liability in hospitals.\n\nUpon checking, enterprise liability is a doctrine that allows plaintiffs to sue an entire enterprise without identifying the specific defendant who caused the harm, provided that the harm was caused by one member of the enterprise.\n\nIn the hospital context, this could mean that the family can hold the hospital liable without identifying which employee was negligent, as long as it was an employee acting within the scope of employment.\n\nGiven that, option A seems incorrect because the family doesn't need to identify who was responsible.\n\nOption C is about administrative negligence, which isn't directly related to the act of administering the wrong dose.\n\nOption D is about causation, which is important but may not be the primary element required.\n\nTherefore, perhaps option B is the correct answer, as the family needs to prove what specific negligent act led to the incorrect dose being administered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe none of the options are entirely correct, and the family needs to prove negligence on the part of the hospital through its employees, causing the patient's death.\n\nBut since I have to choose among the given options, I'll go with option B: the family must prove the specific negligent act that resulted in the wrong dose of the drug being administered.\n\nThis makes sense because, to establish negligence, you need to show what specific act or omission breached the standard of care, leading to the harm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
