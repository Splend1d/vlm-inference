                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Patients with which of the following diseases are treated with injections of vitamin B-12?\" And the options are A. Bell's palsy, B. Crohn's disease, C. Pernicious anemia, and D. Graves' disease. I need to figure out which one of these conditions is treated with vitamin B-12 injections.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what vitamin B-12 does in the body. I know that B-12 is important for nerve function and the production of red blood cells. It's also involved in the metabolism of every cell in the body. So, deficiencies in B-12 can lead to anemia, nerve damage, and other problems.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is Bell's palsy. I remember that Bell's palsy is a temporary weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. It's thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. I don't recall anything about B-12 treatments for Bell's palsy. I think treatments usually involve corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and sometimes antiviral drugs if it's suspected to be caused by a viral infection. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B is Crohn's disease. Crohn's is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. People with Crohn's may have malabsorption issues, which could lead to vitamin deficiencies, including B-12. However, I don't think that B-12 injections are a primary treatment for Crohn's disease itself. Maybe for the complications like anemia, but not directly for the disease. So, perhaps not B.\n\nOption C is pernicious anemia. I know that pernicious anemia is a type of anemia where the body can't absorb enough vitamin B-12 from the digestive tract. This is because patients lack intrinsic factor, which is necessary for B-12 absorption. So, people with pernicious anemia often require B-12 injections to bypass the absorption problem in the gut. This sounds like a strong candidate.\n\nOption D is Graves' disease. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that leads to hyperthyroidism, which is an overactive thyroid gland. I don't think B-12 injections are used to treat Graves' disease. Treatments for Graves' disease include antithyroid medications, beta-blockers, radioactive iodine, and sometimes surgery. So, probably not D.\n\nGiven this, it seems like pernicious anemia is the condition among the options that is treated with B-12 injections. But to be thorough, let me double-check.\n\nPernicious anemia specifically involves a deficiency in vitamin B-12 due to the inability to absorb it in the intestines. Since the body needs B-12 for red blood cell formation and nerve function, a deficiency can lead to anemia and neurological problems. Injections are a way to deliver B-12 directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the absorption issues in the gut.\n\nOn the other hand, while Crohn's disease can lead to B-12 deficiency due to malabsorption, the disease itself isn't treated with B-12 injections. Instead, if a patient with Crohn's has a B-12 deficiency, they might receive injections as a treatment for the deficiency, but it's not a primary treatment for Crohn's.\n\nSimilarly, Bell's palsy and Graves' disease aren't typically treated with B-12 injections.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Pernicious anemia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
