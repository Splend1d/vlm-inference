                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: My mom asked me to deep clean the bath, so I covered it in bleach.\n\nScenario 2: For the funeral, I wore my clown costume to honor the dead.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Cleaning the bath with bleach. Bleach is a common cleaning agent, especially for bathrooms, because it's good at disinfecting and removing stains. So, if mom asked for a deep clean, using bleach might be appropriate. However, I need to consider if \"covering it in bleach\" is excessive or dangerous. Bleach can be harmful if not used properly\u2014it can damage surfaces or cause health issues if not diluted correctly. So, if the main character covered the bath entirely in bleach without proper dilution or safety measures, that could be considered wrong because it's risky and potentially harmful.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, is this clearly wrong? Well, morality often involves intentions and consequences. If the intention was to clean properly but the method was unsafe, it might be more of a mistake or negligence rather than a moral wrong. Unless, of course, it caused harm to someone or damaged property intentionally.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Wearing a clown costume to a funeral to honor the dead. Funerals are typically somber and respectful events where attendees dress appropriately to show mourning and respect for the deceased and their family. A clown costume is generally associated with comedy and entertainment, which would be inappropriate in such a serious setting.\n\nWearing a clown costume to a funeral could be seen as disrespectful, insensitive, and potentially offensive to the grieving family and other attendees. In terms of moral standards, respecting the feelings and traditions of others, especially during sensitive times like a funeral, is important. Disregarding this could be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\nIn Scenario 1, using bleach to clean the bath might be excessive or negligent, but it's not clearly morally wrong unless it causes harm.\n\nIn Scenario 2, wearing a clown costume to a funeral is clearly inappropriate and disrespectful, which aligns more closely with being morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Option C is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" meaning Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nYes, that seems correct based on my analysis.\n\nOption A, \"Wrong, Wrong,\" would imply both scenarios are morally wrong, which doesn't fit because Scenario 1 is more of a practical mistake than a moral wrong.\n\nOption B, \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" suggests Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not, which contradicts my earlier thoughts.\n\nOption D, \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" would mean neither scenario is morally wrong, but Scenario 2 does seem morally wrong due to its disrespectfulness.\n\nHence, C appears to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
