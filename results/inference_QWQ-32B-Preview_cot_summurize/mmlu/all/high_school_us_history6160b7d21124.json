                    "text": "I'm looking at this poem by Phillis Wheatley and trying to figure out which continuity in U.S. history her sentiments most directly reflect. The options are debates over religious freedom, social justice, immigration, or freedom of expression.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the poem. It's called \"On Being Brought from Africa to America,\" and it was published in 1773. So, it's from the colonial period, before the United States was even a country.\n\nLet's look at the first part: \"'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land, Taught my benighted soul to understand That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too; Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.\" Here, Wheatley is saying that being brought from Africa to America was an act of mercy because it introduced her to Christianity. She's expressing gratitude for being exposed to a religion that she sees as saving her soul.\n\nThen, in the second part, she addresses people who look down on black people: \"Some view our sable race with scornful eye, \"Their colour is a diabolic die.\" Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain, May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.\" She's reminding Christians that even though some people see black people as inherently evil because of their skin color, they can still be saved and ascend to heaven.\n\nSo, the poem is about her experience being brought to America, her conversion to Christianity, and a defense against racial prejudice.\n\nNow, thinking about the options:\n\nA. Debates over religious freedom: While the poem does talk about religion and being taught about God and a Savior, it's not really about the freedom to practice religion. It's more about the impact of religion on her life and how it relates to her race.\n\nB. Debates over social justice: This seems promising. The poem addresses racial prejudice and the idea that black people can be saved and are equal in the eyes of God. Social justice often involves fighting against discrimination and promoting equality, which aligns with Wheatley's message here.\n\nC. Debates over immigration: Although she was brought from Africa to America, which could be considered a form of immigration, the poem doesn't focus on the issues typically associated with immigration debates, like citizenship, labor, or cultural integration. It's more about her personal experience and the racial attitudes she encounters.\n\nD. Debates over freedom of expression: While Wheatley is expressing her thoughts and feelings in this poem, the main focus isn't on the freedom to express herself. It's on the content of her message, which is about religion and race.\n\nSo, considering these points, it seems that the sentiments in Wheatley's poem most directly reflect debates over social justice, specifically regarding racial equality and the treatment of black people in society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
