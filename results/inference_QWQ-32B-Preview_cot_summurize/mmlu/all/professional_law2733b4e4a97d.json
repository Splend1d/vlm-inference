Two years of experimental use prior to commercial marketing had demonstrated that the machine laundered clothes more cleanly, more rapidly, and at a lower cost than any previous model. After nine months of commercial sales on a nationwide basis, the manufacturer discovered that an electrical unit in the machine tended to overheat greatly when the machine was heavily loaded or used continuously for more than one hour. The manufacturer promptly notified all dealers that it was recalling machines still in dealers' stock for corrective adjustment. It also provided all dealers with forms of notice to previous purchasers, warning the purchasers of the hazard, urging the purchasers to arrange with the dealers to pick up the machines, with full reimbursement to the purchasers (at the manufacturer's expense); and advising the purchasers who wished to use the machines pending pickup by the dealer to do so only with a clothes load of not more than one-half the machine's capacity and for no longer than three-quarters of an hour. A purchaser of a washing machine, having been notified, arranged on Thursday to have a dealer pick up her machine on the following Monday. Over the weekend, the purchaser was visited by her married daughter and two grandchildren, aged 5 and 3. On Saturday, the purchaser left the house to go shopping. She forgot to warn her daughter about the washing machine. The daughter undertook to do a heavy load of accumulated laundry, including children's clothing and bedding. She loaded the machine fully and repeatedly for an hour and a quarter. Leaving the laundry room with the children in it, she retired for a brief nap. The machine overheated; its paint caught fire, and the fire spread to the window curtains . The children were felled by the smoke. Awakened by the smell of smoke, the daughter rushed down to the laundry, screaming for help. A neighbor rushed into the house after phoning the fire station. Together they entered the laundry room and lifted and carried out the children. The daughter and the neighbor both suffered injuries from the fire and smoke in rescuing the children. Firemen soon arrived and extinguished the fire. If the daughter asserts a claim based on strict liability against the manufacturer for damages, the probable result is that the manufacturer will\n\nA. win, because the daughter was not the purchaser of the washing machine.\nB. win, because the manufacturer issued warnings to dealers and purchasers regarding the defect.\nC. lose, because the manufacturer negligently designed the washing machine.\nD. lose, because the washing machine was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this problem. It seems like a case about product liability, specifically strict liability. Let me try to understand what happened.\n\nSo, there's a manufacturer that made a new washing machine. It was advanced and better than previous models. But after selling it for nine months, they found out that a part of the machine tends to overheat if it's heavily loaded or used continuously for more than an hour. That sounds dangerous.\n\nThe manufacturer acted quickly. They recalled the machines still in dealers' stock and provided dealers with notices to give to previous purchasers. The notice warned about the hazard and told purchasers to arrange for the dealer to pick up the machine for a corrective adjustment, and they'd be fully reimbursed. Also, if people wanted to keep using the machine before it was picked up, they should only use it with half the load and for no more than 45 minutes.\n\nNow, there's a purchaser who got one of these machines. She was notified about the recall and arranged for the dealer to pick it up on Monday. But over the weekend, her married daughter and two grandchildren came to visit, ages 5 and 3. The purchaser went shopping and forgot to warn her daughter about the washing machine. The daughter decided to do a heavy load of laundry, loaded the machine fully and used it for an hour and a quarter.\n\nWhile she was doing that, she left the laundry room with the children in it and took a nap. The machine overheated, caught fire, and the fire spread to the window curtains. The children were overcome by smoke. The daughter was awakened by the smell, rushed to the laundry room, screamed for help. A neighbor called the fire station and helped rescue the children. Both the daughter and the neighbor were injured in the rescue. The fire was eventually extinguished.\n\nNow, the daughter is asserting a claim based on strict liability against the manufacturer for damages. We need to predict the probable result. The options are:\n\nA. The manufacturer wins because the daughter was not the purchaser of the washing machine.\n\nB. The manufacturer wins because they issued warnings to dealers and purchasers regarding the defect.\n\nC. The manufacturer loses because they negligently designed the washing machine.\n\nD. The manufacturer loses because the washing machine was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what is strict liability in the context of product liability? Strict liability means that the manufacturer is responsible for any damages caused by a defective product, even if they were not negligent in making or selling the product. The focus is on the product's defect and whether it's unreasonably dangerous.\n\nIn this case, the washing machine had a defect\u2014it tended to overheat when heavily loaded or used continuously for more than an hour. That seems like a defect in design or manufacturing that makes the product unreasonably dangerous.\n\nNow, the manufacturer did take steps to address this issue. They recalled the machines still in stock and provided warnings to dealers and purchasers. They instructed purchasers to limit the load and usage time until the machine could be fixed.\n\nBut despite these warnings, an accident still happened. The purchaser arranged for the machine to be picked up but forgot to warn her daughter about the hazard. The daughter used the machine as she normally would, unaware of the defect and the precautions she should have taken.\n\nSo, the question is, does the manufacturer still bear responsibility under strict liability even though they issued warnings?\n\nI need to recall some principles of product liability law. One key concept is that a product can be unreasonably dangerous due to a defect in design, manufacturing, or inadequate warnings.\n\nIn this case, it seems like there was a design defect that led to overheating under certain conditions. The manufacturer recognized this and tried to mitigate the risk by providing warnings and arranging for repairs.\n\nBut strict liability often holds manufacturers strictly responsible for defects that make their products unreasonably dangerous, even if they took steps to warn about the defect.\n\nHowever, there might be limitations or defenses in certain jurisdictions. For example, if the user was contributorily negligent, that might affect the outcome. But in strict liability, contributory negligence is not typically a defense.\n\nWait, in strict products liability, the focus is on the product's defect, not on the user's conduct. So, even if the daughter should have known about the warning or should have been more careful, that might not exonerate the manufacturer.\n\nBut in this scenario, the purchaser arranged for the machine to be picked up and was supposed to follow the warnings, but failed to communicate them to her daughter. That complicates things.\n\nLet me consider option A: The manufacturer wins because the daughter was not the purchaser of the washing machine.\n\nIn products liability, the purchaser is not necessarily the only one who can sue. Anyone who was injured by the defective product can potentially bring a claim, including family members or guests who were using the product with permission.\n\nSo, I don't think that the daughter not being the purchaser would bar her claim. Therefore, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: The manufacturer wins because they issued warnings to dealers and purchasers regarding the defect.\n\nAs I thought earlier, in strict liability, warnings might not be enough to relieve the manufacturer of liability if the product is still unreasonably dangerous. The manufacturer has to make the product safe, and warnings might not always suffice.\n\nMoreover, in this case, the warning was not communicated to the daughter, who was the one using the machine. So, even if the purchaser received the warning, it didn't reach the actual user.\n\nTherefore, I doubt that the warnings would be sufficient to defeat the claim.\n\nOption C: The manufacturer loses because they negligently designed the washing machine.\n\nThis option introduces negligence, but the question is about strict liability, not negligence. Strict liability doesn't require proof of negligence; it's about the defect making the product unreasonably dangerous.\n\nSo, while the manufacturer might have been negligent, that's not the basis of the daughter's claim here.\n\nOption D: The manufacturer loses because the washing machine was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\n\nThis seems to align with the principles of strict liability. If the product is defective and unreasonably dangerous, the manufacturer is liable for damages caused by it, regardless of their diligence in addressing the issue.\n\nIn this case, the washing machine had a defect that led to overheating and fire, which are clearly unreasonably dangerous outcomes.\n\nMoreover, even though the manufacturer tried to issue warnings and arrange for repairs, the defect was still present at the time of the accident.\n\nTherefore, it seems likely that the manufacturer would lose on this basis.\n\nBut let's consider another angle. Perhaps the manufacturer could argue that they acted reasonably by recalling the machines and providing warnings, and that the purchaser failed to follow those warnings by not informing her daughter.\n\nHowever, in strict liability, the manufacturer's liability isn't excused by taking steps to warn or repair, if the product is still defective and causes harm.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the warning didn't reach the actual user might not relieve the manufacturer, especially if the product should have been safe in the first place.\n\nTherefore, I think the most probable result is that the manufacturer loses because the washing machine was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
