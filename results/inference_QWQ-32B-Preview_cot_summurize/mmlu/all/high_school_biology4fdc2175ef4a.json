                    "text": "Sickle-cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin, which is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. It's caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which provides instructions for making hemoglobin.\n\nNow, when we talk about carriers of sickle-cell disease, we mean that they have one normal copy of the HBB gene and one mutated copy. This condition is known as sickle-cell trait. People with sickle-cell trait usually don't have symptoms of the disease but can pass the mutated gene to their children.\n\nIn this scenario, both the man and the woman are carriers, meaning each has one normal gene and one mutated gene for sickle-cell. When they have a child, there are four possible combinations of genes that the child can inherit:\n\n1. Normal gene from the mother and normal gene from the father.\n\n2. Normal gene from the mother and mutated gene from the father.\n\n3. Mutated gene from the mother and normal gene from the father.\n\n4. Mutated gene from both the mother and the father.\n\nEach of these combinations has an equal probability of occurring, which is 25%.\n\nNow, let's see what each combination means for the child:\n\n1. If the child inherits the normal gene from both parents, they will not have sickle-cell disease and will not be a carrier.\n\n2. If the child inherits the normal gene from one parent and the mutated gene from the other, they will be a carrier like their parents but will not have the disease.\n\n3. If the child inherits the mutated gene from both parents, they will have sickle-cell disease.\n\nSo, out of the four possible combinations, only one results in the child having sickle-cell disease. Therefore, the chance is 25%.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. The question is about the chance that the child will inherit sickle-cell disease, not just being a carrier.\n\nCarriers have one mutated gene and don't have the disease, whereas having two mutated genes leads to the disease.\n\nSo, indeed, only when the child inherits the mutated gene from both parents will they have the disease, which is one out of four possibilities, or 25%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the Punnett square for this inheritance.\n\nIf we denote the normal gene as \"A\" and the mutated gene as \"a,\" then both parents are \"Aa.\"\n\nWhen they have a child, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- AA (normal)\n\n- Aa (carrier)\n\n- Aa (carrier)\n\n- aa (sickle-cell disease)\n\nSo, there's a 25% chance of AA, 50% chance of Aa, and 25% chance of aa.\n\nOnly the aa genotype corresponds to having sickle-cell disease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 25%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions that both are \"carriers of sickle-cell disease,\" and we're to find the chance that the child will \"inherit sickle-cell disease.\"\n\nI think the answer is D. 25%.\n\nHowever, sometimes there might be confusion about the terms, but in genetics, being a carrier means having one copy of the mutated gene without having the disease, and having the disease means having two copies of the mutated gene.\n\nSo, to confirm, sickle-cell disease is recessive, meaning it only manifests when there are two mutated genes.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
