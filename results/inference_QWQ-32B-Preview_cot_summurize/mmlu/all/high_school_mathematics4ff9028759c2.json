                    "text": "So I have this question: \"How many positive and negative integers is 12 a multiple of?\" and the options are A. 1, B. 4, C. 12, D. 3. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for 12 to be a multiple of an integer. If 12 is a multiple of an integer, say \\( n \\), that means there exists some integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 12 = n \\times k \\). In other words, \\( n \\) divides 12 evenly.\n\nSo, the question is essentially asking for the number of integers \\( n \\) (both positive and negative) that divide 12 without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet me start by finding all the positive divisors of 12. To do that, I can list all the positive integers that divide 12.\n\n1. 1 divides 12 because 12 \u00f7 1 = 12.\n2. 2 divides 12 because 12 \u00f7 2 = 6.\n3. 3 divides 12 because 12 \u00f7 3 = 4.\n4. 4 divides 12 because 12 \u00f7 4 = 3.\n5. 6 divides 12 because 12 \u00f7 6 = 2.\n6. 12 divides 12 because 12 \u00f7 12 = 1.\n\nSo, the positive divisors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. That's 6 positive integers.\n\nNow, since the question asks for both positive and negative integers, I need to consider the negative counterparts of these divisors as well. For every positive divisor, there is a corresponding negative divisor.\n\nSo, the negative divisors of 12 would be: -1, -2, -3, -4, -6, and -12. That's another 6 integers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of integers (both positive and negative) that divide 12 is 6 (positive) + 6 (negative) = 12.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Is there any integer that divides 12 besides these 12 ones? For example, 0? But 0 cannot be a divisor because division by zero is undefined. So, 0 is not a divisor of any integer.\n\nAlso, fractions or non-integer numbers are not considered because we're only dealing with integers.\n\nSo, the total should indeed be 12.\n\nBut looking back at the options, C. 12 is one of them. However, let's see if there's any other way to interpret the question that might lead to a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of distinct divisors, regardless of sign. In that case, it would be just the positive divisors, which are 6. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the number of positive divisors and the number of negative divisors separately, but that doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering only positive multiples, but again, that doesn't align with the question.\n\nWait, the question says: \"How many positive and negative integers is 12 a multiple of?\".\n\nSo, rephrasing: how many integers \\( n \\) (positive and negative) are there such that 12 is a multiple of \\( n \\), i.e., \\( n \\) divides 12.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct.\n\nLet me list all possible divisors again:\n\nPositive: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nNegative: -1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -12\n\nTotal: 12 integers.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 12.\n\nBut why are there other options like A. 1, B. 4, D. 3? Maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of distinct prime divisors of 12, or something similar.\n\nWait, no. The question clearly states \"how many positive and negative integers is 12 a multiple of?\", which directly translates to the number of divisors, both positive and negative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the phrase \"is 12 a multiple of\". Maybe it's being confused with \"how many multiples of 12 are there that are positive and negative integers\", but that would be all integers, since any integer is a multiple of 12 in the sense that 12 times some fraction can equal it, but that's not standard.\n\nNo, I think the standard interpretation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the positive divisors, and the \"and\" is just a conjunction without implying both positive and negative.\n\nBut the question explicitly says \"positive and negative integers\", so it's clear that both signs are to be considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the concept of multiples and divisors.\n\nLet me recall:\n\n- A multiple of an integer \\( n \\) is any integer that can be expressed as \\( n \\times k \\), where \\( k \\) is also an integer.\n\n- A divisor of an integer \\( m \\) is any integer \\( n \\) such that \\( m \\) is a multiple of \\( n \\), i.e., \\( m = n \\times k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nSo, if 12 is a multiple of \\( n \\), then \\( n \\) is a divisor of 12.\n\nTherefore, the question is asking for the number of integers \\( n \\) (positive and negative) that divide 12.\n\nAs previously determined, there are 12 such integers.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 12.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider if 12 has any other divisors beyond the ones listed.\n\nLooking at the positive divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nIs there any other positive integer that divides 12? For example, 5? 12 \u00f7 5 = 2.4, which is not an integer, so 5 is not a divisor.\n\nSimilarly, 7, 8, 9, etc., none of these divide 12 evenly.\n\nSimilarly, for negative integers, the divisors are just the negatives of the positive divisors.\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only proper divisors, but that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question and 12 is only a multiple of 1 and itself, but that would be incorrect, as clearly 2, 3, 4, and 6 also divide 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is miswritten, and it should be asking about factors instead of multiples, but in reality, divisors and factors are synonymous in this context.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is C. 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
