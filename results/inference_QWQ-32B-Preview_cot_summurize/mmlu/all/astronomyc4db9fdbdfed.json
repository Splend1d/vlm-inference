                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about the Moon's surface rocks being older than Earth's surface rocks. And I need to pick the best evidence from these options.\n\nOption A says that lunar rocks are composed of fragments pulverized by many impacts. Hmm, that does sound like the Moon has been battered by a lot of meteorites and such, which probably created a lot of rock fragments. But does that necessarily mean they're older? Maybe not directly.\n\nOption B is about radioactive dating of lunar samples showing they're older. That seems pretty straightforward. Radioactive dating is a reliable method to determine the age of rocks, so if lunar samples are dated to be older, that would be strong evidence.\n\nOption C claims that the Moon's surface is more heavily eroded than Earth's surface. Now, erosion on the Moon is different from erosion on Earth because the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere or water to cause weathering. Erosion on the Moon is mainly due to micrometeorite impacts and solar wind. So, while the Moon might be more eroded in terms of the number of impact craters, does that directly relate to the age of the rocks? Maybe not necessarily.\n\nOption D says that the Moon's surface has more impact craters than Earth's surface. That is true; the Moon has a lot more craters because it lacks the geological activity and weathering processes that Earth has, which can erase craters over time. So, the presence of more craters suggests that the Moon's surface is older, but is that the best evidence?\n\nComparing these options, I think option B is the strongest. Radioactive dating directly measures the age of the rocks, whereas the other options involve indirect evidence that relates to the history and processing of the rocks but doesn't directly measure their age.\n\nWait a minute, but option D is also a pretty solid piece of evidence. The number of craters is used as a dating method in planetary science, especially for surfaces that haven't been resurfaced or altered much over time. So, if the Moon has more craters, it suggests it's been exposed to impacts for a longer period, meaning its surface is older.\n\nHowever, radioactive dating is a more direct method of determining age, whereas crater counting is a relative dating method. So, perhaps radioactive dating is more precise and therefore better evidence.\n\nBut then again, maybe both are important and support each other. The radioactive dating gives absolute ages, while the crater densities provide relative ages that can be calibrated with the absolute dates.\n\nPerhaps the question is looking for the best single piece of evidence, and in that case, radioactive dating would be the most definitive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to test understanding of the differences between Earth and the Moon in terms of geological processes. Earth has plate tectonics, volcanism, and weathering that constantly recycle the crust and erase old features, whereas the Moon doesn't have these active processes to the same extent, so its surface features, including rocks, are much older.\n\nIn that case, option D might be seen as a good indicator of the overall age of the surface, but again, radioactive dating is more direct.\n\nI think I'll go with option B, that radioactive dating of lunar samples shows they are older. This is because it provides direct measurements of the rocks' ages, whereas the other options offer indirect evidence or comparisons that support the idea but don't directly measure age.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
