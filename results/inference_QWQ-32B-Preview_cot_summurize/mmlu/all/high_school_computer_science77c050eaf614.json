Scenario 1: Cars line up in a single lane at a car wash. As each driver reaches the entrance of the car wash, the driver gets out of the car. An automatic pulley moves the car through the car wash as the driver walks to the exit of the car wash to pay and pick up the car. Scenario 2: Contestants auditioning for a reality television talent show are assigned a unique numeric ID upon completing a registration form. Scenario 3: Tennis balls are sold in a cylindrical can that can hold a maximum of 3 balls, where each ball except the bottom one rests on top of the ball below it. The 3 balls are placed in the can one at a time through one opening at the top of the can. The 3 balls are removed from the can one at a time through the same opening. Which of the following shows the data structures that best model the scenarios? Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3\n\nA. Dictionary/map | Queue | Stack\nB. Dictionary/map | Stack | Queue\nC.

I need to figure out which data structure best models each scenario.\n\n**Scenario 1:** Cars line up in a single lane at a car wash. Each driver gets out, and the car is automatically moved through the car wash while the driver walks to the exit to pay and pick up the car.\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, cars are lining up in a single lane. That sounds like a queue because queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The first car to arrive is the first one to be processed and leave. So, for Scenario 1, a queue seems like the best fit.\n\n**Scenario 2:** Contestants auditioning for a reality television talent show are assigned a unique numeric ID upon completing a registration form.\n\nHere, contestants are being assigned unique IDs. This sounds like we need to store some kind of mapping from ID to contestant information, or perhaps just keep track of the IDs issued. A dictionary or map is perfect for this because it allows us to associate keys (in this case, IDs) with values (contestant data), and access them efficiently.\n\n**Scenario 3:** Tennis balls are sold in a cylindrical can that can hold a maximum of 3 balls, where each ball except the bottom one rests on top of the ball below it. The 3 balls are placed in the can one at a time through one opening at the top of the can. The 3 balls are removed from the can one at a time through the same opening.\n\nThis scenario describes a can where balls are added and removed from the same opening at the top. This is characteristic of a stack, which follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The last ball added is the first one to be removed.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Scenario 1: Queue\n\n- Scenario 2: Dictionary/Map\n\n- Scenario 3: Stack\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Dictionary/map | Queue | Stack\n\nB. Dictionary/map | Stack | Queue\n\nC. Queue | Dictionary/map | Stack\n\nD. Stack | Queue | Dictionary/map\n\nThe correct choice seems to be C. Queue | Dictionary/map | Stack.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. In Scenario 2, it's about assigning unique IDs to contestants. Is a dictionary/map the best choice here? Yes, because we can use the ID as a key and store the contestant's information as the value. This allows for quick lookups and management of contestant data.\n\nScenario 1 is clearly a queue since it's a line where the first car to arrive is the first to be served.\n\nScenario 3 is a stack because it's Last-In-First-Out; balls are added and removed from the same top opening.\n\nSo, yes, option C seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
