                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Abby drives 18 miles round trip each day between home and work. The problem says that this daily round trip is rounded to the nearest 5 miles, and we need to estimate the total miles she drives in 5 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"rounded to the nearest 5 miles\" means. Basically, we take the actual mileage, which is 18 miles, and round it to the closest multiple of 5. So, the multiples of 5 around 18 are 15 and 20. Which one is closer to 18?\n\nWell, 18 minus 15 is 3 miles, and 20 minus 18 is 2 miles. So, 20 is closer to 18 than 15 is. Therefore, 18 miles rounded to the nearest 5 miles is 20 miles.\n\nNow, that's the mileage for one day. The problem asks for the total mileage over 5 days. So, if she drives about 20 miles each day, then over 5 days it would be 20 miles/day times 5 days.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 20 times 5 is 100 miles.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 75 miles\n\nB. 100 miles\n\nC. 125 miles\n\nD. 180 miles\n\nSo, 100 miles is option B.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, rounding 18 miles to the nearest 5 miles:\n\n- The multiples of 5 around 18 are 15 and 20.\n\n- 18 is closer to 20 than to 15 because 18 - 15 = 3 and 20 - 18 = 2.\n\n- So, 18 miles rounded to the nearest 5 miles is indeed 20 miles.\n\nThen, for 5 days: 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's another way to interpret the rounding or the total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to round after calculating the total miles over 5 days.\n\nLet's explore that approach.\n\nFirst, calculate the total actual miles over 5 days: 18 miles/day * 5 days = 90 miles.\n\nThen, round 90 miles to the nearest 5 miles.\n\nWhat's the nearest 5 miles to 90? Well, 90 is already a multiple of 5, so it remains 90.\n\nBut 90 miles isn't one of the options. The options are 75, 100, 125, and 180.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, if we round each day's mileage to the nearest 5 miles and then sum, we get 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.\n\nIf we sum the actual mileages first and then round, we get 90 miles, which isn't an option.\n\nBut looking back at the problem, it says \"the daily round trip is rounded to the nearest 5 miles,\" which suggests that we round each day's mileage before summing.\n\nTherefore, the first approach is correct: round each day's mileage to 20 miles and then multiply by 5 to get 100 miles.\n\nSo, the best estimate is 100 miles, which is option B.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way to estimate. Perhaps considering the possible variation in rounding.\n\nFor example, if we round 18 miles to 20 miles, that's an overestimation by 2 miles per day.\n\nOver 5 days, that would be an overestimation of 10 miles.\n\nThe actual total mileage is 18 * 5 = 90 miles.\n\nSo, rounding to 20 miles/day gives us 100 miles, which is 10 miles more than the actual.\n\nIs there a way to get a more accurate estimate while still rounding?\n\nMaybe, but the problem specifically says to round the daily trip to the nearest 5 miles and then estimate the total.\n\nSo, following those instructions, 100 miles is the correct estimate.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to consider rounding down, to 15 miles, but according to the rounding rules, 18 is closer to 20 than to 15, so rounding down wouldn't be accurate.\n\nBut just for curiosity, if we rounded down to 15 miles/day, the total would be 15 * 5 = 75 miles, which is option A, but that's not the correct rounding.\n\nOr, if we chose 20 miles/day, which is option B, that makes sense.\n\nOption C is 125 miles, which would be like 25 miles/day, but 18 is closer to 20 than to 25.\n\nOption D is 180 miles, which would be 36 miles/day, which is way higher than the actual 18 miles.\n\nSo, clearly, option B is the best choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 100 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
