On a busy day, three of his partners had clients waiting to see them, and all of the chairs in the office waiting room were filled. A woman had an appointment with the attorney, and the attorney came out to greet her in the crowded waiting room. As the woman saw the attorney she said, \"Am I glad to see you! I need a will made up right away, because I don't want my rotten son to get any of my money. He will just throw it away at the race track. \" The attorney replied, \"Let's go back to my office to discuss this matter. \" The attorney prepared a will for the woman.\nB. A woman arrived at a law office for an appointment and was escorted to her attorney's office. She sat down and said to the attorney, \"You know, I pay you a large retainer every year for your valued counsel. I need some advice now. There was a fire in my house yesterday. It was minor, but I'm covered for $15,000 under my fire insurance policy. I didn't have any furniture in the room where the fire took place, but I want to put in a claim for a sofa and love seat. How should I go about it?\" The attorney refused to give her any advice.\nC. A woman engaged an attorney to represent her in adoption proceedings. During the course of his representation, she told the attorney some very personal facts about her lifestyle that the attorney needed in order to prepare a petition for adoption. The adoption took place, but the woman never paid her agreed fee to the attorney. The attorney sued the woman to collect his fee.\nD. A woman consulted an attorney regarding a sale of 70% of the stock of a closely held corporation in which the woman was the majority shareholder. She explained the reason for the sale and divulged the financial condition of the corporation and its prospects for the future. The attorney determined that the transaction would be complicated. Since he felt he was inexperienced in handling such a transaction, the attorney decided to decline to represent the woman. The woman nevertheless sold her stock with the assistance of another attorney.\n"

Privileged communications are those where a person can keep their conversations confidential, especially when seeking legal advice. Let's look at each situation one by one.\n\n**Scenario A:**\n\n- An attorney is in a crowded waiting room and a woman approaches him, saying she needs a will because she doesn't want her son to get her money.\n\n- The attorney responds by suggesting they go to his office to discuss it further.\n\n- Later, the attorney prepares a will for her.\n\nSo, here, the woman is seeking legal advice from the attorney in a public place, but they plan to move to a private setting to discuss it properly. Since they intended to have a private consultation, and the attorney did prepare a will for her, it's likely that their communication is privileged. The key is that they intended to have a confidential discussion, which they did in the attorney's office.\n\n**Scenario B:**\n\n- A woman goes to her attorney's office and tells him she wants to make a false insurance claim.\n\n- The attorney refuses to give her any advice.\n\nIn this case, the woman is seeking advice on committing fraud, which is illegal. Communications involving the commission of a crime or fraud are not privileged. So, even if they were in a private setting, the communication about planning a fraudulent act isn't protected by attorney-client privilege.\n\n**Scenario C:**\n\n- A woman hires an attorney for adoption proceedings and shares personal information needed for the petition.\n\n- The adoption goes through, but she doesn't pay the attorney, who then sues her.\n\nHere, the woman shared personal information with the attorney in the context of seeking legal representation for an adoption. This is a classic example of attorney-client privilege because she was seeking legal advice and the information was shared in confidence for that purpose. Even though she didn't pay, the privilege still applies to the communications related to the legal services provided.\n\n**Scenario D:**\n\n- A woman consults an attorney about selling stock in her corporation.\n\n- She shares financial information and the attorney decides not to take the case.\n\n- She sells the stock with another attorney's help.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman was seeking legal advice from the first attorney, and she shared confidential information about her corporation. Even though the attorney decided not to represent her, the communications made during the consultation are still privileged. The fact that she eventually used another attorney doesn't negate the privilege for the initial communications.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **A:** Privileged, as they intended to have a confidential discussion, which they did in the attorney's office.\n\n- **B:** Not privileged, because it involves planning a criminal or fraudulent act.\n\n- **C:** Privileged, as it's standard attorney-client communication for legal services provided.\n\n- **D:** Privileged, even though the attorney didn't take the case, the initial communications are protected.\n\nSo, the situations where communications are privileged are A, C, and D. Scenario B is not privileged due to the nature of the advice sought.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A, C, D} \\]"
