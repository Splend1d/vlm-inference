                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about DNA base composition. So, the base composition of DNA can vary between different species, but there are some ratios that stay the same across all species. We need to figure out which one of these options is expected to remain constant.\n\nFirst, let's recall the basic components of DNA. DNA is made up of four types of nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). These bases pair up in a specific way: Adenine pairs with Thymine, and Cytosine pairs with Guanine.\n\nNow, there's something called Chargaff's rules, which are really important in understanding DNA base composition. Chargaff observed that in DNA, the amount of Adenine is equal to Thymine, and the amount of Cytosine is equal to Guanine. So, A = T and C = G. This is true for double-stranded DNA.\n\nMoreover, the total number of purines (which are A and G) equals the total number of pyrimidines (which are C and T). So, A + G = C + T.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Cytosine : Adenine\n\nAccording to Chargaff's rules, C equals G, and A equals T, but there's no direct relationship that says C should be equal to A. In fact, their amounts can vary between species. So, this ratio isn't expected to remain constant.\n\nB. Pyrimidine : Purine\n\nPyrimidines are C and T, and purines are A and G. Since A + G = C + T, the total number of pyrimidines equals the total number of purines. So, the ratio of pyrimidines to purines should be 1:1. This seems like a strong candidate for a constant ratio.\n\nC. Adenine : Guanine\n\nChargaff's rules tell us that A equals T and C equals G, but they don't specify any direct relationship between A and G. So, this ratio can vary between species.\n\nD. Guanine : Deoxyribose\n\nDeoxyribose is part of the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA, and it's present in equal amounts to the total number of bases. So, the ratio of Guanine to Deoxyribose would depend on the total number of Guanine bases compared to the total number of bases, which can vary between species.\n\nWait a minute, option D mentions Deoxyribose, which is not a base but a sugar. Maybe there's a typo, and it should be Guanine : Ribose, but DNA doesn't contain ribose; it contains deoxyribose. Anyway, I think it's safe to consider that this ratio isn't constant across species.\n\nSo, between the options given, option B, Pyrimidine : Purine, seems to be the one that should remain constant, based on Chargaff's rules.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about it again. In double-stranded DNA, A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. So, the amount of A equals T, and C equals G. Therefore, A + C equals G + T. But wait, that would mean A + C equals G + T, but that doesn't necessarily mean that pyrimidines equal purines, because pyrimidines are C and T, and purines are A and G.\n\nWait, hold on. Let's recast this.\n\nGiven that A = T and C = G, then A + C = T + G.\n\nBut pyrimidines are C and T, and purines are A and G.\n\nSo, pyrimidines = C + T, and purines = A + G.\n\nBut since A = T and C = G, then A + C = T + G.\n\nWait, that seems a bit circular. Maybe I need to approach it differently.\n\nLet's consider that in double-stranded DNA, each strand has a certain composition, but the two strands are complementary.\n\nSo, if one strand has a certain sequence, the other strand has the complementary sequence.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of A in both strands equals the total amount of T, and the total amount of C equals the total amount of G.\n\nTherefore, in the entire double-stranded DNA molecule, the number of A's equals the number of T's, and the number of C's equals the number of G's.\n\nNow, pyrimidines are C and T, and purines are A and G.\n\nSo, pyrimidines = C + T, and purines = A + G.\n\nBut since A = T and C = G, then pyrimidines = C + T = G + A = purines.\n\nTherefore, pyrimidines equal purines in double-stranded DNA.\n\nHence, the ratio of pyrimidines to purines should be 1:1.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any exception or special case where this might not hold true.\n\nIn some single-stranded DNAs, this might not hold, but the question is about DNA in general, and Chargaff's rules apply to double-stranded DNA.\n\nMoreover, in certain viral DNAs or special cases, base compositions might differ, but assuming we're talking about typical double-stranded DNA found in most organisms, Chargaff's rules should hold.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options again.\n\nOption A: Cytosine : Adenine.\n\nAs we saw, C doesn't necessarily equal A; they can vary between species. So, this ratio isn't constant.\n\nOption C: Adenine : Guanine.\n\nAgain, no direct relationship between A and G other than A = T and C = G. So, this ratio can vary.\n\nOption D: Guanine : Deoxyribose.\n\nDeoxyribose is part of the sugar-phosphate backbone, and its amount is equal to the number of bases. So, the ratio of Guanine to total deoxyribose would depend on the Guanine content, which varies between species.\n\nTherefore, none of the other options are expected to remain constant.\n\nIn conclusion, the Pyrimidine : Purine ratio should remain constant in DNA, specifically at 1:1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
