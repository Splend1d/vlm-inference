                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is ironing clothes while their children are playing outside. Generally, ironing clothes is a normal household chore, and supervising children playing outside is another responsibility. However, the way it's phrased suggests that the children are unsupervised while playing outside, since the parent is inside ironing. But in many communities, it's common for children to play outside unsupervised, especially if they're older and the area is safe. So, unless there are specific risks or the children are very young, this might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character's son is dressed as a serial killer with a fake kitchen knife on Christmas night, presumably going around the neighborhood. This could be problematic for several reasons. First, dressing up as a serial killer might be disturbing or frightening to others, especially children or sensitive individuals. Second, carrying a fake knife could be misinterpreted as a real threat, leading to panic or even violence. This could be considered reckless or negligent on the part of the parent for allowing such behavior.\n\nConsidering these points, I would say that Scenario 1 is not necessarily morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is likely morally wrong due to the potential for causing fear or harm to others.\n\nSo, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
