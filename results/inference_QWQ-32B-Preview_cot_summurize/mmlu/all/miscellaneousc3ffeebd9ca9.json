It's about a teacher working with small groups of beginning readers, helping them read texts that are new to them by teaching various reading strategies. I need to identify which reading approach this describes from the options given: direct instruction, literature circle, guided reading, or read-aloud.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each of these approaches.\n\n**Direct instruction** is a teacher-led approach where the teacher explicitly teaches specific skills or concepts. It's very structured and often involves modeling, practice, and feedback. However, it might not necessarily involve students reading texts on their own or in small groups.\n\n**Literature circle** is a approach where students discuss a piece of literature in small groups, often with different roles and responsibilities. It encourages student-led discussion and deeper understanding of the text. But in this scenario, the teacher is actively teaching reading strategies, which seems more guided.\n\n**Guided reading** is a instructional approach where the teacher works with small groups of students who have similar reading levels. The teacher selects texts that are appropriately challenging and provides support as students read, teaching them strategies to comprehend the text better. This sounds a lot like what's described in the question.\n\n**Read-aloud** is when the teacher reads a text aloud to the students, often with the aim of modeling fluent reading, introducing new vocabulary, or discussing the content. While it can include some instruction, it's primarily about the teacher reading and students listening and engaging with the content.\n\nGiven these descriptions, the scenario seems to align most closely with **guided reading**. The teacher is working with small, flexible groups of beginning readers, providing support as they read unfamiliar texts, and teaching them various reading strategies. This matches the definition of guided reading, where the teacher guides students through the reading process, helping them develop independence in reading.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Guided reading.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
