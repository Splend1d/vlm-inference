                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about beats in sound waves. It says that one sound source has a frequency of 500 Hz and another has 504 Hz. I need to find out what the beat frequency will be when these two sounds interfere with each other. The options are 2 Hz, 4 Hz, 8 Hz, and 16 Hz.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what beats are. Beats occur when two sound waves of slightly different frequencies interfere with each other over time. The result is an oscillation in the amplitude of the resulting sound, which we perceive as a fluctuation in volume. The beat frequency is the difference between the frequencies of the two original sound sources.\n\nSo, in this case, the frequencies are 500 Hz and 504 Hz. To find the beat frequency, I should just subtract the lower frequency from the higher one, right?\n\nLet me do that: 504 Hz - 500 Hz = 4 Hz.\n\nSo, the beat frequency should be 4 Hz. That corresponds to option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I understand this correctly. Is there any other factor I should consider? For example, could there be higher harmonics or something that affects the beat frequency? I don't think so, because beats are specifically due to the interference of two fundamental frequencies.\n\nAlso, I've heard that sometimes beat frequency can be related to the least common multiple or something like that, but I don't think that's applicable here. It's simply the difference between the two frequencies.\n\nLet me think about another example to confirm. Suppose I have two frequencies, say 100 Hz and 105 Hz. The beat frequency would be 5 Hz. That makes sense because the waves get in and out of phase every 1/5th of a second, causing the amplitude to fluctuate at that rate.\n\nSimilarly, in this problem, the frequencies are 500 Hz and 504 Hz, so the difference is 4 Hz, which should be the beat frequency.\n\nI think I'm on the right track. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe the beat frequency is related to the sum of the frequencies? No, that's not correct. The sum frequency would be a different phenomenon altogether, related to frequency mixing, which isn't what's being asked here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the average of the two frequencies, but that doesn't make sense for beats. Beats are specifically about the difference in frequencies.\n\nLet me check if there's any formula for beat frequency. Yes, the beat frequency is given by:\n\nf_beat = |f1 - f2|\n\nWhere f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the two sound sources.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nf_beat = |500 Hz - 504 Hz| = | -4 Hz | = 4 Hz\n\nSo, definitely, the beat frequency is 4 Hz.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, B is 4 Hz, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, the problem might be trying to trick me or test my understanding in some way. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider if the two sound sources are from different locations or if there's any phase difference that could affect the beat frequency. I don't think so; beat frequency is solely dependent on the difference in frequencies, regardless of phase or location.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the frequencies are steady or varying over time. The problem doesn't specify, so I'm assuming they're steady frequencies.\n\nAlso, I should remember that human hearing can perceive beat frequencies up to about 20 Hz or so. Below that, it's more of a rhythmic pulsing, and above that, it might start to be heard as a low pitch. But that's not relevant to the calculation here.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The straightforward approach gives me the answer of 4 Hz, and I've verified that through a formula and a similar example.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is B. 4 Hz.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
