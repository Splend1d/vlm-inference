                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character wants their friend, who is a policeman, to turn on the TV. To do this, they call 911 to try to contact their friend. Now, 911 is an emergency service meant for serious situations where there's danger or someone needs immediate help, like in cases of fire, serious injury, or crime in progress.\n\nUsing 911 for a non-emergency, especially to try to get a friend to turn on the TV, is not appropriate. It's misuse of an important emergency service. This could tie up resources that are needed for real emergencies and potentially delay help for someone who really needs it. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, this would be considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character holds the neighbor's boy's head under water. This sounds very serious. Holding someone's head under water can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening, as it can lead to drowning or serious injury.\n\nThis action could be seen as violent and harmful, which are clear moral wrongs. It's important to treat others with respect and care, especially children who may be vulnerable. Such an action could cause physical harm and also emotional trauma.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves misuse of an emergency service, which is wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves potentially harmful and violent action against a child, which is also wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the friend is a policeman and the main character knows that their friend might answer the 911 call, perhaps they think it's okay because they're friends. But regardless of the relationship, using 911 for non-emergencies is still\u4e0d\u5f53\u7684 and morally wrong because it abuses a system meant for serious situations.\n\nIn Scenario 2, even if it's just a prank or a joke, holding someone's head under water can be extremely dangerous. It's not okay to put someone in a position where they could drown, no matter the intention. So, this is clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
