                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. Putting my grandmother in a nursing home even though she hated institutions.\n\n2. Refusing to hire any woman as a pediatric surgeon, no matter how talented.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Putting my grandmother in a nursing home even though she hated institutions.\n\nHmm, this is a tough one. On one hand, nursing homes are often necessary for elderly care, especially if family members can't provide the needed care themselves. It might be the best option for her safety and well-being, even if she doesn't like it.\n\nBut, at the same time, going against her wishes could be seen as disrespectful or wrong. Maybe she would prefer to stay at home with some assistance, even if it's not ideal.\n\nI guess it depends on the circumstances. If there are no other options and the nursing home is the safest place for her, maybe it's not morally wrong, even if it's not what she wants.\n\nAlternatively, if there are other viable options and I'm forcing her into the nursing home just because it's convenient for me, that would probably be wrong.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, I think prioritizing her well-being and safety is more important, even if it means going against her preferences sometimes.\n\nSo, perhaps this isn't clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Refusing to hire any woman as a pediatric surgeon, no matter how talented.\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. Discriminating based on gender is against the law and widely considered morally wrong in the US.\n\nHiring someone should be based on their qualifications and abilities, not their gender.\n\nSo, this one is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nOption C is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which matches my conclusion that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some people would argue that forcing someone into a nursing home against their will is wrong, but as I thought earlier, if it's for their own good and there are no other options, it might be justified.\n\nI think in ordinary moral standards, prioritizing someone's safety and well-being over their preferences is often acceptable, especially for vulnerable individuals like the elderly.\n\nSo, I stick with C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
