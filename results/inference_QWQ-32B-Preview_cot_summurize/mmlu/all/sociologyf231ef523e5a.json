                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about over-urbanization. So, the term 'over-urbanization' is being defined in four different ways here, and I need to figure out which one is the most accurate. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"life in modern Western cities is so far removed from that of the Third World that we find it difficult to understand these societies.\" Hmm, this seems to be suggesting that because Western cities are so different, we can't grasp what's happening in less developed countries. While there might be some truth to that, I'm not sure if this captures the essence of over-urbanization. Over-urbanization, as I understand it, is more about the rapid movement of people to cities and the challenges that come with it, rather than a cultural or societal gap between West and East.\n\nOption B states: \"in poorer countries, the rapidly developing cities drain resources from the rural areas.\" This sounds more promising. Over-urbanization often refers to a situation where there's a massive influx of people into cities, which can lead to strain on resources, infrastructure, and job markets. If cities are growing too quickly, they might not have the capacity to support all the new residents, leading to issues like slums, poverty, and inequality. At the same time, as people leave rural areas, those areas might suffer from labor shortages and other problems. So, this option seems to be highlighting the drain of resources from rural to urban areas, which aligns with what I know about over-urbanization.\n\nOption C says: \"the extent to which urbanization affects development has been exaggerated.\" This seems to be questioning the impact of urbanization on development, suggesting that perhaps urbanization isn't as crucial or detrimental as some make it out to be. But over-urbanization typically implies that urbanization is happening at an unsustainable rate, so I don't think this captures the concept accurately.\n\nOption D: \"governments are so preoccupied with urbanization in the West that they forget to attend to problems in the Third World.\" This seems to be making a point about governmental focus and perhaps neglect of certain regions. While that might be a valid observation in some cases, it doesn't directly define or explain the concept of over-urbanization.\n\nComparing all these options, option B seems to be the most directly related to the concept of over-urbanization. It mentions the rapid development of cities in poorer countries and the draining of resources from rural areas, which are key aspects of over-urbanization.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that over-urbanization is often discussed in the context of developing countries where urban populations are growing rapidly, often due to migration from rural areas in search of better opportunities. However, these cities may not have the necessary infrastructure, jobs, or services to support this influx, leading to various social and economic challenges.\n\nMoreover, as people move to cities, rural areas can be left with fewer workers, which might impact agriculture and other rural economies. This can create a cycle where rural areas become even poorer, prompting more people to move to cities, further straining urban resources.\n\nTherefore, the idea that cities are draining resources from rural areas seems central to the concept of over-urbanization.\n\nOption A, while it might be true that Western and Third World cities differ significantly, this doesn't define over-urbanization. It's more about the relationship between urban and rural areas within a country.\n\nOption C questions the impact of urbanization on development, but over-urbanization specifically refers to excessive or rapid urbanization, which can have negative consequences.\n\nOption D seems to be making a point about governmental priorities, but again, it doesn't define or explain over-urbanization.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that option B is the correct definition of over-urbanization: \"in poorer countries, the rapidly developing cities drain resources from the rural areas.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
