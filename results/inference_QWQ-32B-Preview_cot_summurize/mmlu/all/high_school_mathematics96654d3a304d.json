                    "text": "So I need to compute \"85 choose 82,\" which is a combination, right? I remember that combinations are used to find out how many ways you can choose a certain number of items from a larger set without regard to the order. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, n is 85 and k is 82. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{85}{82} = \\frac{85!}{82! \\cdot (85 - 82)!} = \\frac{85!}{82! \\cdot 3!}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculating factorials of large numbers like 85! can be really tedious and time-consuming, especially without a calculator. There must be a simpler way to compute this.\n\nI recall that factorials have a lot of terms in common, which can cancel out in the numerator and denominator. Let's see if I can simplify this expression before plugging in the numbers.\n\nLooking at the factorials:\n\n85! is 85 \u00d7 84 \u00d7 83 \u00d7 82 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1\n\n82! is 82 \u00d7 81 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1\n\nSo, in the expression \\(\\frac{85!}{82!}\\), the 82! in the denominator cancels out with the 82! in the numerator, leaving us with:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{85!}{82!} = 85 \u00d7 84 \u00d7 83\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{85}{82} = \\frac{85 \u00d7 84 \u00d7 83}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNow, 3! is 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which is 6. So, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{85}{82} = \\frac{85 \u00d7 84 \u00d7 83}{6}\n\\]\n\nAlright, now I just need to calculate 85 \u00d7 84 \u00d7 83 and then divide by 6.\n\nFirst, let's multiply 85 and 84.\n\n85 \u00d7 84:\n\nI can break this down: 80 \u00d7 84 is 6720, and 5 \u00d7 84 is 420. So, 6720 + 420 = 7140.\n\nNow, multiply 7140 by 83.\n\nTo make this easier, I can think of 83 as 80 + 3.\n\nSo, 7140 \u00d7 80 is 571,200.\n\nAnd 7140 \u00d7 3 is 21,420.\n\nAdding those together: 571,200 + 21,420 = 592,620.\n\nNow, divide 592,620 by 6.\n\n592,620 \u00f7 6:\n\n6 goes into 59 nine times (54), subtract to get 5, bring down 2 to make it 52.\n\n6 goes into 52 eight times (48), subtract to get 4, bring down 6 to make it 46.\n\n6 goes into 46 seven times (42), subtract to get 4, bring down 2 to make it 42.\n\n6 goes into 42 seven times exactly.\n\nSo, 592,620 \u00f7 6 = 98,770.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\binom{85}{82} = 98,770\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 252\n\nB. 4680\n\nC. 98770\n\nD. 101170\n\nIt seems that option C is 98,770, which matches my calculation.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm a bit unsure because the other options are much smaller numbers. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, I simplified \\(\\binom{85}{82}\\) to \\(\\frac{85 \u00d7 84 \u00d7 83}{6}\\), which seems correct.\n\nThen, 85 \u00d7 84:\n\n80 \u00d7 84 = 6720\n\n5 \u00d7 84 = 420\n\nTotal: 6720 + 420 = 7140. That seems right.\n\nThen, 7140 \u00d7 83:\n\n7140 \u00d7 80 = 571,200\n\n7140 \u00d7 3 = 21,420\n\nTotal: 571,200 + 21,420 = 592,620. That also seems correct.\n\nNow, dividing 592,620 by 6:\n\n592,620 \u00f7 6 = 98,770. That appears to be accurate.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is indeed 98,770, which is option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I recall that combinations have a property where \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n - k}\\). So, \\(\\binom{85}{82} = \\binom{85}{3}\\).\n\nLet me verify this by calculating \\(\\binom{85}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{85}{3} = \\frac{85!}{3!(85 - 3)!} = \\frac{85!}{3! \\cdot 82!}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the 82! cancels out, leaving:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{85}{3} = \\frac{85 \u00d7 84 \u00d7 83}{3!} = \\frac{85 \u00d7 84 \u00d7 83}{6}\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same expression I had before. So, this confirms that \\(\\binom{85}{82} = \\binom{85}{3}\\), and both equal 98,770.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 98770.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{98770} \\]"
