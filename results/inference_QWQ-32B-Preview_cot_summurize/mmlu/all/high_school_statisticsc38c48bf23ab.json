This law allows us to calculate the total probability of an event by considering all possible scenarios that lead to that event.\n\nLet's define the events:\n\n- \\( A \\): There is an accident on Highway 48 today.\n\n- \\( W \\): The weather is wet today.\n\n- \\( D \\): The weather is dry today.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- \\( P(A|D) = 0.002 \\) (since 0.2% is equal to 0.002).\n\n- \\( P(A|W) = 0.01 \\) (since 1.0% is equal to 0.01).\n\n- \\( P(W) = 0.2 \\) (20% chance of wet weather).\n\n- \\( P(D) = 1 - P(W) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 \\) (since the weather is either wet or dry).\n\nWe need to find \\( P(A) \\), the total probability of an accident today.\n\nAccording to the law of total probability:\n\n\\[\nP(A) = P(A|D) \\cdot P(D) + P(A|W) \\cdot P(W)\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[\nP(A) = (0.002 \\times 0.8) + (0.01 \\times 0.2)\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\[\n0.002 \\times 0.8 = 0.0016\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.01 \\times 0.2 = 0.002\n\\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[\nP(A) = 0.0016 + 0.002 = 0.0036\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that there will be an accident on Highway 48 today is 0.0036.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.0004\n\nB. 0.0016\n\nC. 0.002\n\nD. 0.0036\n\nThe correct answer is D. 0.0036.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.0036} \\]"
