The options are:\n\nA. the level of the spinal cord at which the injury occurred\n\nB. whether the spinal cord was partially or completely severed\n\nC. the man's age\n\nD. both A and B\n\nSo, I need to think about how spinal cord injuries impact sexual function, specifically erections.\n\nFirst, I know that the spinal cord is crucial for sending signals between the brain and the rest of the body. When there's an injury to the spinal cord, these signals can be disrupted, which can affect various bodily functions, including sexual function.\n\nOption A mentions the level of the spinal cord where the injury occurred. I think this is important because different levels of the spinal cord control different parts of the body. For example, injuries at higher levels, like the cervical region, might have more widespread effects compared to injuries lower down, like the lumbar region.\n\nOption B talks about whether the spinal cord was partially or completely severed. This seems relevant too because a complete severance would likely cause more profound and permanent damage compared to a partial injury, where some nerve fibers might still be intact and able to transmit signals.\n\nOption C is about the man's age. While age can affect sexual function in general, I'm not sure if it directly relates to the specific impact of a spinal cord injury on erections. Maybe it plays a role, but I suspect that the level and completeness of the injury are more directly relevant.\n\nOption D combines A and B, suggesting that both the level of the injury and the completeness of the severance are important factors.\n\nLet me consider some research or medical knowledge I might have on this topic. I recall that erections involve both neurological and vascular components. The nervous system sends signals that trigger blood flow to the penis, leading to an erection.\n\nIn the case of spinal cord injury, if the pathways that carry these signals are damaged, it could impair the ability to achieve an erection. The severity of this impairment would likely depend on the specific nerves that are affected, which in turn depends on the level and completeness of the injury.\n\nFor instance, injuries above the sacral spinal cord, which is involved in controlling genital functions, might have a more significant impact on erectile function compared to injuries lower down.\n\nAlso, if the spinal cord is completely severed, there might be no signal transmission beyond the level of injury, leading to more severe sexual dysfunction. In contrast, if the injury is partial, some signals might still get through, potentially allowing for some sexual function.\n\nAge could be a factor in general sexual health, but I think in the context of spinal cord injury, the level and completeness of the injury are more directly determinative.\n\nGiven this, I think the correct answer is D: both A and B. The level of the spinal cord injury and whether the cord was partially or completely severed both play crucial roles in determining a man's ability to have erections after such an injury.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
