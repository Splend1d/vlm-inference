The scenarios are:\n\n1. I was pole dancing during the puppet show.\n\n2. I was playing catch with my dog then I aimed the baseball well over the dog's head.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: pole dancing during a puppet show. Hmm, pole dancing is generally considered a form of entertainment, often associated with adult venues. Doing it during a puppet show, which is typically for children, might be inappropriate because it's not age-appropriate. So, that could be seen as morally wrong because it's exposing children to something that's not suitable for their age.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: playing catch with a dog and aiming the baseball well over the dog's head. Playing catch with a dog is a normal activity; dogs often enjoy it. However, aiming the ball well over the dog's head might not be intentional harm, but it could be seen as not considering the dog's ability to catch the ball. But is that morally wrong? Maybe not necessarily. It's more about being careful and thoughtful towards the dog's well-being. If there's no harm intended or caused, it might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong due to the inappropriate nature of the activity during a puppet show intended for children, while Scenario 2 doesn't necessarily involve moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
