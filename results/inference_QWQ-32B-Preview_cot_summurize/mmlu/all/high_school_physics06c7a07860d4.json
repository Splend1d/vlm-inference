                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a proton moving through a magnetic field. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nWe have a proton traveling at an initial speed of 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 meters per second, and it enters a region with a constant magnetic field of 1.0 Tesla. The initial velocity vector of the proton makes a 30-degree angle with the direction of the magnetic field. The question wants to know the proton's speed 4 seconds after it enters the magnetic field.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how magnetic fields affect moving charges. I know that a magnetic field applies a force on a moving charge, but the force is perpendicular to both the velocity of the charge and the magnetic field. This means that the magnetic force doesn't change the speed of the charge, only the direction of its velocity.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think about this again. The magnetic force is given by F = qv \u00d7 B, where q is the charge, v is the velocity, and B is the magnetic field. The cross product means that the force is perpendicular to both v and B.\n\nSince the force is always perpendicular to the velocity, it doesn't do any work on the proton. Work is force dot product displacement, and since the force is perpendicular to the velocity, the work done is zero. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the proton shouldn't change, which means its speed should remain constant.\n\nBut the problem says to compute the speed after 4 seconds, and the options include different speeds. Is there something I'm missing here?\n\nLet me consider the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field. If the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the particle moves in a circular path. If the velocity has a component parallel to the magnetic field, that component isn't affected, and the particle follows a helical path.\n\nIn this case, the velocity makes a 30-degree angle with the magnetic field. So, we can split the velocity into two components: one parallel to B and one perpendicular to B.\n\nThe component parallel to B should not be affected by the magnetic field, while the component perpendicular to B will cause the proton to move in a circular path.\n\nSo, the total velocity will be a combination of the constant parallel velocity and the circular motion in the perpendicular plane.\n\nBut the speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector, which should remain constant because neither component is changing in magnitude over time.\n\nWait, but maybe there's some acceleration or something. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe magnetic force is F = qv\u22a5B, where v\u22a5 is the component of velocity perpendicular to B.\n\nThis force causes the proton to move in a circular path in the plane perpendicular to B.\n\nThe component of velocity parallel to B remains unchanged.\n\nSo, the speed should remain the same because only the direction of the velocity is changing, not its magnitude.\n\nBut the options suggest different speeds. Maybe there's something about the angle that affects the speed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider relativistic effects, but the speeds here are 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s, which is only about 0.5% of the speed of light, so relativistic effects should be negligible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the options, or perhaps the question is testing whether I understand that the speed remains constant in a magnetic field.\n\nLet me check the formula for the force again. F = qv \u00d7 B, and since F is perpendicular to v, it doesn't change the speed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a time-dependent effect I'm not considering.\n\nWait, maybe the proton is also experiencing some other force, like an electric field, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the magnetic field is changing, but again, the problem says it's a constant magnetic field.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the equations of motion.\n\nThe acceleration due to the magnetic field is a = F/m = (qv \u00d7 B)/m.\n\nSince a is perpendicular to v, the speed doesn't change.\n\nTherefore, the speed should remain 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\nBut that's option C, and the other options are different speeds.\n\nIs it possible that the speed changes over time in a magnetic field? I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's decay or something, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me into thinking that the speed changes, but it doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the cyclotron frequency or something, but that wouldn't affect the speed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the proton is losing energy through radiation, like synchrotron radiation, but that's typically negligible for proton energies at this level.\n\nMoreover, the time given is 4 seconds, but in a constant magnetic field, the motion is periodic, and the speed remains constant.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is that the speed remains 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any component that could change the speed.\n\nIf there were an electric field, that could accelerate the proton and change its speed, but there isn't one mentioned.\n\nIf the magnetic field were changing, that could induce an electric field, but the problem says it's a constant magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any mechanism by which the speed would change.\n\nHence, the speed after 4 seconds should still be 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
