                    "text": "So, the government of country Z is planning to increase its spending by $12 million and at the same time, raise tax collections by the same amount. I need to figure out what the overall impact of these moves will be on the real GDP of country Z. The options are:\n\nA. Real GDP will increase by $6 million.\n\nB. Real GDP will decrease by $6 million.\n\nC. Real GDP will remain unchanged.\n\nD. Real GDP will increase by $12 million.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what government spending and taxes do to the economy. Government spending directly increases aggregate demand because the government is purchasing goods and services or providing transfer payments, which puts money into the economy. On the other hand, taxes reduce disposable income for households and businesses, which can decrease consumption and savings.\n\nSo, if the government increases spending by $12 million, that should boost GDP by that amount, right? But at the same time, by raising taxes by $12 million, it's taking that same amount of money out of the economy. So, do these two actions cancel each other out?\n\nWait, maybe it's not that straightforward. There might be some multiplier effects involved here. In macroeconomics, government spending has a multiplier effect on GDP because the initial spending leads to more income, which leads to more consumption, and so on. Similarly, taxes have a multiplier effect but in the opposite direction because higher taxes reduce disposable income, leading to lower consumption and a chain reaction of reduced economic activity.\n\nSo, the overall impact on GDP would depend on the size of these multipliers.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the government spending multiplier and the tax multiplier.\n\nThe government spending multiplier is typically given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Government Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - MPC} \\]\n\nWhere MPC is the marginal propensity to consume, which is the fraction of additional income that is spent on consumption.\n\nThe tax multiplier is usually:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Multiplier} = \\frac{-MPC}{1 - MPC} \\]\n\nSo, the overall effect on GDP would be:\n\n\\[ \\Delta GDP = (\\text{Government Spending Multiplier} \\times \\Delta G) + (\\text{Tax Multiplier} \\times \\Delta T) \\]\n\nGiven that both \u0394G and \u0394T are $12 million, and assuming MPC is less than 1, let's see what this would look like.\n\nFirst, let's assume an MPC of, say, 0.8, just for illustration.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ \\text{Government Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.8} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Multiplier} = \\frac{-0.8}{1 - 0.8} = \\frac{-0.8}{0.2} = -4 \\]\n\nSo, the change in GDP would be:\n\n\\[ \\Delta GDP = (5 \\times 12) + (-4 \\times 12) = 60 - 48 = 12 \\]\n\nWait, that gives $12 million increase in GDP, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut let's try with a different MPC to see if it's always $12 million.\n\nSuppose MPC is 0.5.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ \\text{Government Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Multiplier} = \\frac{-0.5}{0.5} = -1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta GDP = (2 \\times 12) + (-1 \\times 12) = 24 - 12 = 12 \\]\n\nAgain, $12 million increase.\n\nWait, that's interesting. No matter what the MPC is, as long as the government spending and tax changes are equal, the net change in GDP is equal to the amount of spending increase.\n\nLet me generalize this.\n\nLet MPC be c, where 0 < c < 1.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ \\text{Government Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - c} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Multiplier} = \\frac{-c}{1 - c} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta GDP = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - c} \\right) \\times \\Delta G + \\left( \\frac{-c}{1 - c} \\right) \\times \\Delta T \\]\n\nGiven that \u0394G = \u0394T = 12 million,\n\n\\[ \\Delta GDP = \\frac{\\Delta G - c \\times \\Delta T}{1 - c} \\]\n\nBut since \u0394G = \u0394T,\n\n\\[ \\Delta GDP = \\frac{12 - c \\times 12}{1 - c} = \\frac{12(1 - c)}{1 - c} = 12 \\]\n\nSo, indeed, the change in GDP is $12 million, regardless of the MPC.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. There must be something wrong with this logic.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\n\\[ \\Delta GDP = \\frac{12 - 12c}{1 - c} = \\frac{12(1 - c)}{1 - c} = 12 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, no matter the value of c (as long as it's between 0 and 1), the net change in GDP is $12 million.\n\nBut is this making sense economically?\n\nWell, if the government spends an additional $12 million and taxes increase by $12 million, it's like the government is injecting $12 million into the economy through spending, but sucking out $12 million through taxes. However, because of the multiplier effects, the net effect is still $12 million increase in GDP.\n\nWait, but in reality, wouldn't the increase in taxes offset the increase in spending?\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the government spends $12 million more, which directly increases GDP by $12 million. But at the same time, by taxing $12 million more, it reduces private sector spending by $12 million. However, the multiplier effect comes into play because the initial government spending has a multiplier, and the tax increase has its own multiplier.\n\nBut according to the math above, no matter what the MPC is, as long as \u0394G = \u0394T, the net change in GDP is equal to \u0394G.\n\nThis seems counterintuitive. Maybe there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nLet me look up the combined effect of government spending and taxes on GDP.\n\nUpon reviewing some macroeconomics resources, I find that the balanced budget multiplier is relevant here. The balanced budget multiplier refers to the change in GDP when government spending and taxes are changed by the same amount.\n\nThe balanced budget multiplier is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Balanced Budget Multiplier} = \\text{Government Spending Multiplier} + \\text{Tax Multiplier} \\]\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n\\[ \\text{Government Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - c} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Multiplier} = \\frac{-c}{1 - c} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Balanced Budget Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - c} + \\left( \\frac{-c}{1 - c} \\right) = \\frac{1 - c}{1 - c} = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the balanced budget multiplier is 1.\n\nThis means that when government spending and taxes are increased by the same amount, the net change in GDP is equal to the amount of the spending increase.\n\nSo, in this case, \u0394G = \u0394T = $12 million, and the balanced budget multiplier is 1, so \u0394GDP = 1 * $12 million = $12 million.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it might be option A, $6 million. Maybe I was mistaken.\n\nLooking back, with MPC = 0.8, multipliers were 5 and -4, so net change is 5*12 + (-4)*12 = 60 - 48 = 12.\n\nWith MPC = 0.5, multipliers were 2 and -1, so net change is 2*12 + (-1)*12 = 24 - 12 = 12.\n\nAnd generally, as shown, it's always $12 million.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Real GDP will increase by $12 million.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this.\n\nFor example, if the economy is at full capacity, increased government spending might not lead to increased output but rather to inflation. However, the question mentions real GDP, which would not increase if only inflation is rising.\n\nBut assuming the economy has some spare capacity, the increase in government spending would lead to an increase in real GDP.\n\nAlso, if the tax increase reduces private sector spending more than the government spending increases overall demand, perhaps the net effect could be less than $12 million.\n\nBut according to the standard multiplier analysis, that's not the case; the net effect should be exactly $12 million, given the balanced budget multiplier of 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Real GDP will increase by $12 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
