So, when you have lamps connected in parallel in a circuit, that means they're all connected to the same power source, and each lamp has its own path for current to flow through. Right?\n\nNow, the question is asking what happens to the current in the power source as more lamps are connected in parallel.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a parallel circuit, the total resistance decreases as more branches are added. That makes sense because there are more paths for the current to flow, so it's easier for the current to move through the circuit.\n\nOhm's Law says that current is equal to voltage divided by resistance (I = V/R). So, if the voltage stays the same and the resistance decreases, that means the current should increase.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently. Each lamp draws a certain amount of current from the power source. If I add more lamps in parallel, each one is drawing its own current, so the total current from the power source should be the sum of the currents from each lamp.\n\nSo, if I have one lamp, it draws a certain current. If I add another lamp in parallel, now both are drawing current independently, so the total current should be higher.\n\nTherefore, as more lamps are connected in parallel, the total current from the power source increases.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where adding more parallel lamps wouldn't increase the current?\n\nWell, if the power source has a current limit, maybe it can't supply more current beyond a certain point. But the question doesn't mention anything about the power source's limitations, so I think we can assume it can handle the increased load.\n\nAlso, if the lamps have internal resistances that change when connected in parallel, but again, the question seems straightforward.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is A. increases.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nB. decreases. That doesn't make sense because adding more parallel paths should decrease resistance, which would increase current.\n\nC. remains much the same. That seems unlikely because, as I thought earlier, adding more parallel lamps should increase the total current.\n\nD. Need more information. Well, unless there are specific constraints on the power source or the lamps, I think we can determine the answer based on general circuit principles.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is A. increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
