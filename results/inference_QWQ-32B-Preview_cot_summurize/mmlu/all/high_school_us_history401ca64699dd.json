The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Frederick Douglass's views and how they relate to Chief Justice Roger Taney's opinion in the Dred Scott case. So, first things first, Frederick Douglass was a prominent abolitionist, and in 1857, he expressed his thoughts on the organized support for slavery in the United States. He pointed out that not only were state governments and churches in slaveholding states aligned with slavery, but even the federal government, including its military and judicial branches, was committed to upholding and expanding slavery.\n\nNow, the Dred Scott v. Sandford case was a landmark Supreme Court decision that same year, 1857, where Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote the majority opinion. This case is significant because it had a huge impact on the debate over slavery in the United States, leading up to the Civil War.\n\nSo, the question is asking which statement by Chief Justice Taney aligns with Frederick Douglass's observation about the extensive support for slavery in the U.S. institutions.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Separate but equal facilities for people of different races was constitutional.\n\nActually, the \"separate but equal\" doctrine is most famously associated with the Plessy v. Ferguson case in 1896, not Dred Scott. So, this seems off.\n\nB. Corporations were entitled to the same protections guaranteed to individuals under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nWait, the Fourteenth Amendment wasn't even ratified until after the Civil War, in 1868. Dred Scott was in 1857, so this can't be it.\n\nC. School prayer violated the principle of \"separation of church and state.\"\n\nHmm, school prayer and the separation of church and state\u2014these issues aren't directly related to the Dred Scott decision, which was about slavery and the rights of slaves and former slaves.\n\nD. Congress had no right to regulate slavery in United States territories.\n\nAh, this seems more plausible. In the Dred Scott decision, Chief Justice Taney did indeed rule that Congress did not have the authority to ban slavery in the territories. This would align with Frederick Douglass's assertion that even the federal government was committed to supporting and expanding slavery.\n\nLet me double-check. Frederick Douglass was criticizing the extensive institutional support for slavery, including the federal government's commitment to propagating human bondage. The Dred Scott decision was a prime example of the federal judiciary upholding and expanding slavery by declaring that slaves were not citizens and had no right to sue in federal court, and that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer. Chief Justice Taney's statement that Congress had no right to regulate slavery in U.S. territories directly supports Douglass's view that the federal government was pledged to support and propagate slavery.\n\nJust to make sure, let's briefly recall what the Dred Scott decision entailed. Dred Scott was a slave who had lived with his owner in free territories, and when his owner died, he sued for his freedom, arguing that his time in free soil had made him a free man. The Supreme Court, led by Taney, ruled against him, stating that as a slave, he was not a citizen and therefore had no right to sue in federal court. Moreover, the Court declared that Congress had no power to ban slavery in the territories, which was a direct challenge to the anti-slavery platform of the emerging Republican Party.\n\nThis decision enraged abolitionists and further escalated tensions between the North and the South, bringing the nation closer to civil war.\n\nSo, in summary, Frederick Douglass's observation about the institutional support for slavery, including the federal government's commitment to propagating slavery, is directly reflected in Chief Justice Taney's opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford, particularly in his assertion that Congress had no right to regulate slavery in U.S. territories.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
