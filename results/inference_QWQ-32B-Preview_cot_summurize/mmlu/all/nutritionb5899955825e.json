This is because deuterium is a stable isotope of hydrogen that can be safely administered to humans, and its concentration in body water can be measured accurately. By administering a known amount of deuterium and then measuring its concentration in a subsequent urine or blood sample, the total body water can be calculated using various mathematical models.\n\nWhile carbon-13, nitrogen-15, and oxygen-18 are also stable isotopes used in various biological measurements, they are not typically used for measuring total body water. For example, carbon-13 is often used in studies of carbon metabolism, nitrogen-15 in protein metabolism studies, and oxygen-18 in studies of water turnover and energy expenditure. However, deuterium is the preferred isotope for assessing total body water due to its safety, ease of administration, and the accuracy of measurement techniques available for it."
