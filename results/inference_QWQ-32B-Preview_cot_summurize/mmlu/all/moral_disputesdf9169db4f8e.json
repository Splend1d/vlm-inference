According to the question, Baxter believes that the primary step is to clearly recognize that our goal isn't pure air or water, but something else. The options provided are:\n\nA. some optimal state of pollution.\n\nB. an overall maximally clean environment.\n\nC. some maximal state of pollution.\n\nD. the preservation of all living species.\n\nFirst, I need to interpret what Baxter is saying. He seems to be arguing that pursuing pure air or water isn't the main objective in addressing environmental issues. Instead, there's a different aim that should be prioritized.\n\nOption A suggests \"some optimal state of pollution.\" This implies that there's a balance or a certain level of pollution that is acceptable or even necessary. This could make sense in contexts where complete purity isn't achievable or where certain levels of pollution are inevitable due to human activities.\n\nOption B proposes \"an overall maximally clean environment.\" This sounds similar to pursuing pure air and water, which Baxter is saying isn't the primary objective. So, this might not align with his view.\n\nOption C is \"some maximal state of pollution,\" which suggests allowing the highest possible pollution levels. This seems counterintuitive for environmental protection and probably isn't what Baxter is advocating.\n\nOption D is \"the preservation of all living species.\" While important, this option seems broad and not directly related to the issue of purity in air and water.\n\nGiven Baxter's statement that the objective isn't pure air or water, but rather something else, option A seems the most fitting. It suggests that there's a need to find a balance or an optimal level of pollution, rather than aiming for complete purity.\n\nMoreover, in environmental economics and policy, there's often a discussion about the marginal benefits and costs of pollution reduction. At some point, the cost of achieving extremely pure air and water might outweigh the benefits. Therefore, an optimal state of pollution could be where the marginal cost of reducing pollution equals the marginal benefit.\n\nAdditionally, in some cases, certain levels of pollution might be necessary for economic activities that are crucial for society. For example, industries that contribute significantly to employment and GDP might produce pollution as a byproduct. Finding an optimal balance between environmental quality and economic needs is a common goal in environmental policy.\n\nTherefore, I believe that Baxter is suggesting that the primary step is to recognize that our objective is to achieve some optimal state of pollution, not necessarily pure air or water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
