                    "text": "I'm going to take a shot at this question. It's about language development in children, I think. Let's see the options:\n\nA. Babbling - I remember that's when babies make repetitive sounds like \"ba ba ba\" or \"da da da.\" It's like they're practicing making sounds, but it doesn't have any specific meaning.\n\nB. Cooing - That's even earlier, right? Like when babies make soft, vowel-like sounds, maybe around 2 months old. It's more like they're making pleasant noises, but not really words or even babbling.\n\nC. Holophrases - Hmm, I think this is when a child uses a single word to express a whole idea or thought. For example, saying \"cookie\" might mean \"I want a cookie\" or \"Look, a cookie!\" So, it's a whole phrase condensed into one word.\n\nD. Telegraphic speech - This sounds like when kids start putting words together, maybe two or three words at a time, but without all the grammatical parts. Like saying \"want cookie\" instead of \"I want a cookie.\" It's sort of like telegrams, where people used to pay by the word, so they made messages really short and left out small words.\n\nNow, the question is about \"Get cookie.\" Which one does that fit into?\n\nWell, \"Get cookie\" is more than one word, so it's not a holophrase, which is a single word with a whole meaning. Babbling is just repetitive sounds, not actual words, so that doesn't fit. Cooing is those early vowel sounds, not words either. So, that leaves telegraphic speech.\n\nTelegraphic speech is when kids use minimal words to convey a message, kind of like how telegrams were concise to save money. So, \"Get cookie\" is like saying \"I want to get a cookie\" but without all the extra words. It's straightforward, just the key words.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. Telegraphic speech.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. Holophrases are single words with whole meanings, so \"cookie\" might be a holophrase if the child says it to mean \"I want a cookie,\" but \"Get cookie\" is two words, so it's beyond that stage.\n\nBabbling is more like random sound repetition, and cooing is those early vowel sounds. Neither of those involves actual words.\n\nTherefore, \"Get cookie\" is an example of telegraphic speech because it's a short, telegram-like phrase using key words to express a idea.\n\nYeah, I'm confident with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
