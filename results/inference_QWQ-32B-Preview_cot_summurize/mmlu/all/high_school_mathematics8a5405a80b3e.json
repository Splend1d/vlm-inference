                    "text": "So I have this problem about a cannonball's height over time, and I need to figure out how long it stays above 6 meters. The height is given by the equation h(t) = -4.9t\u00b2 + 14t - 0.4. I need to find the time intervals where h(t) is greater than 6 meters.\n\nFirst, I should set up the inequality:\n\n-4.9t\u00b2 + 14t - 0.4 > 6\n\nTo make it easier to work with, I'll subtract 6 from both sides to set it to zero:\n\n-4.9t\u00b2 + 14t - 0.4 - 6 > 0\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n-4.9t\u00b2 + 14t - 6.4 > 0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic inequality. To solve this, I need to find the roots of the equation -4.9t\u00b2 + 14t - 6.4 = 0, and then determine between which roots the quadratic is positive.\n\nFirst, let's find the roots using the quadratic formula:\n\nt = [ -b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac) ] / (2a)\n\nHere, a = -4.9, b = 14, and c = -6.4.\n\nLet me calculate the discriminant:\n\nD = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (14)\u00b2 - 4(-4.9)(-6.4)\n\nD = 196 - 4 * 4.9 * 6.4\n\nD = 196 - 125.44\n\nD = 70.56\n\nNow, the square root of 70.56 is 8.4.\n\nSo, the roots are:\n\nt = [ -14 \u00b1 8.4 ] / (2 * -4.9)\n\nFirst, t = [ -14 + 8.4 ] / (-9.8) = [ -5.6 ] / (-9.8) = 5.6 / 9.8 = 56/98 = 28/49 = 4/7 seconds\n\nSecond, t = [ -14 - 8.4 ] / (-9.8) = [ -22.4 ] / (-9.8) = 22.4 / 9.8 = 224/98 = 112/49 = 16/7 seconds\n\nSo, the roots are t = 4/7 seconds and t = 16/7 seconds.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of t\u00b2 is negative (-4.9), the parabola opens downwards. That means the quadratic is positive between the two roots.\n\nTherefore, the cannonball is above 6 meters between t = 4/7 seconds and t = 16/7 seconds.\n\nTo find out how long it stays above 6 meters, I need to subtract the smaller root from the larger root:\n\nTime above 6 meters = 16/7 - 4/7 = (16 - 4)/7 = 12/7 seconds\n\nSo, the cannonball is above 6 meters for 12/7 seconds.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"as an improper fraction,\" and 12/7 is already improper. So, the answer should be 12/7.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5/7\n\nB. 7/12\n\nC. 12/7\n\nD. 7/5\n\nOption C is 12/7, which matches my answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's verify the calculations.\n\nFirst, the inequality was -4.9t\u00b2 + 14t - 6.4 > 0.\n\nDiscriminant D = 196 - 125.44 = 70.56, square root is 8.4.\n\nThen, t = [ -14 \u00b1 8.4 ] / (-9.8)\n\nt1 = ( -14 + 8.4 ) / (-9.8) = (-5.6)/(-9.8) = 56/98 = 28/49 = 4/7\n\nt2 = ( -14 - 8.4 ) / (-9.8) = (-22.4)/(-9.8) = 22.4/9.8 = 224/98 = 112/49 = 16/7\n\nTime above 6 meters is from t = 4/7 to t = 16/7, so duration is 16/7 - 4/7 = 12/7 seconds.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check by plugging in t = 0:\n\nh(0) = -0.4, which is less than 6.\n\nThen, between t = 4/7 and t = 16/7, h(t) should be greater than 6.\n\nAfter t = 16/7, h(t) should be less than 6 again.\n\nSo, the answer should be 12/7 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{12}{7}} \\]"
