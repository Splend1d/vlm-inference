                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about group tasks. It says: \"When performing a(n) ________ task, group members select a solution offered by one of the group members as the group\u2019s solution.\" And the options are A. compensatory, B. disjunctive, C. conjunctive, and D. additive.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of group tasks.\n\nStarting with A. compensatory: I think compensatory decision-making is when a group considers all the positive and negative aspects of each option and balances them out. So, it's like weighing the pros and cons together.\n\nNext, B. disjunctive: I recall that disjunctive tasks are those where the group's performance depends on the best member or the best solution proposed. So, maybe that's related to selecting one solution offered by a group member.\n\nThen, C. conjunctive: Conjunctive tasks are those where the group's performance depends on the weakest member. So, it's the opposite of disjunctive tasks.\n\nLastly, D. additive: Additive tasks are where the group's performance is the sum of all members' contributions. So, it's like everyone's input adds up to the final outcome.\n\nNow, the question is asking about a task where the group selects one solution proposed by a member as the group's solution. So, it sounds like they are choosing the best solution among those proposed.\n\nComparing this to the definitions:\n\n- Compensatory: They consider all aspects of each option, but it doesn't specify selecting one solution.\n\n- Disjunctive: Focuses on the best member or solution, which aligns with selecting one solution.\n\n- Conjunctive: Depends on the weakest member, which doesn't seem relevant here.\n\n- Additive: The sum of all contributions, which would likely involve combining multiple solutions rather than selecting one.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like disjunctive is the most appropriate answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In disjunctive tasks, the group's performance is determined by the best member or the best solution. So, if they are selecting one solution, it's probably the best one, which fits with disjunctive.\n\nOn the other hand, compensatory decision-making might involve selecting a solution after balancing various factors, but it's not specifically about choosing one solution over others.\n\nConjunctive tasks rely on the weakest link, which doesn't relate to selecting a solution.\n\nAdditive tasks involve combining everyone's input, so they might come up with a solution that's a combination of multiple ideas, not just selecting one.\n\nTherefore, I think B. disjunctive is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
