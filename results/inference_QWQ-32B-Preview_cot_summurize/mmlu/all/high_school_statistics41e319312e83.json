                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what type of analysis would be best for this scenario. So, there's a manufacturer that makes motor oil, and they\u2019ve developed a new additive. They want to test if this additive affects the lifespan of engines. They\u2019ve selected 25 different engine types at random, and for each engine type, they\u2019re testing it with oil that has the additive and oil without the additive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the design of the experiment. It says that each engine type is tested using both types of oil: with the additive and without. So, for each engine, there are two measurements: one with additive, one without. This sounds like a paired design, where the same engine type is used in both conditions. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re using different engines for the additive and non-additive groups; it\u2019s the same engine type tested under both conditions.\n\nSo, because it's a paired design, I think the analysis should reflect that dependency between the measurements. That means I should look for an option that involves \"matched pairs.\"\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Matched pairs comparison of population proportions\n\nB. Matched pairs comparison of population means\n\nC. Independent samples comparison of population proportions\n\nD. Independent samples comparison of population means\n\nSince the experiment is about testing the lifespan of engines, which is a continuous variable (assuming lifespan is measured in hours or something like that), I think we're dealing with means rather than proportions. Proportions would be more appropriate if they were measuring something like the proportion of engines that fail before a certain time, but here it's about the lifespan, which is a quantitative measure.\n\nSo, between A and B, B seems more appropriate because it's about comparing means.\n\nNow, just to make sure, let's consider why it's not an independent samples comparison. If it were independent samples, that would mean that different engine types were used for the additive and non-additive groups, with no pairing. But in this case, the same engine type is tested in both groups, so the samples are paired.\n\nTherefore, options C and D, which involve independent samples, aren't appropriate here.\n\nSo, the correct choice should be B: matched pairs comparison of population means.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about what a matched pairs comparison entails. In a matched pairs design, each pair is similar in some way, and the differences within pairs are analyzed. Here, each pair consists of the same engine type tested with and without the additive. So, we can calculate the difference in lifespan for each engine type and then analyze those differences.\n\nThat sounds right. So, the analysis would involve looking at the mean difference in lifespans across the 25 engine types.\n\nTherefore, the most useful analysis would be a matched pairs comparison of population means.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n"
