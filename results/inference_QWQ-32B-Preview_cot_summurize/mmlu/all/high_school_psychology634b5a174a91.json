                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Stanley Schachter's two-factor theory of emotion. So, first things first, I need to recall what Schachter's theory is all about.\n\nI remember that Schachter proposed that emotions consist of two main components: physiological arousal and cognitive labeling. So, basically, he believed that our emotional experience is a result of both how our body reacts to a situation and how our mind interprets those reactions.\n\nLet me look at the options one by one to see which one best captures this idea.\n\nOption A says: \"An external event causes us to experience a specific emotion, and this emotion triggers certain physiological changes to occur.\" Hmm, this sounds a bit like the James-Lange theory, where emotions lead to physiological responses. But Schachter's theory is different because he suggests that physiological arousal comes first, and then we label that arousal as a specific emotion based on the context.\n\nSo, Option A doesn't seem to align perfectly with Schachter's two-factor theory.\n\nOption B: \"When our body responds to an external event, our brain interprets the biological changes as a specific emotion.\" This sounds closer to Schachter's idea. He did propose that we have a general physiological arousal, and then we cognitively label that arousal based on the situation, which leads to the experience of a specific emotion.\n\nWait, but Option B says \"our brain interprets the biological changes as a specific emotion.\" That seems pretty much in line with Schachter's theory.\n\nOption C: \"Each person follows a predictable pattern of changes in response to stress, including alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.\" Hmm, this sounds more like Selye's general adaptation syndrome, which is about the body's response to stress, not specifically about emotions.\n\nSo, Option C is probably not the right answer here.\n\nOption D: \"A combination of psychological changes and our cognitive interpretations combine to produce our emotional experiences.\" This is broad and seems related, but Schachter's theory is more specific. It's not just about psychological changes and cognitive interpretations; it's about physiological arousal and cognitive labeling.\n\nComparing Options B and D, Option B seems more precise in describing Schachter's two-factor theory.\n\nLet me double-check. Schachter's theory is often summarized as: emotion = arousal + cognitive label. So, when something happens, we have a physiological response, and then we interpret that response based on the context to identify a specific emotion.\n\nOption B captures this process: the body responds to an external event, and then the brain interprets those biological changes as a specific emotion.\n\nOption D is more general and doesn't specify the sequence or the components as clearly as Option B does.\n\nTherefore, I think Option B is the best summary of Schachter's two-factor theory of emotion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
