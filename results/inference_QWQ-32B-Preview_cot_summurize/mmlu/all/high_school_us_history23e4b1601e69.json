Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.\u2026 Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.\u2026 It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries.\u2026 Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work for all Americans again.\u2026 The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.\n\u2014Geraldine Ferraro, Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address, July 19, 1984\nThe political ideas expressed by Ferraro in the passage above most directly reflect those of which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I'm looking at this speech from Geraldine Ferraro, who was nominated for vice president in 1984. She's talking about how the rules are rigged against regular people, especially when it comes to taxes, and she mentions nuclear warheads and the need for women to contribute to America. I need to figure out which group her ideas most directly reflect: colonial opponents to British taxation, abolitionists, Republicans of the 1920s, or New Dealers of the 1930s.\n\nFirst, let's think about the colonial opponents to British taxation in the 1760s and 1770s. They were protesting taxes like the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts without representation in British Parliament. Their slogan was \"No taxation without representation.\" Ferraro is talking about taxes too, but she's not complaining about representation. She's saying that the tax burden is unfair, with individuals paying more and corporations paying less. So, it's about the distribution of the tax burden, not about representation. So, maybe not A.\n\nNext, abolitionists of the antebellum period were focused on ending slavery. While Ferraro mentions the struggle of Americans over two centuries, she's not directly addressing issues of slavery or civil rights in this excerpt. So, probably not B.\n\nRepublicans of the 1920s\u2014well, the 1920s were a time of prosperity and some conservative politics. Republicans were in power, and there was a focus on business and economic growth. But Ferraro is critiquing the current administration for rigging the rules against ordinary people, which seems more like a criticism of pro-business policies. So, perhaps not C.\n\nNew Dealers of the 1930s\u2014this was Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration during the Great Depression. The New Deal implemented many social and economic reforms to help the average American, like Social Security, regulations on banks, and support for labor unions. Ferraro's speech talks about making the rules of American life work for all Americans again, which sounds similar to the New Deal's aim to ensure that the economy worked for everyone, not just the wealthy.\n\nAlso, Ferraro mentions that it's not right that individual citizens are paying a larger share of taxes while corporations pay less. This echoes New Deal ideas of progressive taxation, where those who can afford to pay more should contribute more to society.\n\nFurthermore, she talks about the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries. The New Deal was part of that ongoing struggle to define American values and ensure that the country lived up to its ideals.\n\nLastly, she says, \"the issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.\" This could be seen as building on the New Deal's inclusion of women in the workforce and in public life, although women's rights were not as prominent in the New Deal as they would become later.\n\nComparing this to the other options, the New Deal seems the most directly reflective of Ferraro's ideas in this speech.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
