                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about aggregate demand. So, aggregate demand is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time. It's made up of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. When we talk about shifting the aggregate demand curve to the left, we're looking for a factor that decreases total demand at every price level.\n\nOption A is an increase in consumer confidence. If consumers are more confident about the economy, they're more likely to spend money. That would increase consumption, which is a component of aggregate demand, so this would shift the curve to the right, not left.\n\nOption B is business firms expecting lower sales in the future. If businesses expect lower sales, they might cut back on their investment and production. This reduction in investment would decrease aggregate demand, shifting the curve to the left.\n\nOption C is foreigners developing a preference for our products. If foreigners like our products more, they'll buy more of them, which increases exports. Net exports (exports minus imports) would rise, increasing aggregate demand and shifting the curve to the right.\n\nOption D is the government increasing its level of spending. Government spending is a direct component of aggregate demand. If the government spends more, aggregate demand increases, shifting the curve to the right.\n\nSo, looking at these options, the one that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the left is Option B: business firms expect lower sales in the future, leading them to decrease investment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
