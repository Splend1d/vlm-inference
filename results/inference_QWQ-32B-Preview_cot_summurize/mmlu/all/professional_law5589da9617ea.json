                    "text": "Let's see. Connie bought a laptop and a service agreement from Computer Retailer Inc. The laptop cost $1,000 and the service agreement was $1,200, making a total of $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop broke down, and the retailer refused to honor the service agreement. Now, Connie is suing the retailer, and I need to figure out which option the trial court is likely to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between common law and the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code). The UCC governs the sale of goods, while common law generally applies to other types of contracts. The key here is to determine whether the predominant purpose of the contract was the sale of goods or the service agreement.\n\nOption A says that Connie would win under common law because the predominant purpose was the sale of goods. But I think the UCC would apply here since it's a sale of goods. So maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B says Connie would win under the UCC only if the predominant reason was for the goods portion. That sounds plausible because the UCC applies to the sale of goods.\n\nOption C says Connie would win under the UCC unless the predominant purpose was for the service agreement. This is similar to option B but phrased differently.\n\nOption D says the court would rule for the retailer if the predominant purpose is determined by intent rather than the dollar amounts.\n\nI need to consider how courts determine whether the UCC or common law applies when there's a contract that includes both goods and services.\n\nI recall that when a contract includes both the sale of goods and services, the application of the UCC depends on which element is predominant. If the sale of goods is the predominant part, then the UCC applies. Conversely, if the services are predominant, then common law applies.\n\nIn this case, the laptop cost $1,000 and the service agreement is $1,200. So, the service agreement is more expensive than the laptop itself. Does that mean services are predominant?\n\nBut maybe the court looks at the nature of the items rather than just the price. A laptop is a tangible good, while a service agreement is about future services.\n\nI think courts often look at the intention of the parties and the nature of the transaction. In this case, Connie went to buy a laptop, and the salesperson also sold her a service agreement. So, perhaps the primary purpose was to acquire the laptop, and the service agreement was ancillary.\n\nHowever, the service agreement is quite expensive, almost equal to the laptop's price. Maybe the court would consider both elements more equally.\n\nI need to check if there are any specific rules in the UCC about mixed contracts involving both goods and services.\n\nLooking at UCC section 2-106, it deals with \"mixed contracts.\" It states that when a contract contains both the sale of goods and the performance of services, and the sale of goods is clearly the main objective, the UCC applies. If services are predominant, then common law applies.\n\nSo, in this case, is the sale of the laptop clearly the main objective, or is the service agreement more significant?\n\nGiven that the service agreement is $1,200 for 5 years, which is more than the laptop's price, it might suggest that services are predominant.\n\nBut, on the other hand, without the laptop, the service agreement wouldn't be necessary. So, perhaps the laptop is still the primary item.\n\nI think it's a close call, but the high cost of the service agreement might lead the court to consider services as predominant.\n\nIf services are predominant, then common law would apply, and the court might rule differently.\n\nBut option A says Connie would win under common law because the predominant purpose was goods, which seems contradictory if services are actually predominant.\n\nOption B says Connie would win under the UCC only if the predominant reason was for the goods portion. So, if goods are predominant, UCC applies, and Connie might have remedies under the UCC.\n\nOption C says Connie would win under the UCC unless the predominant purpose was for the service agreement. So, if services are predominant, common law applies, and the outcome might be different.\n\nOption D says the court would rule for the retailer if the predominant purpose is determined by intent and not just dollar amounts. So, if the court considers that Connie's main intent was to buy the laptop, even though the service agreement cost more, then the UCC might apply.\n\nI think the key is determining what is the predominant purpose of the contract.\n\nPerhaps the court would look at the overall purpose of the transaction. Connie went to buy a laptop, and the service agreement is additional. So, maybe the goods are still predominant, despite the high cost of the service agreement.\n\nAlternatively, the court might consider the dollar amounts as a significant factor.\n\nI think in this scenario, since the service agreement is $1,200 and the laptop is $1,000, the services might be considered predominant, leading to common law applying.\n\nBut option D suggests that if the court determines predominant purpose by intent, not just dollars, then even if services cost more, if the intent was primarily to buy the laptop, the UCC might still apply.\n\nThis is getting complicated. I need to think about which option is most likely correct.\n\nOption A says Connie would win under common law because the predominant purpose was goods. But if services are predominant, common law applies, but it's not clear that Connie would win under common law.\n\nOption B seems reasonable: Connie would win under the UCC only if goods are predominant.\n\nOption C is similar but says unless services are predominant.\n\nOption D favors the retailer if the court looks at intent over dollar amounts.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is Option B: Connie would win under the UCC only if the predominant reason was for the goods portion of the contract.\n\nThis is because if goods are predominant, UCC applies, and Connie might have remedies for breach of warranty or other UCC provisions. If services are predominant, common law applies, and the remedies might be different.\n\nTherefore, the trial court will likely find for Connie under the UCC only if the predominant reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
