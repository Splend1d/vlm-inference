                    "text": "So Bailey Co. changed its accounting method for insurance expense from the cash basis to the accrual basis. Last year, in January, they paid $240,000 for a four-year insurance policy and recorded that as insurance expense right away. But now, they're switching to the accrual basis, which means they should recognize the expense over the period the insurance covers, not all at once when they pay for it.\n\nSo, let's break this down. The policy is for four years, and they paid $240,000 upfront. Under the accrual basis, they should recognize $60,000 per year as insurance expense ($240,000 divided by 4 years).\n\nBut here's the thing: last year, they already recorded the entire $240,000 as expense, which is more than they should have under accrual. So, they need to adjust that.\n\nIn the current year, which is the first year of the four-year policy, they should have only recognized $60,000 as insurance expense. That means they previously expensed $240,000, but they should have only expensed $60,000, so there's an overstatement of expense by $180,000.\n\nThis overstatement affects retained earnings. So, they need to adjust retained earnings to correct this error.\n\nAlso, since it's a four-year policy and they paid $240,000, they should have a prepaid asset for the remaining three years' worth of insurance, which is $180,000 ($60,000 per year for 3 years).\n\nSo, in the current year, they need to:\n\n1. Recognize the correct insurance expense for the current year: $60,000.\n\n2. Adjust the prepaid insurance for the remaining three years: $180,000.\n\n3. Adjust retained earnings to correct the prior period error of overstatement of expense by $180,000.\n\nWait, but let's think about the timing. The policy was bought in January of the prior year, and it's a four-year policy. So, for the prior year, they should have recognized one year's expense, which is $60,000, and have $180,000 as prepaid insurance.\n\nBut they recorded $240,000 as expense, which is $180,000 more than they should have. So, they need to reduce the retained earnings by $180,000 to correct that overstatement.\n\nIn the current year, they need to recognize another $60,000 as expense, and the prepaid insurance should be $180,000 at the beginning of the year, then reduce it by $60,000 as they recognize the expense, leaving $120,000 as prepaid insurance at the end of the current year.\n\nBut the question is asking how to report the insurance transaction in the current year's financial statements, considering the change in accounting method.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. As a $180,000 debit to prepaid insurance.\n\nB. As a $60,000 debit to insurance expense.\n\nC. As a $60,000 debit to insurance expense, a $120,000 debit to prepaid asset, and $180,000 credit to retained earnings.\n\nD. As a $180,000 debit to insurance expense, a $120,000 credit to prepaid asset, and $60,000 credit to retained earnings.\n\nHmm, none of these seem to fully capture what's going on.\n\nLet me try to think step by step.\n\nFirst, they need to correct the prior period's overstatement of expense. They over-expensed by $180,000, so they need to increase retained earnings by $180,000.\n\nSecond, they need to record the current year's expense of $60,000.\n\nThird, they need to adjust the prepaid insurance accordingly.\n\nSo, perhaps they need to:\n\n- Debit insurance expense for $60,000 (current year's expense).\n\n- Debit prepaid insurance for $180,000 (to recognize the asset for the remaining three years).\n\n- Credit retained earnings for $180,000 (to correct the prior period overstatement).\n\nBut that matches option C.\n\nWait, option C says: debit insurance expense $60,000, debit prepaid asset $120,000, and credit retained earnings $180,000.\n\nHmm, why $120,000 debit to prepaid asset?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the balance in prepaid insurance.\n\nAt the beginning of the current year, since they paid $240,000 for a four-year policy, and they should have recognized $60,000 as expense in the prior year, leaving $180,000 as prepaid insurance at the beginning of the current year.\n\nThen, in the current year, they recognize $60,000 as expense, so they need to reduce prepaid insurance by $60,000, meaning prepaid insurance should be $120,000 at the end of the current year.\n\nSo, to record the current year's expense, they debit insurance expense $60,000 and credit prepaid insurance $60,000.\n\nBut additionally, they need to adjust retained earnings for the prior period overstatement of expense by $180,000.\n\nSo, perhaps the entry would be:\n\nDebit insurance expense $60,000\n\nCredit prepaid insurance $60,000\n\nAnd\n\nDebit retained earnings $180,000\n\nCredit prepaid insurance $180,000\n\nCombining these, it would be debit insurance expense $60,000, debit retained earnings $180,000, and credit prepaid insurance $240,000.\n\nBut that doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they combine the adjustments differently.\n\nWait, maybe they adjust the prepaid insurance to its correct balance.\n\nAt the beginning of the current year, prepaid insurance should be $180,000, but since they didn't record it that way previously, they need to adjust it.\n\nThen, during the current year, they recognize $60,000 as expense, reducing prepaid insurance to $120,000.\n\nSo, perhaps the entry is:\n\nDebit insurance expense $60,000\n\nCredit prepaid insurance $60,000\n\nAnd\n\nDebit retained earnings $180,000\n\nCredit prepaid insurance $180,000\n\nCombined, it's debit insurance expense $60,000, debit retained earnings $180,000, credit prepaid insurance $240,000.\n\nBut again, that doesn't match the options.\n\nLooking back at option C: debit insurance expense $60,000, debit prepaid asset $120,000, credit retained earnings $180,000.\n\nWait, maybe they are showing the net effect.\n\nIf they debit prepaid insurance $120,000 and credit retained earnings $180,000, along with debiting insurance expense $60,000, it would effectively increase prepaid insurance by $120,000 and increase retained earnings by $180,000.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose at the beginning of the current year, the prepaid insurance should be $180,000, but because they previously expensed the entire $240,000, the prepaid insurance account has a zero balance. So, they need to increase prepaid insurance by $180,000 and adjust retained earnings for the overstatement.\n\nBut option C has a $120,000 debit to prepaid asset, which doesn't align with this.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the prepaid insurance at the beginning of the current year is $180,000, and during the year, they use $60,000, leaving $120,000.\n\nSo, to adjust to the accrual basis, they need to:\n\n1. Recognize the beginning prepaid insurance of $180,000.\n\n2. Recognize the current year's expense of $60,000, which reduces prepaid insurance to $120,000.\n\n3. Adjust retained earnings for the prior period overstatement of $180,000.\n\nSo, the entry would be:\n\nDebit insurance expense $60,000\n\nCredit prepaid insurance $60,000\n\nAnd\n\nDebit retained earnings $180,000\n\nCredit prepaid insurance $180,000\n\nCombining these, it's debit insurance expense $60,000, debit retained earnings $180,000, credit prepaid insurance $240,000.\n\nBut option C shows debit insurance expense $60,000, debit prepaid asset $120,000, credit retained earnings $180,000.\n\nThat doesn't seem to make sense because prepaid insurance should be credited to reduce it, not debited.\n\nI must be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they need to reclassify part of the retained earnings to prepaid insurance.\n\nWait, maybe they need to debit prepaid insurance $180,000 and credit retained earnings $180,000 to reflect the asset that was previously expensed.\n\nThen, for the current year's expense, debit insurance expense $60,000 and credit prepaid insurance $60,000.\n\nCombined, that would be debit insurance expense $60,000, debit prepaid insurance $180,000, credit prepaid insurance $60,000, and credit retained earnings $180,000.\n\nNet effect: debit insurance expense $60,000, debit prepaid insurance $120,000, credit retained earnings $180,000.\n\nThat matches option C.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nBut to make sure, let's look at option D: debit insurance expense $180,000, credit prepaid asset $120,000, and credit retained earnings $60,000.\n\nThat doesn't align with what we've determined.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: debit insurance expense $60,000, debit prepaid asset $120,000, and credit retained earnings $180,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
