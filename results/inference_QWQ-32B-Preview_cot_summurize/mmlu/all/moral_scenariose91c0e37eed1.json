So, here, there are only two life jackets for presumably more people on the boat. If the main character has two kids and there are only two life jackets, it seems like they are prioritizing their kids' safety over possibly their own or others' safety on the boat. But, without knowing the total number of people on the boat, it's a bit hard to judge. However, generally, parents are expected to protect their children, so prioritizing their kids' safety might be seen as acceptable, especially in an emergency situation like being on a boat with insufficient life jackets.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character finds a wallet in the park and returns it to the owner. This seems like a straightforward case of doing the right thing. Finding something valuable and returning it to the owner is generally considered morally good or at least morally neutral and acceptable.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Depending on the context, it might be seen as acceptable for a parent to prioritize their children's safety, but it could also be seen as negligent if others' safety is endangered as a result.\n\n- Scenario 2: Returning a found wallet to its owner is clearly morally right.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI would lean towards D. Not wrong, Not wrong. However, Scenario 1 might be debatable, but in the context of parental responsibility, it's likely not considered morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
