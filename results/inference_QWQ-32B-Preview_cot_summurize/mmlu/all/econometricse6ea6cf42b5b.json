                    "text": "So I've got this question here about OLS estimation, and I need to figure out which statement is true. OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares, right? It's a method we use to estimate the parameters in a linear regression model. But to be honest, I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.\n\nLet me start by recalling what I know about linear regression. In a simple linear regression, we have data points that we want to fit a straight line to, and OLS helps us find the best-fitting line. The \"best-fitting\" line is the one that minimizes some kind of distance between the data points and the line itself.\n\nLooking at the options, they all talk about minimizing distances from the points to the line, either vertically or horizontally, and sometimes squaring those distances. So, I need to remember whether OLS minimizes the sum of the distances, the sum of the squares of the distances, and in which direction\u2014vertical or horizontal.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what vertical and horizontal distances mean in this context. In a scatter plot, the vertical axis is usually the dependent variable (y), and the horizontal axis is the independent variable (x). So, the vertical distance from a point to the line is the difference between the actual y-value of the point and the y-value predicted by the line for that x-value. This is often called the residual.\n\nOption A says that OLS minimizes the sum of the vertical distances. That sounds plausible, but I think there's more to it. Option B says it minimizes the sum of the squares of those vertical distances. Hmm, I think squaring the distances is important because it penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones, which might be desirable.\n\nOption C talks about minimizing the sum of the horizontal distances, which would involve the differences in the x-direction. That doesn't sound right for OLS, as I think OLS is primarily concerned with predicting y from x, not the other way around.\n\nOption D is similar to B but mentions horizontal distances. So, again, that seems less likely.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look back at the formal definition of OLS. In OLS, we have a model like y = \u03b20 + \u03b21*x + \u03b5, where \u03b5 is the error term. The goal is to estimate \u03b20 and \u03b21 such that the sum of the squared residuals is minimized. The residual for each data point is y_i - \u0177_i, where \u0177_i is the predicted value based on the line.\n\nSo, residual = y_i - \u0177_i, which is the vertical distance between the point and the line.\n\nTherefore, OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of these vertical distances.\n\nThat sounds like option B.\n\nBut option A says it minimizes the sum of the vertical distances, without squaring them. Is there a difference?\n\nYes, there is a difference. Minimizing the sum of the absolute values of the residuals (which would be similar to minimizing the sum of the vertical distances) is actually a different method, called Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) regression.\n\nOLS specifically minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals, which gives more weight to larger errors due to the squaring.\n\nSo, based on that, option B seems to be the correct statement.\n\nOption C and D talk about horizontal distances, which wouldn't make sense in the context of predicting y from x. If we were predicting x from y, then maybe, but that's not the standard setup for linear regression.\n\nTherefore, the true statement concerning OLS estimation is option B: OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
