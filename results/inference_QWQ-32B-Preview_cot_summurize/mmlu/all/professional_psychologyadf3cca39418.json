                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about employment testing and how it affects the opportunities for people who are educationally or socially disadvantaged. The question is asking about the principal effect of current concerns to improve employment opportunities for these groups, and it's focusing on how these concerns have encouraged the use of certain types of employment tests.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Untimed tests of a wide variety of abilities\n\nB. Norm-referenced tests\n\nC. Multiple aptitude batteries\n\nD. Work-sample types of tests\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nOption A: Untimed tests of a wide variety of abilities. Untimed tests are those where there's no time limit, so people can take as much time as they need to complete them. This could be beneficial for people who might be disadvantaged in timed settings, perhaps due to learning disabilities or other issues.\n\nOption B: Norm-referenced tests. These are tests where an individual's performance is compared to a norm group, usually a large population that's similar in some way. Norm-referenced tests are often used to see how someone ranks compared to their peers.\n\nOption C: Multiple aptitude batteries. These are tests that measure several different aptitudes or abilities at once. They're designed to assess a range of skills that might be relevant for a particular job or set of jobs.\n\nOption D: Work-sample types of tests. These are tests that directly mimic the actual tasks or duties of the job. They're designed to give a realistic preview of what the job entails and how well someone can perform those specific tasks.\n\nNow, considering the goal is to improve employment opportunities for educationally or socially disadvantaged individuals, which type of test would best serve this purpose?\n\nLet's think about it.\n\nOption A: Untimed tests could be helpful because they remove time pressure, which might affect disadvantaged individuals who may have had less exposure to test-taking strategies or who have conditions that affect test performance under time constraints.\n\nOption B: Norm-referenced tests compare individuals to a norm group. If the norm group is representative of the general population, disadvantaged individuals might still be at a disadvantage if they haven't had the same educational opportunities as others in the norm group.\n\nOption C: Multiple aptitude batteries assess a range of abilities, which could be beneficial because it broadens the criteria for employment beyond just one or two measures. This might help identify talents and abilities in individuals who may not have excelled in traditional educational settings.\n\nOption D: Work-sample tests directly relate to the job tasks, which could be advantageous for disadvantaged individuals if the tests allow them to demonstrate their practical skills and abilities, even if they haven't had formal education or training in those areas.\n\nAmong these options, I need to choose the one that best aligns with the goal of improving employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups.\n\nOption A seems positive, but removing time limits might not directly address the issue of educational or social disadvantages in a comprehensive way.\n\nOption B, norm-referenced tests, might perpetuate existing disparities if the norm group doesn't include or isn't representative of disadvantaged populations.\n\nOption C, multiple aptitude batteries, seems promising because it assesses a broader range of abilities, which could capture the diverse skills and potentials of disadvantaged individuals who may have developed different strengths outside of traditional educational settings.\n\nOption D, work-sample tests, also seems like a strong candidate because they focus on actual job skills, which might be more equitable for people who have learned through experience rather than formal education.\n\nBetween options C and D, I need to decide which one is more likely to be encouraged by the current concern to improve employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups.\n\nMultiple aptitude batteries (option C) assess various abilities that could be relevant to different jobs, which might help identify candidates who have a variety of skills that aren't necessarily captured by traditional educational measures. This could be particularly beneficial for disadvantaged individuals who may have developed skills through non-traditional paths.\n\nWork-sample tests (option D), on the other hand, are very job-specific. They allow candidates to demonstrate their ability to perform the actual tasks required by the job. This could be advantageous for disadvantaged individuals who may have gained skills through work experience or informal learning but may not have formal educational qualifications.\n\nBoth options seem beneficial, but I need to choose the one that best aligns with the principal effect of current concerns to improve employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups.\n\nPerhaps multiple aptitude batteries (option C) are more encouraged because they provide a broader assessment of a candidate's abilities, which can help identify potential in areas beyond what is typically measured in standard educational settings. This could be particularly useful for identifying candidates who may have been overlooked due to their disadvantaged backgrounds but possess aptitudes that are valuable for various jobs.\n\nOn the other hand, work-sample tests (option D) are highly practical and directly relevant to the job at hand. They might be more immediately appealing to employers because they provide a clear indication of whether a candidate can perform the necessary tasks. However, they might not be as comprehensive in assessing a candidate's overall potential across different areas.\n\nGiven that the question is about improving employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups, I suspect that multiple aptitude batteries (option C) would be the preferred choice because they offer a more holistic view of a candidate's abilities, which can help uncover hidden talents and potentials that may not be apparent from traditional educational backgrounds.\n\nAdditionally, multiple aptitude batteries can help reduce bias in hiring by considering a wider range of skills and abilities, which might be particularly important for disadvantaged individuals who may have developed different strengths outside of conventional educational settings.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. multiple aptitude batteries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
