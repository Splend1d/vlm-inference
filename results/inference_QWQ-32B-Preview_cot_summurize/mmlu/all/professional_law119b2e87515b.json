When the pedestrian started to cross the street, she saw the traffic light was red. She momentarily stopped, thought about waiting until the light turned green, but then decided to cross anyway. As the pedestrian was halfway across the street, the motorist, who was driving 50 m. p. h. in a 25 m. p. h. zone, struck her with his vehicle. The pedestrian suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries in the accident. While in the hospital, the pedestrian's insurance company paid $10,000 of her medical expenses. Six months later, the pedestrian brought suit against the motorist to recover damages for all her medical expenses. This jurisdiction has a \"modified\" comparative negligence statute in effect. Suppose a jury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The motorist was 60 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The pedestrian was 40 percent at fault in crossing the street against the red light; and (3) The pedestrian suffered damages from the accident totaling $50,000. After the verdict, the court was advised that the pedestrian's insurance company had already paid the pedestrian $10,000. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the pedestrian in the amount of\n\nA. $50,000, because the motorist's negligence was greater than the pedestrian's.\nB. $30,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by the motorist's negligence, but the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule.\nC. $20,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence, but the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule.\nD. $10,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence, less the $10,000 in hospital expenses already paid by the insurance company.\n"

It seems a bit complicated at first, but if I break it down, I can manage it.\n\nFirst, there's an accident where a motorist was speeding and hit a pedestrian who crossed the street on a red light. The pedestrian got hurt and had medical expenses covered partly by her insurance. Now, she's suing the motorist for damages.\n\nThe jurisdiction has a \"modified\" comparative negligence statute. I need to remember what that means. In comparative negligence states, the damages are apportioned based on the percentage of fault of each party. \"Modified\" probably means that there's a limit to how much fault the plaintiff can have and still recover damages.\n\nFrom the jury's special verdict:\n\n1. Motorist is 60% negligent for speeding.\n\n2. Pedestrian is 40% at fault for crossing against the red light.\n\n3. Total damages are $50,000.\n\nAlso, the pedestrian's insurance paid $10,000 in medical expenses.\n\nI need to figure out how much the court should award the pedestrian.\n\nFirst, let's consider the comparative negligence. Since it's modified, I need to check if there's a threshold for the plaintiff's fault above which they can't recover anything. In some states, if the plaintiff is more than 50% at fault, they can't recover. But here, the pedestrian is only 40% at fault, which is less than 50%, so she can recover a portion of her damages.\n\nThe formula for modified comparative negligence is usually: Damages recoverable = Total damages * (100% - plaintiff's percentage of fault).\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nDamages recoverable = $50,000 * (100% - 40%) = $50,000 * 60% = $30,000.\n\nWait, but option B says $30,000, and it mentions that the $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule.\n\nWhat's the collateral source rule? I think it means that any payments the plaintiff receives from sources independent of the defendant (like insurance) don't reduce the amount the defendant has to pay.\n\nSo, if the collateral source rule applies, the $10,000 paid by the insurance doesn't get subtracted from the $30,000.\n\nTherefore, the judgment should be for $30,000.\n\nBut option D says $10,000, which is $20,000 less the $10,000 already paid by insurance. That seems wrong because, under the collateral source rule, the insurance payment shouldn't reduce the defendant's liability.\n\nOption A is $50,000, which is the total damages, but that doesn't account for the plaintiff's fault.\n\nOption C is $20,000, which seems to be 40% of $50,000, but that's the plaintiff's share of fault, which shouldn't be what she recovers.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems correct: $30,000, and the $10,000 payment is disregarded under the collateral source rule.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if the collateral source rule really applies here. Maybe there's an exception.\n\nLet me think: the collateral source rule generally prevents the defendant from introducing evidence of payments the plaintiff received from other sources, like insurance, to reduce the damages awarded.\n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, the payment by the plaintiff's own insurance may be considered differently.\n\nBut according to the standard collateral source rule, the defendant shouldn't benefit from the plaintiff's insurance.\n\nTherefore, the $10,000 paid by the insurance should not reduce the amount the defendant has to pay.\n\nSo, the judgment should be for $30,000, and the $10,000 already paid by insurance might be recoverable by the pedestrian from her insurance company, depending on the terms of her policy.\n\nWait, no. Usually, the insurance company would have a subrogation right, meaning they might have the right to recover part of what they paid from any damages the pedestrian receives from the at-fault party.\n\nBut in terms of the court judgment, the collateral source rule should apply, and the $10,000 payment shouldn't reduce the judgment against the defendant.\n\nTherefore, the court should enter a judgment for $30,000, and option B seems correct.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing.\n\nThe accident happened on December 3, and the suit was brought six months later. I don't think the time affects the calculation.\n\nThe motorist was speeding in a 25 mph zone at 50 mph, which is clearly negligent.\n\nThe pedestrian crossed against a red light, which is also negligent.\n\nThe jury assigned percentages accordingly.\n\nSo, based on modified comparative negligence, the pedestrian can recover her damages reduced by her percentage of fault.\n\nTherefore, $50,000 total damages minus 40% fault equals $30,000 recoverable.\n\nAnd the $10,000 paid by insurance is irrelevant under the collateral source rule.\n\nThus, the answer should be B. $30,000, with the $10,000 payment disregarded under the collateral source rule.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
