                    "text": "I'm going to go with C. Sarasvati. I remember that Sarasvati is the goddess of knowledge, music, art, and wisdom in Hinduism. She's often associated with the arts and learning, which seems related to being the power of the word and the mother of the Vedas.\n\nLet me think about the other options to make sure. Vishnu is one of the principal deities, known for preservation, but I don't recall him being associated specifically with speech or the Vedas. Ganesha is the elephant-headed god, known as the remover of obstacles and the patron of arts and sciences, but again, not specifically related to speech or the Vedas. Indra is the king of the gods and the god of thunder and war; I don't think he's associated with speech or the Vedas either.\n\nSo, Sarasvati seems to fit the description best. She's often depicted with a veena, a musical instrument, which connects her to the arts, and her association with knowledge and learning aligns with her being the mother of the Vedas.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should look up some information about Sarasvati's role in Hinduism. According to my knowledge, Sarasvati is indeed considered the goddess of knowledge, music, art, and wisdom. She is revered as the mother of the Vedas, which are ancient sacred texts in Hinduism. The Vedas are considered apauruseya, meaning they are not of human origin, and Sarasvati is credited with revealing them.\n\nAdditionally, Sarasvati is associated with the power of speech and the arts. In Hindu mythology, she is the consort of Brahma, the creator god, and her name itself means \"the flowing one,\" which can be interpreted as the flow of wisdom and knowledge.\n\nSo, based on this information, I'm confident that the answer is C. Sarasvati.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
