I know that the UCC is a set of laws that govern commercial transactions, especially those involving the sale of goods. So, I should look for the option that involves the sale of goods, as opposed to services or real estate.\n\nOption A is about a common carrier delivering a new computer. Now, delivering a computer sounds like a service, specifically transportation. I think the UCC might not cover this because it's more about the delivery service rather than the sale of the computer itself.\n\nOption B mentions crops and timber to be severed from the property next summer. This seems like it's about selling agricultural products or natural resources. Since crops and timber are considered goods, this might fall under the UCC.\n\nOption C is about the purchase of a commercial property building. That sounds like a real estate transaction, which I believe is governed by different laws, not the UCC.\n\nOption D is the sale of an intangible asset. Intangible assets are things like patents, copyrights, or trademarks. I'm not sure if the UCC covers intangible assets or if there's another set of laws that deal with those.\n\nLet me think again. The UCC is primarily concerned with the sale of goods, which are movable objects that can be sold in commerce. So, crops and timber would qualify as goods since they are tangible personal property. On the other hand, the delivery service in option A is more of a service contract, and the purchase of a commercial building in option C is a real estate transaction. As for intangible assets in option D, those might be governed by other laws specific to intellectual property.\n\nSo, between options B and D, B seems more straightforwardly covered by the UCC because it's about tangible goods. Option D is a bit\u6a21\u7cca, but I think the UCC might not cover intangible assets as extensively as tangible goods.\n\nTherefore, I think the most likely contract to be classified under the UCC is option B: crops and timber to be severed from the property next summer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
