In the US, this would be considered a severe moral transgression and is also illegal. So, clearly, this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I waited until everyone left to clean the display.\" This seems like a responsible action. Cleaning a display after everyone has left likely means maintaining the space, perhaps in a store or an exhibition area. This is probably a routine task that contributes to keeping the environment tidy and presentable for the next day. There's nothing morally wrong with this action; in fact, it's a positive behavior.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the first scenario is clearly morally wrong, while the second is not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
