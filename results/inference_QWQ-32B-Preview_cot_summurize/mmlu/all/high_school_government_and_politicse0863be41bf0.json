To make it easier for citizens to register to vote\n\nC. To require that all voters know how to drive\n\nD. To establish voter identification laws\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"motor voter\" laws are. I think they have something to do with registering to vote when you get your driver's license. I've heard of something called the \"National Voter Registration Act,\" which might be related.\n\nLet me see. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is often referred to as the \"motor voter law.\" It was designed to make voter registration more accessible to citizens. One of the key provisions is that it requires states to provide voter registration opportunities at departments of motor vehicles, when people apply for or renew their driver's licenses.\n\nSo, the main idea is to make it easier for people to register to vote by combining it with something they're already doing, like getting their driver's license. This should help increase voter registration rates, which might in turn lead to higher turnout on election days.\n\nOption C says \"to require that all voters know how to drive.\" That doesn't sound right. Not everyone who votes has a driver's license or knows how to drive. In fact, there are many people who are eligible to vote but don't drive.\n\nOption D mentions establishing voter identification laws. While voter ID laws are about requiring certain forms of identification to vote, that seems different from motor voter laws, which are more about making registration easier through motor vehicle departments.\n\nOption A, \"to increase turnout on election days,\" might be a consequence of motor voter laws, but I think the primary purpose is more directly about making registration easier.\n\nOption B says \"to make it easier for citizens to register to vote.\" That aligns closely with what I've read about the National Voter Registration Act and motor voter laws.\n\nMaybe I should look up a reliable source to confirm this. According to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the National Voter Registration Act requires states to offer voter registration opportunities at motor vehicle departments, among other places. The goal is to make voter registration more accessible and convenient for citizens.\n\nSo, based on this, the primary purpose is to make it easier for citizens to register to vote. Therefore, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption C, requiring all voters to know how to drive, isn't logical because voting is a right for all eligible citizens, regardless of whether they can drive or not. There are voters who are elderly, disabled, or choose not to drive for various reasons.\n\nOption D, establishing voter identification laws, is actually a separate issue. Voter ID laws are about verifying a voter's identity at the polling place, whereas motor voter laws are about facilitating the registration process.\n\nOption A, increasing turnout on election days, could be an indirect effect of motor voter laws, since easier registration might lead to higher participation. However, the primary purpose is more directly about registration accessibility.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B: to make it easier for citizens to register to vote.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
