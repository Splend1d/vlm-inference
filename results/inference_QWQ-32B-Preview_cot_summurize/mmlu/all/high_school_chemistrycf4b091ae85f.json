Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the chemical reaction between KOH and H\u2083PO\u2084. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base, and phosphoric acid (H\u2083PO\u2084) is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons (H\u207a) in a neutralization reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nH\u2083PO\u2084 + 3KOH \u2192 K\u2083PO\u2084 + 3H\u2082O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we see that one mole of H\u2083PO\u2084 reacts with three moles of KOH.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of moles of H\u2083PO\u2084 present in 50.0 mL of 0.150 M solution. The formula for moles is:\n\nmoles = molarity \u00d7 volume (in liters)\n\nFirst, convert the volume from mL to L:\n\n50.0 mL = 0.0500 L\n\nNow, calculate the moles of H\u2083PO\u2084:\n\nmoles of H\u2083PO\u2084 = 0.150 mol/L \u00d7 0.0500 L = 0.0075 mol\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 1 mole of H\u2083PO\u2084 requires 3 moles of KOH. Therefore, the moles of KOH needed are:\n\nmoles of KOH = 3 \u00d7 moles of H\u2083PO\u2084 = 3 \u00d7 0.0075 mol = 0.0225 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the volume of 0.250 M KOH that contains 0.0225 moles. Using the formula:\n\nvolume (in liters) = moles / molarity\n\nPlug in the values:\n\nvolume of KOH = 0.0225 mol / 0.250 mol/L = 0.0900 L\n\nConvert this volume back to mL:\n\n0.0900 L = 90.0 mL\n\nTherefore, the volume of 0.250 M KOH required to completely neutralize 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H\u2083PO\u2084 is 90.0 mL.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 90.0 mL.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
