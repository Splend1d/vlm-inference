Option A says they are separate entities, but I don't think that's right because Einstein's theory kind of merged them, didn't it?\n\nOption B says they are parts of one whole. That rings a bell. I think Einstein proposed that space and time are intertwined into what he called spacetime. So, they aren't independent of each other but are combined into this four-dimensional fabric.\n\nOption C mentions an inverse-square law. I know about inverse-square laws in physics, like with gravity or light intensity, but I don't think that's related to space and time. So, probably not C.\n\nOption D says they are special to space travelers. Hmm, maybe this is referring to time dilation or something like that, but I think that's a consequence of spacetime, not that space and time are special only to space travelers.\n\nSo, based on what I remember, Einstein discovered that space and time are not separate but are part of one unified thing called spacetime. Therefore, I think the answer is B: they are parts of one whole.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should quickly look it up or think about it some more. Einstein's theory of relativity, both special and general, deals with space and time. In special relativity, he showed that measurements of space and time are relative to the speed of the observer, and that space and time are interconnected. Then, in general relativity, he described gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n\nSo, yeah, it definitely seems like he viewed space and time as interconnected aspects of the same thing, which is spacetime. Therefore, B seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
