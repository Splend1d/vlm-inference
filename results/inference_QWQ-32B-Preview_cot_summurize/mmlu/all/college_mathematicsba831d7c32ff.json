                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. Sofia and Tess each pick one number from 1 to 10 randomly. I need to find the probability that neither of the numbers chosen is the square of the other. The options are 0.64, 0.72, 0.81, and 0.95.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for one number to be the square of the other. So, if Sofia picks a number, say 2, then Tess would have to pick 4 because 2 squared is 4. Similarly, if Sofia picks 3, Tess would have to pick 9, since 3 squared is 9. So, the pairs where one number is the square of the other are (1,1), (2,4), (3,9), and maybe some others?\n\nWait, let's list all possible pairs where one number is the square of the other. So, if Sofia picks 1, Tess picks 1 (since 1 squared is 1). If Sofia picks 2, Tess picks 4. If Sofia picks 3, Tess picks 9. If Sofia picks 4, Tess picks 16, but 16 is not in 1 to 10, so that's not possible. Similarly, if Sofia picks 4, and Tess picks 2, because the square root of 4 is 2. Wait, so it's not just one way; it could be Sofia picks 4 and Tess picks 2, or Sofia picks 9 and Tess picks 3, etc.\n\nSo, the pairs where one number is the square of the other are:\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,9)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (9,3)\n\nIs that all? Let's see:\n\n- 4 squared is 16, which is outside 1 to 10.\n\n- 5 squared is 25, also outside.\n\n- Similarly, higher numbers don't matter.\n\n- Also, squares of numbers greater than 3 are outside 1 to 10, except for 1, 2, 3.\n\n- And square roots of numbers less than 4 are 1 and 2, which are already covered.\n\nSo, these are the only pairs: (1,1), (2,4), (3,9), (4,2), and (9,3).\n\nNow, the total number of possible pairs is 10 choices for Sofia and 10 for Tess, so 10*10=100 possible pairs.\n\nOut of these 100, how many are the ones where one is the square of the other? We have 5 such pairs.\n\nSo, the probability that one number is the square of the other is 5/100=0.05.\n\nBut the question asks for the probability that neither number is the square of the other, which is the complement of the above event.\n\nSo, it should be 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Is there any overlap or did I miss anything?\n\nLet's consider the pairs again:\n\n- (1,1): 1 is the square of 1.\n\n- (2,4): 4 is the square of 2.\n\n- (3,9): 9 is the square of 3.\n\n- (4,2): 2 is the square of 4? Wait, no, 2 is not the square of 4. 4 squared is 16, not 2. So, is (4,2) actually a valid pair where one is the square of the other? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nActually, for (4,2), 2 is the square root of 4, not the square. So, does the problem consider only squares, not square roots? The problem says \"neither integer chosen will be the square of the other.\" So, it's about one being the square of the other, not one being the square root of the other.\n\nSo, in the pair (4,2), is 4 the square of 2? Yes, 2 squared is 4. So, in this case, 4 is the square of 2, so this pair should be counted.\n\nSimilarly, in (9,3), 3 squared is 9, so 9 is the square of 3.\n\nBut in (2,4), 4 is the square of 2, so that's valid.\n\nWait, but in (4,2), 2 is not the square of 4, because 4 squared is 16, not 2. So, perhaps (4,2) shouldn't be counted.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused.\n\nLet's re-examine this.\n\nIf one number is the square of the other, then:\n\n- If Sofia picks a number x, and Tess picks x\u00b2, provided x\u00b2 is within 1 to 10.\n\n- Or, if Sofia picks x\u00b2, and Tess picks x, provided x\u00b2 is within 1 to 10.\n\nSo, for x=1: 1\u00b2=1 \u2192 pair (1,1)\n\nx=2: 2\u00b2=4 \u2192 pair (2,4)\n\nx=3: 3\u00b2=9 \u2192 pair (3,9)\n\nx=4: 4\u00b2=16, which is outside 1 to 10, so no pair.\n\nBut, also, for x=4, Tess could pick 2, since 2\u00b2=4. So, pair (4,2)\n\nSimilarly, for x=9, Tess could pick 3, since 3\u00b2=9. So, pair (9,3)\n\nBut wait, 9 is not in the choices because the numbers are from 1 to 10, but 9 is included.\n\nWait, no, 9 is in 1 to 10.\n\nWait, no, 1 to 10 includes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nSo, x=1: pair (1,1)\n\nx=2: pair (2,4)\n\nx=3: pair (3,9)\n\nx=4: pair (4,2)\n\nx=9: pair (9,3)\n\nSo, these are the pairs where one number is the square of the other.\n\nIs there any other x where x\u00b2 is within 1 to 10? x=1,2,3.\n\nx=1: 1\u00b2=1 \u2192 (1,1)\n\nx=2: 2\u00b2=4 \u2192 (2,4)\n\nx=3: 3\u00b2=9 \u2192 (3,9)\n\nAnd then, the reverse: x=4, Tess picks 2 \u2192 (4,2)\n\nx=9, Tess picks 3 \u2192 (9,3)\n\nSo, total of 5 pairs.\n\nTherefore, the probability that one number is the square of the other is 5/100=0.05.\n\nThus, the probability that neither number is the square of the other is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, 0.95 is one of them.\n\nBut the other options are 0.64, 0.72, 0.81, and 0.95.\n\nSo, perhaps I missed something.\n\nLet me consider if (1,1) should be counted.\n\nIn (1,1), 1 is the square of 1, so it should be counted.\n\nBut is it possible to have duplicates? Like, is (1,1) only one pair, or should it be considered differently?\n\nAlso, are there any other pairs I missed?\n\nLet me list all possible pairs where one number is the square of the other:\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,9)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (9,3)\n\nYes, that's all.\n\nSo, 5 pairs out of 100.\n\nTherefore, probability is 5/100=0.05.\n\nComplement is 0.95.\n\nBut maybe the problem considers that they cannot pick the same number.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"neither integer chosen will be the square of the other.\"\n\nSo, in (1,1), 1 is the square of 1, so it's not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, in (2,4), 4 is the square of 2, so not allowed.\n\nIn (4,2), 2 is not the square of 4, but 4 is the square of 2, so perhaps it's still not allowed.\n\nWait, but the problem says neither integer is the square of the other.\n\nSo, in (4,2), 4 is the square of 2, so one is the square of the other.\n\nSimilarly, in (9,3), 9 is the square of 3.\n\nSo, these pairs are not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the pairs to exclude are:\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,9)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (9,3)\n\nTotal 5 pairs.\n\nTherefore, probability is 1 - 5/100 = 0.95.\n\nSo, the answer should be 0.95.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers only one direction.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nIf one number is the square of the other, it could mean:\n\n- x = y\u00b2 or y = x\u00b2.\n\nSo, both (2,4) and (4,2) should be considered, as in one is the square of the other.\n\nSo, my initial count of 5 pairs seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 0.95.\n\nBut perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nLet me read it again: \"neither integer chosen will be the square of the other.\"\n\nSo, in other words, we don't want any pair where one number is the square of the other.\n\nWhich is what I considered.\n\nSo, I think 0.95 is the correct answer.\n\nBut maybe the options are misleading, or perhaps I miscounted the pairs.\n\nLet me count the pairs again.\n\nPossible x and y where x = y\u00b2 or y = x\u00b2, with x and y from 1 to 10.\n\nx=1: y=1 (since 1\u00b2=1)\n\nx=2: y=4 (since 2\u00b2=4)\n\nx=3: y=9 (since 3\u00b2=9)\n\nx=4: y=2 (since 4 is 2 squared)\n\nx=9: y=3 (since 9 is 3 squared)\n\nSo, pairs are (1,1), (2,4), (3,9), (4,2), (9,3).\n\nNo others, since 5\u00b2=25 which is beyond 10.\n\nSo, 5 pairs.\n\nTotal possible pairs: 10*10=100.\n\nProbability of picking one of these pairs: 5/100=0.05.\n\nTherefore, probability of not picking such a pair: 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSo, the answer should be 0.95.\n\nPerhaps the confusion is that 1 is the square of itself, so it's only one pair, not two.\n\nBut in my count, I only counted (1,1) once.\n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.95} \\]"
