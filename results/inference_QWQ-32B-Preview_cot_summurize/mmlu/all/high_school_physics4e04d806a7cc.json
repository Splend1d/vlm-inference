                    "text": "Let's tackle this electric dipole problem. I have an electric dipole consisting of two point charges: one positive and one negative, each with a magnitude of 4.0 nanocoulombs (nC), separated by a distance of 2.0 centimeters (cm). I need to find the electric field strength at the point midway between these charges.\n\nFirst, I should recall what an electric dipole is. An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges separated by a distance. The midpoint between the charges is often referred to as the center of the dipole.\n\nNow, to find the electric field at the midpoint, I need to calculate the electric field due to each charge at that point and then add them up, considering their directions.\n\nThe formula for the electric field (E) due to a point charge (q) at a distance (r) is:\n\nE = k * |q| / r\u00b2\n\nwhere k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.99 \u00d7 10^9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2.\n\nIn this case, there are two charges: +4.0 nC and -4.0 nC, and the midpoint is equidistant from both charges. The distance from each charge to the midpoint is half of the separation distance, which is 2.0 cm / 2 = 1.0 cm = 0.01 m.\n\nSo, for each charge, the electric field at the midpoint is:\n\nE = k * |q| / r\u00b2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nE = (8.99 \u00d7 10^9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2) * (4.0 \u00d7 10^-9 C) / (0.01 m)\u00b2\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n(0.01 m)\u00b2 = 0.0001 m\u00b2\n\nNow, the numerator:\n\n8.99 \u00d7 10^9 * 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9 = 35.96 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\n\nSo, E = 35.96 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C / 0.0001 m\u00b2 = 359,600 N/C or 3.596 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nWait a minute, that's the electric field due to one charge. But there are two charges, and I need to find the total electric field at the midpoint.\n\nLet's consider the directions of the electric fields due to each charge. The electric field due to a positive charge points away from the charge, and due to a negative charge, it points towards the charge.\n\nAt the midpoint, the electric field due to the positive charge will point away from the positive charge, which is towards the negative charge. Similarly, the electric field due to the negative charge will point towards itself, which is also towards the positive charge.\n\nSo, both electric fields are pointing in the same direction, from the positive to the negative charge.\n\nTherefore, the total electric field at the midpoint is the sum of the individual electric fields:\n\nE_total = E_positive + E_negative\n\nSince both are equal in magnitude and in the same direction:\n\nE_total = 2 * E\n\nFrom earlier, E = 3.596 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nSo, E_total = 2 * 3.596 \u00d7 10^5 V/m = 7.192 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 9.0 \u00d7 10^4 V/m\n\nC. 1.8 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nD. 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 7.192 \u00d7 10^5 V/m, which rounds to 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming Coulomb's constant, k = 8.99 \u00d7 10^9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2\n\nCharge, q = 4.0 nC = 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9 C\n\nDistance, r = 1.0 cm = 0.01 m\n\nElectric field due to one charge:\n\nE = k * |q| / r\u00b2 = (8.99 \u00d7 10^9) * (4.0 \u00d7 10^-9) / (0.01)^2\n\nCalculate numerator: 8.99 \u00d7 4.0 = 35.96, and 10^9 * 10^-9 = 1, so 35.96 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\n\nDenominator: (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 m\u00b2\n\nSo, E = 35.96 / 0.0001 = 359,600 V/m or 3.596 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nThen, total electric field E_total = 2 * E = 7.192 \u00d7 10^5 V/m, which rounds to 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any possibility that the electric fields cancel each other out at the midpoint?\n\nNo, because both fields point in the same direction, from the positive to the negative charge. So, they add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a conceptual mistake here. Perhaps the electric field at the midpoint of an electric dipole is zero?\n\nWait, that can't be right. In an electric dipole, the electric field at the midpoint should not be zero because the fields from both charges are in the same direction.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing it with the electric field on the equatorial plane of a dipole, which is indeed zero.\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with the midpoint along the axis connecting the two charges.\n\nWait, no, the midpoint is along the axis connecting the two charges, not on the equatorial plane.\n\nActually, for an electric dipole, the electric field along the axial line (the line passing through both charges) is given by:\n\nE_axial = (2 * k * p) / r^3\n\nwhere p is the dipole moment, which is p = q * d, with d being the separation distance.\n\nLet me try calculating it using this formula to verify.\n\nFirst, dipole moment p = q * d = (4.0 \u00d7 10^-9 C) * (2.0 \u00d7 10^-2 m) = 8.0 \u00d7 10^-11 C\u00b7m\n\nNow, electric field along the axial line at a distance r from the center is:\n\nE_axial = (2 * k * p) / r^3\n\nIn this case, r is the distance from the center to the point where we're calculating the field. Since we're calculating at the midpoint, r = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If r = 0, then the formula would suggest division by zero, which is undefined.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let's think carefully.\n\nThe formula E_axial = (2 * k * p) / r^3 is valid for points along the axial line outside the dipole, i.e., r is the distance from the center of the dipole to the point along the axis.\n\nBut in this problem, we're asked for the field at the midpoint between the charges, which is at the center of the dipole, so r = 0.\n\nSo, applying this formula directly would lead to division by zero, which is not possible.\n\nThis suggests that the electric field at the center of the dipole along the axial line might be different and possibly zero or have some other value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula doesn't apply at r = 0.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe using the definition of electric field due to each charge and vectorally adding them.\n\nElectric field due to positive charge:\n\nE_positive = k * q / r^2, directed away from the positive charge.\n\nElectric field due to negative charge:\n\nE_negative = k * q / r^2, directed towards the negative charge.\n\nSince both fields are in the same direction (from positive to negative), the total electric field is E_total = E_positive + E_negative = 2 * (k * q / r^2)\n\nWith r = 0.01 m, as before.\n\nSo, E_total = 2 * (8.99 \u00d7 10^9 * 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9 / (0.01)^2) = 2 * (35.96 / 0.0001) = 2 * 359,600 = 719,200 V/m or 7.192 \u00d7 10^5 V/m, which rounds to 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nBut earlier, there was confusion with the axial formula suggesting division by zero. So, perhaps the axial formula doesn't apply at r = 0, and the straightforward superposition method is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the electric field at the center of the dipole is actually zero due to symmetry.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the fields from both charges are in the same direction at the midpoint.\n\nWait, perhaps if I consider the vector directions more carefully.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let's place the positive charge at x = +d/2 and the negative charge at x = -d/2, with the midpoint at x = 0.\n\nThe electric field due to the positive charge at x = 0 points from +d/2 to 0, which is in the negative x-direction.\n\nThe electric field due to the negative charge at x = 0 points from 0 to -d/2, which is also in the negative x-direction.\n\nTherefore, both fields add up in the negative x-direction.\n\nSo, E_total = E_positive + E_negative = 2 * (k * q / r^2) in the negative x-direction.\n\nThus, E_total = 2 * (8.99 \u00d7 10^9 * 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9 / (0.01)^2) = 7.192 \u00d7 10^5 V/m in the negative x-direction.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude is 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m, which corresponds to option D.\n\nPerhaps the confusion earlier was due to misapplying the axial formula at r = 0, but using superposition directly gives a clear answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding of the axial formula.\n\nLet me look up the formula for the electric field along the axial line of an electric dipole.\n\nUpon checking, the formula for the electric field along the axial line of a dipole at a distance r from the center is:\n\nE_axial = (2 * k * p) / r^3\n\nwhere p is the dipole moment, p = q * d.\n\nIn this case, p = (4.0 \u00d7 10^-9 C) * (2.0 \u00d7 10^-2 m) = 8.0 \u00d7 10^-11 C\u00b7m\n\nThen, E_axial = (2 * 8.99 \u00d7 10^9 * 8.0 \u00d7 10^-11) / r^3\n\nSimplify numerator: 2 * 8.99 * 8.0 = 143.84, and 10^9 * 10^-11 = 10^-2, so 143.84 \u00d7 10^-2 = 1.4384 N/C / m^3\n\nBut r is the distance from the center of the dipole to the point along the axis.\n\nIn this problem, we're evaluating at the midpoint, which is at r = 0.\n\nSo, plugging r = 0 into the formula gives division by zero, which is undefined.\n\nThis suggests that the electric field at the center of the dipole along the axial line is actually infinite, which doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the axial formula isn't meant to be used at r = 0.\n\nGiven that, returning to the superposition approach seems more appropriate.\n\nUsing superposition, E_total = 2 * (k * q / r^2), with r = d/2 = 0.01 m\n\nSo, E_total = 2 * (8.99 \u00d7 10^9 * 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9 / (0.01)^2) = 7.192 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the superposition calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation.\n\nFirst, k * q / r^2 = (8.99 \u00d7 10^9) * (4.0 \u00d7 10^-9) / (0.01)^2\n\nCalculate numerator: 8.99 * 4.0 = 35.96, and 10^9 * 10^-9 = 1, so 35.96 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\n\nDenominator: (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 m\u00b2\n\nSo, E = 35.96 / 0.0001 = 359,600 V/m\n\nThen, E_total = 2 * 359,600 = 719,200 V/m, which is approximately 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nBut earlier, there was confusion with the axial formula suggesting division by zero. Maybe the axial formula isn't applicable at r = 0, and the superposition method is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the electric field at the center of the dipole is zero due to symmetry.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the fields from both charges are in the same direction at the midpoint.\n\nWait, maybe if the dipole is aligned along the x-axis, and we're considering the field along the axial line, then at r = 0, the field should be zero because the electric fields from both charges would cancel each other out due to symmetry.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nElectric field due to positive charge at midpoint: points towards negative charge.\n\nElectric field due to negative charge at midpoint: points towards positive charge.\n\nSo, both fields point in the same direction, from positive to negative.\n\nTherefore, they should add up, not cancel.\n\nThus, the total electric field should be twice the electric field due to one charge.\n\nTherefore, E_total = 2 * (k * q / r^2)\n\nWith r = d/2 = 0.01 m\n\nSo, E_total = 2 * (8.99 \u00d7 10^9 * 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9 / (0.01)^2) = 7.192 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the electric field at the midpoint between two equal and opposite charges is different.\n\nLet me consider the general formula for the electric field due to an electric dipole.\n\nThe electric field along the axial line is E_axial = (2 * k * p) / r^3\n\nAnd along the equatorial line, it's E_equatorial = (k * p) / r^3\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with the axial line, and r = 0 is at the center.\n\nHowever, as we've seen, plugging r = 0 into the formula leads to division by zero, which is undefined.\n\nThis suggests that the formula is not valid at r = 0, and we should use another method, such as superposition.\n\nGiven that, the superposition method seems appropriate, leading to E_total = 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the superposition method.\n\nLet me recalculate E due to one charge.\n\nE = k * q / r^2 = (8.99 \u00d7 10^9) * (4.0 \u00d7 10^-9) / (0.01)^2\n\nCalculate numerator: 8.99 * 4.0 = 35.96, and 10^9 * 10^-9 = 1, so 35.96 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\n\nDenominator: (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 m\u00b2\n\nSo, E = 35.96 / 0.0001 = 359,600 V/m\n\nThen, E_total = 2 * 359,600 = 719,200 V/m, which is 7.192 \u00d7 10^5 V/m, approximately 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nBut to ensure there are no mistakes, let's consider the units.\n\nElectric field is in N/C or V/m, and the calculation gives units of V/m, which is correct.\n\nAlso, the magnitude seems reasonable for the given charges and distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance should be considered differently.\n\nWait, the separation distance is 2.0 cm, so r from each charge to the midpoint is 1.0 cm = 0.01 m, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the charges are not point charges, but in this problem, it's specified that they are point charges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a permittivity of free space involved that I missed, but in using Coulomb's constant k, it's already accounted for.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. 7.2 \u00d7 10^5 V/m\n\nHowever, I recall that for an electric dipole, the electric field at the midpoint is actually zero. But that contradicts my calculation.\n\nLet me check a reference or think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps for a dipole, the electric field at the midpoint is zero only if the dipole is aligned along a different axis or under different conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the dipole moment and the angle between the dipole moment and the position vector.\n\nThe general formula for the electric field due to a dipole is:\n\nE = (k * p * (3*(unit vector_r )^2 -1)) / r^3\n\nBut at the midpoint, r = 0, which again leads to division by zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the limit as r approaches zero, the field approaches infinity, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the electric field at the center of the dipole is undefined due to the charges"
