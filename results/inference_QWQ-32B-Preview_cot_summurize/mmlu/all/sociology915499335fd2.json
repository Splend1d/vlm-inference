                    "text": "I'm trying to understand why ethnographic research produces qualitative data. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The findings are amenable to statistical analysis.\n\nWell, ethnography is known for its detailed observations and descriptions, often involving immersion in a culture or social group. It seems like qualitative data, which is non-numerical and descriptive, fits better with ethnography. Statistical analysis typically applies to quantitative data, which is numerical. So, this option doesn't seem right.\n\nB. It is conducted over a period of several years.\n\nDuration might be a characteristic of some ethnographic studies, but that doesn't define why it produces qualitative data. Some ethnographies can be shorter-term, and anyway, the length of the study isn't directly related to the type of data produced. So, this doesn't seem like the best answer.\n\nC. It uncovers rich, detailed accounts from an insider's perspective.\n\nThis sounds very much like what ethnography aims to do. Ethnographers often live among the people they study, participating in their daily lives and observing their behaviors and customs. This leads to deep, nuanced understanding and descriptive data, which is qualitative. This seems like a strong candidate.\n\nD. It compares findings from a number of different cases.\n\nComparing different cases can be part of ethnographic research, but again, this is more about the method of analysis rather than the type of data collected. Qualitative data can be compared, but so can quantitative data. This option doesn't specifically explain why ethnographic research produces qualitative data.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to best capture the essence of ethnographic research and why it produces qualitative data. It's about gaining rich, detailed insights from an insider's viewpoint, which naturally leads to descriptive, non-numerical data.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
