                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. Roslyn has twenty boxes in total. Out of these, thirteen contain pencils, nine contain pens, and three contain neither pens nor pencils. We need to find out how many boxes contain both pens and pencils.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's given:\n\n- Total boxes: 20\n\n- Boxes with pencils: 13\n\n- Boxes with pens: 9\n\n- Boxes with neither: 3\n\nWe need to find the number of boxes that have both pens and pencils.\n\nOne way to approach this is by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps us avoid double-counting when dealing with overlapping sets.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n\\[ |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B| \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( |A \\cup B| \\) is the number of elements in either set A or set B or both.\n\n- \\( |A| \\) is the number of elements in set A.\n\n- \\( |B| \\) is the number of elements in set B.\n\n- \\( |A \\cap B| \\) is the number of elements in both sets A and B.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- Set A is the set of boxes containing pencils.\n\n- Set B is the set of boxes containing pens.\n\nSo,\n\n- \\( |A| = 13 \\)\n\n- \\( |B| = 9 \\)\n\n- \\( |A \\cup B| \\) is the number of boxes containing either pencils or pens or both.\n\nBut we also know that there are three boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils. Therefore, the number of boxes that contain either pencils or pens or both is:\n\n\\[ |A \\cup B| = \\text{Total boxes} - \\text{Boxes with neither} = 20 - 3 = 17 \\]\n\nNow, plugging these values into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n\\[ 17 = 13 + 9 - |A \\cap B| \\]\n\nSolving for \\( |A \\cap B| \\):\n\n\\[ |A \\cap B| = 13 + 9 - 17 = 22 - 17 = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils is 5.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this because 5 is one of the options, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it differently. If there are 13 boxes with pencils and 9 with pens, and 3 with neither, then the overlapping boxes should be calculated to ensure we don't have more boxes than we actually have.\n\nLet's consider the total number of boxes that should have either pencils or pens or both is 17, as calculated earlier.\n\nIf we add the boxes with pencils and pens: 13 + 9 = 22, but this counts the boxes that have both pencils and pens twice. Since there are only 17 boxes that have either or both, the overlap should be 22 - 17 = 5, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use a Venn diagram. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents boxes with pencils, and the other represents boxes with pens.\n\n- The pencils circle has 13 boxes.\n\n- The pens circle has 9 boxes.\n\n- The overlap is what we're trying to find.\n\n- The total number of boxes that have either pencils or pens or both is 17.\n\nSo, if we denote the overlap as x, then:\n\n- Boxes with only pencils: 13 - x\n\n- Boxes with only pens: 9 - x\n\n- Boxes with both: x\n\n- Boxes with neither: 3\n\nThe sum of these should equal the total number of boxes:\n\n\\[ (13 - x) + (9 - x) + x + 3 = 20 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ 13 - x + 9 - x + x + 3 = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ 25 - x = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nAgain, we get x = 5, which confirms our previous result.\n\nBut let's look back at the options provided:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 13\n\nD. 139\n\nOption A is 5, which matches our calculation. However, the other options are present, so it's possible that there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider if there's any mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \"Roslyn has twenty boxes. Thirteen of the boxes contain pencils, nine of the boxes contain pens, and three of the boxes contain neither pens nor pencils. How many boxes contain both pens and pencils?\"\n\nEverything seems straightforward. The inclusion-exclusion principle should apply here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach using set theory.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- n(A) = number of boxes with pencils = 13\n\n- n(B) = number of boxes with pens = 9\n\n- n(A \u222a B) = number of boxes with either pencils or pens or both = 20 - 3 = 17\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) = number of boxes with both pencils and pens = ?\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[ n(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B) \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ 17 = 13 + 9 - n(A \u2229 B) \\]\n\nSolving for n(A \u2229 B):\n\n\\[ n(A \u2229 B) = 13 + 9 - 17 = 5 \\]\n\nAgain, we get 5.\n\nWait, but option B is 2, which is different from 5. Maybe there's a mistake in the options, or perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that some boxes only have pencils, some only have pens, some have both, and some have neither.\n\nGiven that, and using the numbers provided, let's see:\n\nTotal boxes: 20\n\nBoxes with neither: 3\n\nBoxes with either pencils, pens, or both: 20 - 3 = 17\n\nBoxes with only pencils: 13 - x\n\nBoxes with only pens: 9 - x\n\nBoxes with both: x\n\nTotal: (13 - x) + (9 - x) + x + 3 = 20\n\nSimplifying: 13 - x + 9 - x + x + 3 = 20\n\nWhich simplifies to: 25 - x = 20\n\nTherefore, x = 5\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick us into thinking that the total number of boxes with pencils and pens is simply 13 + 9 = 22, but since there are only 20 boxes, the overlap must be 22 - 20 = 2.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't account for the boxes with neither.\n\nWait, if there are three boxes with neither, then the number of boxes with either pencils or pens or both is 17, as previously determined.\n\nSo, if we consider only the boxes with pencils and pens, ignoring the neither boxes, then the total would be 13 + 9 - x = 17\n\nSolving for x: 22 - x = 17 => x = 5\n\nThis again confirms that the overlap is 5.\n\nHowever, if someone mistakenly ignores the neither boxes and just considers the boxes with pencils and pens, they might think:\n\nBoxes with pencils: 13\n\nBoxes with pens: 9\n\nTotal boxes: 20\n\nOverlap: 13 + 9 - 20 = 2\n\nBut this is incorrect because the total number of boxes that have either pencils or pens or both is actually 17, not 20.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is 13 + 9 - x = 17 => x = 5\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem is that the options include 5 and 2, and 2 might be a result of the mistaken approach I just described.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nSuppose we have 20 boxes.\n\n- 13 contain pencils.\n\n- 9 contain pens.\n\n- 3 contain neither.\n\nWe need to find how many contain both.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of probabilities or use logical reasoning.\n\nIf 13 boxes contain pencils, and 9 contain pens, and 3 contain neither, then the boxes that contain either pencils or pens or both are 17.\n\nNow, if we add the boxes with pencils and pens: 13 + 9 = 22, but since there are only 17 boxes that have either or both, the overlap must be 22 - 17 = 5.\n\nThis is consistent with our previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a table can help visualize this.\n\nLet's create a table:\n\n|                | Contains pens | Does not contain pens | Total |\n\n|----------------|---------------|-----------------------|-------|\n\n| Contains pencils| x             | 13 - x                | 13    |\n\n| Does not contain pencils | 9 - x           | 3                 | 12 - x   |\n\n| Total          | 9             | 11                  | 20    |\n\nWait, in this table:\n\n- The cell for contains pencils and contains pens is x.\n\n- The cell for contains pencils and does not contain pens is 13 - x.\n\n- The cell for does not contain pencils but contains pens is 9 - x.\n\n- The cell for does not contain pencils and does not contain pens is 3.\n\nNow, the total number of boxes that do not contain pencils is 20 - 13 = 7.\n\nBut in the table, it's shown as 12 - x.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me adjust the table.\n\nActually, the total number of boxes that do not contain pencils should be 7, as 20 - 13 = 7.\n\nSo, the cell for does not contain pencils but contains pens should be 9 - x, and the cell for does not contain pencils and does not contain pens is 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of boxes that do not contain pencils is (9 - x) + 3 = 12 - x\n\nBut we know this should be 7, so:\n\n12 - x = 7\n\nTherefore, x = 5\n\nAgain, this confirms that x = 5.\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils is 5.\n\nHence, the correct answer is option A. 5\n\nI think the confusion might arise if one ignores the boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils, leading to an incorrect calculation of the overlap.\n\nBut based on the correct application of the inclusion-exclusion principle and the table method, the answer should be 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
