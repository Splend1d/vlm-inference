                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about international law and domestic law. It's asking whether countries can use their own domestic laws as an excuse to violate their obligations under international law. And then it gives four options:\n\nA. Domestic law always prevails over international law.\n\nB. Only customary international law prevails over domestic law.\n\nC. Obligations under international law prevail over domestic law.\n\nD. Constitutional obligations always prevail over obligations under international law.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky for me because I'm not super familiar with international law, but I'll try to reason through it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between domestic law and international law. Domestic law is the set of laws that apply within a country's own borders, right? Like its constitution, statutes, and regulations. International law, on the other hand, is the set of rules that govern relationships between countries.\n\nSo, the question is, when a country has obligations under international law, can it just say, \"Well, our own domestic law says something different, so we're going to do that instead\"?\n\nI think the general principle is that international law should take precedence over domestic law in cases where there's a conflict, especially when the country has voluntarily entered into international agreements or recognized certain international norms.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. Domestic law always prevails over international law.\n\nThis seems unlikely. If domestic law always prevailed, then countries could just ignore their international obligations by passing laws to the contrary. That wouldn't make much sense, because international law is meant to bind countries even if their domestic laws say something different.\n\nB. Only customary international law prevails over domestic law.\n\nCustomary international law is made up of practices that states follow out of a sense of legal obligation. So, if this option is correct, it would mean that only habits or customs that have become legally binding in international law can override a country's domestic law.\n\nThis seems a bit limited. It might be that both treaty law and customary law have authority over domestic law, not just customary law.\n\nC. Obligations under international law prevail over domestic law.\n\nThis sounds more plausible. It suggests that once a country has obligations under international law, those obligations take precedence over its domestic law. This seems in line with the idea that international law binds states regardless of their internal legal systems.\n\nD. Constitutional obligations always prevail over obligations under international law.\n\nThis seems counterintuitive. If a country's constitution says something that contradicts its international obligations, does the constitution always win?\n\nIn some countries, the constitution might incorporate international law, but to say that constitutional obligations always prevail seems too broad. It would allow countries to opt out of international law simply by having conflicting provisions in their constitutions.\n\nConsidering these options, C seems the most reasonable: obligations under international law prevail over domestic law.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider some real-world examples or principles.\n\nFor instance, there's the principle of \"pacta sunt servanda,\" which is a Latin term meaning \"agreements must be kept.\" It's a fundamental principle in international law that states are bound to\u5c65\u884c their treaty obligations in good faith.\n\nAlso, when a country ratifies an international treaty, it's agreeing to be bound by that treaty's provisions. In most legal systems, this means that the treaty should have legal effect within the country, often requiring that domestic laws be aligned with the treaty.\n\nIn some countries, international treaties have direct effect in domestic law, meaning that they can be applied by courts without the need for additional legislation. In other countries, treaties need to be incorporated into domestic law through specific legislation.\n\nBut in either case, the international obligation is supposed to be fulfilled, which implies that international law prevails over any conflicting domestic law.\n\nMoreover, there's the concept of \"monism\" and \"dualism\" in international law. Monist states view international and domestic law as a single legal system, so international law can be applied directly. Dualist states require that international law be translated into domestic law through legislation.\n\nHowever, even in dualist systems, when a country has ratified an international treaty and incorporated it into domestic law, the international obligation should take precedence.\n\nThere might be exceptions or complexities, but based on the general principles, it seems that international law obligations prevail over domestic law.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C: obligations under international law prevail over domestic law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
