                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. So, there's a supermarket that just reopened after a six-month renovation. The renovations involved repairing, replastering, and repainting the ceiling and walls, done by a painting company. The next day after reopening, the manager notices some plaster fragments on the floor, apparently fallen from a 10-square-foot area of the ceiling. The manager quickly posts caution signs in that area, saying \"Caution: Falling Plaster,\" and calls the painting company to send a repairman to fix the problem.\n\nLater that afternoon, a shopper is in the supermarket, moving quickly to get some canned goods in the area where the caution signs are posted. Just as she reaches for the items, a section of the ceiling falls and injures her seriously.\n\nNow, the question is: If the shopper asserts a claim against the supermarket, which option is most likely correct?\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Prevail, because the supermarket failed to take adequate precautions to ensure the safety of its patrons against such an unreasonable risk of harm.\n\nB. Prevail, because the supermarket is vicariously liable for the negligence of its independent contractor in the performance of a non-delegable duty.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the injury was the fault of the painting company.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the supermarket posted signs warning customers of the risk of harm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal principles involved here, particularly regarding premises liability. Supermarkets owe a duty of care to their patrons to maintain a safe environment. If there are hazards, they need to take reasonable steps to protect shoppers from those hazards.\n\nIn this case, the manager noticed plaster falling and immediately posted caution signs, which seems like a reasonable initial response. They also called the painting company to send a repairman, which suggests they were addressing the issue.\n\nHowever, despite these precautions, the shopper was still injured. So, the question is whether the supermarket did enough to fulfill their duty of care.\n\nOption A suggests that the supermarket failed to take adequate precautions, implying that posting signs wasn't enough. Maybe they should have closed off the area entirely or taken more proactive measures to prevent access to that section.\n\nOption B mentions vicarious liability for the independent contractor. Vicarious liability means that one party is held liable for the actions of another party. In this case, it's suggesting that the supermarket could be held liable for the painting company's negligence, perhaps because the painting company was performing a non-delegable duty.\n\nNon-delegable duties are duties that the supermarket cannot delegate to someone else; they remain responsible for ensuring those duties are properly carried out. Examples might include ensuring the safety of the premises.\n\nOption C argues that the shopper won't prevail because the injury was the fault of the painting company. This suggests that the painting company is at fault for the poor quality of their work, leading to the plaster falling, and therefore the supermarket shouldn't be held liable.\n\nOption D says the shopper won't prevail because the supermarket posted warning signs, implying that they warned customers of the danger, so they've fulfilled their duty of care.\n\nNow, considering these options, I need to think about what the law likely requires in this situation.\n\nFirst, the supermarket has a duty to keep the premises safe for shoppers. They knew about the falling plaster and took some steps to address it, like posting caution signs and calling for a repairman.\n\nBut was that enough? Did they do everything reasonably possible to protect shoppers from the hazard?\n\nPerhaps they should have cordoned off the area, prevented access to that section entirely, rather than just posting signs. Signs are a start, but if the hazard is significant, maybe more was required.\n\nOn the other hand, the shopper was moving quickly and may not have noticed the signs, or perhaps didn't have time to react before the ceiling fell.\n\nRegarding vicarious liability, it's possible that the supermarket could be held liable for the painting company's negligence if the painting company was performing a non-delegable duty.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, maintaining the structural integrity of the premises is a non-delegable duty for the property owner or manager. This means that even if they hire someone else to do the work, they remain ultimately responsible for ensuring it's done properly.\n\nSo, in that case, the supermarket might be liable for the painting company's negligence in causing the plaster to fall.\n\nOption C suggests that the fault lies with the painting company, so the shopper shouldn't prevail against the supermarket. But as per the non-delegable duty concept, the supermarket might still be liable.\n\nOption D argues that the warning signs were sufficient, so the supermarket fulfilled their duty. However, perhaps warning signs aren't enough when there's an imminent danger like falling plaster. Maybe they should have taken more proactive measures to prevent access to that area.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option A is the most likely correct answer. The supermarket may have failed to take adequate precautions to ensure the safety of its patrons against an unreasonable risk of harm. Posting signs might not have been sufficient; they perhaps should have closed off the area or taken other measures to prevent shoppers from being in harm's way.\n\nOption B could also be plausible, given the concept of non-delegable duties, but option A seems more directly related to the supermarket's own actions or lack thereof.\n\nOption C might not hold because of the non-delegable duty, and option D might not be sufficient because warning signs may not always be enough to discharge the duty of care.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option A: the shopper probably will prevail because the supermarket failed to take adequate precautions to ensure the safety of its patrons against such an unreasonable risk of harm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
