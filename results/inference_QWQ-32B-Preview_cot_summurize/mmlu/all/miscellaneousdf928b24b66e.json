I think I know what minerals are, but maybe I should refresh my memory.\n\nSo, minerals are naturally occurring substances that are homogeneous and have a specific chemical composition and crystal structure. They are inorganic compounds, meaning they are not derived from living organisms.\n\nQuartz is definitely a mineral. It's silicon dioxide, SiO2, and it's one of the most common minerals on Earth. It forms in various types of rocks and has many uses.\n\nDiamond is also a mineral. It's made of carbon, like graphite, but its atomic structure makes it much harder. Diamonds form under high pressure and temperature deep within the Earth.\n\nCalcite is another mineral. It's calcium carbonate, CaCO3, and it's a common constituent of sedimentary rocks like limestone.\n\nNow, Lithium. Hmm, lithium is a chemical element, symbol Li, atomic number 3. It's a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group. But is it considered a mineral?\n\nWait a minute, elements themselves aren't minerals; minerals are compounds with a specific composition. So, lithium, being an element, can't be a mineral. But I've heard of lithium minerals, like spodumene and petalite, which contain lithium.\n\nMaybe I'm confusing things. Perhaps lithium occurs in mineral form, but lithium itself is an element, not a mineral.\n\nLet me check the definitions again. Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic solids with a definite chemical composition and ordered atomic structure. Elements can be minerals if they meet these criteria. For example, native gold and silver are considered minerals.\n\nSo, is lithium found in its native form? I don't think so. Lithium is highly reactive and would likely form compounds readily. It's not commonly found in its free state in nature.\n\nTherefore, while compounds containing lithium are minerals, elemental lithium itself is not typically considered a mineral because it's not stable in nature on its own.\n\nSo, among the options given, Quartz, Diamond, and Calcite are all minerals, while Lithium, being an element that doesn't occur naturally in its elemental form, is not a mineral.\n\nI think the answer is B. Lithium.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
