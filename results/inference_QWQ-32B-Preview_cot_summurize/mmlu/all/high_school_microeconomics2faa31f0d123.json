                    "text": "So I've got this problem about Jason who cleans swimming pools, and it's in a perfectly competitive market. He's a profit maximizer, and he can charge $10 per pool. He cleans 9 pools per day, with total variable costs of $80 and total fixed costs of $20. I need to figure out what's true among the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers, meaning they have to accept the market price. Here, the market price is $10 per pool. Jason wants to maximize profit, which is total revenue minus total costs.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total revenue (TR). TR is price per pool times the number of pools cleaned per day.\n\nTR = P * Q = $10 * 9 = $90\n\nNext, total costs (TC) are the sum of total fixed costs (TFC) and total variable costs (TVC).\n\nTC = TFC + TVC = $20 + $80 = $100\n\nNow, profit (\u03c0) is TR minus TC.\n\n\u03c0 = TR - TC = $90 - $100 = -$10\n\nSo, Jason is making a loss of $10 per day.\n\nNow, the question is whether he should continue operating or shut down in the short run.\n\nIn the short run, a firm should continue operating as long as the revenue covers the variable costs. If the revenue is less than the variable costs, it's better to shut down to minimize losses.\n\nSo, let's check if TR is greater than TVC.\n\nTR = $90\n\nTVC = $80\n\nSince $90 > $80, Jason should continue operating in the short run.\n\nMoreover, by operating, his loss is $10 (as calculated above). If he shuts down, he would still have to pay the fixed costs of $20, and his variable costs would be $0. So, his loss would be equal to the fixed costs, which is $20.\n\nTherefore, by continuing to operate, he incurs a smaller loss of $10 compared to $20 if he shuts down.\n\nSo, the correct choice is that Jason should clean 9 pools per day, incurring economic losses of $10.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $20.\n\nB. Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $10.\n\nC. Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $20.\n\nD. Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10.\n\nOption D seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nFirst, should he shut down or continue operating?\n\nSince TR > TVC ($90 > $80), he should continue operating.\n\nIf he continues, his loss is $10.\n\nIf he shuts down, his loss is $20 (just the fixed costs).\n\nTherefore, continuing operation minimizes his losses.\n\nHence, option D is correct: Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
