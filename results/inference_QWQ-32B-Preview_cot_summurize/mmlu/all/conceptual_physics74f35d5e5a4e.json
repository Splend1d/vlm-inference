                    "text": "Let's see what the options are for the principal source of Earth's internal energy. We have tidal friction, gravitational pressure, radioactivity, and geothermal heat. Hmm, I need to think about which one is the main driver inside the Earth that keeps it warm and active.\n\nFirst, tidal friction is something that affects the Earth's rotation and causes tides, but I'm not sure if it's a major source of internal energy. Gravitational pressure might be related to how gravity compresses the Earth's core, but I think radioactivity is a big player in generating heat inside the Earth. And geothermal heat is basically the heat from the Earth's interior, but that's more of an effect rather than a source, right?\n\nLet me recall what I learned in geology class. The Earth's internal energy comes from several sources, but the main one is radioactivity. There are radioactive isotopes like uranium, thorium, and potassium in the Earth's mantle and core that decay over time, releasing heat. This heat is what drives plate tectonics, volcanoes, and other geological activities.\n\nTidal friction does generate some heat, but it's relatively minor compared to radioactivity. Gravitational pressure certainly plays a role in the Earth's internal structure, but I don't think it's the primary source of energy. And geothermal heat is just the heat that's already there from when the Earth formed, but that would have dissipated over billions of years without another source to keep it going.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C, radioactivity. What do you think?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
