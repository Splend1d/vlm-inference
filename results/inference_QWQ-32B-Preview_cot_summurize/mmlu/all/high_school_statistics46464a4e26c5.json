                    "text": "Let's see which one of these options is a binomial random variable. I need to recall what a binomial random variable is. It's a type of discrete random variable that counts the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes: success or failure, and the probability of success is constant across trials.\n\nOption A: The number of tosses before a \"5\" appears when tossing a fair die. This seems like a geometric distribution because it's about the number of trials until the first success, not a fixed number of trials. So, probably not binomial.\n\nOption B: The number of points a hockey team receives in 10 games, where two points are awarded for wins, one point for ties, and no points for losses. This doesn't sound binomial because the outcome isn't just success or failure. There are three possible outcomes for each game: win, tie, or lose, which lead to different point assignments. Binomial variables require only two outcomes per trial.\n\nOption C: The number of hearts out of five cards randomly drawn from a deck of 52 cards, without replacement. This seems like it could be binomial because each card is either a heart or not a heart. However, since it's without replacement, the probability changes with each draw. In binomial distributions, the probability must remain constant across trials. So, this might not be binomial.\n\nOption D: The number of motorists not wearing seat belts in a random sample of five drivers. This seems like it could be binomial. Each driver either is or isn't wearing a seat belt, which are two outcomes. If we assume that the sample is random and that the probability of a driver not wearing a seat belt is constant across the sample, then this could be binomial.\n\nWait a minute, in option C, since the sampling is without replacement, the trials aren't independent, and the probability changes with each draw. That violates the independence and constant probability requirements for a binomial distribution. So, it's not binomial.\n\nIn option D, if the sample size is small relative to the population, the probability might be considered approximately constant, making it close to a binomial scenario. But strictly speaking, if the population is finite and we're sampling without replacement, it's a hypergeometric distribution, not binomial.\n\nHowever, perhaps the question assumes that the sample size is small relative to the population, so the probability doesn't change much, and it can be approximated as binomial.\n\nComparing options C and D, option D seems more likely to be considered binomial, especially if the population is large.\n\nBut let's think again. Option A is geometric, option B has more than two outcomes, option C is hypergeometric due to without replacement, and option D could be binomial if we assume a large population.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is probably D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
