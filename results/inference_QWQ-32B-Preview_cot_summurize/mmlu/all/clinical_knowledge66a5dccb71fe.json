                    "text": "So I have this problem here: a person is prescribed Ropinirole 1.5 mg divided into three doses, and I need to find out how many micrograms each dose is. The options are A. 5, B. 50, C. 0.5, and D. 500. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked.\n\nI know that 1 mg is equal to 1000 micrograms. So, if the total prescription is 1.5 mg, that would be 1.5 times 1000 micrograms, which is 1500 micrograms. Now, this total amount is to be divided into three doses. So, to find out each dose, I should divide 1500 micrograms by 3.\n\nLet me do the math: 1500 divided by 3 is 500. So, each dose is 500 micrograms. Looking back at the options, D. 500 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something. The prescription is 1.5 mg total, and it's divided into three doses. Yes, each dose would be 1.5 mg divided by 3, which is 0.5 mg per dose. Now, converting 0.5 mg to micrograms: since 1 mg is 1000 micrograms, 0.5 mg would be 500 micrograms. So, again, 500 micrograms per dose.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of micrograms from the start. 1.5 mg is 1500 micrograms, divided by 3 doses, which is 500 micrograms per dose. Either way, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI should make sure that I didn't misread the units or make a calculation error. The question asks for each dose in micrograms, and I've calculated it to be 500 micrograms. The options provided are A. 5, B. 50, C. 0.5, and D. 500. So, D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the question. \"Ropinirole 1.5 mg divided into three doses\" \u2013 this clearly means that the total daily dose or the total prescription is 1.5 mg, and it's to be taken in three separate doses. So, dividing the total by three gives the amount per dose.\n\nI don't think there's any ambiguity here. The calculation is straightforward. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is D. 500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
