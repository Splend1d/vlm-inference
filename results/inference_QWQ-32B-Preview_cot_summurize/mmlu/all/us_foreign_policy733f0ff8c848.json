Receipt of sensitive nuclear assistance\n\nB. Wealth/GDP\n\nC. Rivalry with a nuclear state\n\nD. Regime type\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these options means in the context of nuclear proliferation.\n\nOption A: Receipt of sensitive nuclear assistance. This probably refers to a country getting help from another\u56fd\u5bb6 in developing nuclear weapons, maybe through technology transfer, training, or even directly providing nuclear materials. It makes sense that if a country gets such assistance, it's more likely to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nOption B: Wealth/GDP. This is about the economic strength of a country. A higher GDP might mean a country has more resources to invest in a nuclear program. So, wealth could be a factor in whether a country can afford to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nOption C: Rivalry with a nuclear state. If a country is in a rivalry with a nuclear-armed opponent, it might feel the need to develop its own nuclear weapons for deterrence or as a means to level the playing field.\n\nOption D: Regime type. This refers to the type of government a country has, such as democratic, authoritarian, monarchy, etc. Maybe certain types of regimes are more likely to pursue nuclear weapons than others.\n\nNow, I need to think about which one of these isn't a good predictor. That means, which factor doesn't necessarily correlate with a country developing nuclear weapons.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Receipt of sensitive nuclear assistance: This seems like a strong predictor. If a country gets direct help in developing nuclear weapons, it's probably more likely to succeed in getting them. So, this is likely a good predictor.\n\nB. Wealth/GDP: While having more wealth might help, it's not always necessary. Some relatively poor countries have developed nuclear weapons, like North Korea. So, maybe wealth isn't as big a predictor as others.\n\nC. Rivalry with a nuclear state: This seems like a strong motivator. If a country feels threatened by a nuclear-armed rival, it might prioritize developing its own nuclear weapons for deterrence. So, this is likely a good predictor.\n\nD. Regime type: This is interesting. Maybe some types of regimes are more likely to pursue nuclear weapons due to political reasons. For example, authoritarian regimes might be more willing to allocate resources to such programs without public opposition. Or perhaps democratic regimes are more risk-averse and less likely to pursue nuclear weapons. However, there are exceptions. For instance, both democratic and authoritarian countries have developed nuclear weapons.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Option B, Wealth/GDP, might not be as good a predictor as the others. While wealth can help, it's not a decisive factor. Countries with lower GDPs have still managed to develop nuclear weapons, sometimes by prioritizing their limited resources on nuclear programs.\n\nAdditionally, factors like technological capability, political will, and security threats might be more important than just wealth. So, perhaps Wealth/GDP isn't the best predictor compared to receiving nuclear assistance, being in a rivalry with a nuclear state, or the type of regime.\n\nTherefore, I would say that Wealth/GDP is NOT a good predictor of which states will get nuclear weapons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
