                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Vale, who's a partner in Ball Partnership. I need to figure out how much gross income from Ball Vale should include in her year 1 adjusted gross income. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Vale owns 50% of Ball Partnership. On January 2 of year 1, her tax basis in Ball was $60,000. During the year, Ball made a $10,000 nonliquidating cash distribution to each partner on December 31, year 1. Also, Ball's income tax return reported tax-exempt interest income of $80,000 and dividend income of $12,000 for year 1.\n\nOkay, so I need to find out Vale's share of the partnership's income that she should include in her adjusted gross income (AGI).\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a partnership, the partners include their share of the partnership's income, deductions, and credits on their individual tax returns. The partnership's income is allocated to the partners based on their profit-sharing ratios, which in this case is 50% for Vale.\n\nNow, the partnership's income consists of tax-exempt interest income and dividend income. Tax-exempt interest income is exactly what it sounds like: income that is not subject to federal income tax. Dividend income, on the other hand, is generally taxable.\n\nSo, in this case, the tax-exempt interest income is $80,000, and dividend income is $12,000. Since Vale owns 50%, her share of the tax-exempt interest would be $40,000 ($80,000 * 50%), and her share of the dividend income would be $6,000 ($12,000 * 50%).\n\nNow, tax-exempt interest is not included in AGI; it's excluded from income for tax purposes. So, Vale doesn't need to include her $40,000 share of tax-exempt interest in her AGI. However, dividend income is taxable and should be included in AGI.\n\nTherefore, Vale should include $6,000 from dividends in her AGI.\n\nBut wait, there's also a distribution of $10,000 that Ball made to each partner. Since it's a nonliquidating distribution, it's essentially a return of capital, to the extent of the partner's basis, or possibly some earnings.\n\nI need to consider how this distribution affects Vale's AGI.\n\nFirst, let's see what her basis was before the distribution. On January 2, year 1, her basis was $60,000. During the year, she received $6,000 from dividends, which would increase her basis. So, her basis before the distribution would be $60,000 + $6,000 = $66,000.\n\nNow, she receives a $10,000 distribution. To the extent that the distribution is less than or equal to her basis, it's a return of capital and reduces her basis. So, $10,000 is less than $66,000, so her basis after the distribution would be $66,000 - $10,000 = $56,000.\n\nImportantly, nonliquidating distributions in excess of basis would be taxable as gain, but in this case, the distribution is less than her basis, so no gain is recognized.\n\nTherefore, the $10,000 distribution is not included in her AGI; it's just a reduction in her basis.\n\nSo, going back, her share of the partnership's income to include in AGI is only the dividend income, which is $6,000.\n\nBut looking back at the options, $6,000 is option A. However, I feel like there might be more to this.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the effect of the distribution on her basis and see if there's any other income to consider.\n\nLet me check the regulations or see if there's something I'm missing.\n\nAccording to partnership tax rules, a partner's inside basis (basis in the partnership) is adjusted for the partner's share of partnership income, deductions, and distributions.\n\nIn this case, Vale's inside basis started at $60,000, added her share of income ($6,000 from dividends), and then reduced by the distribution of $10,000, resulting in a ending basis of $56,000.\n\nNow, regarding the income to include in AGI, it's only the taxable income from the partnership, which is the dividend income. The tax-exempt interest is excluded, and the distribution is a return of capital.\n\nBut perhaps there's something about the treatment of the distribution that I need to consider.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's something about the outside basis, which is the basis in the partnership interest, separate from the inside basis.\n\nWait, no, in partnership tax, there's only one basis: the outside basis, which represents the partner's capital account.\n\nLet me try to recall the sequence of events:\n\n1. Starting basis: $60,000\n\n2. Add share of income: $6,000 (dividends)\n\n3. New basis before distribution: $66,000\n\n4. Distribution: $10,000\n\n5. Ending basis: $56,000\n\nSince the distribution is less than the basis, no gain is recognized. The distribution is simply a return of capital, reducing the basis.\n\nTherefore, the only income from the partnership that Vale includes in her AGI is her share of the taxable income, which is the dividend income of $6,000.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A is $6,000, but maybe there's more income that should be included.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the treatment of tax-exempt interest.\n\nEven though it's tax-exempt at the partnership level, does it pass through to the partner?\n\nActually, tax-exempt interest earned by a partnership is tax-exempt to the partners as well. So, Vale doesn't need to include her share of the tax-exempt interest in her AGI.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's something about the partnership making a distribution that affects the income allocation.\n\nBut according to the regulations, distributions don't directly affect the income allocation; they affect the basis.\n\nUnless there's a specific rule I'm not recalling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's something about the partnership's tax-exempt income affecting the distribution.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the concept of qualified noneconomic income.\n\nPartnerships have something called qualified noneconomic income, which includes tax-exempt income, and it can affect the partner's basis and the treatment of distributions.\n\nLet me see:\n\nPartnership's qualified noneconomic income (QNEI) includes tax-exempt income, among other things.\n\nIn this case, the tax-exempt interest of $80,000 would be QNEI.\n\nPartners must allocate their share of QNEI to basis, but it doesn't increase AGI.\n\nHowever, when there are distributions, QNEI can affect the partner's basis and potentially the character of gain or loss on a later sale of the partnership interest.\n\nBut in this problem, since it's a nonliquidating distribution, and Vale is still a partner, I don't think there's any gain or loss recognized yet.\n\nTherefore, her share of QNEI is $40,000, which affects her basis, but not her AGI.\n\nSo, her basis would be:\n\nStarting basis: $60,000\n\nAdd share of taxable income: $6,000 (dividends)\n\nAdd share of QNEI: $40,000 (tax-exempt interest)\n\nTotal basis before distribution: $106,000\n\nLess distribution: $10,000\n\nEnding basis: $96,000\n\nWait a minute, this is different from what I calculated earlier.\n\nI think I might have misremembered the treatment of QNEI.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nAccording to partnership tax rules, a partner's basis is increased by the partner's share of partnership ordinary income, capital gain net income, and separately stated items that increase basis, and decreased by distributions of money or property.\n\nQualified noneconomic income (QNEI), which includes tax-exempt income, is added to the partner's basis, but it's not included in the partner's income.\n\nSo, in this case, Vale's basis would be:\n\nStarting basis: $60,000\n\nAdd share of ordinary income: $6,000 (dividends)\n\nAdd share of QNEI: $40,000 (tax-exempt interest)\n\nTotal basis before distribution: $106,000\n\nLess distribution: $10,000\n\nEnding basis: $96,000\n\nNow, the income included in Vale's AGI is only her share of the taxable income, which is the dividends of $6,000.\n\nThe tax-exempt interest is added to basis but not included in income.\n\nThe distribution reduces basis but doesn't result in any income or loss, since it's less than the basis.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $6,000.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A is $6,000, but perhaps there's more to it.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the treatment of the distribution in more detail.\n\nIn some cases, distributions can be partially or fully taxable, but in this case, since it's a nonliquidating distribution and it's less than the basis, it's entirely a return of capital, reducing basis.\n\nTherefore, no income is recognized from the distribution.\n\nThus, the only income from Ball that Vale should include in her AGI is the $6,000 from dividends.\n\nBut perhaps there's something about the partnership's tax-exempt income that affects the distribution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pass-through of the tax-exempt income to the partner, which then affects the partner's AGI.\n\nBut no, tax-exempt income remains tax-exempt when passed through to the partner.\n\nIt increases the partner's basis but is not included in income.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is $6,000, which is option A.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or in my understanding.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nSuppose that the partnership has tax-exempt income and dividend income.\n\nThe partnership itself doesn't pay tax on the tax-exempt income, but it does on the dividend income, depending on the circumstances.\n\nWait, no, dividends are generally taxable to the partnership.\n\nWait, actually, partnerships don't pay tax; they pass through the income to the partners.\n\nSo, the partnership reports the income, and the partners include their shares in their incomes.\n\nNow, tax-exempt interest is tax-exempt to the partners, and dividends are taxable.\n\nSo, in this case, Vale should only include her share of the dividends in her AGI, which is $6,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $6,000.\n\nBut perhaps there's a twist here that I'm missing.\n\nLet me read the question again:\n\n\"Vale is a 50% partner in Ball Partnership. Vale's tax basis in Ball on January 2 year 1 was $60,000. Ball did not have unrealized receivables, appreciated inventory, or properties that had been contributed by its partners. On December 31, year 1, Ball made a $10,000 nonliquidating cash distribution to each partner. The Ball Partnership income tax return reported the following items for year 1: Tax-exempt interest income $80,000 Dividend income $12,000 What total amount of gross income from Ball should be included in Vale's year 1 adjusted gross income?\"\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n- 50% partner\n\n- Basis on Jan 2, year 1: $60,000\n\n- No unrealized receivables, appreciated inventory, or contributed properties\n\n- $10,000 nonliquidating distribution on Dec 31, year 1\n\n- Partnership's income: $80,000 tax-exempt interest and $12,000 dividends\n\nNow, perhaps I need to consider if there's any built-in gain or something, but the problem says there were no unrealized receivables, appreciated inventory, or contributed properties, so presumably, no built-in gain or loss.\n\nTherefore, the only income to consider is the income earned during the year, which is tax-exempt interest and dividends.\n\nVale's share of the tax-exempt interest is $40,000, which increases her basis but isn't included in income.\n\nHer share of the dividends is $6,000, which is included in her AGI.\n\nThe distribution of $10,000 is a return of capital, reducing her basis, but not affecting her income.\n\nTherefore, the total gross income from Ball to include in Vale's AGI is $6,000.\n\nBut maybe there's a miscalculation in the basis.\n\nLet's recalculate the basis:\n\nStarting basis: $60,000\n\nAdd share of ordinary income: $6,000 (dividends)\n\nAdd share of QNEI: $40,000 (tax-exempt interest)\n\nTotal basis before distribution: $106,000\n\nLess distribution: $10,000\n\nEnding basis: $96,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for total gross income, which might include both the tax-exempt interest and the dividends.\n\nBut no, gross income for AGI purposes generally includes only taxable income, so tax-exempt interest is excluded.\n\nTherefore, only the $6,000 in dividends should be included.\n\nBut again, looking at the options, $6,000 is option A, but maybe the answer is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's something about the distribution being a return of capital that affects the income.\n\nBut no, a nonliquidating distribution up to the basis is a return of capital and doesn't generate income.\n\nTherefore, I think $6,000 is the correct answer.\n\nUnless there's a mistake in the way I'm approaching this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider if the partnership has any deductions or other items.\n\nBut the problem only mentions tax-exempt interest and dividend income.\n\nWait, perhaps the partnership has to pay tax on the dividend income, and the partner has to include their share of that income.\n\nBut partnerships don't pay tax; they pass through the income to the partners.\n\nSo, Vale should include her share of the taxable income, which is the dividends.\n\nTherefore, $6,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's something about the partnership's tax-exempt income affecting the partner's income.\n\nBut no, tax-exempt income remains tax-exempt when passed through.\n\nTherefore, I think $6,000 is the correct answer.\n\nPerhaps the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
