                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to figure out which of these options is considered part of the required supplementary information for general purpose external financial reporting of a local government. The options are:\n\nA. Fund financial statements.\n\nB. Combining nonmajor fund statement.\n\nC. Notes to the financial statements.\n\nD. Management's discussion and analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"required supplementary information\" means in the context of governmental financial reporting. I know that governmental financial reports have several components, including the government-wide financial statements, fund financial statements, and supplementary information.\n\nI recall that the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) sets the standards for state and local governmental financial accounting and reporting. So, I should refer to GASB statements to get a clear understanding.\n\nFrom what I remember, the required supplementary information (RSI) is an integral part of the financial statements and provides additional information that is necessary for users to understand the financial position and operations of the government.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A is \"Fund financial statements.\" I know that fund financial statements are a major component of governmental financial reports. They present financial data for governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds. These are not considered supplementary information; they are core financial statements.\n\nOption B is \"Combining nonmajor fund statement.\" This might be a statement that combines the financial activity of nonmajor funds into a single statement. I'm not entirely sure about this term, but I think it's still part of the fund financial statements, which are primary financial statements, not supplementary information.\n\nOption C is \"Notes to the financial statements.\" Notes are indeed an essential part of the financial statements. They provide detailed explanations and additional information about the numbers presented in the financial statements. I believe notes are considered an integral part of the financial statements, not supplementary information.\n\nOption D is \"Management's discussion and analysis.\" This is where the management of the government provides an analysis of the financial statements, discusses the government's financial health, and may include information about future plans and challenges. This sounds a lot like what I remember as required supplementary information.\n\nWait a minute, I think I need to double-check this. Maybe I should look up GASB Statement No. 34, which is the comprehensive revision of state and local governmental financial reporting model.\n\nAccording to GASB Statement No. 34, the financial statements include:\n\n- Government-wide financial statements: government-wide statement of net position and government-wide statement of activities.\n\n- Fund financial statements: statement of net position for each fund and statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund net position.\n\n- Notes to the financial statements.\n\nThen, there is required supplementary information, which includes:\n\n- Management's discussion and analysis (MD&A).\n\n- Required supplementary information also may include statistical tables, capital assets and long-term liabilities tables, etc.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that management's discussion and analysis is indeed part of the required supplementary information.\n\nLet me make sure about the other options again.\n\nFund financial statements are definitely not supplementary; they are core financial statements.\n\nCombining nonmajor fund statement, if it's a statement that combines the activity of nonmajor funds, it would still be part of the fund financial statements, which are primary.\n\nNotes to the financial statements are integral to the financial statements, not supplementary.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Management's discussion and analysis.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
