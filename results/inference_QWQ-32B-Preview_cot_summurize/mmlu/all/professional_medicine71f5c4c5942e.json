                    "text": "I've got this case here about a 52-year-old woman who comes in with greenish discharge from her left nipple. No history of trauma or fever, not on oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, and her last pregnancy was about 20 years ago. On physical exam, everything else is normal except for this green discharge. I need to figure out the most likely cause among the options given: breast cancer, fibrocystic disease, mammary duct ectasia, or pituitary adenoma.\n\nFirst, I should think about what nipple discharge could indicate. Nipple discharge can be physiological or pathological. Physiological discharge can occur in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, but she's not in that situation. Sometimes, discharge can occur in non-lactating women due to hormonal fluctuations, but she's not on contraceptives or hormone replacement, so that might not be the case here.\n\nNow, the discharge is greenish, which seems unusual. Color can give some clues. For instance, bloody discharge can be concerning for ductal issues, while clear or milky discharge might suggest different etiologies.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A is breast cancer. Nipple discharge can be a symptom of breast cancer, but it's more commonly associated with bloody or serous discharge. Green discharge seems less typical for cancer, but I shouldn't rule it out entirely.\n\nOption B is fibrocystic disease. This is a common benign condition characterized by cysts and fibrous tissue in the breast. It can cause lumpy breasts and sometimes nipple discharge, but the discharge is usually clear or whitish, not green.\n\nOption C is mammary duct ectasia. This is another benign condition where the ducts beneath the nipple become widened and inflamed. It's more common in perimenopausal women. Symptoms can include nipple discharge, which might be green or another color due to the inflammatory process.\n\nOption D is pituitary adenoma. Pituitary tumors can sometimes cause hyperprolactinemia, which can lead to galactorrhea\u2014nipple discharge, usually bilateral and milky. However, the discharge is typically not green, and she's not on medications that could cause hyperprolactinemia.\n\nConsidering these points, mammary duct ectasia seems like the most likely cause. It's a benign condition that can cause nipple discharge, especially in perimenopausal women, and the discharge can be green due to the inflammatory process involved.\n\nI should also consider that an infection could cause green discharge due to the presence of pus, but the question mentions that there's no history of trauma or fever, and the physical exam is normal except for the discharge. So, while infection is possible, it might be less likely given these factors.\n\nIn summary, among the options provided, mammary duct ectasia is the most likely cause of this patient's greenish nipple discharge.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nC"
