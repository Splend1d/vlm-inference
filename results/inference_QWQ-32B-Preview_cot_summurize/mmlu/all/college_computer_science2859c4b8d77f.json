                    "text": "Let's see. I have these statements about circuits, and I need to figure out which ones are true. The options are:\n\nI. Combinational circuits may have feedback; sequential circuits do not.\n\nII. Combinational circuits have a \"memoryless\" property; sequential circuits do not.\n\nIII. Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. I and II only\n\nD. II and III only\n\nOkay, first I need to recall the differences between combinational and sequential circuits.\n\nCombinational circuits are those where the output is solely determined by the current inputs, with no consideration of past inputs or states. Things like adders, multiplexers, and decoders are combinational.\n\nSequential circuits, on the other hand, have memory elements, so their output depends on both the current inputs and the history of inputs. Examples include flip-flops, counters, and registers.\n\nNow, let's look at statement I: \"Combinational circuits may have feedback; sequential circuits do not.\"\n\nHmm, feedback in circuits usually implies that some part of the output is fed back into the input. In combinational circuits, feedback can lead to timing issues and is generally avoided because it can cause instability. In sequential circuits, feedback is often present because the memory elements depend on their previous state.\n\nSo, actually, combinational circuits typically do not have feedback, while sequential circuits often do. Therefore, statement I seems false.\n\nMoving on to statement II: \"Combinational circuits have a 'memoryless' property; sequential circuits do not.\"\n\nYes, that sounds right. Combinational circuits don't have memory; their output is only based on the current inputs. Sequential circuits do have memory, as they can store state information.\n\nSo, statement II is true.\n\nNow, statement III: \"Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock.\"\n\nCombinational circuits don't require a clock signal; they operate based on the input signals alone. Sequential circuits, especially synchronous ones, are often controlled by a clock signal to synchronize state changes.\n\nSo, statement III is false.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement I is false.\n\n- Statement II is true.\n\n- Statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
