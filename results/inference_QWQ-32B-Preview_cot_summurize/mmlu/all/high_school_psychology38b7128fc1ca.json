                    "text": "So I've got this question about a free-recall task and a serial position curve. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a serial position curve is. I think it's a graph that shows how likely you are to remember items from a list based on their position in the list. Usually, it has a characteristic shape with better recall for the first few items and the last few items, and poorer recall for the middle items.\n\nSo, in this experiment, the participant is presented with a list of words one at a time in a specific order: house, flower, dog, table, license, water, computer, salad.\n\nThe question is, according to the serial position curve, which word is the participant most likely to forget?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. House\n\nB. Computer\n\nC. Flower\n\nD. License\n\nOkay, so house is the first word, computer is the seventh, flower is the second, and license is the fifth.\n\nFrom what I recall about serial position curves, the first few items benefit from the primacy effect, meaning they're better remembered because they were encountered first and perhaps rehearsed more. The last few items benefit from the recency effect, as they're still fresh in memory.\n\nSo, the words in the middle are likely to be forgotten more often because they don't have the advantage of either the primacy or recency effects.\n\nLooking at the options, house is likely to be well-remembered due to primacy, computer is near the end and might benefit from recency, flower is second which is still early and might have some primacy benefit, and license is fifth, which is in the middle.\n\nSo, fifth is right in the middle of the list. Maybe that's the one most likely to be forgotten.\n\nWait, but the list has eight words. Let's see:\n\n1. House\n\n2. Flower\n\n3. Dog\n\n4. Table\n\n5. License\n\n6. Water\n\n7. Computer\n\n8. Salad\n\nSo, the middle items are dog, table, license, and water.\n\nAmong the options, only license is in the middle, while house has primacy, computer is towards the end and might have recency, and flower is early on.\n\nSo, perhaps license is the most likely to be forgotten.\n\nBut let's think about the serial position curve again. Typically, it shows that the first few and the last few are remembered better, with a dip in the middle.\n\nIn a list of eight items, the middle would be items 4, 5, and maybe 6.\n\nSo, table, license, and water are in the middle.\n\nBut in the options, only license is listed among these.\n\nTherefore, license seems to be the most likely to be forgotten.\n\nWait, but the question is about which word is most likely to be forgotten, and the options include house, computer, flower, and license.\n\nHouse has primacy, computer has recency, flower has some primacy benefit, and license is in the middle.\n\nSo, compared to the others, license is in the least favorable position in terms of memory recall.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. License.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors.\n\nFor example, maybe some words are more memorable because they're more distinctive or meaningful.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the serial position curve, which is more about the position in the list rather than the content of the words.\n\nSo, based on position alone, license being in the middle, should be the most likely to be forgotten.\n\nYes, I think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
