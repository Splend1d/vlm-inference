                    "text": "Let's look at these statements one by one to see which one is false.\n\nStatement A says: \"Like the normal distribution, the t-distributions are symmetric.\" I know that both normal and t-distributions are symmetric around their mean, so this seems correct.\n\nStatement B: \"The t-distributions are lower at the mean and higher at the tails, and so are more spread out than the normal distribution.\" I recall that t-distributions have heavier tails compared to the normal distribution, which means they are indeed lower at the mean and higher at the tails. So, this also seems accurate.\n\nStatement C: \"The greater the df, the closer the t-distributions are to the normal distribution.\" Degrees of freedom (df) affect the shape of the t-distribution. As df increases, the t-distribution approaches the shape of the standard normal distribution. This is a fundamental concept, so this statement appears to be true.\n\nStatement D: \"The smaller the df, the better the 68-95-99.7 Rule works for t-models.\" Hmm, this one sounds suspicious. The 68-95-99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule, applies to normal distributions, where approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three. However, t-distributions, especially those with small df, have heavier tails than the normal distribution. This means that more data falls in the tails in t-distributions compared to the normal distribution. Therefore, the 68-95-99.7 rule would not work as well for t-distributions with small df because the proportions in the tails are different.\n\nIn fact, for t-distributions with small df, the proportions within standard deviations from the mean differ from those in the normal distribution. So, the smaller the df, the less applicable the 68-95-99.7 rule is to t-models.\n\nTherefore, statement D is false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
