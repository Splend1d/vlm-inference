I need to figure out how much fencing he needs.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rectangle has two widths and two lengths. So, to find the total fencing needed, I should add up all the sides.\n\nSo, the total fencing would be:\n\nWidth + width + length + length.\n\nThat is, 55 + 55 + 75 + 75.\n\nLet me add those up.\n\n55 plus 55 is 110.\n\n75 plus 75 is 150.\n\nNow, 110 plus 150 is 260.\n\nSo, the total fencing needed is 260 feet.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 130\n\nB. 260\n\nC. 3,905\n\nD. 4,125\n\nOption B is 260, which matches what I calculated.\n\nBut wait, is there a shorter way to calculate this?\n\nYes, I recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (75 + 55) = 2 \u00d7 130 = 260 feet.\n\nThat's the same answer I got earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nMaybe someone might think to multiply length by width, but that's for area, not perimeter.\n\nArea would be 75 \u00d7 55, which is 4,125 square feet, but that's not relevant here.\n\nOr maybe add length and width and get 130, but that's just one length and one width, not the total perimeter.\n\nSo, no, the correct answer is indeed 260 feet.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
