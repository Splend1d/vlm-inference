                    "text": "Let's see. I remember 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' is a classic movie from the Star Trek franchise. It was released in 1982, and it's one of the original films featuring the crew of the USS Enterprise.\n\nNow, the question is about an actress who played a pointy-eared Vulcan in this movie. Vulcans are a fictional alien race in the Star Trek universe, known for their logical approach to life and their distinctive ear shape, which is indeed pointy.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Whoopi Goldberg - I know Whoopi Goldberg is an accomplished actress, but I don't recall her being in Star Trek II. Maybe she was in a different Star Trek movie?\n\nB. Jennifer Grey - Jennifer Grey is famous for \"Dirty Dancing,\" which came out in 1987, a few years after 'Star Trek II.' I don't think she was in this particular movie.\n\nC. Kirstie Alley - Kirstie Alley is known for \"Cheers\" and \"Look Who's Talking\" series, but I don't remember her being in 'Star Trek II.'\n\nD. Helen Hunt - Helen Hunt is known for \"As Good as It Gets\" and \"Mad About You,\" which are much later productions.\n\nHmm, none of these names seem familiar in the context of 'Star Trek II.' Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the actress played a supporting role or had a minor part.\n\nWait a minute, in 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,' the main Vulcan character is Spock, played by Leonard Nimoy. But the question specifies an actress, so it must be a different Vulcan character.\n\nLet me think about other Vulcan characters in the movie. There's Pavel Chekov, but he's Russian, not Vulcan. Then there's Saavik, who is a half-Romulan, half-Vulcan character, played by Robin Curtis in this film.\n\nBut Robin Curtis is not listed in the options. Maybe the question is referring to a different Vulcan character or perhaps there's a mistake in the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the actress played a Vulcan in a different Star Trek movie, not necessarily 'Star Trek II.' But the question specifically mentions 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.'\n\nLet me double-check the cast of 'Star Trek II.' The main cast includes William Shatner as Captain Kirk, Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n as Khan, Leonard Nimoy as Spock, DeForest Kelley as Dr. McCoy, James Doohan as Scotty, Walter Koenig as Chekov, and Jacqueline Kim as Yeoman J. Mia Engle also has a small role as a nurse.\n\nWait, is there another Vulcan character besides Spock in this movie? I think Saavik is the only other Vulcan, and she's played by Robin Curtis.\n\nPerhaps the question is mistaken, or maybe I'm missing something. Maybe one of the actresses listed did a cameo or had an uncredited role?\n\nWhoopi Goldberg was in \"The Wiz\" in 1978 and \"Ghostbusters\" in 1984, so her career was budding around that time, but I don't recall her being in 'Star Trek II.'\n\nJennifer Grey was in \"The Big Chill\" in 1983 and \" ferris Bueller's Day Off\" in 1986, so again, not associated with 'Star Trek II.'\n\nKirstie Alley was in \"Look Who's Talking\" in 1989 and \"Cheers\" started in 1982, but I don't think she was in 'Star Trek II.'\n\nHelen Hunt was in \"Mad About You\" starting in 1992 and \"As Good as It Gets\" in 1997, which are way after 'Star Trek II.'\n\nIt's possible that the question has a typo or is misremembered. Maybe it's referring to a different movie or a different character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actress played a Vulcan in a different Star Trek film, and the question is misattributing the movie.\n\nFor example, in 'Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,' Saavik is still played by Robin Curtis, and in 'Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,' there aren't many Vulcan characters.\n\nIn 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,' there's a Vulcan ambassador played by Chrisopher Lloyd, but he's a man, not a woman.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about a different movie altogether, but mistakenly referred to 'Star Trek II.'\n\nAlternatively, maybe the actress played a Vulcan in a television episode of Star Trek: The Original Series or another Star Trek series.\n\nBut the question specifically mentions 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,' so perhaps I need to consider that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"pointy-eared Vulcan\" is a red herring, and the actress played a different role in the movie.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as the question seems straightforward.\n\nGiven that none of the provided options seem to match the cast of 'Star Trek II,' and considering my knowledge of the movie, I would have to say that perhaps the question is incorrect or needs clarification.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to choose one, maybe there's a lesser-known Vulcan character played by one of these actresses, but it's stretching it.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is not listed among the options, or there's a mistake in the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about a different movie or a different character, and it's been misphrased.\n\nGiven the information I have, I can't confidently select any of the provided answers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None of the above}} \\]"
