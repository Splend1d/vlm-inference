                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about the legislative successes of certain interest groups, like the National Rifle Association and antiabortion activists. It's asking what these successes demonstrate about the influence of interest groups in politics.\n\nOption A says that U.S. domestic policy grew more conservative in the 1990s. Well, it's possible that during that decade, there was a shift towards conservatism, which might have helped these groups achieve their legislative goals. But the question is talking about \"legislative successes\" of these interest groups, which suggests that their influence is significant regardless of the overall political climate. So, while A might be partially true, it doesn't directly address the impact of these interest groups.\n\nOption B claims that the influence of political action committees has weakened in recent years. But if these interest groups have had legislative successes, that would suggest their influence is strong, not weakening. So, B seems contradictory to the premise of the question.\n\nOption C states that the power of interest groups depends on the degree of support for their positions in the White House. While having a sympathetic administration can certainly help, it's not the only factor. Interest groups can influence legislation through various means, including lobbying, grassroots mobilization, and campaign contributions, regardless of who is in the White House. So, C might not fully capture the complexity of interest group influence.\n\nOption D says that majority opinion on an issue can sometimes be overridden by the intensity of a minority's commitment to activism. This seems particularly relevant. Often, interest groups represent a minority viewpoint but have a disproportionate influence because their members are highly motivated and active. For example, the NRA has been very successful in pushing for gun rights, even in cases where public opinion might be divided or leaning towards stricter regulations. Similarly, antiabortion activists have been influential in shaping legislation related to abortion, despite potentially not representing the majority view.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option D seems to best explain how these interest groups can achieve legislative successes even if their positions aren't held by the majority of the population. It's about the intensity of their activism and commitment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
