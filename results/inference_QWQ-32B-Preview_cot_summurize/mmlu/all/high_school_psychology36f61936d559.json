Trait theorists are interested in identifying and measuring stable personality characteristics, which aligns with the focus of the MMPI. Psychoanalytic theorists focus more on unconscious processes, humanistic theorists emphasize personal growth and self-actualization, and behaviorists concentrate on observable behaviors and environmental influences. Therefore, trait theorists would be most interested in the results of the MMPI."
