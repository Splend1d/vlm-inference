                    "text": "So I've got this probability question here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. The question says: \"The probability is 0.2 that a value selected at random from a normal distribution with mean 600 and standard deviation 15 will be above what number?\" And then there are options: A. 0.84, B. 603.8, C. 612.6, D. 587.4.\n\nAlright, first things first, I know that in a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. The mean here is 600, and the standard deviation is 15. So, the distribution is bell-shaped, with most of the values clustering around the mean.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for a number such that the probability of selecting a value above it is 0.2. That means 20% of the distribution lies above this number. Since the total area under the normal curve is 1, the area below this number would be 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. So, I need to find the value that corresponds to the 80th percentile of this normal distribution.\n\nTo find this value, I can use the Z-score table or a Z-score calculator. The Z-score tells me how many standard deviations away from the mean a value is. The formula for Z-score is:\n\nZ = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nWhere:\n\n- X is the value I'm trying to find\n\n- \u03bc is the mean (600)\n\n- \u03c3 is the standard deviation (15)\n\nI need to find X such that P(Z < Z_score) = 0.8.\n\nLooking at the Z-table, I find that a Z-score of about 0.84 corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.8. So, Z \u2248 0.84.\n\nNow, plugging this into the Z-score formula:\n\n0.84 = (X - 600) / 15\n\nSolving for X:\n\nX = (0.84 * 15) + 600\n\nX = 12.6 + 600\n\nX = 612.6\n\nSo, the number I'm looking for is 612.6. That means option C is correct.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. The question says \"above what number\" with a probability of 0.2. So, indeed, 20% of the distribution is above this number, which means 80% is below it. So, finding the 80th percentile makes sense.\n\nLet me verify the Z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.8. Yes, from the Z-table, Z \u2248 0.84.\n\nNow, calculating X:\n\nX = 600 + (0.84 * 15) = 600 + 12.6 = 612.6\n\nThat matches option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this problem. Maybe I should consider the properties of the normal distribution more carefully.\n\nIn a normal distribution, the mean is 600, and the standard deviation is 15. So, one standard deviation above the mean would be 615, and one standard deviation below would be 585.\n\nBut the problem is not asking for one standard deviation above or below; it's asking for a specific value where only 20% of the data is above it.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct. Using the Z-score and the Z-table is the standard method for solving such problems.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use a calculator or software that directly computes percentiles for a normal distribution, I would input mean = 600, standard deviation = 15, and find the 80th percentile, which should give me X = 612.6.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance that the question is asking for something else. Maybe it's a trick question, but I don't see how. The options provided are numerical values, and option C matches my calculation.\n\nWait, option A is 0.84, which is the Z-score I used. But the question is asking for the actual value from the distribution, not the Z-score. So, option A is just the Z-score, which is part of the calculation but not the final answer.\n\nOption B is 603.8, which is less than the mean of 600, but since we're looking for a value above which only 20% of the distribution lies, it should be greater than the mean. So, option B can be eliminated.\n\nOption D is 587.4, which is even lower than option B, so that doesn't make sense either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed option C, 612.6.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The approach is correct, and the calculation checks out. So, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{612.6} \\]"
