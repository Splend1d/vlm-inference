Every complete space is compact.\n\nC. Neither (a) nor (b).\n\nD. Both (a) and (b).\n\nI need to recall the definitions of compact and complete spaces to answer this.\n\nFirst, a compact space is one in which every open cover has a finite subcover. This is a topological property.\n\nA complete space, on the other hand, usually refers to a metric space where every Cauchy sequence converges. So, completeness is a property related to the convergence of sequences.\n\nNow, I need to see if compactness implies completeness, and vice versa.\n\nLet's consider option A: Every compact space is complete.\n\nIs this true? Well, compactness is a topological property, and completeness is a property of metric spaces. Not all compact spaces are metric spaces. However, in metric spaces, compactness does imply completeness. This is a theorem: In a metric space, compactness is equivalent to being complete and totally bounded.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify metric spaces, and compactness can be defined in more general topological spaces, I'm not sure if every compact space is complete. Maybe in general topological spaces, completeness isn't even defined unless there's a metric.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question assumes we're talking about metric spaces. In that case, compactness does imply completeness.\n\nNow, option B: Every complete space is compact.\n\nAgain, in metric spaces, completeness doesn't imply compactness. There are complete metric spaces that are not compact. For example, the real numbers with the standard metric are complete but not compact because they are not bounded.\n\nWait, in metric spaces, compactness is equivalent to being complete and totally bounded. So, completeness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for compactness. You also need total boundedness.\n\nTherefore, not every complete space is compact.\n\nSo, option A might be true in metric spaces, but option B is false.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify metric spaces, which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about complete normed spaces, i.e., Banach spaces.\n\nIn that case, a compact normed space would have to be finite-dimensional, and every finite-dimensional normed space is complete. But I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in normed spaces, compactness implies that the space is finite-dimensional. And finite-dimensional normed spaces are complete.\n\nBut again, the question is general about spaces, which could be topological spaces.\n\nI think I need to consider general topological spaces.\n\nIn general topological spaces, compactness is defined via open covers, but completeness isn't directly defined unless there's a uniform structure or a metric.\n\nSo, in general, compactness doesn't imply completeness because completeness isn't even defined in all compact spaces.\n\nSimilarly, completeness doesn't imply compactness because completeness is about sequences or nets converging, which doesn't ensure that every open cover has a finite subcover.\n\nTherefore, neither A nor B is generally true.\n\nBut perhaps in the context of the question, they are considering metric spaces.\n\nIf that's the case, then A is true (in metric spaces, compact implies complete) and B is false (complete doesn't imply compact).\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C. Neither (a) nor (b), if we consider general spaces.\n\nBut if we consider only metric spaces, then A is true and B is false.\n\nBut since the question says \"every compact space\" and \"every complete space,\" without specifying metric spaces, I think the general case applies, and in general topological spaces, completeness isn't defined.\n\nSo, neither A nor B is true in general.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, if the question assumes metric spaces, then A is true and B is false, so the answer would be A.\n\nBut since it's not specified, I think C is the safe choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
