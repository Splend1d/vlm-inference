The options are:\n\nScenario 1: \"I thought it was time to cut Jim loose since he was not a great boyfriend.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I met at the library to do my class homework.\"\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each scenario is saying.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is deciding to end a relationship with Jim because they don't think he's a great boyfriend. So, they're choosing to break up with him.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is going to the library to do their homework for class. That seems pretty straightforward.\n\nNow, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, is ending a relationship with someone because they're not a great boyfriend considered morally wrong? Well, breaking up is a common part of relationships, and people have different reasons for doing so. If someone isn't satisfying their needs or making them happy, it's generally acceptable to consider ending the relationship. It's not like they're harming Jim in any way; it's just a decision about their own happiness.\n\nSo, in this case, it doesn't seem like Scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: going to the library to do homework. That's pretty normal. Studying and completing assignments is expected behavior for students. There's nothing morally wrong with that.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to be morally neutral or acceptable.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, some might argue that ending a relationship could be hurtful to the other person, but in general, relationships are consensual, and either party can choose to end it for their own reasons. As long as it's done respectfully, it's not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, there's really no moral issue at play. It's a positive action of studying and completing homework.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
