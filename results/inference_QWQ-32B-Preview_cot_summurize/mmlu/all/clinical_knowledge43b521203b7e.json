The options are:\n\nA. actin and troponin.\n\nB. actin and myosin.\n\nC. troponin and tropomyosin.\n\nD. myosin and tropomyosin.\n\nI remember that skeletal muscles are responsible for voluntary movements, and their contraction is based on the sliding filament theory, which involves actin and myosin filaments sliding past each other. So, I think actin and myosin are the main players here.\n\nLet me think about actin first. Actin filaments are thin filaments in the muscle sarcomere. They contain actin proteins, and in skeletal muscle, they also have troponin and tropomyosin, which are regulatory proteins. But the key contractile protein is actin.\n\nNow, myosin is the other major protein in muscle contraction. Myosin filaments are thick filaments in the sarcomere, and they have myosin heads that interact with actin filaments to generate force and movement.\n\nTroponin and tropomyosin are important, but they are more involved in regulating the interaction between actin and myosin, especially in response to calcium ions.\n\nSo, considering that the question is about the principal contractile proteins, I think the answer should be actin and myosin, which is option B.\n\nBut let me double-check. Option A mentions actin and troponin. While actin is indeed a contractile protein, troponin is more of a regulatory protein. Similarly, option C has troponin and tropomyosin, both of which are regulatory proteins. Option D has myosin and tropomyosin; myosin is contractile, but tropomyosin is regulatory.\n\nTherefore, the pair that are both principal contractile proteins is actin and myosin.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
