                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option would lead to faster economic growth in the U.S. Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A is about putting higher tariffs on imported goods. Tariffs are like taxes on imports, which can protect domestic industries from foreign competition. But, higher tariffs can also make imported goods more expensive, which might not be good for consumers who rely on those products. Also, other countries might retaliate with their own tariffs, which could hurt U.S. exports. So, it's not clear if this would overall boost economic growth.\n\nOption B suggests more investment in capital infrastructure and less consumption of nondurable goods and services. Infrastructure includes things like roads, bridges, and public transportation, which are essential for businesses to operate efficiently. Investing more in infrastructure can improve productivity and make it easier for companies to grow and create jobs. On the other hand, consuming fewer nondurable goods and services might slow down some parts of the economy in the short term, but if that frees up resources for long-term investment, it could lead to faster growth over time.\n\nOption C is about eliminating mandatory school attendance laws. Education is a key factor in economic growth because it improves the skills and productivity of the workforce. If we remove mandatory schooling, fewer people might complete their education, which could lead to a less skilled workforce in the future. That doesn't sound like it would promote faster economic growth.\n\nOption D proposes annual limits on the number of foreigners immigrating into the U.S. Immigration can have mixed effects on the economy. On one hand, immigrants often fill labor shortages and start businesses, which can boost economic growth. On the other hand, some people argue that immigrants take jobs away from native-born workers. However, overall, studies have shown that immigration generally has a positive impact on economic growth. So, limiting immigration might not be the best way to accelerate growth.\n\nComparing all these options, option B seems to make the most sense for promoting faster economic growth. Investing in infrastructure can improve the efficiency of the economy, and while reducing consumption of nondurable goods might have short-term costs, the long-term benefits of better infrastructure could outweigh those costs.\n\nI think I'll go with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
