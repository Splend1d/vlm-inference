But the social groups might not be directly relevant to the question about out-of-town friends, so I'll focus on the friends first.\n\nThe problem says that 30% of her female friends live in town, and 40% of her male friends live in town. I need to find out how many out-of-town friends she has in total.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many female friends live in town. If 30% of her 60 female friends live in town, then:\n\nNumber of female friends in town = 30% of 60 = 0.30 \u00d7 60 = 18\n\nSo, 18 female friends live in town.\n\nSimilarly, for male friends, 40% of her 50 male friends live in town:\n\nNumber of male friends in town = 40% of 50 = 0.40 \u00d7 50 = 20\n\nSo, 20 male friends live in town.\n\nNow, to find the number of out-of-town friends, I need to subtract the in-town friends from the total number of friends for each gender and then add them up.\n\nNumber of out-of-town female friends = Total female friends - Female friends in town = 60 - 18 = 42\n\nNumber of out-of-town male friends = Total male friends - Male friends in town = 50 - 20 = 30\n\nTotal out-of-town friends = Out-of-town female friends + Out-of-town male friends = 42 + 30 = 72\n\nSo, the answer should be 72.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of friends and the total number of in-town friends, then subtract the in-town friends from the total friends.\n\nTotal friends = 60 females + 50 males = 110 friends\n\nTotal in-town friends = 18 females + 20 males = 38 friends\n\nThen, out-of-town friends = total friends - in-town friends = 110 - 38 = 72\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the percentages directly.\n\nBut I think the way I did it is correct. The social groups information might be a red herring, not relevant to the question about out-of-town friends.\n\nSo, the answer should be 72.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 38\n\nB. 72\n\nC. 110\n\nD. 360\n\nOption B is 72, which matches my calculation.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
