                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option isn't a characteristic of asexual reproduction in animals. So, first things first, I should remember what asexual reproduction is. Asexual reproduction is when an organism can create offspring without needing a partner. It's like cloning, where the offspring are genetically identical to the parent.\n\nOption A says: \"Daughter cells have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.\" That makes sense because in asexual reproduction, like mitosis, the chromosomes are duplicated and then divided equally between the two daughter cells. So, they should have the same number of chromosomes as the parent. That seems correct.\n\nOption B says: \"Daughter cells are identical to the parent cell.\" Again, in asexual reproduction, the offspring are genetically identical to the parent because there's no mixing of genes from two different parents. So, this also seems accurate.\n\nOption C says: \"The parent cell produces diploid cells.\" Now, I need to recall what diploid means. Diploid means having two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. In asexual reproduction, since there's only one parent, the offspring should have the same ploidy level as the parent. So, if the parent is diploid, the offspring should also be diploid. That sounds right too.\n\nOption D says: \"The daughter cells fuse to form a zygote.\" Hmm, this sounds familiar, but I think it's related to sexual reproduction. In sexual reproduction, gametes from two parents fuse to form a zygote, which then develops into a new organism. But in asexual reproduction, there's no fusion of cells; the parent simply divides to produce offspring. So, this doesn't sound like a characteristic of asexual reproduction.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe in some types of asexual reproduction, daughter cells fuse. Let me think. I know that in some organisms, like certain protozoa, there are processes like multiple fission, but I don't recall anything where daughter cells fuse in asexual reproduction.\n\nMoreover, zygotes are typically associated with sexual reproduction, where two gametes combine. In asexual reproduction, the parent cell directly divides into daughter cells without forming a zygote.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, A, B, and C seem to be accurate descriptions of asexual reproduction, while D seems to be more related to sexual reproduction.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: \"The daughter cells fuse to form a zygote.\" This is not a characteristic of asexual reproduction in animals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
