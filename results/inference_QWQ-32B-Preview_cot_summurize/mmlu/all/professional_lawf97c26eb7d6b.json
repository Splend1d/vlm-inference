                    "text": "Let's see. There's a bank teller on trial for embezzlement, and the prosecution wants to introduce the bank's daily deposit and tally records for six months. They're trying to show that the total deposits don't match the total funds received and recorded. The problem is, they want to put these records into evidence without having someone from the bank testify about them or certifying them in some way. The defense is objecting on hearsay grounds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what hearsay is. Hearsay is basically when someone testifies about something they heard someone else say, and it's not allowed because it's considered unreliable. But in this case, it's about documents, not someone testifying about what they heard.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the rules about business records and their admissibility in court. I recall that business records can be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule, but there are conditions attached to that.\n\nOption A says no, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business. That sounds plausible, but I need to think about whether that's accurate.\n\nOption B says yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules. This seems to be getting at the idea that someone needs to vouch for the records' authenticity.\n\nOption C says no, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required. This is similar to option A but more specific to business records.\n\nOption D says yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records. This seems contrary to what I know about business records being admissible under certain circumstances.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, business records are indeed an exception to the hearsay rule, meaning they can be admitted without the live testimony of the person who made the record, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nOne of those conditions is that the record was made in the regular course of business, at or near the time of the event, by someone with knowledge of the event.\n\nAdditionally, the records generally need to be authenticated, meaning that there needs to be some proof that the records are what they purport to be.\n\nThis authentication can come in various forms. For example, a custodian of records or someone familiar with the bank's record-keeping system can testify about how the records are created and maintained.\n\nAlternatively, there might be rules that allow for self-authentication, such as certificates or seals on the documents, but I'm not sure about that in this context.\n\nSo, in this case, the prosecution is trying to introduce these records without any testimony or certification. The defense is objecting on hearsay grounds.\n\nGiven that business records are an exception to the hearsay rule, but only if certain conditions are met, including authentication, it seems like the records might not be admissible in this form.\n\nOption A says the court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence regularly kept by a business. While courts do have discretion, they still need to follow the rules of evidence. So, without authentication, it might not be sufficient.\n\nOption B says yes, the court should order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity. This aligns with what I'm thinking.\n\nOption C says no, because business records are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule with no further qualification required. But that's not entirely accurate because authentication is a requirement.\n\nOption D says yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records. But I know that business records, including bank records, are generally included in the hearsay exception, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nSo, between options B and C, B seems more accurate because it acknowledges the need for authentication.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way for business records to be admitted without live testimony, perhaps through certification.\n\nLet me think about the rules of evidence, specifically the Federal Rules of Evidence, since this seems to be a legal question.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), business records are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule, provided that:\n\n- The record was made in the regular course of business;\n\n- At or near the time of the event;\n\n- By someone with knowledge;\n\n- In the regular practice of the business.\n\nAdditionally, there needs to be testimony from someone who can attest to these facts, unless a statute or rule provides for other methods of authentication.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there might be provisions allowing for certification of records by a custodian, without requiring live testimony.\n\nFor example, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 902 provides methods for self-authentication of certain documents, including business records, through certification.\n\nSo, if the bank provides a certification that complies with Rule 902, the records might be admissible without live testimony.\n\nBut in this case, the prosecution is trying to introduce the records without certification or testimony from a bank custodian.\n\nTherefore, without such certification or testimony, the records might not be admissible due to lack of authentication.\n\nHence, the court is likely to sustain the defense's objection and order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nOption A is too broad, as it suggests the court has wide discretion to allow the evidence without considering the rules of evidence.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it ignores the need for authentication.\n\nOption D is incorrect because bank records are included in the business records exception to hearsay, provided the conditions are met.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
