The question is asking why this happens, and it's probably due to some limitation in the system's resources.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. buffer\n\nB. external storage\n\nC. processing power\n\nD. local storage\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of computer systems.\n\nA buffer is a temporary storage area used to hold data while it's being transferred from one place to another. For example, when you type into a search box, the text is stored in a buffer until you press enter or submit the form.\n\nExternal storage refers to permanent storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, or cloud storage. This is where data is stored long-term.\n\nProcessing power refers to the ability of the CPU to perform computations and execute instructions.\n\nLocal storage is similar to external storage but is specific to the device itself, like the internal memory of a computer or phone.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the issue arises when more than 200 words are entered into the search box and the search button is pressed. The system crashes, which suggests that there's a limit being exceeded somewhere in the process.\n\nIf the search box is designed to handle up to 200 words, entering more than that might exceed the size of the buffer allocated for that input. If the buffer isn't large enough to hold the extra text, it could cause an overflow, leading to a crash.\n\nOn the other hand, external storage is used for long-term data storage and isn't directly involved in handling user inputs like search queries. So, it's less likely to be the cause here.\n\nProcessing power might be a factor if the search function is computationally intensive, but in this case, the crash happens specifically when more than 200 words are entered, which seems more related to the input size rather than the complexity of the search algorithm.\n\nLocal storage is also used for persistent data storage and isn't directly related to handling temporary user inputs like search queries.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is A. buffer, because it's related to the temporary storage of user input, and exceeding its capacity could lead to a system crash.\n\nBut let me think about this again to make sure. Maybe there's another aspect to consider.\n\nSuppose the search function not only takes the input but also processes it in some way, perhaps by sending it to a server or indexing it. In that case, maybe the issue is with the processing power or storage on the server side.\n\nHowever, the question mentions that the crash occurs when the search button is pressed, which suggests that the problem happens at the point of submission, likely on the client side before the data is even sent to the server.\n\nAdditionally, if the search box has a limit of 200 words, it's probably because the developers anticipated that the buffer allocated for that input field can only handle up to that amount. Exceeding that limit could lead to buffer overflow, which is a common cause of crashes.\n\nBuffer overflow occurs when more data is trying to be placed into a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overwrite adjacent memory spaces. This can corrupt data, lead to program crashes, or even enable security vulnerabilities.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that the correct answer is A. buffer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider each option again:\n\nA. buffer: Likely cause due to exceeding the allocated space for user input.\n\nB. external storage: Unlikely, as external storage isn't involved in handling temporary user inputs.\n\nC. processing power: Unlikely, unless the search function is very computationally intensive, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nD. local storage: Similar to external storage, it's used for persistent data storage and not for handling temporary inputs.\n\nHence, the best answer is A. buffer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
