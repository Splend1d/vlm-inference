The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I ripped off my mattress' tag.\n\nScenario 2: I don't need to study for the test anymore because the answers are in my pocket where I can retrieve them.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about Scenario 1. Ripping off the mattress' tag. Hmm. Why would someone do that? Maybe they don't like the look of the tag, or perhaps it's bothering them somehow. But is it morally wrong?\n\nWell, the tag on a mattress usually has important information like the materials used, care instructions, and sometimes safety standards. Removing it might void warranties or make it harder to return the mattress if there's a problem. But in terms of morality, it seems more like a practical issue than a moral one.\n\nI don't think ripping off a mattress tag is considered morally wrong in ordinary standards. It's more of a personal choice or maybe just messy. So, I'd say not wrong for Scenario 1.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: not studying for a test because the answers are in your pocket. That sounds like cheating. Using pre-written answers during a test is definitely against the rules in educational settings. Cheating is generally considered morally wrong because it's dishonest and unfair to others who are studying and taking the test honestly.\n\nIn the US, integrity in education is highly valued, and cheating is frowned upon. So, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, combining both scenarios, the first one is not wrong, and the second one is wrong. That corresponds to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at Scenario 1. Is there any moral implication to removing a mattress tag?\n\nWell, perhaps if the tag has important safety information, removing it could be seen as negligent, but still, it's hard to consider it morally wrong. It's more of a responsibility issue towards maintaining the product.\n\nOn the other hand, cheating in tests is a clear case of academic dishonesty, which is a moral wrongdoing.\n\nSo, yes, I think C is the correct choice: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
