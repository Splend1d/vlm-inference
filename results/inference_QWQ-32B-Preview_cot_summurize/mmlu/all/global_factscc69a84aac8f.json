I don't remember the exact statistic, so I need to think about what I know about bullying rates in that age group.\n\nFirst, I recall that bullying is a significant issue in schools, especially during adolescence. Ages 13-15 are typically middle school years, where social dynamics can be particularly challenging. I think that a considerable percentage of students experience some form of bullying during this time.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- 26% seems quite low. If only 26% of kids in that age group were bullied, that would mean a little over a quarter of them faced bullying. But I feel like it's more widespread than that.\n\n- 46% is almost half. That seems more plausible. It suggests that nearly half of the kids in that age group experienced bullying, which aligns with the idea that bullying is common during middle school.\n\n- 66% is two-thirds of the population. That seems high, but perhaps in some studies, it's possible that a majority reported experiencing bullying.\n\n- 86% is almost nine out of ten. That seems excessively high to me. If 86% of kids were being bullied, it would imply that bullying is the norm, which I don't think is the case.\n\nI need to recall or find some data to support this. I remember that in various studies, bullying rates can vary depending on the definition of bullying and the specific population studied. However, for a general question like this, I need to think about what the most commonly reported statistic is.\n\nI think that around half of adolescents experience some form of bullying. So, 46% seems reasonable. But maybe I'm misremembering. Perhaps it's higher or lower.\n\nWait, I recall that in some studies, up to 30% of students report being involved in bullying, either as perpetrators, victims, or both. But that's a different statistic.\n\nSpecifically for being bullied, I think it's higher than 26%, but lower than 66%. So, 46% seems acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's higher, but I doubt it's 66%.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If 46% reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months, that seems significant, but not overly so.\n\nI don't have the exact data in front of me, but based on my general knowledge, I would go with 46%.\n\nSo, my answer is B. 46%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
