The options are sensory aphasia, motor aphasia, sensory ataxia, and avocalia. I need to figure out which one matches this description.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means. Aphasia is a language disorder that affects the ability to communicate, often due to brain damage. There are different types of aphasia, and it seems like sensory and motor aphasia are options here.\n\nSensory aphasia, also known as Wernicke's aphasia, is when someone has difficulty understanding language, both spoken and written, but can still produce speech. However, their speech might not make much sense because they don't realize their mistakes in understanding.\n\nMotor aphasia, also known as Broca's aphasia, is when someone has trouble speaking and forming words, but they can still understand language.\n\nSensory ataxia sounds like it might be related to balance or coordination, but I'm not sure. Ataxia generally refers to a lack of muscle control or coordination.\n\nAvocalia seems unfamiliar to me. Maybe it's related to not being able to speak or produce vocal sounds.\n\nGiven the description in the question\u2014 inability to understand words without loss of ability to speak or hear words\u2014it sounds like sensory aphasia, because the person can hear and speak but can't understand the meaning of the words.\n\nLet me double-check the other options:\n\n- Motor aphasia affects speech production, but the question says there's no loss of ability to speak.\n\n- Sensory ataxia seems unrelated to language understanding.\n\n- Avocalia might imply an inability to speak, which isn't the case here since the person can speak.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is A. sensory aphasia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
