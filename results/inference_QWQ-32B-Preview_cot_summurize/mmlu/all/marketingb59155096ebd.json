                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about intermediaries and utility. So, intermediaries help bring products from far away to places where customers can easily buy and use them. The options are time utility, place utility, ownership utility, and information utility. I need to decide which one this describes.\n\nFirst, let's think about what each type of utility means. Time utility is about making products available when customers want them, maybe through scheduling deliveries or keeping stock during off-peak times. Place utility is about having the product where customers are, making it convenient for them to purchase. Ownership utility is about transferring ownership of the product to the customer, maybe through efficient checkout processes. Information utility is about providing customers with information about the product to help them make purchasing decisions.\n\nNow, the question is talking about intermediaries bringing products from a long way away to a more convenient location for purchase and consumption. That sounds a lot like place utility because it's about making the product available in a place that's convenient for the customer.\n\nTime utility is about when the product is available, but here it's about where it's available. Ownership utility is about the transaction process, and information utility is about providing product information. Neither of those seems to directly match the description in the question.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Place utility.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there might be another type of utility that could apply here. Maybe if the intermediary is storing the product until the customer is ready to buy it, that could involve time utility. However, the main focus of the question is on bringing the product to a convenient location, not on when it's available.\n\nAlternatively, if the intermediary is providing lots of information about the product to help customers decide, that might relate to information utility. But again, the key point in the question is about the location convenience.\n\nTherefore, I believe place utility is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
