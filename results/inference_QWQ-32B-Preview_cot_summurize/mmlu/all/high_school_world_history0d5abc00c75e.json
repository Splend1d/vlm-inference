                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about why China, even though they invented gunpowder, didn't lead in developing gunpowder weapons. The passage gives some context about Europe and China during specific centuries and their military situations.\n\nFirst, it talks about Western Europe in the 1200s through 1400s. It says that early cannons were heavy and slow to fire, but they were useful in sieges, which were common in warfare at that time. Because sieges were important, governments saw value in paying for cannons and experimenting to make them better\u2014more powerful and easier to move.\n\nThen, it talks about China, especially after the mid-1300s. China was threatened mainly by mobile steppe nomads. The early gunpowder weapons were unwieldy, meaning they were hard to handle or move around, so they weren't very useful against these mobile enemies. Instead, China focused on improving horse archer units that could effectively combat the nomads.\n\nSo, the question is asking why China didn't lead in gunpowder weapon innovation, and it gives four options:\n\nA. They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.\n\nB. They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.\n\nC. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\n\nD. They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.\n\nLooking at the passage, it doesn't mention anything about Confucian traditionalism discouraging innovation, so option A isn't supported by the text. Option B says they had too much faith in their existing forces, but again, the passage doesn't mention anything about their confidence in their armies; it just says they focused on improving horse archers because they were effective against nomads.\n\nOption C says they logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs. This aligns with the passage, which states that China devoted its efforts to improving horse archer units because they could effectively combat the steppe nomads, who were their main threat. So, China chose to develop weapons that were more suitable for their specific situation.\n\nOption D suggests that China couldn't afford the initial expense of converting to new technology. But the passage doesn't mention anything about financial constraints or the cost of developing gunpowder weapons. It's about the utility of the weapons against their enemies.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the most accurate answer is C: They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\n\nIt's interesting how different military contexts can shape technological development. In Europe, where sieges were common, cannons were useful, so they invested in improving them. In China, facing mobile nomads, gunpowder weapons weren't as effective, so they focused on horse archers instead.\n\nThis shows that military needs can drive technological innovation in specific directions. It's not just about having the technology; it's about whether it's applicable and useful in your particular circumstances.\n\nI think this also highlights the importance of adapting technology to fit strategic needs. China didn't abandon gunpowder altogether; they just prioritized other types of weapons that were more effective against their main threats.\n\nIt's also worth noting that over time, gunpowder technology did spread and evolve in China, but perhaps not at the same pace as in Europe due to these differing military pressures.\n\nSo, in summary, the passage suggests that China's focus on different types of weaponry was a strategic choice based on the nature of the threats they faced, rather than a lack of innovation or financial constraints.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
