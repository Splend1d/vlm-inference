Argument from Ignorance\n\nB. Affirming the Consequent\n\nC. Denying the Antecedent\n\nD. Begging the Question\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what each of these fallacies means.\n\nStarting with A, Argument from Ignorance. That's when someone claims something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. Like, \"There must be aliens because no one has proven they don't exist.\" That doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nOption B is Affirming the Consequent. That's a type of deductive reasoning where you have an \"if-then\" statement, and you affirm the \"then\" part, then conclude the \"if\" part. But that's not necessarily a fallacy; it becomes a fallacy when the \"if-then\" statement isn't properly established.\n\nWait, no, Affirming the Consequent is actually a fallacy. Let me recall: If P then Q. Q is true, therefore P is true. That's affirming the consequent, and it's a fallacy because there could be other reasons Q is true besides P.\n\nOption C is Denying the Antecedent. That's another deductive reasoning fallacy: If P then Q. Not P, therefore not Q. Which is invalid because Q could be true for other reasons.\n\nOption D is Begging the Question, which is circular reasoning where the conclusion is assumed in one of the premises.\n\nNow, looking back at the statement: \"We must assume that he is a Communist, because he says that he is not, and we know that Communists are taught always to deny party membership.\"\n\nSo, they're arguing that because he denies being a Communist, and Communists are taught to deny their membership, therefore he must be a Communist.\n\nHmm, this seems like they're assuming that only Communists would deny their membership, which isn't necessarily true. Maybe non-Communists would also deny being Communists for various reasons.\n\nBut let's see which fallacy this matches.\n\nIt doesn't seem like Argument from Ignorance, because they're not relying on lack of proof.\n\nIs it Affirming the Consequent? Let's map it out.\n\nIf he is a Communist, then he denies being one.\n\nHe denies being one.\n\nTherefore, he is a Communist.\n\nYes, that's affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy because there could be other reasons why he denies being a Communist.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's Begging the Question.\n\nWait, let's look at that.\n\nBegging the Question is circular reasoning where the conclusion is assumed in the premise.\n\nIn this case, are they assuming he's a Communist to conclude he's a Communist?\n\nWell, they're assuming that only Communists deny being Communists, which is similar to assuming their conclusion.\n\nBut Affirming the Consequent seems more precise here.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose:\n\nPremise: Communists are taught to deny their party membership.\n\nObservation: He denies being a Communist.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, he is a Communist.\n\nThis is logically flawed because there could be other reasons for denying being a Communist.\n\nSo, it's affirming the consequent.\n\nBut let's consider Begging the Question.\n\nIs the conclusion assuming its own truth?\n\nWell, they're assuming that only Communists would deny being Communists, which is part of what they're trying to prove.\n\nSo, there is an element of circular reasoning here.\n\nIt's a bit tricky because it could be seen as both.\n\nBut in logic, Affirming the Consequent is a specific type of fallacy, while Begging the Question is more general.\n\nPerhaps Affirming the Consequent is a better fit here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's both.\n\nBut since I have to choose one, I think Affirming the Consequent is the most direct answer.\n\nLet me see if there's another perspective.\n\nSuppose we have:\n\nIf someone is a Communist, then they deny being one.\n\nHe denies being one.\n\nTherefore, he is a Communist.\n\nThis is classic affirming the consequent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that they're assuming that denying membership is only done by Communists, which is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, they're ignoring other possibilities, which makes it affirming the consequent.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. Affirming the Consequent.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A: Argument from Ignorance \u2013 doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: Denying the Antecedent \u2013 that would be if they said something like, \"He doesn't deny being a Communist, so he's not a Communist,\" which isn't the case here.\n\nOption D: Begging the Question \u2013 while there is an element of circular reasoning, I think Affirming the Consequent is a more precise description of the fallacy in this scenario.\n\nSo, I'll go with B. Affirming the Consequent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
