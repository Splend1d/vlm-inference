These bonds are formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, resulting in the creation of a peptide bond and the release of a water molecule. This process is known as dehydration synthesis.\n\nWhile hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds do play roles in the structure and stability of proteins, they are not the primary bonds that connect amino acids in the polypeptide chain. Glycosidic bonds, on the other hand, are found in carbohydrates and link monosaccharides together."
