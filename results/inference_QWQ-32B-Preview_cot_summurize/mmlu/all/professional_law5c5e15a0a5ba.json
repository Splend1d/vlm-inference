His friend has been telling him for a while that he shouldn't leave so much merchandise out in the open, but the owner hasn't been listening. One day, the friend decides to play a joke on him to make a point. He picks up a hatchet from a display case, swings it over his head as if he's about to hit the owner, and says, \"All right buddy, one false move and it's over.\" The owner is really scared but, luckily, nothing actually happens\u2014he doesn't get hit or hurt in any way.\n\nNow, the question is, if the owner decides to sue his friend, what's likely to happen? The options are:\n\nA. He'll recover because the friend was negligent.\n\nB. He'll recover because he was afraid the friend would hit him.\n\nC. He won't recover because he didn't suffer any physical harm.\n\nD. He won't recover because the friend was only joking.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what kind of legal claim is the owner thinking of making here? It seems like he's upset because his friend scared him, but didn't actually hurt him. So, it's not a case of battery or assault where there's physical contact. It's more about the fear and intimidation.\n\nIn legal terms, assault is when someone intentionally causes another person to fear immediate harmful or offensive contact. So, even if no physical contact occurs, if the victim reasonably believes that they're about to be harmed, that can be assault.\n\nIn this case, the friend swung a hatchet over his head as if to strike the owner and made a threatening statement. The owner was frightened, which suggests that he believed the friend was about to hit him.\n\nSo, under the definition of assault, it seems like the friend's actions could constitute assault because he intentionally caused the owner to fear immediate harm.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Recover because the friend was negligent.\n\nNegligence is different from assault. Negligence involves failing to act with the care that a reasonable person would under similar circumstances, resulting in harm to another person. In this case, it's more about intentional actions rather than carelessness. So, option A might not be the best fit.\n\nB. Recover because he feared the friend would hit him.\n\nThis aligns closely with the definition of assault, where the victim fears immediate harmful contact. So, this seems plausible.\n\nC. Not recover because he suffered no physical harm.\n\nWell, in assault cases, physical harm isn't always required. The key is the intentional causing of fear of harm. So, even without physical injury, the owner might still have a claim.\n\nD. Not recover because the friend was only joking.\n\nThis is an interesting point. Maybe the friend didn't really intend to hit him; it was just a joke. But in legal terms, intent is about whether the action was meant to cause the fear, not necessarily to cause actual harm. If the friend knew or should have known that swinging a hatchet over his head and making threats would cause fear, then it could still be assault, even if it was meant as a joke.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the most likely result is that the owner would recover because he feared the friend would hit him (option B).\n\nBut let's think about it a bit more. Maybe there are some defenses the friend could raise. For example, perhaps he can argue that it was obvious it was a joke, or that they had a prior relationship where such pranks were acceptable.\n\nHowever, from the owner's perspective, he was genuinely frightened, which suggests that he didn't perceive it as a joke at that moment. Also, the friend's actions were potentially very dangerous, swinging a hatchet like that.\n\nAdditionally, even if it was meant as a joke, that doesn't necessarily make it okay in legal terms, especially if it causes reasonable fear in the other person.\n\nSo, overall, it seems like the owner has a valid claim for assault based on the fear caused by the friend's actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Recover, because he feared the friend would hit him.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
