                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out what happens to preRNA during processing and which statement correctly describes that process. So, first things first, what is preRNA? PreRNA, I think, is the precursor to the final RNA molecule, usually mRNA, that gets translated into protein. So, it undergoes some modifications before it's ready to be transported out of the nucleus and used by the ribosomes.\n\nI remember that one of the main things that happens is splicing, where certain parts called introns are removed, and the remaining parts called exons are joined together. So, introns are removed, and exons are kept. That seems important.\n\nAlso, I think there's something about adding a cap and a tail to the RNA. Like, a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail at the 3\u2032 end. These are added to help protect the RNA from degradation and to help it get transported out of the nucleus and recognized by the ribosomes.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA says: Introns are removed in the nucleus. A 5\u2032 cap and the poly-A tail are added after the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nB says: Introns are removed and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nC says: Exons are removed and a 5\u2032 cap is added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. After leaving the nucleus, the poly-A tail is added.\n\nD says: Point mutations are repaired, exons are removed, and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nOkay, let's evaluate these one by one.\n\nOption A: It correctly says that introns are removed in the nucleus, which matches what I remember. And it says that the 5\u2032 cap and poly-A tail are added after the preRNA leaves the nucleus. Hmm, I think that might not be entirely accurate. I think these additions happen before the RNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nOption B: This says that introns are removed and both the 5\u2032 cap and poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. This seems more plausible to me. It makes sense that all these processing steps happen in the nucleus before the mature mRNA is exported out.\n\nOption C: This says that exons are removed and a 5\u2032 cap is added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. After leaving the nucleus, the poly-A tail is added. Wait, exons are the coding parts that are kept, so removing exons wouldn't make sense. That must be a mistake.\n\nOption D: It says point mutations are repaired, exons are removed, and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. Again, removing exons is incorrect, and I don't recall that point mutations are typically repaired during RNA processing. That seems more like a DNA repair process.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems the most correct. Introns are removed, and both the 5\u2032 cap and poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nBut let me double-check. I think in reality, the 5\u2032 cap is added very early in the processing, soon after transcription starts. Splicing of introns occurs, and then the poly-A tail is added at the end of the processing. And all of this happens in the nucleus before the mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a specific order to these events. The cap is added first, then splicing removes introns, and finally, the poly-A tail is added. But according to option B, both the cap and tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus, which is accurate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the cap and tail are added after the RNA leaves the nucleus, which isn't the case.\n\nOption C is wrong because it says exons are removed, which doesn't make sense since exons are the coding sequences that are kept.\n\nOption D is also incorrect for the same reasons as C, plus the added mistake of repairing point mutations during RNA processing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Introns are removed and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
