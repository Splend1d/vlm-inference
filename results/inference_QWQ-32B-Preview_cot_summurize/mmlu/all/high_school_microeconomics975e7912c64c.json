                    "text": "So I've got this question here about monopolistic competition and how entry of new firms affects existing ones. Let's see:\n\nThe question is: \"If firms are entering an industry that is monopolistically competitive, we would expect...'\n\nAnd then there are four options:\n\nA. the demand for existing firms to shift rightward.\n\nB. the market price of the product to increase.\n\nC. the demand for existing firms to become more inelastic.\n\nD. the demand for existing firms to shift leftward.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what monopolistic competition is. Monopolistic competition is a market structure where there are many firms and many customers, and firms produce differentiated products. So, each firm has a little bit of market power because their product is somewhat unique, but there are many substitutes available.\n\nNow, if new firms are entering this industry, that means there are more suppliers in the market, each offering a slightly different product. So, how does that affect the existing firms?\n\nLet me think about option A: the demand for existing firms shifting rightward. A rightward shift in demand means that at any given price, consumers want to buy more of the product. But if new firms are entering and offering more alternatives, wouldn't that actually make consumers have more choices, potentially taking some demand away from existing firms? So, I'm not sure about that one.\n\nOption B: the market price of the product to increase. Hmm, generally, when more firms enter a market, they increase the supply, which tends to put downward pressure on prices, assuming demand remains constant. So, it seems counterintuitive that prices would increase with more entry.\n\nOption C: the demand for existing firms becoming more inelastic. Elasticity of demand refers to how responsive quantity demanded is to a change in price. If demand becomes more inelastic, that means consumers are less responsive to price changes. But I don't see why entry of new firms would make the demand for existing firms less elastic. In fact, with more substitutes available, you might think that demand becomes more elastic, not less.\n\nOption D: the demand for existing firms shifting leftward. A leftward shift in demand means that at any given price, consumers want to buy less of the product. That seems plausible because with new firms entering and offering more alternatives, some customers might switch to these new options, reducing the demand for what existing firms are selling.\n\nWait a minute, but in monopolistic competition, products are differentiated. So, even if new firms enter, their products are not perfect substitutes for the existing ones. Does that mean that existing firms might not see a significant shift in their demand curves?\n\nWell, in perfect competition, where products are homogeneous, entry of new firms would definitely shift the demand curve for existing firms leftward, as customers can perfectly substitute between any firm's product. But in monopolistic competition, because of product differentiation, each firm has its own demand curve that is downward sloping but also somewhat insulated from direct competition.\n\nHowever, even with differentiation, if new firms enter and offer similar but distinct products, some customers might switch from existing firms to these new ones. So, while the demand might not shift as much as in perfect competition, there could still be a leftward shift in demand for existing firms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entry of new firms doesn't affect the demand for existing firms at all, but I don't think that's the case because, again, with more options, some customers will choose the new firms instead of the existing ones.\n\nLet me think about this differently. In monopolistic competition, in the long run, firms earn zero economic profit because of free entry. So, if new firms are entering, that suggests that existing firms were earning positive economic profits, attracting new entrants. As more firms enter, the demand for each existing firm's product should decrease, leading to a leftward shift in their demand curves, until eventually, economic profits are driven to zero.\n\nWait, but the question is about what we would expect as firms are entering, not in the long-run equilibrium. So, during the process of entry, existing firms are facing increased competition, which should be reducing their demand.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider the overall market demand. If the market is growing or if there is increased demand for the product, that could allow more firms to enter without necessarily reducing the demand for existing firms. But the question doesn't specify anything about market demand changing; it just says firms are entering.\n\nPerhaps it's possible that if the market demand is increasing sufficiently, existing firms could see their demand shift rightward even as new firms enter. But that's not guaranteed; it depends on the magnitude of the increase in market demand relative to the increase in supply from new entrants.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards option D: the demand for existing firms shifts leftward, because of the increased competition from new entrants.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options.\n\nOption A: demand shifts rightward. That seems unlikely because of the increased competition.\n\nOption B: market price increases. Again, with more firms entering, supply increases, which should put downward pressure on prices, unless there's a corresponding increase in demand that outpaces the increase in supply.\n\nOption C: demand becomes more inelastic. I don't see a direct link between new firms entering and the elasticity of demand for existing firms' products.\n\nSo, overall, option D seems the most plausible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
