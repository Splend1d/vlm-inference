                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to figure out whether they're true or false based on group theory.\n\n**Statement 1:** If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\n\nFirst, I recall that in a group, the number of elements of a particular order is related to the number of cyclic subgroups of that order. Specifically, if an element has order 15, then the cyclic subgroup generated by that element has 15 elements, including the identity.\n\nWait, actually, if an element \\( a \\) has order 15, then the subgroup \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\) generated by \\( a \\) has 15 elements: \\( \\{e, a, a^2, \\dots, a^{14}\\} \\). Now, in this subgroup, how many elements have order 15?\n\nAn element \\( a^k \\) in \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\) has order \\( \\frac{15}{\\gcd(15, k)} \\). So, for \\( a^k \\) to have order 15, \\( \\gcd(15, k) \\) must be 1. Therefore, the number of elements of order 15 in \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\) is equal to the number of integers \\( k \\) from 1 to 14 such that \\( \\gcd(15, k) = 1 \\).\n\nThis is Euler's totient function \\( \\phi(15) \\). Since 15 is 3 times 5, both prime, \\( \\phi(15) = 15 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{3}) \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 15 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 8 \\). So, there are 8 elements of order 15 in \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\).\n\nBut now, could there be more elements of order 15 outside of \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\)? Well, yes, because the group could have other cyclic subgroups of order 15.\n\nHowever, the statement says \"it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\" Given that even in the smallest case, where the group has exactly one subgroup of order 15, there are already 8 elements of order 15, this seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there could be groups with an element of order 15 but potentially fewer elements of order 15. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the group. If the group has an element of order 15, then by Lagrange's theorem, the order of the group must be a multiple of 15.\n\nSo, \\( |G| = 15k \\) for some integer \\( k \\geq 1 \\).\n\nNow, in the case where \\( k = 1 \\), the group is cyclic of order 15, and as we saw, there are exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nIf \\( k > 1 \\), the group could have multiple subgroups of order 15.\n\nMoreover, if the group has more than one subgroup of order 15, these subgroups could intersect trivially or not.\n\nBut even if they intersect non-trivially, the number of elements of order 15 would still be at least 8, because even if all subgroups share some elements, there must be at least 8 distinct elements of order 15.\n\nWait, actually, if there are multiple subgroups of order 15, their intersection could be a subgroup of order dividing 15. The only subgroups of a cyclic group of order 15 are of orders 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n\nSo, if two subgroups of order 15 intersect, their intersection must be of order 1, 3, 5, or 15.\n\nIf they intersect trivially, i.e., only at the identity, then the total number of elements of order 15 would be higher than 8.\n\nIf they intersect in a subgroup of order 3 or 5, then there would be some overlap in elements of order 15, but still, the minimal number of elements of order 15 would be 8.\n\nWait, actually, elements of order 15 are those of order 15 in their cyclic subgroup, and these are precisely the generators of their cyclic subgroup.\n\nSo, in any case, the group must have at least 8 elements of order 15, coming from the single cyclic subgroup of order 15 if that's the only one present.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nNow, this is a bit trickier. We've seen that in a cyclic group of order 15, there are exactly 8 elements of order 15.\n\nIf the group is larger, say of order 30, 45, etc., it could have more subgroups of order 15, each contributing additional elements of order 15.\n\nBut the question is, if there are more than 8 elements of order 15, must there be at least 16?\n\nLet's consider a group with two distinct subgroups of order 15.\n\nSuppose these two subgroups intersect trivially, i.e., only at the identity.\n\nThen, the total number of elements of order 15 would be \\( 8 + 8 = 16 \\), since each subgroup contributes 8 elements of order 15, and there is no overlap between them.\n\nBut what if the subgroups intersect in a subgroup of order 3 or 5?\n\nIf they intersect in a subgroup of order 3, then the number of elements of order 15 in the union of the two subgroups would be \\( 8 + 8 - \\phi(3) \\), where \\( \\phi(3) = 2 \\), so 16 - 2 = 14.\n\nSimilarly, if they intersect in a subgroup of order 5, \\( \\phi(5) = 4 \\), so 16 - 4 = 12.\n\nIn either case, the total number of elements of order 15 is more than 8, but not necessarily at least 16.\n\nWait, in the first case, with intersection of order 3, we have 14 elements of order 15, which is more than 8 and less than 16.\n\nSimilarly, with intersection of order 5, we have 12 elements of order 15.\n\nSo, in these scenarios, the group has more than 8 elements of order 15, but not at least 16.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 seems to be false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are groups where the number of elements of order 15 can be exactly 9, 10, etc., which are more than 8 but less than 16.\n\nI need to think of an example or see if such configurations are possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some groups, the number of elements of order 15 is always a multiple of 8, but I don't think that's the case, as shown above.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
