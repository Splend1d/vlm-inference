The mean is found by adding up all the scores and then dividing by the number of scores.\n\nJane's scores are: 98, 97, 92, 85, and 93.\n\nFirst, let's add them up:\n\n98 + 97 = 195\n\n195 + 92 = 287\n\n287 + 85 = 372\n\n372 + 93 = 465\n\nSo, the total sum of her scores is 465.\n\nNow, we need to divide this sum by the number of scores. Jane has 5 quiz scores.\n\nMean score = total sum / number of scores = 465 / 5\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n465 \u00f7 5 = 93\n\nTherefore, Jane's mean score is 93.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 92\n\nB. 93\n\nC. 94.5\n\nD. 95\n\nThe correct answer is B. 93.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{93} \\]"
