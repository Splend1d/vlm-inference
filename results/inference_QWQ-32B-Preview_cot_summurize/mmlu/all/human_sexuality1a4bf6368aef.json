                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about gonorrhea, and I need to figure out which statements are true. The options are:\n\nA. can be treated with antibiotics\n\nB. has a high risk of infection with a single exposure\n\nC. is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in only a small percentage of those infected\n\nD. infections are limited to genital areas\n\nOkay, first up is A: can be treated with antibiotics. I know that gonorrhea is caused by bacteria, specifically Neisseria gonorrhoeae. And generally, bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics. So, this seems likely to be true. But I should make sure because sometimes bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics.\n\nNext is B: has a high risk of infection with a single exposure. Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and I think it's pretty contagious. I've heard that the risk of getting it from a single act of unprotected sex with an infected partner is quite high. So, this might be true as well.\n\nOption C says it's asymptomatic in only a small percentage of those infected. Hmm, I thought that a lot of people with gonorrhea don't show symptoms, especially women. I remember that asymptomatic cases are quite common, maybe even a majority in some cases. So, this statement seems contradictory to what I know.\n\nLastly, D: infections are limited to genital areas. Gonorrhea affects the genital tract, but I've also heard that it can affect other parts of the body, like the throat or eyes, especially through different types of sexual contact. So, this might not be entirely accurate.\n\nLet me try to gather more information to confirm these thoughts.\n\nStarting with A: treatable with antibiotics. Yes, gonorrhea is typically treated with antibiotics. In fact, the CDC recommends specific antibiotic regimens for treating gonorrhea. However, there is a growing concern about antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is making treatment more challenging in some cases. So, while it's generally treatable with antibiotics, there are emerging issues with resistance. But for now, I'll consider this statement true.\n\nMoving on to B: high risk of infection with a single exposure. Gonorrhea is indeed highly contagious. The CDC states that the risk of transmission from a single act of vaginal sex with an infected partner is about 20% for women and 5% for men. For anal sex, the risks are higher, around 50% for insertive anal sex and up to 100% for receptive anal sex. These percentages suggest a significant risk with a single exposure. So, this statement seems accurate.\n\nNow, C: asymptomatic in only a small percentage of those infected. This is where I think there might be a misunderstanding. In reality, many people with gonorrhea have no symptoms, which is why it can spread so easily. For example, in women, up to 50% of infections may be asymptomatic, and in men, asymptomatic infections are less common but still occur. So, saying that it's asymptomatic in only a small percentage isn't accurate. This statement seems false.\n\nFinally, D: infections are limited to genital areas. As I recall, gonorrhea can infect the throat and eyes, not just the genital tract. Oral sex can transmit gonorrhea to the throat, and it can also be transmitted to the eyes, although that's less common. So, this statement is too limiting and seems false.\n\nPutting it all together, it looks like options A and B are true, while C and D are false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A \\text{ and } B} \\]"
