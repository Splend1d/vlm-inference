                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem: \"Which expression is another way to show 8 x 6?\" and there are four options: A. (24+4)+6, B. (2+4)x6, C. (2x4) + 6, and D. (2x4)x6. I need to figure out which one of these expressions equals the same thing as 8 times 6.\n\nFirst, I should calculate what 8 x 6 is. That's pretty straightforward: 8 times 6 equals 48. So, I'm looking for an expression that also equals 48.\n\nLet's look at option A: (24 + 4) + 6. If I add 24 and 4, that's 28, and then adding 6 makes 34. So, 34 is not equal to 48. Therefore, option A is not correct.\n\nOption B: (2 + 4) x 6. First, I add 2 and 4 to get 6, and then multiply by 6, which gives 36. 36 is not 48, so option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: (2 x 4) + 6. First, multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, then add 6, which makes 14. Again, 14 is not 48.\n\nOption D: (2 x 4) x 6. First, multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, and then multiply by 6, which gives 48. That matches!\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. (2 x 4) x 6.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check just to be sure. Maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nOption A: (24 + 4) + 6. That's just addition, no multiplication. 24 + 4 is 28, plus 6 is 34. No good.\n\nOption B: (2 + 4) x 6. That's 6 x 6, which is 36. Not 48.\n\nOption C: (2 x 4) + 6. That's 8 + 6, which is 14. Not 48.\n\nOption D: (2 x 4) x 6. That's 8 x 6, which is 48. Yep, that's the one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to express 8 x 6 using different numbers or operations. Let's see.\n\nFor example, 8 x 6 is the same as 2 x 24, because 2 times 24 is also 48. But that's not one of the options.\n\nOr, 8 x 6 could be expressed as 16 x 3, since 16 times 3 is also 48. But again, that's not an option here.\n\nAnother way could be 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8, since multiplication is repeated addition, but that's not listed either.\n\nSo, among the given choices, option D is the correct one.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any misinterpretation of the expressions.\n\nTake option D: (2 x 4) x 6. According to the order of operations, I do the multiplication inside the parentheses first, which is 2 x 4 = 8, and then multiply by 6, which is 8 x 6 = 48.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this expression? Maybe if I considered the associative property of multiplication, which states that the way factors are grouped does not change the product. So, (2 x 4) x 6 is the same as 2 x (4 x 6), which is 2 x 24 = 48. Either way, it's still 48.\n\nSo, definitely, option D is the correct choice.\n\nI think that's clear enough. No need to overcomplicate it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
