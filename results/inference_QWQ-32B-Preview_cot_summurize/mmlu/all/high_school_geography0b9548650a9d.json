                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's asking which capital city is located outside the central core area of the country. The options are Abuja, Nigeria; Paris, France; London, United Kingdom; and Cairo, Egypt. I need to figure out which one of these capitals isn't in the central part of its country.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what is meant by the \"central core area.\" I think it refers to the geographical center or the heartland of the country, where maybe the majority of the population or the main economic activities are located.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Abuja, Nigeria. I know that Nigeria is in West Africa, and Abuja was chosen as the capital in 1976 or something like that, to be more central than the previous capital, Lagos, which is on the coast. So, I think Abuja is in the center of Nigeria. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNext, Paris, France. France is in Western Europe, and Paris is located in the north-central part of the country. I believe it's considered quite central in terms of both geography and importance.\n\nLondon, United Kingdom. The UK consists of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. London is in southeastern England. I wonder if that's considered the central core area. Maybe for England, but not for the entire UK.\n\nThen, Cairo, Egypt. Egypt is in North Africa, stretching from the Sinai Peninsula in the northeast to the Red Sea in the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Libya to the west, and Sudan to the south. Cairo is located near the Nile Delta, in the north of the country. I think Egypt's central core might be elsewhere, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at maps or recall some geographical facts.\n\nLet me think about Nigeria first. Nigeria is quite a large country, and Abuja was indeed built to be a more central capital compared to Lagos, which is on the coast in the southwest. So, if Abuja was chosen for its central location, it should be in the center of the country.\n\nParis is known as the heart of France, both culturally and politically. France is relatively compact, and Paris is near the center. So, I don't think Paris is outside the central core area.\n\nLondon is in southeastern England, but the UK includes other countries like Scotland and Wales. Scotland is to the north of England, and Wales is to the west. So, in terms of the entire UK, London might not be in the central core area of the whole country. But historically and politically, it's the capital.\n\nCairo is in northern Egypt, while a significant part of Egypt is to the south, extending down the Nile River to Aswan and beyond. So, perhaps Cairo isn't in the central core area of Egypt.\n\nNow, comparing these, I need to see which one is the most clearly outside the central core area.\n\nAbuja seems central in Nigeria, Paris in France, London perhaps not entirely central in the UK, and Cairo in the north of Egypt.\n\nMaybe between London and Cairo, one of them is more outside the central core area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Abuja was moved from Lagos specifically because Lagos wasn't central.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the reason for choosing these capitals.\n\nAbuja was indeed planned to be a more central capital for Nigeria, replacing Lagos, which was considered too coastal and not representative of the entire country.\n\nParis has been the capital of France for centuries, and it's in a central location.\n\nLondon has been the capital of England and then the UK for a long time, and while it's in the southeast, it's still considered the heart of the country.\n\nCairo has been the capital of Egypt for a long time, but I wonder if there's a reason it's not in the central part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trickier than I thought. Maybe none of them are in the exact geographical center, but one is more off-center than the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the population distribution or economic activity when defining the \"central core area.\"\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about where the majority of each country's population or economic activity is concentrated.\n\nFor example, in the UK, a large portion of the population and economic activity is concentrated in London and the southeast. So, London is at the core in that sense.\n\nIn France, Paris is similarly the economic and population center.\n\nIn Egypt, while Cairo is the capital and has a large population, perhaps the central core in terms of population or economy is elsewhere.\n\nWait, no, Cairo is the largest city and the main economic hub of Egypt.\n\nIn Nigeria, Lagos was the former capital and is still the largest city and economic hub, while Abuja is the political capital.\n\nSo, perhaps in Nigeria, the central core is around Lagos, and Abuja was chosen to be more representative politically.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the geographical locations more carefully.\n\nLet me look up the geographical centers of these countries.\n\nFirst, Nigeria: I think Nigeria is roughly in the shape of an irregular rectangle, extending from the coast in the south to the Sahel in the north. Abuja is located in the center of the country, between the north and the south.\n\nParis is in the north-central part of France, which seems central.\n\nLondon is in the southeast of the UK, but the UK also extends northward to Scotland.\n\nCairo is in the north of Egypt, near the Mediterranean coast, while Egypt extends southward along the Nile.\n\nComparing these, Cairo seems to be located at one end of the country, while the rest of the country extends southward.\n\nSimilarly, London is in the southeast, while the UK extends northward.\n\nAbuja is in the center of Nigeria, and Paris is in the center of France.\n\nSo, between London and Cairo, which one is more outside the central core area?\n\nPerhaps Cairo, since Egypt is mostly a north-south country, and Cairo is at the northern end.\n\nLondon, while in the southeast, the UK is more of a north-south country as well, but London is closer to the center than Cairo is in Egypt.\n\nWait, no, the UK extends much further west than London, with Wales and Scotland.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps London is more central in terms of population distribution, since a large portion of the population is in southeastern England.\n\nBut in Egypt, Cairo has a huge population, but Egypt's population is also concentrated along the Nile, so perhaps Cairo is still central in terms of population distribution.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider the historical context.\n\nWas Cairo always the capital of Egypt? I think so, for thousands of years.\n\nLondon has been the capital of England for a long time, and then of the UK.\n\nAbuja was planned to be the capital of Nigeria to be more central.\n\nParis has been the capital of France for centuries.\n\nPerhaps the question is about capitals that were moved from coastal or non-central locations to more central locations.\n\nIn that case, Abuja was moved from Lagos, which was more coastal.\n\nBut I don't know if Paris or London were moved from other locations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about capitals that are not in the geographical center.\n\nIn that case, perhaps all of them are not in the exact center, but one is the farthest from the center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about capitals that are located in a different region from the majority of the population or economic activity.\n\nFor example, in Nigeria, while Abuja is central, the economic hub is Lagos, which is in the southwest.\n\nBut in France, Paris is both the political and economic center.\n\nIn the UK, London is both the political and economic center.\n\nIn Egypt, Cairo is both the political and economic center.\n\nSo, perhaps Abuja is the one that's moved away from the economic center.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the criterion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about capitals that are located in regions that are not dominant in terms of ethnicity or culture.\n\nFor example, in Nigeria, Abuja was chosen to be more representative of the different ethnic groups.\n\nSimilarly, in Egypt, Cairo is the dominant cultural and political center.\n\nI'm getting too speculative here.\n\nMaybe I need to stick to geographical considerations.\n\nLet me consider the map of each country.\n\nNigeria: Abuja is in the center, between the north and the south.\n\nFrance: Paris is in the north-central part, which seems central.\n\nUnited Kingdom: London is in the southeast, while Scotland is to the north and Wales to the west.\n\nEgypt: Cairo is in the north, near the Mediterranean, while the rest of the country extends southward along the Nile.\n\nComparing these, Cairo seems to be located at one end of the country, while the rest extends southward.\n\nSimilarly, London is in the southeast, while the country extends northward.\n\nBut in the case of Egypt, the distance from Cairo to Aswan, for example, is quite substantial, whereas in the UK, the distance from London to Edinburgh is about 400 miles, which is also significant.\n\nBut perhaps in Egypt, the north-south axis is longer, making Cairo more peripheral in terms of the entire country.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the location relative to the country's main areas of interest or resources.\n\nFor example, in Egypt, perhaps the central core is around the Nile, and Cairo is at the northern end.\n\nBut Cairo is still in the Nile Valley.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central core is around Memphis or somewhere else.\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just make an educated guess.\n\nBetween the options, Abuja was specifically chosen to be central, Paris is central in France, London is central in terms of the UK's population and economy, and Cairo is central in Egypt's population and economy.\n\nBut perhaps Cairo is more at one end of the country compared to the others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the location relative to the country's borders.\n\nFor example, Cairo is close to the Mediterranean border, while Abuja is inland in Nigeria.\n\nBut London is also coastal.\n\nWait, London is on the Thames Estuary, which opens into the North Sea.\n\nSo, both London and Cairo are coastal cities, while Abuja and Paris are more inland.\n\nBut the question is about being outside the central core area, not necessarily coastal.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe I should consider the population distribution.\n\nIn Nigeria, Abuja is in the center, but the population is more concentrated in the south, around Lagos.\n\nIn France, Paris is the population center.\n\nIn the UK, population is concentrated in the southeast, around London.\n\nIn Egypt, population is concentrated along the Nile, with Cairo being the largest concentration.\n\nSo, perhaps Abuja is in a less populated area compared to the other capitals.\n\nBut again, the question is about being outside the central core area of the country.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central core area refers to the historical heartland of the country.\n\nFor example, in Egypt, the historical heartland might be around Thebes or other ancient cities, which are south of Cairo.\n\nBut that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the capital being located in a different region from the rest of the country.\n\nFor example, if a capital is on an island while the rest of the country is on the mainland, or something like that.\n\nBut none of these options fit that description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the capital being located near the border with another country.\n\nFor example, Cairo is near the border with Libya and Sudan, but not exactly on the border.\n\nLondon is near the English Channel and the Strait of Dover.\n\nAbuja is inland in Nigeria.\n\nParis is near the English Channel and close to Calais.\n\nPerhaps proximity to borders is a factor.\n\nBut again, all of them are near some borders.\n\nThis is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe I should just look at the straight geographical center of each country.\n\nFor example, the geographical center of Nigeria might be somewhere near Abuja, making it central.\n\nFrance's geographical center is somewhere near Clermont-Ferrand, I think, which is south of Paris.\n\nBut Paris is still considered central.\n\nThe geographical center of the UK is in England, I believe, perhaps near Burton-upon-Trent.\n\nLondon is southeast of that point.\n\nEgypt's geographical center is somewhere in the middle of the Nile Valley, perhaps near Assyut.\n\nCairo is north of that.\n\nSo, in that sense, Cairo is not in the geographical center of Egypt.\n\nSimilarly, London is not in the geographical center of the UK.\n\nBut neither are Abuja or Paris necessarily in the exact geographical centers of their countries.\n\nSo, perhaps the question is about which capital is the farthest from its country's geographical center.\n\nBut I don't know the exact distances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the capital not being in the largest city or the economic hub.\n\nIn that case, Abuja is not the largest city or the economic hub of Nigeria, while Paris, London, and Cairo are their countries' largest cities and economic hubs.\n\nSo, perhaps Abuja is the one located outside the central core area in that sense.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider the purpose behind choosing each capital.\n\nAbuja was chosen to be a more neutral capital, away from the coastal south.\n\nParis has been the capital of France for centuries, and it's central.\n\nLondon is the capital of the UK, and while it's in the southeast, it's been the capital for a long time.\n\nCairo is the capital of Egypt and has been for a long time.\n\nPerhaps the question is about a capital that was moved from a coastal location to a more central location, like Abuja from Lagos.\n\nBut I don't know if that's the case for the other options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about a capital that is not located in the largest city or the historical capital.\n\nIn Nigeria, Abuja replaced Lagos as the capital.\n\nIn France, Paris has been the capital for a long time.\n\nIn the UK, London has been the capital for a long time.\n\nIn Egypt, Cairo has been the capital for centuries.\n\nSo, perhaps Abuja is the one that is outside the central core area in the sense that it was built to be a new capital, away from the main economic center.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the capital being located in a different region from the rest of the country.\n\nFor example, if a capital is on an island while the rest of the country is on the mainland.\n\nBut none of these fit that description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the capital being located in a less populated area.\n\nAbuja is in a less populated area compared to Lagos in Nigeria.\n\nParis is in a highly populated area.\n\nLondon is in a highly populated area.\n\nCairo is in a highly populated area.\n\nSo, perhaps Abuja is the one located outside the central core area in terms of population density.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the distance of each capital from its country's geographical center.\n\nIf I could find the geographical centers of these countries and see which capital is farthest from that center, that might be the answer.\n\nBut I don't have that information readily available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the capital not being in the main urban area.\n\nFor example, in Nigeria, Lagos is the main urban area, and Abuja was built separately.\n\nIn France, Paris is the main urban area.\n\nIn the UK, London is the main urban area.\n\nIn Egypt, Cairo is the main urban area.\n\nSo, perhaps Abuja is the one outside the central core urban area.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the capital being located in a region that is not the traditional heartland of the country.\n\nFor example, in Nigeria, the north and the south have different histories and ethnic compositions, and choosing Abuja as the capital was to have a neutral location.\n\nSimilarly, in Egypt, Cairo is the traditional heartland.\n\nIn France and the UK, Paris and London are the traditional heartlands.\n\nSo, perhaps Abuja is again the one outside the central core area in that sense.\n\nBut I'm just speculating.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look up which of these capitals is not in the central core area of its country.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is miswritten, and all of them are in the central core areas of their countries.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is London, because in the UK, Scotland and Wales are separate nations, and London is in England, which might not be considered the central core area for the entire UK.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Cairo, because Egypt extends southward along the Nile, and Cairo is in the north.\n\nBut again, Cairo is the main political and economic center.\n\nI'm really not sure.\n\nMaybe I should just pick Abuja, since it was specifically chosen to be a new capital in a central location, away from the previous capital, Lagos.\n\nBut I have a feeling that might not be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the capital being located on an international border or something like that.\n\nBut none of these capitals are directly on international borders.\n\nAbuja is inland in Nigeria.\n\nParis is near the English Channel and close to Calais.\n\nLondon is on the Thames Estuary.\n\nCairo is near the Mediterranean.\n\nBut none of them are actually on the border with another country.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the capital being located in a different time zone from part of the country.\n\nBut all of these countries are within a single time zone, I believe.\n\nNigeria is in one time zone, France is in one time zone, the UK is in one time zone, and Egypt is in one time zone.\n\nSo, that doesn't seem relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the capital being located in a different climate zone from part of the country.\n\nFor example, in Nigeria, the south is more tropical, while the north is drier.\n\nAbuja is in the central part, which might have a different climate.\n\nBut similar variations exist in the other countries.\n\nFrance has different climates from the north to the south.\n\nThe UK has different climates from the south to the north.\n\nEgypt has desert climate throughout, but perhaps different regions have different microclimates.\n\nSo, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the capital being located in a region with a different language or ethnic group.\n\nFor example, in Nigeria, Abuja is in the center, away from the south or the north, to be neutral among the different ethnic groups.\n\nSimilarly, in Egypt, Cairo is predominantly Arab, which might be representative.\n\nIn France, Paris is in the north-central part, which is Francophone.\n\nIn the UK, London is in England, which is English-speaking.\n\nSo, perhaps Abuja is chosen to be neutral among different ethnic groups, whereas the other capitals are in areas dominated by certain ethnic groups.\n\nBut that might not be the criterion the question is looking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the capital not being located in the most populous city or the economic hub.\n\nIn that case, Abuja is not the most populous city or the economic hub of Nigeria, while Paris, London, and Cairo are.\n\nSo, perhaps Abuja is the capital located outside the central core area in that sense.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nMaybe I should just make an educated guess and go with Abuja.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
