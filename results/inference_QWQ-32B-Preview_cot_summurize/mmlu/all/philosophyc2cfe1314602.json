Let's see:\n\nOption A says, \"perform the action that leads to the greatest total happiness.\" Hmm, that sounds familiar. Isn't that more related to utilitarianism? Like, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill's ideas? They were all about maximizing happiness and minimizing pain for the greatest number of people. But Kant was different, right? He had a more deontological approach, focusing on duties and rules rather than outcomes.\n\nOption B says, \"act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.\" Yeah, that rings a bell. Kant's categorical imperative is all about acting according to principles that could be universalized. So, if everyone were to act on the same principle, would it make sense or lead to a contradiction? If it does lead to a contradiction, then that maxim shouldn't be acted upon. That seems like a key part of Kant's ethics.\n\nOption C is, \"behave only in such a way as a perfectly virtuous person would behave.\" This sounds a bit like virtue ethics, where the focus is on the character of the moral agent rather than on the principles or consequences of actions. But Kant was more about duty and universal moral laws, not so much about emulating a perfect virtue. So, maybe not this one.\n\nOption D says, \"place the interests of others above the interests of ourselves.\" That sounds altruistic, and certainly morality often involves considering others' well-being. But Kant also emphasized treating people as ends in themselves, not just as means to an end. His formula of humanity says that in our actions, we should always treat humanity, whether in our own person or in that of another, always as an end and never merely as a means. So, it's about respecting people's dignity and autonomy, not just prioritizing their interests over our own.\n\nComparing all these options, Option B seems to align most closely with Kant's philosophy. His categorical imperative, which is central to his moral theory, is indeed about acting on maxims that can be universalized. It's about following moral laws that are universally applicable, based on reason, and not on personal desires or consequences.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
