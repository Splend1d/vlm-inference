Let me make sure about the other options to be confident.\n\nA. Front-loading refers to scheduling a primary or caucus early in the election calendar to gain media attention and influence the nomination process. That doesn't seem related to drawing district lines.\n\nB. Prior restraint is a legal concept that involves censorship or prevention of speech or publication before it occurs. It's not about political districts.\n\nC. Reapportionment is the process of redistributing the number of seats in a legislative body based on population changes, usually after a census. While it's related to adjusting political boundaries, it's not specifically about favoring one party.\n\nSo, gerrymandering seems to be the correct term for drawing district lines to benefit a particular party. I've heard about cases where districts are shaped in unusual ways to include or exclude certain voters, which fits this description.\n\nTo be thorough, I should confirm that none of the other options fit better. Front-loading is about scheduling elections, prior restraint is about censorship, and reapportionment is about adjusting the number of seats based on population. None of these directly relate to manipulating district boundaries for political advantage.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D. gerrymandering.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
