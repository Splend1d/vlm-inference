                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about when fetishism typically develops. The options are ages 30 through 50, at birth, 10 through 20, or 20 through 30. I don't know much about this topic, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what fetishism is. From what I recall, fetishism is when someone has a sexual attraction to objects, body parts, or non-genital areas that aren't typically considered sexual. For example, someone might have a fetish for high heels or leather.\n\nNow, I need to think about when this kind of attraction usually starts developing in people. I know that sexual preferences and interests can develop at different times for different people, but maybe there's a general age range when fetishism typically emerges.\n\nLet me consider option B: at birth. That seems unlikely because sexual attraction and fetishes are complex aspects of human sexuality that develop over time. Infants are not sexually attracted to objects or body parts in the way that fetishism is defined. So, I can probably rule out option B.\n\nOption A is ages 30 through 50. Hmm, that seems a bit late. I would think that sexual preferences and fetishes develop earlier in life. Many people explore their sexuality in their teens and twenties, so it seems odd that fetishism would typically develop later in adulthood.\n\nOption C is ages 10 through 20. This seems more plausible. Adolescence and early adulthood are times when people start exploring their sexuality and developing their sexual preferences. It's possible that fetishism could develop during this period as individuals become more aware of their sexual attractions and interests.\n\nOption D is ages 20 through 30. This is also a possible time frame for the development of fetishism. Many people continue to explore and understand their sexual preferences into their twenties and beyond.\n\nBetween options C and D, I need to decide which one is more accurate. I think that fetishism, like many sexual preferences, can develop in adolescence, which is typically between ages 10 and 20. However, it's also possible that some people may not discover or act on their fetishes until later in life.\n\nMaybe I should look for some information to confirm this. I remember that psychological development plays a role in sexual preferences. During adolescence, individuals go through significant physical and emotional changes, which can influence their sexual attractions.\n\nAdditionally, exposure to certain stimuli or experiences during this time could contribute to the development of fetishes. So, it makes sense that fetishism might develop during ages 10 through 20.\n\nOn the other hand, some sources might suggest that fetishism can develop at different times for different people, and it's not strictly limited to a particular age range.\n\nGiven the options provided, I think option C, ages 10 through 20, is the most appropriate answer. It aligns with the general understanding that sexual preferences and fetishes often develop during adolescence and early adulthood.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
