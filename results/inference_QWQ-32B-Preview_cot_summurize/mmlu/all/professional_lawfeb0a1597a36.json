                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what's going to happen with the defendant's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an indictment with two counts: felony murder and arson. The defendant was found guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. Now, the defense attorney wants to set aside that guilty verdict for felony murder. So, we need to think about why they might be doing that and whether it makes sense legally.\n\nOption A says the motion will be granted because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights. Hmm, that sounds serious. Plain error usually means a clear and obvious mistake that affects the fairness of the trial. But is that the case here?\n\nWell, the issue is that the jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. Now, felony murder typically requires that a death occurs during the commission of a felony, like arson. So, if the defendant wasn't guilty of arson, how could they be guilty of felony murder based on that arson?\n\nThis seems a bit inconsistent. Maybe that's why the defense is arguing that it's a mistake. But is it necessarily a constitutional error? Maybe not directly. It might be more of a logical inconsistency in the verdicts.\n\nOption B says the motion will be granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges. This seems to be getting at the inconsistency I was just thinking about.\n\nIn criminal cases, inconsistent verdicts can sometimes occur, and the law has to handle them somehow. In some situations, if the verdicts are logically inconsistent, it might be possible to challenge them.\n\nFor example, if to commit felony murder, you have to commit the underlying felony, which in this case is arson, then how can you be guilty of felony murder without being guilty of arson? It seems contradictory.\n\nBut, I recall that in some jurisdictions, inconsistent verdicts are allowed as long as there's sufficient evidence to support each verdict independently. So, maybe the jury just made a mistake, but it's still valid.\n\nOption C says the motion will be denied because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error. This seems to be saying that, even if there's some inconsistency, it's not enough to overturn the verdict.\n\nOption D says the motion will be denied because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek appellate review for a non-constitutional error. This suggests that any error here isn't constitutional, and the defendant should go through the regular appeals process.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to decide which one is most likely correct.\n\nFirst, is this a constitutional error? I don't think so. The inconsistency might be a problem, but it doesn't rise to the level of a constitutional violation. So, option A might be too strong.\n\nOption B is appealing because it points out the inconsistency. But I wonder if inconsistency alone is enough to set aside a guilty verdict. In some cases, juries can be unpredictable, and as long as there's evidence to support each verdict, it might stand.\n\nOption C suggests that the verdicts, despite inconsistency, don't amount to reversible error. This seems plausible. Maybe the court would say that, even with the inconsistency, there was enough evidence to support the felony murder conviction independently of the arson charge.\n\nOption D says that the defendant should seek appellate review for a non-constitutional error. This seems like a procedural answer, indicating that the motion to set aside might be denied, and the defendant would have to appeal if they want to challenge the verdict further.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option C is the most appropriate. The verdicts, though inconsistent, do not necessarily constitute a reversible error. The felony murder conviction can stand on its own if there's sufficient evidence to support it, even if the arson charge was acquitted.\n\nMoreover, it's not uncommon for juries to return inconsistent verdicts, and courts often uphold them unless there's a clear legal barrier.\n\nSo, I would go with option C: the motion will be denied because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
