                    "text": "So I've got this question about Brill Co. and their expenditures related to Product X. They've spent money on labor and materials for a prototype, testing the prototype, and legal costs to file a patent. The production started when the patent was granted. Now, I need to figure out how much of these costs should be expensed as research and development costs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what qualifies as research and development (R&D) costs. From what I know, R&D costs typically include expenses incurred in the process of developing a new product or improving an existing one. This can include both research costs, which are aimed at gaining knowledge, and development costs, which apply that knowledge to create a new product.\n\nIn this case, the expenditures are:\n\n1. Labor and material costs incurred in producing a prototype: $100,000\n\n2. Cost of testing the prototype: $40,000\n\n3. Legal costs to file a patent: $50,000\n\nProduction commenced when the patent was granted, which suggests that the patent was successfully obtained.\n\nNow, I need to categorize these costs:\n\n- The labor and material costs for the prototype seem like development costs because they're directly related to creating the product.\n\n- The testing costs are also part of the development process to ensure the prototype works as expected.\n\n- The legal costs to file the patent are different. These are costs associated with protecting the intellectual property once the development is complete and the product is ready to be produced.\n\nAccording to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), development costs that can be capitalized must meet certain criteria, such as the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, among others.\n\nIn this scenario, since production commenced when the patent was granted, it suggests that the product has reached its technical feasibility and is ready for production. Therefore, the costs up to that point might be considered for capitalization if they meet the criteria for capitalization of development costs.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the amount that should be expensed as research and development costs. This implies that not all of these costs are capitalized; some might need to be expensed immediately.\n\nLet's look at each cost again:\n\n1. Labor and material costs for the prototype: These are development costs. If the criteria for capitalization are met, these could be capitalized. But if not, they should be expensed.\n\n2. Testing costs: Similar to the prototype costs, these are part of the development process and would be subject to the same capitalization criteria.\n\n3. Legal costs to file the patent: These are typically capitalized as they are directly related to the acquisition of the intangible asset (the patent).\n\nBut the question is about expensing R&D costs, so perhaps the legal costs are not considered R&D expenses.\n\nGiven that, maybe only the prototype and testing costs are considered R&D costs.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. $40,000\n\nB. $100,000\n\nC. $140,000\n\nD. $145,000\n\nOption A is $40,000, which is just the testing cost.\n\nOption B is $100,000, which is only the prototype cost.\n\nOption C is $140,000, which is the sum of prototype and testing costs.\n\nOption D is $145,000, which is the sum of prototype, testing, and legal costs.\n\nIf legal costs are not considered R&D expenses, then the total R&D costs would be $100,000 (prototype) + $40,000 (testing) = $140,000.\n\nBut I need to make sure about the treatment of these costs.\n\nAccording to GAAP, development costs can be capitalized if certain criteria are met, including:\n\n- The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset.\n\n- The intent and ability to complete the development and use or sell the asset.\n\n- How the asset will generate probable future economic benefits.\n\n- The availability of resources to complete the development.\n\n- The ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the development activity.\n\nIn this case, since production commenced when the patent was granted, it seems that the technical feasibility has been established, and the other criteria are likely met. Therefore, these development costs might be eligible for capitalization.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the amount that should be expensed as R&D costs. If the costs are capitalized, they are not expensed immediately but amortized over time.\n\nBut perhaps not all of these costs meet the capitalization criteria, or maybe under certain circumstances, they need to be expensed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the legal costs are considered part of the R&D costs.\n\nWait, perhaps the legal costs are separate and should be capitalized as part of the patent asset, distinct from R&D expenses.\n\nIn that case, the R&D expenses would be the prototype and testing costs.\n\nBut the question is asking for the amount that should be expensed as R&D costs.\n\nIf these costs are capitalized, then they are not expensed immediately, but if they don't meet the capitalization criteria, they would be expensed.\n\nBut according to the scenario, production commenced when the patent was granted, suggesting that the development is complete and the asset is ready for use, so perhaps these costs should be capitalized.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the amount that should be expensed, implying that some or all of these costs are to be expensed.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that not all companies capitalize development costs, or perhaps under certain circumstances, these costs must be expensed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only certain components are expensed.\n\nI need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the prototype and testing costs are considered part of the R&D process and are expensed, while the legal costs are capitalized as part of the patent asset.\n\nIn that case, the total R&D expenses would be $100,000 + $40,000 = $140,000.\n\nBut option C is $140,000.\n\nHowever, option D is $145,000, which includes the legal costs as well.\n\nBut legal costs are not typically considered R&D expenses; they are more related to protecting the intellectual property.\n\nTherefore, perhaps only the prototype and testing costs are R&D expenses, totaling $140,000.\n\nBut let me consider if any of these costs should be expensed immediately.\n\nIf the development costs are capitalized, then they are not expensed immediately but amortized over their useful life.\n\nHowever, if they don't meet the capitalization criteria, they would be expensed.\n\nBut in this case, since production has commenced, it seems likely that the criteria are met, and the costs should be capitalized.\n\nTherefore, perhaps none of these costs should be expensed as R&D costs.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the amount that should be expensed as R&D costs.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that all these costs are R&D costs, and they should be expensed unless they meet the capitalization criteria.\n\nBut the question is about what amount should be expensed, implying that some costs need to be expensed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only part of these costs should be expensed.\n\nWait, maybe the prototype and testing costs are R&D costs, and the legal costs are separate.\n\nIf the R&D costs are capitalized, then they are not expensed immediately, but if they are not capitalized, they are expensed.\n\nBut the question is asking for the amount that should be expensed as R&D costs, so perhaps it's asking for the total R&D costs that need to be expensed, assuming that they are not capitalized.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company chooses to expense them immediately for some reason.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. $40,000\n\nB. $100,000\n\nC. $140,000\n\nD. $145,000\n\nOption A is just the testing cost, which seems too low.\n\nOption B is just the prototype cost.\n\nOption C is the sum of prototype and testing costs.\n\nOption D is the sum of all three costs.\n\nIf legal costs are not considered R&D expenses, then option C makes sense.\n\nBut if legal costs are included in R&D expenses, then option D would be correct.\n\nHowever, I think legal costs are more related to the patent acquisition and should be capitalized separately, not as part of R&D expenses.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer is $140,000.\n\nBut let me consider another angle.\n\nMaybe the prototype and testing costs are considered part of the R&D process and should be expensed, while the legal costs are capitalized.\n\nIn that case, $140,000 should be expensed.\n\nAlternatively, if the development costs are capitalized, then only the research costs would be expensed, but in this case, it seems like both prototype and testing are development costs.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to consider that all R&D costs are expensed unless they meet the capitalization criteria, and in this case, since production has commenced, the costs should be capitalized.\n\nBut the question is asking for the amount that should be expensed, so perhaps none of these costs should be expensed, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company chooses to expense them for strategic reasons, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the legal costs are capitalized, and the prototype and testing costs are expensed.\n\nIn that case, $140,000 should be expensed.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that under GAAP, development costs can be capitalized if certain criteria are met, but many companies choose to expense them nonetheless.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the $140,000 should be expensed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the testing costs are expensed, and the prototype costs are capitalized, making the expensed amount $40,000.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the prototype costs are capitalized, and both testing and legal costs are expensed, totaling $90,000, but that's not an option.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\n- Prototype costs: development costs, potentially capitalizable.\n\n- Testing costs: development costs, potentially capitalizable.\n\n- Legal costs: costs to acquire the patent, separately capitalizable.\n\nTherefore, the R&D costs would be the prototype and testing costs, totaling $140,000.\n\nIf these costs are capitalized, they are not expensed immediately, but if they are expensed, it means they are not capitalized.\n\nTherefore, the amount that should be expensed as R&D costs is $140,000.\n\nHence, option C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the legal costs should also be included as R&D costs, making the total $145,000, but I think legal costs are more related to the patent acquisition and not directly to the R&D process.\n\nTherefore, I think $140,000 is the correct amount to be expensed as R&D costs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nc. $140,000\n"
