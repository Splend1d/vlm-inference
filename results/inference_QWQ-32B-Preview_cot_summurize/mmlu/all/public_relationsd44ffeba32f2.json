What is predicted to be the main driver of this?\" And the options are A. Online consumer goods purchases, B. Video, C. Music, D. Online auctions.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what's driving internet traffic nowadays. I know that with the rise of streaming services, people are watching a lot more videos online, like movies, TV shows, and YouTube content. So, video seems like it could be a big contributor.\n\nMusic is also streamed a lot, but I feel like music files are generally smaller than videos, so maybe they don't consume as much data. Although, with high-quality audio, maybe that's not always the case.\n\nOnline consumer goods purchases involve shopping online, which includes looking at product pages, maybe some images and short videos, but overall, I think the data usage per purchase is less compared to streaming video.\n\nOnline auctions, like eBay or other platforms, probably involve similar data usage to online shopping, with images and sometimes videos of items, but again, not as data-intensive as streaming video.\n\nSo, if I had to guess, I'd say that video is the main driver of increased internet traffic. I remember reading somewhere that video streaming accounts for a large percentage of internet traffic, something like over 80%.\n\nLet me see if I can recall why video consumes so much data. It's because videos have high resolution, high frame rates, and often in HD or higher qualities, which require more bandwidth. Plus, with the increasing popularity of 4K and even 8K content, that's going to demand even more data.\n\nAlso, think about the number of people who are streaming videos on multiple devices simultaneously, like smart TVs, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. That multiplies the data usage.\n\nMusic streaming is definitely on the rise too, with services like Spotify and Apple Music, but again, audio files are generally smaller than video files.\n\nOnline purchases involve browsing products, which might include lots of images, but probably not as data-intensive as streaming video. And online auctions are similar.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is B. Video.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are other factors. For example, is there a surge in online gaming that could be driving internet traffic? Hmm, gaming does consume data, especially online multiplayer games, but I think video streaming is still bigger.\n\nAlso, with the Internet of Things (IoT), more devices are connected to the internet, but individually, they might not consume that much data compared to video streaming.\n\nAnother thing is cloud storage and syncing, where people store their files on cloud services like Dropbox or Google Drive. But again, while this can consume data, especially for large files, it's probably not as significant as video streaming.\n\nSo, all things considered, I believe that video is the main driver of the expected 400% growth in internet traffic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
