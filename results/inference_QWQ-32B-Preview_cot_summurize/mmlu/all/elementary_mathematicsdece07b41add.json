                    "text": "So Lily has a bag of candy and she wants to give it away to either 5, 3, or 2 people, and she wants to make sure that each person gets an equal number of pieces. That means the total number of candies has to be divisible by 5, 3, and 2 without any remainder.\n\nSo, I need to find which number among 12, 20, 30, and 45 can be divided evenly by 5, 3, and 2.\n\nLet me think about this. If a number is divisible by 5, 3, and 2, it means that the number is a multiple of all these numbers. To find such a number, I should look for the least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 3, and 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the LCM of 5, 3, and 2.\n\n- The prime factors of 5 are just 5.\n\n- The prime factors of 3 are just 3.\n\n- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.\n\nThe LCM would be the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in these numbers. So, LCM = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 30.\n\nSo, the smallest number that is divisible by 5, 3, and 2 is 30.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\nA. 12\n\n- Divisible by 2 and 3, but not by 5. Because 12 \u00f7 5 = 2.4, which is not a whole number.\n\nB. 20\n\n- Divisible by 2 and 5, but not by 3. Because 20 \u00f7 3 \u2248 6.666, which is not a whole number.\n\nC. 30\n\n- Divisible by 2, 3, and 5.\n\n- 30 \u00f7 2 = 15\n\n- 30 \u00f7 3 = 10\n\n- 30 \u00f7 5 = 6\n\nD. 45\n\n- Divisible by 3 and 5, but not by 2. Because 45 \u00f7 2 = 22.5, which is not a whole number.\n\nSo, only 30 is divisible by 2, 3, and 5.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is multiple choice, and it's possible that there are multiple correct answers, but in this case, only 30 seems to fit the criteria.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption A: 12\n\n- 12 \u00f7 5 = 2.4 \u2192 not whole number \u2192 cannot divide equally among 5 people.\n\nOption B: 20\n\n- 20 \u00f7 3 \u2248 6.666 \u2192 not whole number \u2192 cannot divide equally among 3 people.\n\nOption C: 30\n\n- 30 \u00f7 2 = 15\n\n- 30 \u00f7 3 = 10\n\n- 30 \u00f7 5 = 6\n\nAll whole numbers, so it works.\n\nOption D: 45\n\n- 45 \u00f7 2 = 22.5 \u2192 not whole number \u2192 cannot divide equally among 2 people.\n\nSo, indeed, 30 is the only number that fits all the criteria.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of candies must be a multiple of the LCM of 5, 3, and 2, which is 30. So any multiple of 30 would work, but among the options given, only 30 is listed.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
