Treaties are to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\nThis principle is established by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which is the primary source of international law governing treaties. According to this article, the interpretation of a treaty should consider the following:\n\n1. The ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty in their context: This means that the words used in the treaty should be given their usual and natural meaning, taking into account the specific context in which they are used.\n\n2. The context includes the text of the treaty as a whole, any protocols, annexes, or other related documents, and any subsequent agreements or practices that may have modified or clarified the treaty's meaning.\n\n3. The object and purpose of the treaty: This refers to the overall goals and intentions that the parties had when entering into the treaty. Understanding the treaty's objectives can help interpret specific provisions in a way that is consistent with those goals.\n\nOption B is incomplete because it ignores the importance of context and the object and purpose of the treaty, which are crucial for a comprehensive interpretation.\n\nOption C focuses solely on the preparatory works and the intention of the parties, which, according to the Vienna Convention, are only to be used for clarification if the interpretation based on the ordinary meaning is ambiguous or leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable (Article 32).\n\nOption D is too narrow because it only considers the object and purpose, ignoring the ordinary meaning and the context, which are fundamental to treaty interpretation.\n\nTherefore, option A accurately reflects the principles of treaty interpretation as per international law."
