                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about retrotransposons, and I need to pick the most accurate description from these options.\n\nOption A says: \"A DNA sequence that can move from one site in the genome to another without replicating.\" Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think this might be describing a transposon, specifically a class of mobile genetic elements called \"class II transposable elements\" or sometimes just \"transposons.\" They can cut themselves out of one location and paste themselves into another without making a copy. But retrotransposons are different, right?\n\nOption B says: \"A DNA sequence that can be deleted from the genome without consequence.\" Well, that seems a bit vague. There are certainly parts of the genome that can be deleted without immediate harm, like some non-coding regions or redundant copies of genes. But I don't think this describes retrotransposons specifically.\n\nOption C says: \"A DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate.\" Now, this rings a bell. Retrotransposons are known for moving around the genome by being transcribed into RNA, then that RNA is reverse-transcribed back into DNA, which is then inserted into a new location. So, they do replicate via an RNA intermediate. That sounds promising.\n\nOption D says: \"A DNA sequence that replicates via a protein intermediate.\" I'm not sure what this means exactly. Maybe it's referring to some other mechanism where a protein is involved in the replication or movement of the DNA sequence. But for retrotransposons, the key is the RNA intermediate, not a protein.\n\nLet me double-check. Retrotransposons are a type of transposable element that moves by being copied via an RNA intermediate and then integrated back into the DNA. This process involves the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which converts the RNA back into DNA.\n\nSo, comparing that to the options:\n\n- Option A describes movement without replicating, which doesn't match the replication step in retrotransposons.\n\n- Option B is about deletions without consequence, which isn't related to retrotransposons.\n\n- Option C mentions replication via an RNA intermediate, which aligns with the definition of retrotransposons.\n\n- Option D mentions a protein intermediate, which isn't the characteristic feature of retrotransposons.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is Option C: \"A DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
