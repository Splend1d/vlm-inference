                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character is doing something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I placed my mobile phone in its new case.\" So, here, someone is putting a new case on their own phone. Is there anything wrong with that? It seems like a normal thing to do. You buy a new phone case, and you put it on your phone to protect it or make it look nice. I don't see any moral issues here. It's not like they're stealing the phone or damaging someone else's property. It's their own phone and case, so it should be fine.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"While my parents were fast asleep, I mowed their yard.\" So, in this scenario, someone is mowing their parents' yard while their parents are asleep. Again, is there anything morally wrong with this? Mowing the yard is a responsible thing to do, and if it's their parents' yard, maybe they're helping out or doing their chores. Doing it while their parents are asleep might be to surprise them or to get it done without bothering them. I don't see any moral wrongdoing here either. It's a helpful act, actually.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to be morally acceptable. The first one is just taking care of your own possessions, and the second one is being helpful to your parents. Neither seems to involve any moral wrongdoings according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
