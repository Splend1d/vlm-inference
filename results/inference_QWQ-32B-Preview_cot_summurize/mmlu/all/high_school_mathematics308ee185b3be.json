                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: It defines a operation called \"star,\" denoted by $\\star$, where $a \\star b = a^b - ab$. And it says that $2 \\star x = 22$, and I need to find the value of $x$ from the given options: 5, 22, 11, or 6.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what $2 \\star x$ means according to the definition. So, $2 \\star x = 2^x - 2x$. And this is equal to 22. So, the equation I need to solve is:\n\n$$2^x - 2x = 22$$\n\nNow, I have to find the value of $x$ that satisfies this equation. Since it's a multiple-choice question, I could just plug in the options and see which one works. That might be the easiest way here, especially since the operation involves exponentiation, which can be tricky to solve algebraically.\n\nLet's start with option A: $x = 5$.\n\nPlug in $x = 5$:\n\n$$2^5 - 2(5) = 32 - 10 = 22$$\n\nOh, that's exactly 22. So, option A works.\n\nBut wait, I should check the other options to make sure there isn't another value that also satisfies the equation.\n\nOption B: $x = 22$.\n\n$$2^{22} - 2(22)$$\n\n$2^{22}$ is a really large number, 4,194,304, minus 44 is still a huge number, way bigger than 22. So, that's not correct.\n\nOption C: $x = 11$.\n\n$$2^{11} - 2(11) = 2048 - 22 = 2026$$\n\nThat's not 22, so option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: $x = 6$.\n\n$$2^6 - 2(6) = 64 - 12 = 52$$\n\nThat's not 22 either.\n\nSo, the only correct option is A: $x = 5$.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me see if there are any other real solutions to the equation $2^x - 2x = 22$.\n\nI know that $2^x$ grows exponentially, and $2x$ grows linearly, so they usually intersect at most twice.\n\nWe already have one solution at $x = 5$. Is there another solution?\n\nLet's consider smaller values of $x$.\n\nFor $x = 4$:\n\n$$2^4 - 2(4) = 16 - 8 = 8$$\n\nWhich is less than 22.\n\nFor $x = 3$:\n\n$$2^3 - 2(3) = 8 - 6 = 2$$\n\nStill less than 22.\n\nFor $x = 5$, we have 22, as we saw.\n\nAnd for $x = 6$, we have 52, which is greater than 22.\n\nSo, it seems like $x = 5$ is the only integer solution among the options provided.\n\nWait, but let's think about fractional or negative values of $x$, though the options only include positive integers, so maybe that's beyond the scope of this problem.\n\nFor example, if $x = 4.5$, what would $2^{4.5} - 2(4.5)$ be?\n\n$2^{4.5} = 2^{9/2} = \\sqrt{2^9} = \\sqrt{512} \\approx 22.627$, minus 9, which is approximately 13.627, still less than 22.\n\nSimilarly, $x = 5$ gives exactly 22, and $x = 5.5$ would give $2^{5.5} - 2(5.5) = 2^{11/2} - 11 \\approx 35.777 - 11 = 24.777$, which is greater than 22.\n\nSo, there might be another solution between $x = 5$ and $x = 5.5$, but since the options are integers, and $x = 5$ is already a perfect solution, I don't need to look further.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $x = 5$, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
