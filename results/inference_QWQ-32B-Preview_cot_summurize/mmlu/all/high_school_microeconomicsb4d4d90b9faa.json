Negotiations to obtain a wage floor\n\nI think this is about unions bargaining with employers to set a minimum wage, or a wage floor, for their members. That sounds like a common practice in collective bargaining. So, this seems like something unions would do to increase wages.\n\nB. Restrictive membership policies\n\nThis might be about limiting the number of people who can join the union or the workforce in a particular sector. By restricting membership, unions can control the supply of labor, which might help in driving up wages because there are fewer workers competing for the same jobs. So, this seems like another method unions might use.\n\nC. Efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. Substitute resources could be other types of labor or even machinery that can replace human workers. If unions try to decrease the prices of these substitutes, that might make them more attractive to employers, which could potentially put downward pressure on wages. Wait, that doesn't seem like something unions would do to increase wages. In fact, it might have the opposite effect. Unions usually want to protect their members' jobs and wages, so encouraging the use of cheaper substitutes wouldn't align with that goal.\n\nD. Featherbedding or make-work rules\n\nFeatherbedding refers to rules that require employers to hire more workers than necessary or to have workers do tasks that aren't essential. Make-work rules are similar, where workers are required to perform additional tasks that don't necessarily add value but increase labor costs. By increasing labor costs and demand for workers, this can lead to higher wages. So, this seems like another method unions might use to increase wages.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems like option C doesn't align with the goal of increasing wages. In fact, it might work against it by making substitutes more attractive. So, I think the answer is C. Efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
