We have a fully connected neural network with two hidden layers, and we need to find out how many parameters it has in total.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a fully connected network, each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. The parameters of each connection are the weights and biases.\n\nSo, for each layer, the number of parameters is determined by the number of inputs to that layer and the number of neurons in that layer.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Input dimension: 100\n\n- First hidden layer: 1000 neurons\n\n- Second hidden layer: 10 neurons\n\n- Output layer: 1 scalar (so, 1 neuron)\n\nLet's calculate the parameters layer by layer.\n\n**First hidden layer:**\n\n- It has 1000 neurons.\n\n- Each neuron is connected to all 100 input features.\n\n- Therefore, the number of weights in this layer is 1000 * 100 = 100,000.\n\n- Additionally, each neuron has a bias term, so there are 1000 biases.\n\n- Total parameters for the first hidden layer: 100,000 (weights) + 1000 (biases) = 101,000.\n\n**Second hidden layer:**\n\n- It has 10 neurons.\n\n- Each neuron is connected to all 1000 neurons from the first hidden layer.\n\n- Therefore, the number of weights in this layer is 10 * 1000 = 10,000.\n\n- Each neuron has a bias term, so there are 10 biases.\n\n- Total parameters for the second hidden layer: 10,000 (weights) + 10 (biases) = 10,010.\n\n**Output layer:**\n\n- It has 1 neuron.\n\n- This neuron is connected to all 10 neurons from the second hidden layer.\n\n- Therefore, the number of weights in this layer is 1 * 10 = 10.\n\n- Additionally, there is 1 bias term.\n\n- Total parameters for the output layer: 10 (weights) + 1 (bias) = 11.\n\nNow, to find the total number of parameters in the network, we sum up the parameters from all layers:\n\nTotal parameters = parameters in first hidden layer + parameters in second hidden layer + parameters in output layer\n\nTotal parameters = 101,000 + 10,010 + 11\n\nLet's add these up:\n\n101,000\n\n+ 10,010\n\n= 111,010\n\nThen,\n\n111,010\n\n+ 11\n\n= 111,021\n\nSo, the total number of parameters in the network is 111,021.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 111021\n\nB. 110010\n\nC. 111110\n\nD. 110011\n\nThe correct answer is A. 111021.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{111021} \\]"
