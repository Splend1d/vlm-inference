                    "text": "So, Samantha has 342 baseball cards and Perry has 184. We need to find out how many more cards Samantha has than Perry. The question is basically asking for the difference between the number of cards Samantha has and the number Perry has.\n\nTo find the difference, I need to subtract the smaller number from the larger number. So, I'll subtract 184 from 342.\n\nLet me write that down: 342 - 184.\n\nNow, let's do the subtraction step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract the units place: 2 - 4. But 2 is less than 4, so I need to borrow from the tens place.\n\nThe tens place in 342 is 4, so I'll borrow 1 from there, making it 3, and the units place becomes 12.\n\nNow, 12 - 4 = 8.\n\nNext, subtract the tens place: 3 - 8. Again, 3 is less than 8, so I need to borrow from the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds place in 342 is 3, so I'll borrow 1 from there, making it 2, and the tens place becomes 13.\n\nNow, 13 - 8 = 5.\n\nFinally, subtract the hundreds place: 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 342 - 184 = 158.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 158\n\nB. 168\n\nC. 258\n\nD. 268\n\nThe correct answer is A. 158.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my subtraction to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again: 342 - 184.\n\nUnits: 2 - 4 needs borrowing. Borrow 1 from tens place (4 becomes 3), units become 12. 12 - 4 = 8.\n\nTens: 3 - 8 needs borrowing. Borrow 1 from hundreds place (3 becomes 2), tens become 13. 13 - 8 = 5.\n\nHundreds: 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nSo, 158 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can add 158 to 184 to see if I get 342.\n\n184 + 158:\n\nStart with units: 4 + 8 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nTens: 8 + 5 = 13, plus the carried over 1 makes 14. Write down 4, carry over 1.\n\nHundreds: 1 + 1 = 2, plus the carried over 1 makes 3.\n\nSo, 184 + 158 = 342. That checks out.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 158, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
