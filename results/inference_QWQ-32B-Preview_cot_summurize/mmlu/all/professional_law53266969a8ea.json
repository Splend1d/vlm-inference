                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, we have a farm and an orchard, adjoining pieces of land. In 2006, a farmer buys the farm, which is 10 acres, in fee simple absolute. The orchard, which is 20 acres to the north, is owned by a rancher, also in fee simple absolute.\n\nNow, way back when, a remote predecessor of the farmer granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the farm. This was done in such a way that an easement appurtenant to the orchard was created. This means that there's a right-of-way across the farm that benefits the orchard. This was done by deed and properly recorded, but interestingly, the shepherd never actually used this right-of-way.\n\nFast forward to 2010, the rancher sells the orchard to the farmer. Then, the next year, the farmer sells the orchard to an investor for $250,000, and neither the rancher-farmer deed nor the farmer-investor deed mentions this easement.\n\nNow, the investor is claiming that she has a right-of-way across the farm, but the farmer is saying no such easement exists. The question is, in a lawsuit by the investor to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the farm, what should happen?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Lose, because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard from the rancher.\n\nB. Lose, because the right-of-way was abandoned due to no actual use.\n\nC. Win, because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement.\n\nD. Win, because the investor acquired an easement by implication.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, option A mentions merger. In property law, when the same person owns both the dominant and servient estates, the easement merges and is extinguished. Here, the farmer bought the orchard from the rancher in 2010, so at that point, the farmer owned both the farm (servient estate) and the orchard (dominant estate). So, did the easement merge at that point?\n\nWell, generally, yes, but there's a catch. If the farmer then sells the orchard to someone else, does the easement spring back to life? In other words, does the severance of the merged estates revive the easement?\n\nI think it does. Because when the farmer sells the orchard to the investor, the dominant estate is separated from the servient estate again, and the easement should remain in place, provided it was properly created and recorded.\n\nSo, maybe option A isn't correct, or at least, it's not the whole story.\n\nOption B suggests that the easement was abandoned because it was never used. But in property law, non-use alone doesn't constitute abandonment of an easement. There needs to be an intent to abandon, usually accompanied by some act or statement indicating that intent. Since the shepherd never used the right-of-way, but there's no indication of an intent to abandon, this option might not hold water.\n\nOption C says the investor should win because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement. Constructive notice typically means that someone is presumed to know about something because it's a matter of public record. Since the easement was created by deed and properly recorded, anyone searching the title would find it. So, the farmer should have known about it when buying the orchard.\n\nBut the farmer sold the orchard to the investor without mentioning the easement. Does that mean the investor still has the benefit of the easement?\n\nWell, in general, when property is sold, the buyer takes subject to existing easements, especially those that are recorded. So, even if the deed doesn't mention the easement, the investor might still have the benefit of it.\n\nOption D mentions acquiring an easement by implication. This is a bit different. Easements by implication arise when there's a necessity or a reasonable necessity for the use of one parcel of land for the enjoyment of another. But in this case, the easement was already created by deed, so it's not a matter of implying a new easement; it's about whether the existing easement survives the transactions.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best answer is C. The investor should win because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement, which should pass to the investor upon sale, even if not mentioned in the deed.\n\nOption A might be incorrect because the severance of the merged estates upon sale to the investor could revive the easement.\n\nOption B is likely invalid because non-use doesn't equal abandonment without an intent to abandon.\n\nOption D isn't quite fitting because it's not a matter of implying a new easement but recognizing an existing one.\n\nSo, I think C is the way to go.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
