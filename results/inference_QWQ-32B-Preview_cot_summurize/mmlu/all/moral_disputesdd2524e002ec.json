                    "text": "I'm going to attempt to answer this question about Metz's thoughts on dignity-based arguments against capital punishment based on African values. The question presents four options, and I need to determine which one correctly identifies why Metz thinks these arguments fail.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Metz's critique of these arguments. I remember that Metz is a philosopher who has written about moral and political philosophy, including issues related to African ethics. In his work, he often engages with African moral theories and their applications to contemporary issues.\n\nOption A suggests that it's unclear whether these dignity-based arguments show that capital punishment is degrading and therefore wrong. This seems plausible because Metz might be arguing that the concept of dignity is too vague or that the link between capital punishment and degradation isn't clearly established in these arguments.\n\nOption B states that these arguments prove too much, meaning they have unintended consequences. Specifically, it says that they seem to entail that any instance of killing in self-defense is wrong. This could be a problem because if the argument against capital punishment also implies that self-defense is wrong, which is generally considered acceptable, then the argument might be too broad.\n\nOption C combines both A and B, suggesting that both issues are problems with these arguments.\n\nOption D says none of the above, which would mean that Metz's critique is different from what's presented in A and B.\n\nTo decide between these options, I need to recall Metz's specific points. I think Metz argues that dignity-based arguments against capital punishment, when grounded in African values, face challenges in clearly demonstrating why capital punishment is degrading. So, option A seems relevant.\n\nAdditionally, Metz might be pointing out that if these arguments are formulated in a certain way, they could inadvertently condemn other forms of killing that are widely accepted, such as killing in self-defense. This would be a problem because it would make the argument less plausible to those who accept self-defense as morally permissible.\n\nTherefore, both A and B seem to be valid concerns that Metz might raise against these arguments. So, option C, which combines both, might be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether Metz actually raises both of these objections. Perhaps he only focuses on one of them. I need to think back to the specific text or article where he discusses this.\n\nI recall that in one of his articles, Metz critiqued dignity-based arguments against capital punishment for being too abstract and not sufficiently connected to the concrete practices and values in African ethical traditions. This aligns with option A, as it suggests that the arguments don't clearly show how capital punishment is degrading.\n\nMoreover, Metz might argue that if dignity is invoked to condemn capital punishment, it should also condemn other practices that similarly degrade human dignity, possibly including certain forms of self-defense that involve killing. This could be seen as the argument proving too much, as in option B.\n\nGiven this, it seems that both A and B are relevant criticisms that Metz might level against these arguments. Therefore, option C, which includes both A and B, is likely the correct answer.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider whether there might be another issue that Metz raises, which would make option D more appropriate. But based on my recollection of his work, I don't think there's another major critique that he makes beyond these points.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the answer is C: both A and B. Metz thinks that extant dignity-based arguments based on African values fail because it's unclear that they show capital punishment is degrading and therefore wrong, and also because they seem to entail that any instance of killing in self-defense is wrong, which is an undesirable conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
