The question is asking about what kind of social sanction this is. Social sanctions are basically ways that society rewards or punishes behavior. There are formal and informal ones, and positive and negative ones.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between formal and informal sanctions. Formal sanctions are official actions taken by institutions or authorities, like laws or rules enforced by schools or governments. Informal sanctions, on the other hand, are more subtle and come from social groups, like friends or peers, and can be things like approval, disapproval, teasing, or ridicule.\n\nNow, positive sanctions are rewards for behavior that society approves of, while negative sanctions are punishments for behavior that society disapproves of.\n\nIn this case, the behavior in question is thumb-sucking in kindergarten, and the response is teasing and ridicule from peers. So, it seems like the peers are disapproving of this behavior, and they're expressing that disapproval through teasing and ridicule.\n\nGiven that, it sounds like this is a negative sanction because it's a form of punishment or disapproval for the behavior. And since it's coming from peers and not from an official authority or institution, it should be considered informal.\n\nSo, putting that together, it should be an informal negative sanction.\n\nLet me double-check the options:\n\nA. Formal positive sanction - that doesn't fit because it's not a reward, and it's not coming from an official source.\n\nB. Formal negative sanction - it's negative, but it's not formal; it's coming from peers.\n\nC. Informal positive sanction - it's informal, but it's negative, not positive.\n\nD. Informal negative sanction - that seems to fit perfectly.\n\nYeah, I think D is the correct answer here.\n\nIt's important to understand that social sanctions can play a big role in shaping behavior, even if they're informal. Teasing and ridicule can be powerful motivators for kids to change their behavior to fit in with their peers.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that while peers might be applying this sanction, it's not necessarily based on any objective standard of right or wrong. Thumb-sucking at that age might not be harmful, but peers might still disapprove of it for various reasons, maybe because they see it as babyish or unusual.\n\nThis example also highlights how social interactions can influence child development and behavior. It's something that educators and parents might need to be aware of and perhaps address sensitively, to ensure that children don't feel bullied or unnecessarily pressured to change their behavior.\n\nOverall, the answer is D: Informal negative sanction."
