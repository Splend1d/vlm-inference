I've got this dataset that includes information about computer science majors in colleges across the U.S. For each student, it has their gender, the state where they attend college, and their GPA on a 4.0 scale. Now, I need to figure out which of the questions can be answered using only this data set.\n\nOption A asks: \"Do students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects?\" Hmm, the issue here is that our data set only includes computer science majors. It doesn't have any information about students majoring in other subjects. So, we can't compare computer science majors' GPAs to those of other majors because that data isn't present in our set. Therefore, this question can't be answered with the given data.\n\nOption B: \"How many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male computer science majors attending college in that state?\" Okay, so this is about the distribution of genders among computer science majors in each state. Since the data set includes the gender and the state of each computer science student, we can definitely calculate the percentage of females and males in each state and then determine how many states have a higher percentage of females. So, this question can be answered using the data set.\n\nOption C: \"What percent of students attending college in a certain state are majoring in computer science?\" This one is a bit tricky. The data set has information about computer science majors only, so we don't have the total number of students attending college in each state, including those who are not majoring in computer science. Without knowing the total number of students in each state, we can't calculate the percentage that are computer science majors. Therefore, this question can't be answered with the given data.\n\nOption D: \"Which college has the highest number of students majoring in computer science?\" The data set includes the state where each student attends college, but not the specific college or institution. So, we can't identify individual colleges and their student counts based on this data. We only know the state, not the specific college. Therefore, this question can't be answered with the given data.\n\nSo, out of all these options, only option B can be answered using the information provided in the data set.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
