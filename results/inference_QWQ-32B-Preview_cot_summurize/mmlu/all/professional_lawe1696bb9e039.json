                    "text": "So I've got this contract problem here, and I need to figure out what the market price of widgets should be taken as when determining damages for the buyer. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between a buyer and a seller for 10,000 widgets at $1 each, with delivery no later than September 30. So, the contract date is September 1, and the delivery date is by September 30.\n\nThen, on September 15, there's a worldwide shortage of widgets, causing the market price to spike. Because of this, the seller decides not to deliver the widgets and sends a letter to the buyer on September 15 stating that the widgets won't be delivered. The buyer receives this letter on September 20.\n\nFinally, the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract on October 15.\n\nNow, the question is about determining the market price of widgets for the purpose of calculating damages. The options are:\n\nA. The market price on September 1.\n\nB. The market price on September 15.\n\nC. The market price on September 20.\n\nD. The market price on September 30.\n\nTo answer this, I need to recall the principles of contract law regarding damages for breach of contract, specifically in cases involving goods and market price.\n\nI remember that in contract law, when there's a breach involving the sale of goods, the measure of damages is generally the difference between the contract price and the market price at a specific time.\n\nBut when exactly is that specific time? Is it the time of the breach, the time the buyer learns of the breach, or the time the goods were supposed to be delivered?\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nThe seller breached the contract by deciding not to deliver the widgets on September 15, but the buyer didn't know about it until September 20. The delivery was supposed to be by September 30, and the lawsuit was filed on October 15.\n\nI think the key here is to determine when the buyer had to cover, meaning when they had to purchase replacement widgets in the open market.\n\nIn contract law, for goods, the buyer can cover by making a good faith purchase or cancellation of goods in substitution. The measure of damages is then the difference between the contract price and the cost of cover.\n\nThe time for cover is typically when the buyer actually makes the cover purchase, but if they don't cover, then damages are assessed based on the market price at the time the goods were to be delivered.\n\nBut in this case, the seller notified the buyer on September 15 that they wouldn't deliver, and the buyer received the notice on September 20.\n\nSo, upon receiving notice of the breach, the buyer should make reasonable efforts to cover by purchasing widgets elsewhere to minimize their losses.\n\nTherefore, the market price relevant for damages would be the market price at the time the buyer received notice of the breach, which is September 20.\n\nWait, but the market price increased on September 15 due to the shortage. So, by September 20, the market price would already be higher.\n\nBut let's see what the options are:\n\nA. September 1: That's the contract date, before the market price increased. That doesn't seem right.\n\nB. September 15: The day the seller decided not to deliver and the market price increased.\n\nC. September 20: The day the buyer received notice of the breach.\n\nD. September 30: The original delivery date.\n\nI think the most appropriate date would be September 20, when the buyer learned of the breach and could then proceed to cover by purchasing widgets at the then-current market price.\n\nAlternatively, if the buyer didn't cover, damages could be assessed based on the market price at the time the goods were to be delivered, which is September 30.\n\nBut the question is about determining the market price, and it seems like the correct answer should be either September 20 or September 30.\n\nLooking back at the options, C and D are September 20 and September 30.\n\nI need to decide between these two.\n\nIf the buyer received notice on September 20, they should cover promptly to mitigate damages. So, the market price on September 20 would be relevant.\n\nHowever, if they didn't cover, then the market price at the time of the scheduled delivery, September 30, might be used.\n\nBut in contract law, the buyer is expected to cover promptly after learning of the breach to minimize losses.\n\nTherefore, September 20 seems like the more appropriate date.\n\nAdditionally, option D, September 30, is the delivery date, but by that time, the market price may have changed again, so using that date might not accurately reflect the buyer's losses.\n\nWait, but in some cases, for goods, damages are assessed as the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time the goods were to be delivered.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nYes, in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs sales of goods, damages for breach of contract are determined based on the market price at the time and place for delivery.\n\nSpecifically, UCC 2-708 provides that the measure of damages for non-delivery is the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach.\n\nWait, is that accurate?\n\nLet me look it up.\n\nUCC 2-708(1)(a): \"The measure of damages for non-delivery of goods is the difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price together with incidental damages provided in this article (Section 2-710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller's breach.\"\n\nSo, according to UCC 2-708(1)(a), the market price is determined at the time when the buyer learned of the breach.\n\nIn this case, the buyer learned of the breach on September 20.\n\nTherefore, the market price on September 20 should be used to calculate damages.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. The market price on September 20.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that might change this.\n\nFor example, if the buyer didn't cover on September 20 and waited until later, might the market price on September 30 be used instead?\n\nWell, according to the UCC, even if the buyer doesn't cover, the measure of damages is still based on the market price at the time the buyer learned of the breach.\n\nHowever, if the market price decreased between September 20 and September 30, and the buyer waited to cover, potentially, the damages could be assessed differently.\n\nBut based on UCC 2-708, it seems clear that the relevant date is when the buyer learned of the breach, which is September 20.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. The market price on September 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
