                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about Milgram's obedience study and its ethical criticisms. The options are lack of informed consent, nonrandom sampling procedures, violation of anonymity, and risk of psychological harm. I need to pick one, but I'm a bit unsure about which one is the primary ethical issue with Milgram's study.\n\nFirst, I remember that Milgram's study was about obedience to authority figures. Participants were told to administer electric shocks to another person if they answered questions incorrectly. Of course, the shocks were fake, but the participants didn't know that.\n\nNow, regarding informed consent, I think that's important in any research study. Participants should know what they're getting into. In Milgram's study, participants were told they would be testing the effects of punishment on learning, but they weren't fully informed about the nature of the study or the extent of the shocks they would be administering. So, lack of informed consent seems like a valid criticism.\n\nNonrandom sampling procedures might be a methodological issue, but I'm not sure if that's an ethical concern. Sampling methods can affect the generalizability of the results, but ethically, as long as participants are treated fairly, the sampling method might not be directly ethical in nature.\n\nViolation of anonymity could be an issue if participants' identities were revealed in some way, but in Milgram's study, participants were assigned numbers, and their identities were protected. So, I don't think that was a major ethical issue here.\n\nRisk of psychological harm is a big one. Many participants in Milgram's study experienced stress, anxiety, and emotional distress during the experiment. Some even requested to stop, but were encouraged to continue. After the study, Milgram provided a debriefing and revealed that the shocks were fake, but the psychological impact on some participants was significant. There were reports of people breaking down, sweating, trembling, and being extremely upset.\n\nIn fact, ethical review boards nowadays would likely not approve a study like Milgram's due to the potential for causing severe psychological distress to participants. The American Psychological Association has guidelines that emphasize the need to minimize harm and discomfort to participants.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the primary ethical criticism of Milgram's obedience study is the risk of psychological harm to participants. While lack of informed consent is also a valid point, the potential for causing lasting psychological damage seems more severe.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if multiple options could be correct. Lack of informed consent and risk of psychological harm are both ethical issues, but if I have to choose one, I'd go with the risk of psychological harm because it directly relates to the well-being of the participants.\n\nAlso, nonrandom sampling might not be ethical per se, but more of a methodological issue. And anonymity seems to have been preserved in Milgram's study.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: risk of psychological harm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
