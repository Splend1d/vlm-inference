Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ F = k \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( F \\) is the force between the charges,\n\n- \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant,\n\n- \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are the magnitudes of the charges,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between the charges.\n\nFrom this equation, it's clear that if the distance \\( r \\) between the charges is halved (i.e., the charges are placed twice as close to each other), the force \\( F \\) will be multiplied by a factor of \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{r}{2}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{2}{r} \\right)^2 = 4 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right)^2 \\). Therefore, the force becomes four times stronger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. four times as strong"
