                    "text": "So here's this scenario: a pilot and his girlfriend go flying, she's scared of flying but goes anyway. Then, the pilot decides to play a joke by shutting off the engine, causing the plane to nosedive. He says they're going to crash, she panics and screams, then he starts the engine again and lands safely. No one gets hurt physically, but she's really distressed. Now, she's thinking about suing him for intentional infliction of emotional distress. We need to figure out what's likely to happen in court.\n\nFirst, let's understand what intentional infliction of emotional distress is. It's a legal claim where someone argues that another person intentionally caused them severe emotional harm through extreme and outrageous behavior.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. She might recover because a reasonable person would be distressed by his actions. That makes sense; most people would be terrified if their plane started nosediving and they thought they were going to crash.\n\nB. She might recover because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous. Shutting off the engine mid-flight for a joke seems pretty extreme and outrageous, especially when you know the person is scared of flying.\n\nC. She might not recover because the pilot intended it as a joke and lacked sufficient intent for an intentional tort. But wait, he did intend to scare her, right? So, even if it was a joke, he meant to cause some fear. Is that enough intent for this kind of tort?\n\nD. She might not recover because there was no physical injury. Some courts require some sort of physical harm along with emotional distress to recover, but not always.\n\nLet's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, was the pilot's conduct intentional? It seems clear that he intended to shut off the engine and create the nosedive to scare her. So, intent is there.\n\nNext, was the conduct extreme and outrageous? Shutting off a plane's engine for a joke seems extremely reckless and outrageous, especially considering she was already scared of flying. It's not just a harmless prank; it endangered their lives.\n\nNow, did she suffer severe emotional distress? She became panic-stricken and screamed hysterically. That sounds like severe emotional distress to me.\n\nBut, there was no physical injury. Some jurisdictions require that there be some physical harm along with the emotional distress to recover damages. However, in many places, physical injury is not a prerequisite for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nConsidering all this, options A and B seem plausible because the pilot's actions were intentional, extreme, and caused severe emotional distress.\n\nOption C says she won't recover because it was a joke, and he lacked sufficient intent. But intent is present; he intended to scare her. The fact that it was a joke doesn't necessarily negate the intent required for this tort. In fact, intending to scare someone might meet the intent requirement.\n\nOption D suggests she won't recover because there was no physical injury. While physical injury isn't always required, some courts might require it. However, in many jurisdictions, purely emotional distress is compensable if the other elements are met.\n\nGiven that, I think the most likely answer is B: she will probably recover because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n\nBut let's consider another angle. Maybe the pilot could argue that she consented to going on the flight knowing she was scared, so she accepted some level of risk. However, consenting to go on a flight doesn't mean she consents to the pilot shutting off the engine for a joke.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pilot could argue that it was a joke between consenting adults, but given the potential for serious harm, it's hard to see this as a permissible joke.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the correct answer is B: she will probably recover because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
