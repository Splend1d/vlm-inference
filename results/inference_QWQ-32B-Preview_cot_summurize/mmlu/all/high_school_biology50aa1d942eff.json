                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about these terms. They all sound similar, but I know there are differences. Let's see:\n\nFirst, there's parasitism. I think that's when one species benefits at the expense of another. So, the host is harmed, and the parasite benefits. That doesn't match the description because the other species is unaffected in the question.\n\nNext, mutualism. That's when both species benefit from the interaction. So, both gain something positive. But the question says one benefits and the other is unaffected, so that doesn't fit either.\n\nCommensalism, now that sounds familiar. I think that's exactly what's being described: one species benefits, and the other is neither harmed nor benefited; it's unaffected. Let me make sure.\n\nAnd then, symbiosis. I think symbiosis is a broader term that includes any close living relationship between two different species. That would include parasitism, mutualism, and commensalism. So, it's a general term.\n\nGiven that, commensalism seems to be the specific type where one benefits and the other is unaffected.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's some overlap or exceptions I'm not aware of.\n\nFor example, in mutualism, both benefit, in parasitism, one benefits at the expense of the other, and in commensalism, one benefits and the other is neither harmed nor benefited.\n\nSymbiosis is more of an umbrella term.\n\nSo, for the question asked, the answer should be C. commensalism.\n\nStill, I should remember that in real-world scenarios, the lines can sometimes be blurred. What might seem neutral for one species could have slight impacts that aren't immediately obvious.\n\nBut based on the definitions, commensalism is the correct term for this type of interaction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
