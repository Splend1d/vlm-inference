The grammar is ambiguous.\n\nII. The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.\n\nIII. The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each statement means.\n\n**Statement I: The grammar is ambiguous.**\n\nA grammar is ambiguous if there exists at least one string that can be parsed in more than one way, i.e., it has more than one parse tree or derivation sequence.\n\nLet's check if our grammar is ambiguous. Consider the string \"(x)\". This string can be derived as follows:\n\n1. S \u2192 ( S )\n\n2. S \u2192 x\n\nSo, S \u21d2 ( S ) \u21d2 ( x )\n\nIs there another way to derive \"(x)\"? Let's see:\n\nIf we try to apply the first production again, but we can't because S is only replaced by ( S ) or x, and x doesn't contain S. So, there's only one way to derive \"(x)\". What about a longer string, like \"((x))\"?\n\nDerivation:\n\n1. S \u2192 ( S )\n\n2. S \u2192 ( S )\n\n3. S \u2192 x\n\nSo, S \u21d2 ( S ) \u21d2 ( ( S ) ) \u21d2 ( ( x ) )\n\nIs there another sequence? If we try:\n\nS \u2192 ( S )\n\nAnd then in the first S, apply S \u2192 x, but that would be ( x ), which is different. So, for \"((x))\", there's only one derivation path. It seems that for any string generated by this grammar, there's only one way to derive it.\n\nTherefore, this grammar is not ambiguous. So, statement I is false.\n\n**Statement II: The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.**\n\nTop-down parsing starts from the start symbol and attempts to derive the input string by expanding non-terminals according to the productions of the grammar.\n\nFor top-down parsing to work efficiently, the grammar should be left-recursive-free and have no common prefixes among different productions of the same non-terminal.\n\nIn our grammar:\n\nS \u2192 ( S )\n\nS \u2192 x\n\nThere is no left recursion here. Also, the two productions for S start with different symbols: one starts with '(', and the other starts with 'x'. Therefore, there are no shift-reduce conflicts in top-down parsing.\n\nHence, this grammar is suitable for top-down parsing. So, statement II is true.\n\n**Statement III: The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.**\n\nBottom-up parsing starts from the input string and attempts to reduce it back to the start symbol by applying the reverse of the productions.\n\nFor bottom-up parsing to work efficiently, the grammar should not have common prefixes in the right-hand sides of productions for the same non-terminal, and it should be free of certain types of conflicts.\n\nIn our grammar:\n\nS \u2192 ( S )\n\nS \u2192 x\n\nThe right-hand sides are \"( S )\" and \"x\", which don't have common prefixes. Therefore, there shouldn't be any reduce-reduce conflicts.\n\nMoreover, since there are no nested non-terminals that could cause shift-reduce conflicts, this grammar should be suitable for bottom-up parsing.\n\nThus, statement III is also true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatement I is false, while statements II and III are true. Therefore, the correct choice is:\n\nD. II and III only\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
