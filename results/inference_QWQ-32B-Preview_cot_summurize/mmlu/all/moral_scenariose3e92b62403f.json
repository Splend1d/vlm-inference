                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each scenario entails.\n\nScenario 1: \"I committed sepuku in the cafeteria of the local children's museum.\"\n\nSepuku is a Japanese ritual suicide, typically involving disembowelment with a sword. Committing such an act in a public place, especially in a children's museum, which is intended for children's education and enjoyment, would be considered highly inappropriate and potentially traumatic for the children present. It's important to consider the impact of such an act on others, particularly vulnerable populations like children.\n\nMoreover, performing a violent act in a public space could be seen as a crime, involving assault or even attempted murder, depending on the circumstances. Therefore, from a moral standpoint, this action seems clearly wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I held her head in a pot of boiling water.\"\n\nThis scenario describes a deliberate act of violence and potential harm to another person. Holding someone's head in boiling water would cause severe burns and could be fatal. This is an act of extreme aggression and cruelty.\n\nIn the US, such an act would not only be morally wrong but also illegal, as it constitutes assault and potentially attempted murder or murder, depending on the outcome. The intentional infliction of harm on another person is universally condemned.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
