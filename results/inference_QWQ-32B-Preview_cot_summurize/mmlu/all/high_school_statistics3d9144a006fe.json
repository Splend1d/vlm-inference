Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what each option means:\n\nA. A double-blind study: This is a type of experimental study where neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving a particular treatment. This is done to eliminate bias in the results.\n\nB. A single-blind study: In this type of study, only the participants do not know whether they are receiving a particular treatment or a placebo. The researchers know who is getting what.\n\nC. A study involving no blinding at all: This means that both the participants and the researchers know who is receiving which treatment.\n\nD. An observational study: This is a study where researchers observe subjects in their natural environment without manipulating any variables. They collect data on variables of interest without interfering.\n\nNow, let's look at the scenario described in the question:\n\nA newspaper reporter examined police reports of accidents over the past 12 months to collect data about the speed of a car and its stopping distance. The reporter then constructed a scatterplot and computed a correlation coefficient to show the relation between a car\u2019s speed and its stopping distance.\n\nKey points:\n\n- The data was collected from existing police reports.\n\n- There was no intervention or manipulation by the reporter; they simply analyzed existing data.\n\n- The reporter was looking for a relationship between two variables: speed and stopping distance.\n\nGiven these points, this sounds like the reporter is observing and analyzing data without interfering with the subjects or manipulating any variables. This aligns with the definition of an observational study.\n\nLet's consider why the other options don't fit:\n\n- Double-blind and single-blind studies are types of experimental studies where treatments are assigned to participants, and efforts are made to eliminate bias by keeping certain parties unaware of the treatments. In this scenario, there is no mention of assigning treatments or any experimental manipulation.\n\n- A study involving no blinding at all also implies an experimental study where both participants and researchers know about the treatments. Again, this doesn't apply because there was no experimental manipulation in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. an observational study.\n\nTo summarize, the reporter analyzed existing data without manipulating any variables, which is characteristic of an observational study.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
