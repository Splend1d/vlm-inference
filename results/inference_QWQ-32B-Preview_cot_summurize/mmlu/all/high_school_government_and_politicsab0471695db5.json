                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's about a term used in politics, \"gone native,\" in the context of a president's cabinet member. The options are pretty different, so I need to think carefully about what \"going native\" might mean in this scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"going native\" means in a political context. I know that in some areas, like anthropology or business, \"going native\" can mean adopting the customs or traits of a local culture. But in politics, especially regarding a cabinet member, it might have a different connotation.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says the cabinet member resigns to take a position as a consultant to lobbying groups. Hmm, that seems like the member is moving on to a new role after leaving the cabinet. Is this what \"going native\" refers to? I'm not sure. It doesn't sound directly related to the term I've heard before.\n\nOption B mentions that the cabinet member cedes control of his or her department to lifelong bureaucrats within the department. This could imply that the cabinet member is stepping back and letting career officials take the lead. Maybe \"going native\" means aligning with the permanent bureaucracy rather than bringing in their own agenda. That seems plausible.\n\nOption C says the cabinet member places his or her department's priorities above the president's. This could be seen as putting the interests of the department before those of the overall administration. Is this what \"going native\" means? It's possible, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption D involves accepting bribes or expensive favors from businesses regulated by his or her department. This seems more like corruption or ethical misconduct rather than \"going native.\" Maybe \"going native\" has a different meaning here.\n\nLet me try to recall where I've heard \"going native\" used in politics. I think it's sometimes used to describe politicians who are perceived as abandoning their party's principles or the president's agenda in favor of local interests or influences.\n\nGiven that, option B seems most aligned with that idea\u2014ceding control to lifelong bureaucrats within the department. This could mean that the cabinet member is letting the career officials, who may have their own ways of doing things, take over, perhaps prioritizing the department's traditional approaches over the president's directives.\n\nOption C also touches on prioritizing the department over the president, which aligns with \"going native\" in the sense of putting local or institutional interests before the overarching presidential agenda.\n\nBetween B and C, I think B is a better fit because it specifically mentions ceding control to bureaucrats, which implies a shift in power within the department away from the political appointee (the cabinet member) to the permanent staff.\n\nOption D seems more about ethical lapses rather than a shift in allegiance or priorities, so I think it's less likely.\n\nOption A is about resigning to consult lobbying groups, which might be a career move but doesn't directly relate to the term \"going native\" in the context of being a cabinet member.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is option B: cedes control of his or her department to lifelong bureaucrats within the department.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there's another meaning I might be missing. Maybe \"going native\" in this context means something else entirely.\n\nI've heard the term used in journalism to describe reporters who become too close to their sources, adopting their perspectives. Perhaps there's a similar concept in politics.\n\nApplying that to a cabinet member, it could mean aligning too closely with the interests of the department, which would align with option C.\n\nAlternatively, \"going native\" might refer to a political appointee adopting the culture or practices of the bureaucracy, which again points to option B.\n\nGiven that, both B and C seem plausible, but I think B is a clearer fit because it specifically mentions ceding control to bureaucrats, which directly implies a shift in power and influence within the department.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. The cabinet member cedes control of his or her department to lifelong bureaucrats within the department.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
