                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Aaron Beck's negative triad theory in depression. So, first things first, I need to recall what the negative triad is all about.\n\nAaron Beck is a renowned psychologist who made significant contributions to cognitive therapy, particularly in understanding and treating depression. His negative triad theory suggests that depressed individuals have a particular way of viewing themselves, the world, and the future. Essentially, they have negative schemas or beliefs in these three areas.\n\nOption A talks about coping with primary stresses like change, death, and monetary instability through withdrawal. While stressors can certainly contribute to depression, this option doesn't directly address the negative triad. The negative triad is more about the cognitive aspects\u2014how depressed people perceive themselves, the world, and the future\u2014rather than their coping mechanisms.\n\nOption B mentions that depressed individuals believe at least three individuals in a group view them negatively. This seems to touch on social perceptions, but it's too specific and doesn't capture the broad scope of the negative triad. The negative triad isn't just about social evaluation; it's about overall self-view, view of the world, and outlook on the future.\n\nOption C states that depressed individuals hold a negative view of themselves, the world, and their futures. This aligns perfectly with Beck's negative triad theory. According to Beck, depressed individuals have pervasive negative beliefs in these three areas:\n\n1. **Themselves:** They may see themselves as inadequate, unlovable, or worthless.\n\n2. **The World:** They might view the world as a hostile, untrustworthy, or unforgiving place.\n\n3. **The Future:** They often have a pessimistic outlook, expecting things to stay bad or get worse.\n\nOption D mentions three stages: separation anxiety, development of an external locus of control, and failure to achieve. While these concepts might be relevant in different theories of depression, they don't specifically represent Beck's negative triad. This option seems to be mixing different psychological concepts without directly addressing the negative triad.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option C: Depressed individuals hold a negative view of themselves, the world, and their futures.\n\nTo reinforce this, let's consider an example. Imagine someone who is depressed might think, \"I'm a failure and no one likes me\" (negative view of self), \"Everyone is against me and the world is unfair\" (negative view of the world), and \"Things will never get better, and I'll always feel this way\" (negative view of the future). These thoughts encapsulate the negative triad.\n\nUnderstanding the negative triad is crucial in cognitive therapy because the goal is to identify and challenge these negative beliefs, helping individuals develop a more balanced and positive perspective.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Aaron Beck's negative triad theory is central to cognitive therapy for depression.\n\n- The negative triad consists of negative views about oneself, the world, and the future.\n\n- Recognizing and modifying these negative beliefs is a key therapeutic approach in treating depression.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Beck, A.

By recognizing and addressing negative views about oneself, the world, and the future, cognitive therapy aims to help individuals overcome depression and develop more adaptive thought patterns.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n- Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)\n\n- Cognitive Therapy Techniques\n\n**Case Studies:**\n\n- Analysis of patients' thought patterns aligning with the negative triad.\n\n- Therapeutic interventions targeting specific aspects of the negative triad.\n\n**Discussion Questions:**\n\n- How might the negative triad manifest differently in various cultural contexts?\n\n- What role do environmental factors play in reinforcing the negative triad?\n\n**Ethical Considerations:**\n\n- Ensuring confidentiality in cognitive therapy sessions.\n\n- Respect for patients' autonomy in choosing treatment approaches.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAaron Beck's negative triad theory posits that depressed individuals hold negative views about themselves, the world, and the future. This theory is fundamental in cognitive therapy, guiding interventions aimed at modifying these negative beliefs to alleviate depression.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
