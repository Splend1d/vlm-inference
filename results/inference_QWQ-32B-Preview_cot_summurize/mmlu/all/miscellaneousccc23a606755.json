Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says that poverty is the index value of government services like Medicaid and public housing. Hmm, that sounds like it's about the value of assistance provided by the government to poor people, but I don't think that's how poverty is defined. Poverty is more about the lack of resources or income that falls below a certain threshold, not about the value of services provided.\n\nOption B talks about relative deprivation and changes in the distribution of income. Relative deprivation means comparing people's income or resources to others in society. So, if income inequality increases, relative deprivation might increase too. But I'm not sure if the US government defines poverty based on relative terms or on an absolute standard.\n\nOption C mentions an absolute level set in the 1960s and adjusted for inflation since then. This sounds familiar. I recall that the poverty line in the US was established a long time ago, and it's adjusted each year to account for changes in the cost of living. So, this seems like a plausible definition.\n\nOption D says poverty is a concept based on lifestyle and measured on a sliding scale based on individual needs. This sounds a bit vague. Lifestyle could mean different things to different people, and a sliding scale based on individual needs might be subjective. I don't think the government uses such a subjective measure for poverty.\n\nLet me think about this. The US government has an official poverty measure, right? I believe it's called the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). I think it's based on a threshold that was established in the 1960s, which was roughly three times the cost of a minimum food diet at that time. Since then, it has been adjusted each year based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation.\n\nSo, according to this, poverty is defined as an absolute level that was set in the past and adjusted for inflation over time. That matches with option C.\n\nOption B mentions relative deprivation, which is a different approach to measuring poverty. Some countries or researchers use relative poverty measures, where the poverty line is a percentage of the median income of the society. But in the US, the official poverty measure is an absolute one, adjusted only for inflation, not for changes in overall income distribution.\n\nOption D seems too subjective and doesn't align with the official government definition.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: an absolute level set in the 1960s and since adjusted to reflect inflation at the consumer level.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. The Federal Poverty Level is indeed based on the original thresholds established in the 1960s, and it is updated annually to account for inflation using the CPI. This means that the poverty line remains an absolute measure, not taking into account changes in overall living standards or consumption patterns over time.\n\nSo, yes, option C accurately describes how the US government defines poverty.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
