Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data, so it performs poorly on both the training data and new, unseen data. Overfitting, on the other hand, is when a model is too complex and captures not only the underlying pattern but also the noise in the training data, which makes it perform well on the training data but poorly on new data. Good fitting is when the model captures the underlying pattern well and generalizes correctly to new data. So, if a model can't model the training data nor generalize to new data, it's probably underfitting."
