                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which option best illustrates the use of the elastic clause. First, I need to remember what the elastic clause is. I think it's also known as the necessary and proper clause in the U.S. Constitution. It's in Article I, Section 8, and it allows Congress to make laws that are necessary and proper for carrying out its enumerated powers.\n\nOkay, so the elastic clause gives Congress some flexibility to pass laws that aren't specifically outlined in the Constitution but are needed to execute its constitutional duties. So, I need to look for an option where Congress is doing something that maybe isn't directly stated in the Constitution but is related to its powers.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"The Supreme Court allows a lower court ruling to stand by refusing to hear an appeal.\" Hmm, this seems more related to the Supreme Court's discretionary power to choose which cases to hear. It doesn't seem directly related to Congress or the elastic clause.\n\nOption B: \"A congressional committee prevents the full chamber from voting on legislation by delaying its report.\" This seems like a procedural maneuver within Congress. While it's something Congress does, it doesn't appear to be an exercise of the elastic clause. It's more about how Congress manages its own processes.\n\nOption C: \"Congress passes legislation establishing a national speed limit.\" Now, this sounds interesting. I don't recall the Constitution specifically giving Congress the power to set speed limits. But maybe it falls under some broader power, like regulating interstate commerce, since speeding could affect safety on interstate highways.\n\nOption D: \"A member of the House of Representatives introduces a bill to increase federal income tax rates.\" Well, Congress does have the power to levy taxes, as specified in the Constitution. So, this seems like a direct exercise of an enumerated power, not something that would require the elastic clause.\n\nBetween options C and D, D seems straightforward, but C might be more relevant to the elastic clause because establishing a national speed limit isn't explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. So, perhaps Congress is using the elastic clause to pass such legislation.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think about whether Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, and since highways are used for interstate travel and commerce, setting speed limits could be justified under that power. So, in that case, it might not need the elastic clause because it's directly related to the commerce clause.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elastic clause is being used to pass laws that are necessary and proper for executing its commerce regulatory powers.\n\nI'm a bit confused now. Maybe I need to consider that the elastic clause allows Congress to pass laws that are not only related to its enumerated powers but are also necessary and proper for carrying out those powers.\n\nIn that case, option C might be a good example because establishing a national speed limit could be seen as necessary and proper for regulating interstate commerce, even if the Constitution doesn't specifically mention speed limits.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, seems like a direct exercise of the taxation power, which is explicitly granted to Congress.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the best answer.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look back at what the elastic clause actually says.\n\nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 18 of the U.S. Constitution states: \"Congress shall have Power To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\"\n\nSo, it's about making laws that help execute the enumerated powers.\n\nIn option C, establishing a national speed limit could be seen as a law that is necessary and proper for regulating interstate commerce, which is an enumerated power.\n\nTherefore, this seems like a good illustration of the elastic clause in action.\n\nOption A is about the Supreme Court's discretionary review, which is related to the judicial branch, not Congress.\n\nOption B is about congressional procedures, not about\u7acb\u6cd5.\n\nOption D is about taxation, which is a direct enumerated power.\n\nSo, I think C is the best answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other options that could potentially involve the elastic clause.\n\nOption A: Supreme Court actions don't directly involve the elastic clause, as it pertains to Congress's lawmaking powers.\n\nOption B: This is more about internal congressional operations, not about passing laws under the elastic clause.\n\nOption D: Direct exercise of enumerated power, not needing the elastic clause.\n\nTherefore, C seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
