                    "text": "So here's this scenario involving property ownership and mortgages, and I need to figure out who's liable for the mortgage. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's Osgood, who inherited Desertacre from his father and farmed it until he retired in 2006. He then gave the property to Cutler \"for his use during his natural life.\" So, it sounds like Osgood gave Cutler a life estate in Desertacre. That means Cutler can use the property for his lifetime, but ownership might pass to someone else after that.\n\nAfter taking possession, Cutler mortgaged the property for $100,000. So, Cutler borrowed money and used the property as collateral for the mortgage.\n\nThen, in 2009, Osgood died, and his will devised Desertacre to his son, Desmond, with a remainder to Deirdre, subject to Cutler's mortgage. At that time, the property was worth $300,000.\n\nDesmond is hesitant about taking title because of the mortgage debt. Now, the question is: with respect to the mortgage, will Desmond be liable?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. LIABLE, because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.\n\nB. LIABLE, because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.\n\nC. NOT LIABLE, because there was no assumption of the mortgage.\n\nD. NOT LIABLE, because he did not personally grant the mortgage.\n\nOkay, so to determine liability for the mortgage, I need to understand the relationship between the mortgage and the property, as well as the parties involved.\n\nFirst, a mortgage is a security interest in property to secure the performance of a debt, usually a loan. The mortgagor (borrower) promises to repay the loan, and if they don't, the mortgagee (lender) can foreclose on the property.\n\nIn this case, Cutler is the one who executed the mortgage, meaning he borrowed the money and put Desertacre up as collateral.\n\nNow, Osgood conveyed Desertacre to Cutler for his life, so Cutler has a life estate. Then, Osgood died and willed the property to Desmond and Deirdre, subject to Cutler's mortgage.\n\nSo, Desmond is getting the property after Osgood's death, but subject to the existing mortgage that Cutler put on the property.\n\nHere's the key: when property is conveyed subject to a mortgage, the new owner typically takes the property encumbered by that mortgage. This means they don't necessarily assume the personal obligation to pay the mortgage, but the property itself remains collateral for the loan.\n\nAssuming the mortgage would require a specific agreement where Desmond promises to pay the mortgage debt. If there's no such assumption, Desmond isn't personally liable for paying the debt, but the mortgage lien stays on the property.\n\nSo, in this case, since the will says the property is devised to Desmond subject to Cutler's mortgage, it means the mortgage lien remains on the property, but Desmond isn't personally on the hook to pay the mortgage unless he specifically assumed the mortgage, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nTherefore, options C and D both suggest that Desmond is not liable because there was no assumption of the mortgage and because he didn't personally grant the mortgage.\n\nBut let's think carefully: if Desmond takes the property subject to the mortgage, does that mean he's liable for the mortgage debt?\n\nIn most jurisdictions, taking property subject to a mortgage means the property continues to secure the existing debt, but it doesn't necessarily make the new owner personally liable for paying the debt unless there's an assumption of the mortgage.\n\nSo, in this case, since there's no mention of Desmond assuming the mortgage, he shouldn't be personally liable for paying it.\n\nHowever, the mortgage lien remains on the property, so if the mortgage isn't paid, the lender could foreclose on Desertacre.\n\nBut the question is about liability for the mortgage, which probably refers to personal liability to make payments.\n\nGiven that, options C and D both suggest no liability, but let's see which one is more accurate.\n\nOption C says \"not liable, because there was no assumption of the mortgage.\"\n\nOption D says \"not liable, because he did not personally grant the mortgage.\"\n\nBoth seem correct, but option C might be a bit more precise because it highlights the key point: without assuming the mortgage, Desmond isn't personally liable for it.\n\nOption D is also correct because Desmond didn't create the mortgage; Cutler did.\n\nBut perhaps option C is more directly relevant because it refers to the absence of assumption, which is crucial in determining liability.\n\nWait, but in some jurisdictions, if the property is conveyed subject to the mortgage, and the conveyance doesn't include an assumption, the new owner might still be personally liable for the mortgage debt.\n\nHmm, I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me look up some law on this.\n\nAfter some research, I find that generally, when property is conveyed subject to a mortgage, the new owner takes the property encumbered by the mortgage, but isn't personally liable for the debt unless they assume the mortgage.\n\nAssuming the mortgage typically requires a written agreement where the new owner promises to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nIn this case, since there's no mention of Desmond assuming the mortgage, he shouldn't be personally liable for it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely C: not liable, because there was no assumption of the mortgage.\n\nOption D is also correct in that Desmond didn't grant the mortgage, but liability often depends on whether he assumed it.\n\nSo, I think C is the better answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider option A and B.\n\nOption A says liable because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.\n\nBut being a devisee doesn't automatically make him liable for the mortgage unless the will specifically makes him liable, which it doesn't seem to in this case.\n\nOption B says liable because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.\n\nBut, as I understand it, being subject to the mortgage means the property is encumbered by the mortgage, not that Desmond is personally liable for the debt.\n\nTherefore, options C and D are more accurate, but C emphasizes the key point about assumption.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C: not liable, because there was no assumption of the mortgage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
