So, the Nation of Islam is a religious and social movement that has been around for quite some time in the United States. It's important to understand who they appealed to, especially in the context of American history and society.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. British-born second generation immigrants from the Asian subcontinent. Hmm, that seems a bit off track. The Nation of Islam is primarily an American movement, and its focus has been on the African-American community. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nB. White Americans who wanted to convert to Islam. Well, Islam has attracted converts from various backgrounds, including white Americans. However, the Nation of Islam has had a particular focus on African-Americans and their experiences. While they may have had some white members or associates, their primary appeal wasn't to white Americans wanting to convert to Islam.\n\nC. African-Americans who felt excluded from the 'ethnic melting pot' in the USA. This seems more plausible. The Nation of Islam emerged in the early 20th century, during a time when African-Americans were facing significant discrimination and segregation. The idea of the \"melting pot\" suggests that all ethnic groups would blend together, but in reality, African-Americans were often excluded from this process. So, it makes sense that the Nation of Islam would appeal to African-Americans who felt marginalized and excluded from mainstream American society.\n\nD. African-Caribbeans who lived in the inner cities and had a distinctive youth culture. While African-Caribbeans have certainly contributed to American culture, especially in urban areas, the Nation of Islam's primary focus has been on African-Americans. Although there may be some overlap, this option seems a bit too specific and not directly aligned with the core appeal of the Nation of Islam.\n\nConsidering these points, I think the best answer is C: African-Americans who felt excluded from the 'ethnic melting pot' in the USA. The Nation of Islam provided a sense of identity, community, and empowerment for African-Americans who were dealing with racism and inequality in American society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
