                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a high school survey. They sent out a survey to a random sample of 75 students from last year's graduating class, and out of those, 27 didn't return the survey. Now, I need to decide what the best plan of action is. There are four options:\n\nA. Use the surveys that were returned and change the sample size to 48 for the analysis.\n\nB. Use the surveys that were returned and leave the sample size at 75 for the analysis.\n\nC. Randomly select 27 additional class members and send the survey to them.\n\nD. Follow up with those that did not return the survey to encourage them to respond.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, there were 75 students selected randomly, and 27 didn't return the survey. So, the number of returned surveys is 75 minus 27, which is 48. So, 48 surveys were returned.\n\nOption A suggests using those 48 returned surveys and changing the sample size to 48 for analysis. That seems logical because you only have data from 48 students who returned the survey.\n\nOption B says to use the 48 returned surveys but keep the sample size at 75 for analysis. That doesn't make much sense because you don't have data from all 75 students; only 48 responded.\n\nOption C proposes selecting another 27 students randomly and sending the survey to them. This would increase the sample size to 102, but the original sample was 75, and 27 didn't respond. Adding more participants might complicate things, and it's not directly addressing the issue of non-response.\n\nOption D suggests following up with the 27 who didn't return the survey to encourage them to respond. This could potentially increase the response rate and get more data, which is generally a good practice in survey research.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of each option.\n\nOption A: Using the 48 returned surveys and adjusting the sample size to 48. This is straightforward, but there's a risk of non-response bias. The 27 who didn't respond might have different characteristics or opinions from those who did respond, which could skew the results.\n\nOption B: Using the 48 returned surveys but keeping the sample size as 75 in the analysis. This doesn't make much sense statistically because you don't have data from all 75. It could lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nOption C: Selecting additional students. This might help in getting more responses, but it changes the original sample frame. The original sample was 75, and adding more students might not be representative of the same population, especially if the additional students are different in some way.\n\nOption D: Following up with non-respondents to encourage response. This is a common practice in survey research to improve response rates and reduce non-response bias. It's possible that some of those 27 students just needed a reminder or had forgotten to return the survey.\n\nConsidering these points, option D seems like the best plan of action. By following up with the non-respondents, you might increase the number of returned surveys, which would give you a larger sample size and potentially reduce bias.\n\nHowever, if following up doesn't yield any additional responses, then you might have to proceed with the 48 returned surveys, acknowledging the potential bias in your analysis.\n\nOption A is better than option B because at least you're being honest about the sample size you have data for. But ideally, you want as much data as possible to make your conclusions more reliable.\n\nOption C isn't bad, but it complicates things by changing the sample. It's better to stick with the original sample and try to get as much data from them as possible.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the best plan of action would be option D: follow up with those that did not return the survey to encourage them to respond. This approach aims to improve the response rate and minimize bias in the survey results.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
