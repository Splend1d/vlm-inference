                    "text": "So, I've got this case here about a 33-year-old guy who had a radical thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. During the surgery, there was some bleeding, and the docs had to tie off a few vessels on the left side of his neck. After the operation, his blood tests came back showing a calcium level of 7.5 mg/dL, albumin at 4 g/dL, and parathyroid hormone at 200 pg/mL.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what these values mean and how they relate to the surgery he underwent.\n\nSo, a radical thyroidectomy is a surgery where the entire thyroid gland is removed, along with some surrounding tissues, and sometimes lymph nodes, especially if there's cancer involved. Thyroid cancer can spread to nearby lymph nodes, so that's why they might remove those as well.\n\nNow, during the surgery, there was bleeding, and they had to ligate, or tie off, some vessels in the left side of his neck. That makes sense, as bleeding needs to be controlled during surgery.\n\nPostoperatively, his calcium level is 7.5 mg/dL. Normal serum calcium levels are usually around 8.5-10.5 mg/dL, so 7.5 is a bit low. Hypocalcemia, or low calcium levels, can be a complication of thyroid surgery, especially radical thyroidectomies, because the parathyroid glands can be accidentally injured or removed during the procedure.\n\nParathyroid glands are four tiny glands usually located behind the thyroid gland, and they regulate calcium levels in the blood through parathyroid hormone (PTH). If they're damaged or removed during thyroid surgery, PTH levels can drop, leading to hypocalcemia.\n\nIn this case, the PTH level is 200 pg/mL. Normal PTH levels vary depending on the lab, but generally, a normal range is around 10-65 pg/mL. So, 200 pg/mL is higher than normal, which seems counterintuitive if the patient has hypocalcemia.\n\nWait, hypocalcemia usually leads to an increase in PTH as the body tries to raise calcium levels. But in this case, the calcium is low, and PTH is high. That suggests that the parathyroid glands are trying to compensate for the low calcium by secreting more PTH, but for some reason, the calcium isn't rising appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the PTH isn't being measured correctly, or there's an issue with the assay. But assuming the lab values are accurate, perhaps there's a problem with the parathyroid glands' ability to respond to the increased PTH.\n\nBut wait, the patient had a radical thyroidectomy, and during the surgery, vessels were ligated on the left side of the neck. Could damage to certain vessels have affected the blood supply to the parathyroid glands, leading to their dysfunction?\n\nYes, that's a possibility. The parathyroid glands have specific blood supplies, and if their blood vessels are damaged during surgery, it could lead to ischemia and dysfunction of the glands.\n\nSo, I need to think about which vessels supply the parathyroid glands and which ones might have been ligated during the surgery.\n\nFirst, let's recall the vascular supply to the thyroid and parathyroid glands.\n\nThe thyroid gland is supplied mainly by the thyroid arteries, which are branches of the external carotid artery on the right side and the thyrocervical trunk on the left side.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Right thyroid artery: usually a branch of the right internal thyroid artery, which is a branch of the right external carotid artery.\n\n- Left thyroid artery: often a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, which arises from the subclavian artery.\n\nAdditionally, the inferior thyroid arteries supply the inferior poles of the thyroid gland and sometimes contribute to the blood supply of the parathyroid glands.\n\nThe parathyroid glands receive their blood supply from small branches of the inferior thyroid artery and sometimes from the superior thyroid artery.\n\nGiven that, if vessels were ligated on the left side of the neck during the surgery, and those vessels supplied the parathyroid glands, that could lead to ischemia and dysfunction of the parathyroid glands, resulting in hypocalcemia.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Branch of the costocervical trunk\n\nB. Branch of the external carotid artery\n\nC. Branch of the thyrocervical trunk\n\nD. Tributary of the internal jugular vein\n\nI need to identify which of these vessels, if ligated, would most likely cause the findings in this patient.\n\nFirst, the costocervical trunk is a branch of the subclavian artery that supplies blood to the neck and chest. Its branches include the supreme intercostal artery and the deep cervical artery. I'm not sure if the parathyroid glands receive direct supply from branches of the costocervical trunk, so this might not be the most likely answer.\n\nOption B is a branch of the external carotid artery. On the right side, the superior thyroid artery is a branch of the external carotid artery, supplying the thyroid gland. On the left side, the left superior thyroid artery might also be a branch of the external carotid, but often, the left thyroid artery is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk.\n\nOption C is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, which is a branch of the subclavian artery. The thyrocervical trunk supplies branches to the thyroid gland, including the inferior thyroid artery, which supplies the parathyroid glands.\n\nOption D is a tributary of the internal jugular vein. Veins carry deoxygenated blood away from the tissues, and ligating a vein wouldn't directly affect the blood supply to the parathyroid glands, so this seems less likely.\n\nGiven that, options A, B, and C involve arteries that could supply blood to the parathyroid glands, while option D involves a vein, which is less likely to be directly involved in this scenario.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, option C, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, seems the most relevant because the thyrocervical trunk supplies the inferior thyroid artery, which is a major supplier to the parathyroid glands.\n\nOption B, a branch of the external carotid artery, might also supply the thyroid gland, but perhaps not directly to the parathyroid glands.\n\nOption A, a branch of the costocervical trunk, seems less directly related to the parathyroid blood supply.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Branch of the thyrocervical trunk.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nThe patient had a radical thyroidectomy, and during the surgery, there was bleeding that required ligating vessels on the left side of the neck. Given that the left thyroid artery is often a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and the parathyroid glands receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, which is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, ligating a branch of the thyrocervical trunk could compromise blood flow to the parathyroid glands, leading to hypocalcemia.\n\nAdditionally, the high PTH level suggests that the parathyroid glands are trying to compensate for the low calcium, but if they're damaged or ischemic, they might not be able to function properly, leading to persistent hypocalcemia.\n\nSo, yes, ligating a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, which supplies the parathyroid glands, could cause the findings in this patient.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Branch of the thyrocervical trunk.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
