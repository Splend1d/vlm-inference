As the man approached a railroad crossing he noticed that the barriers to the crossing were open. The man cautiously looked both ways for any train. Assuming that no train was coming, he proceeded across the railroad tracks. Suddenly, an oncoming train struck the man's car, completely demolishing it. The man was dead on arrival at the local hospital. Unknown to the man, the railroad crossing guard, in a drunken stupor, had fallen asleep at the barrier controls. He failed to see or hear the signals from the oncoming train that struck and killed the man. The railroad company was well aware of the crossing guard's alcoholism, but continued to employ him. However, two weeks after the accident occurred, the railroad company fired the crossing guard. The executor of the man's estate institutes a wrongful death action against the railroad company.

He approaches a railroad crossing, sees that the barriers are open, looks both ways for any trains, and assuming none is coming, he crosses the tracks. But suddenly, a train comes and hits his car, demolishing it, and unfortunately, he dies on arrival at the hospital.\n\nNow, the interesting part is that the railroad crossing guard was drunk and asleep at the barrier controls, so he didn't see or hear the train's signals, which led to the accident. The railroad company knew about the crossing guard's alcoholism but still kept him employed. Two weeks after the accident, the company fired the crossing guard.\n\nThe man's estate is now suing the railroad company for wrongful death. During the trial, the estate's attorney wants to introduce evidence that the railroad company dismissed the crossing guard shortly after the accident. The railroad company's attorney objects to this, and the question is what the court should do: overrule the objection or sustain it, and why.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Overrule the objection, as the employee's dismissal was an admission that the railroad company was aware of the crossing guard's chronic alcoholism.\n\nB. Overrule the objection, as an adoptive admission by conduct.\n\nC. Sustain the objection, because the probative value of the evidence would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\n\nD. Sustain the objection, as evidence of subsequent remedial measures is inadmissible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these means.\n\nOption A suggests that by firing the crossing guard, the railroad company is admitting they knew about his alcoholism. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the direct reason for admitting this evidence.\n\nOption B talks about an adoptive admission by conduct. I think this means that by acting in a certain way, the company is implicitly admitting something. Maybe by firing the guard, they're admitting that his actions were bad.\n\nOption C says that the evidence should be excluded because it's more prejudicial than probative. That means that while it might have some relevance, it could unduly influence the jury in a negative way.\n\nOption D mentions that evidence of subsequent remedial measures is inadmissible. I think this is a rule in evidence law that says you can't use fixes or changes made after an accident to prove negligence or liability.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, why does the estate's attorney want to introduce the fact that the company fired the crossing guard after the accident? Probably to show that the company recognized that the guard was at fault or that there was a problem with him, maybe his alcoholism.\n\nBut, according to rule D, evidence of subsequent remedial measures is inadmissible. What are remedial measures? They are actions taken after an accident to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. For example, fixing a broken stair or improving a warning sign.\n\nIn this case, firing the crossing guard could be seen as a remedial measure: the company is removing a problematic employee to prevent future accidents.\n\nEvidence rules, particularly in many jurisdictions, exclude such evidence because introducing it might discourage parties from making repairs or taking steps to prevent future accidents for fear that it will be used against them in court.\n\nSo, if firing the guard is considered a remedial measure, then according to rule D, the evidence should be excluded.\n\nBut let's consider option A. It suggests that the dismissal is an admission of the company's awareness of the guard's alcoholism. That might be true, but is that the primary reason for excluding or including the evidence?\n\nOption B talks about adoptive admission by conduct. This is when someone, by their actions, adopts or accepts the truth of something. For example, if someone says something in your presence and you don't deny it, that might be an adoptive admission.\n\nIn this case, by firing the guard, is the company admitting something about the guard's behavior or their knowledge of his alcoholism?\n\nIt's possible, but I'm not sure if that's the most direct reason for the court's decision.\n\nOption C mentions that the probative value is outweighed by prejudicial effect. Probative value is how much the evidence helps to prove something relevant to the case. Prejudicial effect is how much it might unfairly influence the jury against the company.\n\nIf the firing is introduced, it might make the jury think that the company was at fault because they had to get rid of the guard, which could be prejudicial.\n\nBut is that the main issue here? Probably not, because the main issue seems to be whether firing the guard is a remedial measure and thus inadmissible.\n\nLet me double-check what a remedial measure is. It's typically an action taken to fix a problem after an accident, to prevent similar accidents in the future.\n\nFiring an employee who was involved in an accident could be seen as such a measure, especially if the employee was problematic.\n\nHowever, in this case, the guard was fired two weeks after the accident, which might suggest that the company recognized that he was responsible for the accident.\n\nBut according to evidence rules, even if that's the case, the firing is still a subsequent remedial measure and thus inadmissible to prove negligence or defect.\n\nSo, based on that, the court should sustain the objection, making option D the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let's consider option A again. If the firing is seen as an admission of the company's knowledge of the guard's alcoholism, maybe that's a different issue.\n\nHowever, even if that's the case, the firing is still a subsequent action taken after the accident, which aligns with the concept of a remedial measure.\n\nMoreover, the company's knowledge of the guard's alcoholism might be relevant for other reasons, but in this specific context, where the firing is being offered as evidence of that knowledge, it might still be excluded as a remedial measure.\n\nOption C mentions prejudicial effect outweighing probative value. While that might be true, it's a more general reason for excluding evidence, and in this specific scenario, the more precise rule about subsequent remedial measures likely applies.\n\nTherefore, I think the most appropriate answer is D: sustain the objection, as evidence of subsequent remedial measures is inadmissible.\n\nThis aligns with evidence rules designed to encourage parties to make improvements and fixes without fearing that such actions will be used against them in court.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
