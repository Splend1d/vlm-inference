                    "text": "NSC 68, which stands for National Security Council Report 68, is indeed seen as a turning point in U.S. Cold War foreign policy. To understand why, let's first clarify what NSC 68 was and then evaluate each option to see which one accurately reflects its significance.\n\nNSC 68 was a classified document produced in 1950 that assessed the Soviet Union's capabilities and intentions and recommended a substantial build-up of U.S. military and economic strength to counter the perceived Soviet threat. It was drafted in response to concerns about the growing power of the Soviet Union and the spread of communism worldwide.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. It indicated the primacy of economic containment\n\nWhile NSC 68 did emphasize the importance of economic measures in containing the Soviet Union, it is more accurately known for shifting the focus towards a stronger military response. So, while economic containment was part of the strategy, it wasn't the primary focus of NSC 68.\n\nB. It indicated a desire to engage with the Soviet Union\n\nThis is not accurate. NSC 68 was a response to the perceived belligerence and expansionist policies of the Soviet Union. It advocated for a more aggressive stance rather than engagement.\n\nC. It indicated a shift towards military containment\n\nThis is the correct answer. NSC 68 marked a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy from a reliance on economic measures like the Marshall Plan to a much stronger emphasis on military build-up and preparedness. It called for a substantial increase in defense spending and the development of new military technologies to counter the Soviet threat.\n\nD. It dispensed with the idea of containment\n\nThis is incorrect. NSC 68 did not abandon the concept of containment; rather, it expanded and intensified it by adding a much stronger military component to the existing economic and political strategies.\n\nIn summary, NSC 68 is seen as a turning point because it signaled a major shift towards military containment as the primary means of countering the Soviet Union during the Cold War. This shift had profound implications for U.S. foreign policy, leading to increased military spending, the development of new weapons systems, and a more assertive global posture in the decades that followed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
