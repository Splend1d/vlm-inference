The options are A) 4 and 19 over 20, B) 4 and 19 over 100, C) 4 and 1 over 20, and D) 419 over 1000. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let's understand what 4.95 means. The number 4.95 is a decimal number where 4 is the whole number part and 95 is the decimal part. To convert this to a fraction, I can consider the decimal part separately and then combine it with the whole number.\n\nSo, the decimal part is 0.95. I know that 0.95 is the same as 95 hundredths, which can be written as 95/100. So, 4.95 can be written as 4 and 95/100.\n\nBut, I need to simplify this fraction. Let's see if 95/100 can be reduced. Both 95 and 100 are divisible by 5.\n\n95 \u00f7 5 = 19\n\n100 \u00f7 5 = 20\n\nSo, 95/100 simplifies to 19/20. Therefore, 4.95 is equal to 4 and 19/20.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4 and 19 over 20, which matches what I got. Option B is 4 and 19 over 100, but 19/100 is not simplified from 95/100. Option C is 4 and 1 over 20, which is too small. Option D is 419 over 1000, which seems incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if 4 and 19/20 is equal to 4.95. Let's convert 4 and 19/20 back to a decimal to verify.\n\nFirst, 19/20 as a decimal is 0.95 because 19 divided by 20 is 0.95. Then, adding the whole number part, 4 + 0.95 = 4.95. Perfect, it matches.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the mixed number to an improper fraction. 4 and 19/20 is the same as (4*20 + 19)/20 = (80 + 19)/20 = 99/20. Is 99/20 equal to 4.95? Let's divide 99 by 20: 20*4 = 80, 99 - 80 = 19, so 19/20 = 0.95, thus 4 + 0.95 = 4.95. Yes, it's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider option D: 419 over 1000. If I divide 419 by 1000, I get 0.419, which is not equal to 4.95. So, option D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: 4 and 19 over 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
