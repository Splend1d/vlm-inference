                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about auditor independence and nonaudit services. So, the scenario is that an auditor is providing nonaudit services to an issuer client, and we need to figure out which of these options would not impair independence and wouldn't require preapproval from the audit committee, except for one.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules governing auditor independence, especially regarding nonaudit services. I know that auditors can provide certain nonaudit services to their audit clients without compromising their independence, but there are limits and conditions attached.\n\nOption A says: \"Nonaudit services with revenues in aggregate of less than 5% of the total revenues paid by the issuer to the auditor during the fiscal year in which the nonaudit services are provided.\" Hmm, this sounds familiar. I think there's a threshold where if the nonaudit services are below a certain percentage of the total fees, they might not require preapproval. But I need to be careful here.\n\nOption B: \"Nonaudit services that were promptly brought to the attention of, and approved by, the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit.\" This seems straightforward. If the audit committee approves the services before the audit is done, it should be okay. But the question is about services that don't require preapproval, except for one option.\n\nOption C: \"Nonaudit services to perform financial information systems design and implementation.\" Now, this rings a bell. I think performing such services could impair the auditor's independence because it involves a lot of responsibility over the client's financial systems, which are central to the audit.\n\nOption D: \"Services that the issuer did not recognize as nonaudit services at the time of the engagement.\" This one is a bit tricky. If the issuer didn't realize that certain services were nonaudit services, it might imply that there was a lack of transparency or understanding about the nature of the services provided.\n\nLooking back at the question, it says \"without impairing independence and without obtaining the preapproval of the audit committee, except for one.\" So, among these options, three are acceptable without preapproval, and one is not.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\n- Option A: Services below 5% of total revenues. I think there might be a rule that allows for de minimis exceptions, meaning that small amounts of nonaudit services don't require preapproval because their impact on independence is minimal.\n\n- Option B: Services approved by the audit committee prior to audit completion. This seems like a safeguard, so it should be acceptable without preapproval in this context.\n\n- Option C: Financial information systems design and implementation. This sounds like a significant involvement in the client's internal controls, which are crucial for the audit. I believe providing such services could impair independence because the auditor is effectively designing the systems that they will later audit.\n\n- Option D: Services not recognized as nonaudit at the time of engagement. This might imply that the services were perhaps considered part of the audit services, but in reality, they are nonaudit services. This could be a gray area, but I don't think it necessarily impair independence.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that Option C is the one that would likely impair independence, and therefore, it would require preapproval by the audit committee. The other options either involve small amounts of services, are approved beforehand, or involve some misunderstanding about the nature of the services.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Nonaudit services to perform financial information systems design and implementation.\n\nTo confirm, I should think about why the other options are acceptable without preapproval.\n\nOption A: The 5% threshold is probably set to capture only significant nonaudit services that could potentially influence the auditor's objectivity. Services below this threshold are considered insignificant in terms of their impact on independence.\n\nOption B: If the audit committee approves the services before the audit is completed, it means that there is oversight and consideration of potential independence issues, so preapproval isn't needed additionally.\n\nOption D: Although there might be a lack of clarity about what constitutes nonaudit services, this doesn't necessarily mean that independence is impaired. It's more about proper classification rather than the nature of the services themselves.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the exception because providing financial information systems design and implementation services could significantly impair the auditor's independence due to the close relationship and influence over the client's financial systems.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
