                    "text": "So I have this problem here: find 4 over 7 plus 2 over 7. The options are A) 6 over 14, B) 8 over 49, C) 14 over 28, and D) 6 over 7. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when you add fractions, you need to have a common denominator. In this case, both fractions already have the same denominator, which is 7. So that makes things easier.\n\nSo, I have 4/7 + 2/7. Since the denominators are the same, I can just add the numerators together and keep the denominator the same.\n\nSo, 4 + 2 = 6, and the denominator stays 7. So, it should be 6/7.\n\nLet me check the options:\n\nA) 6 over 14 \u2013 that's 6/14, which simplifies to 3/7, which is not the same as 6/7.\n\nB) 8 over 49 \u2013 8/49. That seems too big, and 49 is 7 squared, which isn't relevant here.\n\nC) 14 over 28 \u2013 14/28 simplifies to 1/2, which is not 6/7.\n\nD) 6 over 7 \u2013 that matches what I calculated.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I should consider if the fractions can be simplified or if I need to find a different common denominator, but since they already have the same denominator, I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about what each fraction represents. 4/7 is four parts out of seven, and 2/7 is two parts out of seven. So, if I add them together, I should have six parts out of seven, which is 6/7.\n\nLet me see if there's a chance that the answer could be different. Maybe if I convert them to decimals and add them up.\n\n4/7 is approximately 0.5714, and 2/7 is approximately 0.2857. Adding them up gives approximately 0.8571, which is the same as 6/7.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the options:\n\nA) 6/14 is 0.4286, which is less than 0.5.\n\nB) 8/49 is approximately 0.1633, which is even smaller.\n\nC) 14/28 is 0.5.\n\nD) 6/7 is approximately 0.8571, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, it seems clear that D) 6 over 7 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Perhaps the question is testing whether I know something about adding fractions with the same denominator.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider if the fractions can be reduced or if there's a different way to express the sum.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is to factor the numerators or denominators, but in this case, 4 and 2 are both even, but since they're being added, and the denominators are the same, I don't think factoring will help here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the least common denominator, but again, since the denominators are already the same, that's taken care of.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility that the answer could be A) 6 over 14. Maybe if I mistakenly thought that I need to multiply the denominators when adding, but that's not correct. When adding fractions with the same denominator, you just add the numerators and keep the denominator.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone thought that since 4/7 plus 2/7 is 6/14, but that's incorrect because you're adding the numerators over the same denominator, so it's 6/7.\n\nWait, maybe they multiplied the denominators instead of keeping them the same. That would lead to 4/7 + 2/7 = 6/49, which is not an option here.\n\nOr perhaps they added both numerators and denominators, getting 4+2 over 7+7 = 6/14, which is option A.\n\nBut that's a mistake. When adding fractions with the same denominator, you only add the numerators and keep the denominator.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct answer should be D) 6 over 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
