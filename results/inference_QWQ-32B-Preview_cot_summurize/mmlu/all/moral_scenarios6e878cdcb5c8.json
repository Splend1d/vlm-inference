                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I called into work because I didn't want to work.\n\nScenario 2: I called the cops on the man who hit no one.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: calling into work because I didn't want to work.\n\nSo, this sounds like calling in sick or something to avoid going to work, but the reason is that I just don't feel like working. Is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, morally wrong implies some kind of ethical breach, right? Like harming someone or being dishonest.\n\nIn this case, calling in sick when you're not actually sick could be seen as lying to your employer. That seems unethical because you're misrepresenting your ability to work, maybe so you can skip work for personal reasons.\n\nFrom an ordinary moral standard in the US, dishonesty is generally considered wrong. Also, depending on the job and the company's policies, this could be considered abuse of sick leave or personal time off.\n\nSo, I think Scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: calling the cops on the man who hit no one.\n\nThis one is a bit confusing. \"The man who hit no one\" \u2014 does that mean the man didn't hit anyone, or is it something else?\n\nI think it's referring to a situation where a man hit someone, but in this scenario, the person is claiming he hit no one, meaning he's denying hitting someone.\n\nBut the way it's phrased, \"the man who hit no one,\" it seems like the man didn't hit anyone, but maybe there's confusion or an accusation.\n\nWait, maybe it's a misphrasing, and it's supposed to be \"the man who hit 'no one,'\" meaning the man who was hitting people, but in this case, he hit no one, so perhaps the action didn't go through.\n\nThis is a bit unclear, but let's assume that someone thought a man was going to hit someone, maybe in a threatening manner, and so they called the cops on him, but in reality, he didn't hit anyone.\n\nSo, the main character called the cops on this man who was allegedly going to hit someone but ended up not doing it.\n\nIs calling the cops on someone who was potentially threatening but didn't actually hit anyone morally wrong?\n\nWell, calling the cops on someone for a potential threat could be seen as responsible, especially if there was a risk involved. However, if it turns out to be a false alarm, it might be considered wasting police time or making a baseless accusation.\n\nBut in terms of moral standards, if there was a genuine concern for safety, then calling the cops might be justified. On the other hand, if it was a frivolous call without any real concern, then it could be seen as wrong.\n\nGiven that, it's a bit nuanced. But according to ordinary moral standards, if there was a legitimate safety concern, then calling the cops would not be wrong, even if it turns out there was no actual hitting.\n\nSo, in this case, I'd say it's not wrong.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Wrong\n\nScenario 2: Not wrong\n\nThat corresponds to option B.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nOption A: Wrong, Wrong\n\nOption B: Wrong, Not wrong\n\nOption C: Not wrong, Wrong\n\nOption D: Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nYes, based on my analysis, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong, so option B seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any other perspectives.\n\nFor Scenario 1, some might argue that if you're not feeling well, even if not sick, maybe you should rest, but that's different from calling in sick when you're not. Misrepresenting your condition to take a day off is generally considered dishonest.\n\nFor Scenario 2, calling the cops on someone who hasn't actually committed a crime could be seen as problematic, but if there was a perceived threat, it might be justified.\n\nIn some cases, people call the cops on others for benign actions, which could be seen as overreacting or even abusive, but based on the phrasing, it seems like there was a potential for harm.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial assessment holds.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
