                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand the distribution of scores on the WISC (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children). The WISC is a standardized test, and its scores are typically distributed normally, with a mean (average) score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.\n\nIn a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean, and the standard deviation tells us how spread out the scores are. Specifically:\n\n- About 34% of the data falls between the mean and one standard deviation above the mean.\n\n- About 34% of the data falls between the mean and one standard deviation below the mean.\n\n- Therefore, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation above and below the mean.\n\n- About 14% of the data falls between one and two standard deviations above the mean.\n\n- About 14% of the data falls between one and two standard deviations below the mean.\n\n- Therefore, about 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations above and below the mean.\n\nGiven that the mean is 100 and the standard deviation is 15, let's calculate the range from 70 to 130.\n\nFirst, find out how many standard deviations 70 and 130 are from the mean.\n\nFor 70:\n\n70 - 100 = -30\n\n-30 / 15 = -2 standard deviations\n\nFor 130:\n\n130 - 100 = 30\n\n30 / 15 = 2 standard deviations\n\nSo, 70 is two standard deviations below the mean, and 130 is two standard deviations above the mean.\n\nIn a normal distribution, approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, about 95% of the population scores between 70 and 130 on the WISC.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 34\n\nB. 50\n\nC. 68\n\nD. 95\n\nThe correct answer is D. 95.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's double-check this.\n\nWe know that:\n\n- Mean = 100\n\n- Standard deviation = 15\n\n- Range in question: 70 to 130\n\nWhich is from -2 SD to +2 SD.\n\nIn a normal distribution:\n\n- From mean to +1 SD: 34.13%\n\n- From mean to -1 SD: 34.13%\n\n- From mean to +2 SD: 47.72%\n\n- From mean to -2 SD: 47.72%\n\nBut more straightforward is to remember that approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the population scoring between 70 and 130 on the WISC is approximately 95%.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
