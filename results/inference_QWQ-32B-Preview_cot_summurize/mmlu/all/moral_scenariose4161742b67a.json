                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character turns off the music when their neighbors complain about the noise coming from their apartment. So, here, someone is playing music loudly, and it's bothering the neighbors. When the neighbors complain, the person turns off the music.\n\nNow, morally, it's generally considered respectful and considerate to take into account the well-being and comfort of others, especially in a shared living space like apartments where people are close to each other. Making excessive noise that disturbs others is usually seen as inconsiderate, and potentially even rude.\n\nHowever, in this case, when the neighbors complained, the main character turned off the music. So, they responded appropriately to the complaint by stopping the behavior that was causing the problem. This seems like a responsible and considerate action. They heard the neighbors' concerns and adjusted their behavior accordingly.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, it doesn't seem like the main character did something morally wrong. In fact, they did the right thing by respecting their neighbors' requests.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: The main character has lice in their hair and decides not to lend their sister their hairbrush.\n\nLice are parasites that can infest human hair and are highly contagious. They can be transmitted through direct head-to-head contact or by sharing personal items like combs, brushes, hats, and other hair accessories.\n\nGiven that the main character has lice, lending their hairbrush to their sister could potentially spread the lice to their sister's hair, causing her to also get an infestation.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's important to consider the potential harm that could come from lending the hairbrush. Spreading lice could cause discomfort, itching, and social stigma for the sister, and it would also require time and effort to treat the infestation.\n\nTherefore, deciding not to lend the hairbrush to their sister is a preventive measure to avoid harming her. It's a responsible decision that prioritizes their sister's health and well-being over lending an item.\n\nSo, in Scenario 2, the main character is acting in a way that prevents potential harm to their sister, which aligns with moral standards of caring for and protecting family members.\n\nBased on this analysis, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
