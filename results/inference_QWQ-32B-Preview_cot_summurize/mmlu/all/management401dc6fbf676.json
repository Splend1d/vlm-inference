I remember that Peter Drucker was a really influential management thinker, and he had some key principles about how managers should approach their roles.\n\nOption A says, \"Making people's strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant.\" That sounds familiar. I think Drucker emphasized playing to people's strengths and managing around their weaknesses. So, this seems like it could be one of his principles.\n\nOption B is \"Enhancing the ability of people to contribute.\" Again, this aligns with Drucker's focus on developing people and helping them perform at their best. So, this also seems likely to be one of his principles.\n\nOption C says, \"To operate the organisation's status system.\" Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. I don't recall Drucker talking specifically about operating the organization's status system. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps he did mention something about status, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption D is \"Integrating people in a common venture by thinking through, setting and exemplifying the organizational objectives, values and goals.\" This sounds like Drucker's emphasis on clarity of purpose and aligning individuals with organizational goals. So, this seems plausible.\n\nI think I need to recall Drucker's actual five principles to be sure. Let me list them as I remember them:\n\n1. Making strengths productive.\n\n2. Making weaknesses irrelevant.\n\n3. Enhancing the ability to contribute.\n\n4. Integrating people in a common venture.\n\n5. Building community.\n\nWait, now that I think about it, I might be misremembering. Maybe the fifth principle is something else. Let me double-check.\n\nUpon reviewing Drucker's work, his five guiding principles of management are:\n\n1. Make strengths productive.\n\n2. Make weaknesses irrelevant.\n\n3. Enhance the ability to contribute.\n\n4. Integrate people in a common venture.\n\n5. Build community.\n\nSo, comparing these to the options provided:\n\nA corresponds to the first two principles combined.\n\nB is the third principle.\n\nC is not mentioned in Drucker's principles.\n\nD seems to be a part of the fourth principle.\n\nTherefore, option C, \"To operate the organisation's status system,\" is not one of Drucker's five guiding principles of management.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
