                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: if a=7 and b=13, I need to find the number of even positive integers less than ab. Let me see... first, I should probably figure out what ab is. Since a is 7 and b is 13, ab would be 7 times 13, right?\n\nSo, 7 times 13 is 91. So, ab = 91. Now, I need to find all the even positive integers less than 91. Okay, even numbers are those that are divisible by 2.\n\nSo, the even numbers less than 91 would start from 2 and go up to 90, since 90 is the largest even number less than 91.\n\nNow, how do I find out how many even numbers there are from 2 to 90 inclusive?\n\nWell, I remember that to find the number of terms in a sequence, I can use the formula:\n\nNumber of terms = (Last term - First term)/Common difference + 1\n\nIn this case, the first term is 2, the last term is 90, and the common difference is 2, since we're dealing with even numbers.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nNumber of even numbers = (90 - 2)/2 + 1 = (88)/2 + 1 = 44 + 1 = 45.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that formula. Yes, it's correct. For an arithmetic sequence, the number of terms is given by (Last term - First term)/Common difference + 1.\n\nSo, (90 - 2)/2 + 1 = 88/2 + 1 = 44 + 1 = 45.\n\nHmm, but let me make sure. If I list out the even numbers from 2 to 90:\n\n2, 4, 6, ..., 88, 90.\n\nIf I divide 88 by 2, I get 44, and then adding the first term, that would make 45 even numbers.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the number of even numbers less than 91 is equal to floor of (90)/2, which is 45.\n\nWait, but floor of 90/2 is 45, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the number of even positive integers less than ab (which is 91) is 45.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 45\n\nB. 46\n\nC. 90\n\nD. 180\n\nIt seems that A. 45 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way could be to consider that half of the positive integers less than ab are even, assuming ab is odd, which in this case it is, since 7 and 13 are both odd, and odd times odd is odd.\n\nSo, ab = 91, which is odd.\n\nThe total number of positive integers less than 91 is 90.\n\nIf ab is odd, then half of these numbers should be even, and half should be odd.\n\nSo, 90/2 = 45 even numbers, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 45.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's any trick here. The question says \"even positive integers less than ab\", and ab is 91.\n\nIs there any possibility that 90 is not even, but in this case, 90 is even, so it's included.\n\nAlso, 2 is the smallest even positive integer, and 90 is the largest less than 91.\n\nSo, yes, it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could list out the even numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., 90.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with first term 2, common difference 2, and last term 90.\n\nThe number of terms is (90 - 2)/2 + 1 = 45.\n\nSo, again, 45.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
