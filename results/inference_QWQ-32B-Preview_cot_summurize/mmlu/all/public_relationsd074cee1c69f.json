                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's asking about the goal of a certain type of advertising that aims to promote a specific product and service to a target audience. The options are person-oriented, product-oriented, profit-oriented, and idea-oriented. I need to choose which one fits best.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each option means:\n\n- Person-oriented advertising probably focuses on the people behind the product or service, maybe the founders or endorsers.\n\n- Product-oriented advertising is likely centered around the features and benefits of the product itself.\n\n- Profit-oriented advertising might be aimed at maximizing revenue or profitability through the ads.\n\n- Idea-oriented advertising could be focused on promoting a concept or ideology rather than a specific product.\n\nNow, the question is about promoting a specific product and service to a target audience. So, it seems like the advertising is directly about the product and service.\n\nPerson-oriented might not be the best fit because it's more about the people involved rather than the product. Profit-oriented seems more about the financial goals of the advertising rather than what it's promoting. Idea-oriented is about concepts, not specific products.\n\nProduct-oriented advertising sounds like it directly promotes the product and its features to the target audience. That seems to align closely with the goal mentioned in the question.\n\nWait a minute, the question mentions both \"product and service.\" So, maybe it's not just about products, but also services. I wonder if there's a difference in advertising for products versus services.\n\nIn general, product-oriented advertising can include services as well, especially if the service is a core part of what's being offered. For example, a company might offer a product along with a service plan.\n\nGiven that, product-oriented seems like the most appropriate choice here. It's directly about promoting the specific product and/or service to the target audience.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nPerson-oriented: This might be more about building a connection with the endorser or the company's personality. For example, seeing an ad with a celebrity endorsing a product.\n\nProfit-oriented: This seems more about the business goals of the advertising, like increasing sales or market share, rather than what is being promoted.\n\nIdea-oriented: This could be about promoting a lifestyle, a belief, or a cause. For example, ads that promote recycling or environmental awareness.\n\nNone of these other options seem to directly match the goal of promoting a specific product and service.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. product-oriented.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
