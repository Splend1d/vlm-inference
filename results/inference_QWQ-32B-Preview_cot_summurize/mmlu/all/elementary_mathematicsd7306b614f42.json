The options are 220, 770, 4, and 110 parts. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many parts she makes per hour. That way, I can calculate how many she'd make in 35 hours. So, if she makes 22 parts in 7 hours, her rate is 22 parts divided by 7 hours. Let me do that division: 22 divided by 7 is about 3.142 parts per hour. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, to find out how many parts she can make in 35 hours, I'll multiply her rate by 35. So, 3.142 parts per hour times 35 hours. Let's calculate that: 3.142 times 35 is... hmm, 3 times 35 is 105, and 0.142 times 35 is, let's see, 0.1 times 35 is 3.5, and 0.042 times 35 is, say, 1.47. So altogether, it's about 105 plus 3.5 plus 1.47, which is roughly 109.97. That's almost 110 parts. So, option D, 110 parts, seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a simpler way to do this without calculating the exact rate. Since 35 hours is 5 times 7 hours, maybe I can just multiply the number of parts by 5. Because if she makes 22 parts in 7 hours, in 35 hours, which is 5 times longer, she should make 5 times as many parts. So, 22 parts times 5 is 110 parts. That matches what I got earlier. Cool, that makes sense.\n\nI think option D, 110 parts, is the correct answer. The other options don't make sense in this context. 220 is too high, 770 is way too high, and 4 is way too low. So, 110 parts is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
