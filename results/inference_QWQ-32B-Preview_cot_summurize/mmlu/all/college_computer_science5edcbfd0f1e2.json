                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a microcomputer used for data acquisition and control. It needs to digitize and process four analog input signals and output their average continually in real time. There's an external analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that takes 12 microseconds to digitize one input, and only one digitization occurs at a time. For each signal digitized, the CPU needs to execute five instructions, including the triggering instruction. Then, to average each set of four samples and output this value, ten more CPU instructions are needed. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is ignored. The question is asking for the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, assuming suitable data buffering is employed.\n\nOkay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the entire process:\n\n1. Digitize four analog input signals.\n\n2. Average the four digitized samples.\n\n3. Output the average.\n\nAnd this needs to happen continually in real time.\n\nSo, for each set of four inputs, there's a sequence of operations that need to be performed.\n\nLet's consider the time involved in digitizing one input signal:\n\n- The ADC takes 12 microseconds to digitize one input.\n\n- During this time, the CPU executes five instructions, one of which is the triggering instruction.\n\nSince only one digitization occurs at a time, the total time to digitize four inputs would be 4 times 12 microseconds, which is 48 microseconds.\n\nWait, but the CPU is executing instructions while the ADC is working. So, for each digitization, the CPU executes five instructions, including the trigger.\n\nSo, for four digitizations, the CPU would execute 4 * 5 = 20 instructions.\n\nAfter that, the CPU needs to execute ten more instructions to average the four samples and output the average.\n\nTherefore, the total number of CPU instructions per cycle is 20 (for digitization) + 10 (for averaging and output) = 30 instructions.\n\nNow, the total time for one complete cycle (digitizing four inputs and outputting the average) needs to be equal to the time it takes to digitize four inputs, which is 48 microseconds, assuming that the CPU can keep up with the ADC.\n\nBut the CPU is executing instructions during this time, so we need to make sure that the time taken by the CPU to execute these 30 instructions is less than or equal to 48 microseconds.\n\nIn other words, the maximum average instruction execution time (let's call it T) should satisfy:\n\n30 * T \u2264 48 microseconds\n\nSo, T \u2264 48 / 30 = 1.6 microseconds\n\nTherefore, the maximum average instruction execution time is 1.6 microseconds.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.8 microseconds\n\nB. 1.2 microseconds\n\nC. 1.6 microseconds\n\nD. 2.4 microseconds\n\nOption C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there's any misunderstanding in the process.\n\nIs there any overlap between the ADC conversion time and the CPU instruction execution time?\n\nThe problem says that the ADC is triggered by a CPU instruction, and during the conversion time, the CPU can presumably do other tasks, like executing other instructions.\n\nHowever, since the ADC is external and only one conversion occurs at a time, the CPU needs to wait for each conversion to complete before triggering the next one, if there's no buffering.\n\nBut the problem mentions that suitable data buffering is employed. So, perhaps the ADC conversions can be pipelined or buffered, allowing the CPU to trigger one conversion and proceed to other tasks while the ADC is working on it.\n\nIf there is buffering, the CPU can trigger the next conversion without waiting for the current one to complete, up to the buffer depth.\n\nAssuming that the buffer can hold at least four conversions, the CPU can trigger all four conversions in sequence and then proceed to process the previous set of conversions.\n\nIn this case, the total time for digitizing four inputs would still be 48 microseconds, but the CPU can overlap the execution of instructions for digitization and averaging.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of pipeline processing.\n\nLet's consider that the CPU triggers the first ADC conversion and starts executing the five instructions for it.\n\nWhile the ADC is converting the first input (12 microseconds), the CPU can proceed to other tasks.\n\nAfter 12 microseconds, the first conversion is complete, and the CPU can read the result and start processing it.\n\nMeanwhile, the CPU can trigger the second ADC conversion and execute the five instructions for it, and so on.\n\nAssuming that there is a buffer for the ADC results, the CPU can read the previous conversion while triggering the next one.\n\nSo, for four conversions, the total time would be 12 microseconds (for the last conversion) plus the time for the CPU to process the four conversions and compute the average.\n\nBut this seems more complex.\n\nPerhaps the initial approach is sufficient for this problem.\n\nGiven that, the maximum average instruction execution time is 1.6 microseconds, which corresponds to option C.\n\nI think the answer is C. 1.6 microseconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
