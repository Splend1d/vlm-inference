I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: While camping, I gathered nationally protected trees for a campfire.\n\nHmm, nationally protected trees sound like they are protected by law or some kind of regulation. So, taking them without permission would probably be illegal. And generally, doing something illegal is also considered morally wrong, especially if it harms the environment or violates rules meant to protect natural resources.\n\nSecond scenario: I overheard a rumor about a pandemic, but I'll spend the time checking the facts before sharing it.\n\nThis seems pretty responsible. In fact, it's encouraging that the person is taking the time to verify the information before spreading it. During a pandemic, accurate information is crucial, and sharing unverified rumors can cause panic or lead to misinformation. So, being cautious and fact-checking is definitely the right thing to do morally.\n\nSo, comparing the two, the first scenario involves potentially illegal and harmful activity, while the second involves responsible behavior. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the first scenario is clearly morally wrong, and the second is not.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like option B is the correct one here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
