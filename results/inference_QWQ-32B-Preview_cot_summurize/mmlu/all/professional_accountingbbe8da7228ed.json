                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year, given some information about the company's performance and distributions.\n\nFirst, I know that Greene is the sole shareholder of Seagull, which is an S corporation. S corporations pass their income, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders, who then report them on their individual income tax returns. This means that Greene will report Seagull's income and deductions on his personal tax return.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Greene's basis in Seagull is $15,000. During the year, Seagull reported an ordinary loss of $5,000 and $2,000 of municipal bond interest. Additionally, Seagull distributed $6,000 in cash to Greene on November 1.\n\nTo find Greene's basis at the end of the year, I need to adjust his beginning basis for these items.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ordinary loss. Since Seagull is an S corporation, the ordinary loss passes through to Greene, and he can deduct it on his personal tax return, subject to certain limitations. However, for basis purposes, losses reduce the shareholder's basis in the stock.\n\nSo, Greene's basis would be reduced by the ordinary loss of $5,000.\n\nNext, the municipal bond interest. Municipal bond interest is generally exempt from federal income tax. Since it's tax-exempt, it doesn't affect Greene's basis in the stock.\n\nThen, there's the distribution of $6,000. For S corporations, distributions generally don't affect the shareholder's basis unless there are specific conditions met, such as distributions in excess of the shareholder's basis.\n\nWait, actually, in S corporations, distributions reduce the shareholder's basis to the extent of their basis, without recognizing gain, unless the distribution is entirely dividend-like.\n\nBut in this case, since Seagull is an S corporation, and it's distributing cash, the distribution will reduce Greene's basis in the stock by $6,000, but only to the extent of his basis after considering the ordinary loss.\n\nLet me try to put this in order:\n\n1. Starting basis: $15,000\n\n2. Subtract ordinary loss: $15,000 - $5,000 = $10,000\n\n3. Subtract distribution: $10,000 - $6,000 = $4,000\n\nSo, at the end of the year, Greene's basis would be $4,000.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any other factors that could affect the basis. The municipal bond interest is tax-exempt and shouldn't affect the basis. So, I think the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. $4,000.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the rules for S corporation distributions and basis. According to IRS rules, a shareholder's basis is reduced by distributions up to the amount of their basis. Any distribution in excess of basis would be treated as a capital gain, but in this case, the distribution is $6,000, and after the loss, the basis is $10,000, so the full $6,000 can be distributed without recognizing a capital gain.\n\nTherefore, the ending basis should indeed be $4,000.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A is $4,000, which matches my calculation.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some cases, distributions can be affected by other items, like previously excluded income or something like that. But in this problem, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the municipal bond interest affects the basis in some way. Let me check that.\n\nMunicipal bond interest is tax-exempt, so it doesn't enter into the taxable income calculation. Since it's not taxable, it shouldn't affect the basis. Basis is generally adjusted by items that affect income or loss.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nStarting basis: $15,000\n\nLess ordinary loss: $5,000 \u2192 $10,000\n\nLess distribution: $6,000 \u2192 $4,000\n\nTherefore, ending basis is $4,000.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other adjustment I might have missed. For example, is there any provision where municipal bond interest could indirectly affect the basis? I don't think so, because it's nontaxable and doesn't affect the corporation's taxable income.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in S corporations, separately stated items can affect the basis, but municipal bond interest is not a separately stated item; it's just part of the income.\n\nTherefore, I stick with my initial conclusion that the ending basis is $4,000.\n\nBut why are there other options like $6,000, $14,000, and $15,000? Maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Perhaps the municipal bond interest affects the basis differently.\n\nWait, maybe the municipal bond interest increases the basis because it's a nontaxable item. But no, generally, nontaxable income doesn't increase the basis in S corporations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distribution is considered a return of capital only to the extent of basis, and any excess is a capital gain. But in S corporations, distributions are generally considered to come out of basis first, without recognizing gain, unless the distribution exceeds the basis.\n\nIn this case, the distribution is $6,000, and after the loss, the basis is $10,000, so the entire $6,000 reduces the basis to $4,000, and no gain is recognized.\n\nTherefore, ending basis is $4,000.\n\nI think the answer is A. $4,000.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there's any other adjustment that needs to be made.\n\nIs there any provision where municipal bond interest could increase the basis? I don't think so. In C corporations, interest income increases taxable income, but in S corporations, it's passed through to the shareholders.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the regulations or IRS publications regarding S corporation basis adjustments.\n\nAccording to IRS Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses, for S corporations, a shareholder's basis is adjusted by:\n\n- Additions: Shareholder contributions, loan payments from the corporation, and the corporation's deductions allocated to the shareholder.\n\n- Subtractions: Distributions from the corporation, the corporation's income allocated to the shareholder, and the corporation's gains allocated to the shareholder.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Starting basis: $15,000\n\n- Subtract ordinary loss: $5,000 \u2192 $10,000\n\n- Subtract distribution: $6,000 \u2192 $4,000\n\nMunicipal bond interest is not included in the adjustments because it's nontaxable.\n\nTherefore, the ending basis is $4,000.\n\nI think the correct answer is A. $4,000.\n\nBut why are there other options? Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the municipal bond interest needs to be added back to the basis because it's tax-exempt.\n\nWait, in some cases, tax-exempt income can affect basis, but in S corporations, it's passed through to the shareholder, who then reports it on their personal return.\n\nSince the shareholder reports the municipal bond interest on their personal return, and it's nontaxable, it shouldn't affect the basis.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation stands: $15,000 - $5,000 - $6,000 = $4,000.\n\nI think the answer is A. $4,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
