The options are:\n\nA. the method of selection.\n\nB. examination of the outcome.\n\nC. both of the above.\n\nD. how representative the sample is of the population.\n\nI think the key here is understanding what a simple random sample really is. From what I remember, a simple random sample is one where every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, and the selection of one member doesn't affect the selection of another.\n\nSo, option A mentions \"the method of selection.\" That sounds relevant because the way you select the sample is crucial in determining whether it's a simple random sample. If you use a method that ensures each member has an equal chance, that aligns with the definition.\n\nOption B is \"examination of the outcome.\" I'm not sure what this means exactly. Does it mean looking at the characteristics of the sample after it's been selected? That doesn't sound directly related to the definition of a simple random sample.\n\nOption C says \"both of the above.\" But since I'm questioning option B, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption D is \"how representative the sample is of the population.\" While it's desirable for a sample to be representative, that's not the defining characteristic of a simple random sample. A simple random sample aims for each member to have an equal chance of selection, but it doesn't guarantee that the sample will perfectly represent the population.\n\nWait, maybe I should look back at my notes or a textbook to confirm.\n\nOkay, according to my statistics textbook, a simple random sample is indeed a sample chosen in a way that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, and the selection of one member doesn't influence the selection of another.\n\nSo, focusing on the method of selection seems correct. The outcome or the representativeness is a consequence of the method, but the definition itself is about the method.\n\nMaybe option A is the right answer.\n\nBut let's think about option B, \"examination of the outcome.\" Perhaps this refers to checking whether the sample is random after selection. But that seems more like verifying the randomness after the fact, which isn't the same as defining what a simple random sample is.\n\nOption D, \"how representative the sample is of the population,\" is important for generalizing results, but it's not the defining characteristic of a simple random sample.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A, the method of selection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
