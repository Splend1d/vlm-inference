According to the problem, eighty-five more than the square of this number is equal to the square of the quantity that is 17 less than the number. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 85 = (x - 17)^2 \\]\n\nFirst, we need to expand the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n\\[ (x - 17)^2 = x^2 - 34x + 289 \\]\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 85 = x^2 - 34x + 289 \\]\n\nNext, we'll subtract \\( x^2 \\) from both sides to simplify:\n\n\\[ 85 = -34x + 289 \\]\n\nNow, let's isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 289 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 85 - 289 = -34x \\]\n\n\\[ -204 = -34x \\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by -34 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-204}{-34} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the number is 6.\n\nTo verify, let's plug \\( x = 6 \\) back into the original equation:\n\nLeft side: \\( 6^2 + 85 = 36 + 85 = 121 \\)\n\nRight side: \\( (6 - 17)^2 = (-11)^2 = 121 \\)\n\nSince both sides are equal, our solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]\n"
