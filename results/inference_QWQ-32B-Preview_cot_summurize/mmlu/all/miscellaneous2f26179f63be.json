Espy.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is an award specifically for sports.\n\nFirst, I know what an Oscar is. Oscars are awards given in the film industry by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. They honor achievements in cinema. So, that's not a sports award.\n\nNext, Emmys. I think Emmys are awards for television. They recognize excellence in TV programming and broadcasting. Again, that's not related to sports.\n\nNobel prizes are for achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economics. Those are all fields of study and peace efforts, not sports.\n\nSo, that leaves me with Espys. I'm not entirely sure what Espys are, but based on the process of elimination, it seems like it might be the sports award.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check what Espys are. I think Espy stands for Excellence in Sports Performance year, or something like that. I recall seeing news about Espy awards ceremonies, and they seem to honor athletes and achievements in sports.\n\nLet me just make sure. If Oscars are for movies, Emmys for TV, Nobels for academic and peace work, then Espys must be for sports. It makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Espy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
