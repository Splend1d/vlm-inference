Well, that's true because 3 comes before 5 on the number line.\n\nNext, statement B: 5 > 3. That means 5 is greater than 3. Again, that's true because 5 is to the right of 3 on the number line.\n\nNow, statement C: -5 > -3. Hmm, this is about negative numbers. On the number line, negative numbers get smaller as they go left. So, -5 is to the left of -3, which means -5 is less than -3. Therefore, -5 > -3 would be false because -5 is actually less than -3.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is which statement is false. So, if C is false, then D might be true.\n\nLet's check statement D: -3 > -5. As we just said, -3 is to the right of -5 on the number line, so -3 is greater than -5. That means -3 > -5 is true.\n\nSo, between C and D, C is false and D is true.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. In positive numbers, bigger positives are greater, like 5 > 3. In negative numbers, it's the opposite; bigger negatives are actually smaller. So, -5 is smaller than -3.\n\nTherefore, -5 > -3 is false, and -3 > -5 is true.\n\nSo, the false statement is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
