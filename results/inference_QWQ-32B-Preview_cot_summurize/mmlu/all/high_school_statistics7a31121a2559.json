                    "text": "Let's see which statement about hypothesis testing is correct. I'll go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level.\"\n\nHmm, I know that the significance level is like a threshold for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis. A 10% level is less strict than a 5% level. So, if we can reject the null at 10%, it doesn't necessarily mean we can reject it at 5%, because 5% is a stricter criterion. I think this statement might be false.\n\nOption B says: \"Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\"\n\nI recall that the choice between one-sided and two-sided tests should be based on the research question and hypotheses before looking at the data. Deciding after the data are gathered could lead to bias and incorrect conclusions. So, this statement seems false as well.\n\nOption C says: \"If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.\"\n\nThis one is tricky. The 1% level means that if the null hypothesis is true, there's a 1% chance of incorrectly rejecting it, which is the Type I error rate. However, it doesn't mean there's a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis in general, because the probability of rejecting the null depends on whether it's true or false. So, I think this statement is misleading and probably false.\n\nOption D says: \"The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\"\n\nYes, power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative is true. So, this seems correct.\n\nBased on my reasoning, it looks like option D is the true statement about hypothesis testing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
