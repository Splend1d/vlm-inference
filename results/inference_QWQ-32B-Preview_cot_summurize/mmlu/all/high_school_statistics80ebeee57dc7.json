Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a type I error is. In hypothesis testing, a type I error occurs when we reject a true null hypothesis. In other words, it's a false positive. So, in this context, it would mean concluding that the lead levels are too high when in reality they are within the allowed limit.\n\nNow, the department is testing soil samples from random locations in the park to check the lead levels. If the lead levels exceed the allowed limit, they plan to close the park because high lead levels are harmful to children.\n\nLet me think about the hypotheses here. The null hypothesis (H0) would probably be that the lead levels are within the allowed limit, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the lead levels exceed the allowed limit.\n\nSo, if we make a type I error, we are incorrectly rejecting H0, which means we conclude that the lead levels are too high when they are actually within the limit.\n\nNow, what decision would be made in this case? If the department thinks that the lead levels are too high (because they incorrectly rejected H0), they would close the park.\n\nBut in reality, the lead levels are within the allowed limit, so closing the park would be unnecessary.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit\n\nB. Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit\n\nC. Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit\n\nD. Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit\n\nOption A matches the scenario of a type I error: closing the park when lead levels are actually within the limit.\n\nOption B sounds like a type II error, where we fail to reject a false null hypothesis, meaning we keep the park open even though lead levels are too high.\n\nOption C is the correct action if lead levels are indeed too high.\n\nOption D is the correct action if lead levels are within the limit.\n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider what a type I error means again. It's rejecting H0 when H0 is true. Here, H0 is that lead levels are within limits. So, rejecting H0 would mean concluding that lead levels are too high and closing the park, even though they are actually within limits.\n\nYes, that matches option A.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
