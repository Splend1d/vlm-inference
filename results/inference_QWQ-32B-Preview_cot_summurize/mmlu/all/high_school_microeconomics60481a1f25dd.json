                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option would cause the demand curve for orange juice to shift to the right. Shifting to the right means that more orange juice is demanded at every price level. So, I need to think about what could make people want more orange juice, regardless of the price.\n\nOption A is about a bumper crop of oranges in Florida. Now, Florida is a big producer of oranges, so if there's a bumper crop, that means there are more oranges available. But wouldn't that affect the supply of orange juice instead of the demand? If there are more oranges, producers can make more orange juice, which would shift the supply curve to the right, leading to lower prices and possibly higher quantity sold. But the demand curve itself wouldn't shift to the right just because supply increased.\n\nOption B is a decrease in the price of Tang. Tang is a powdered orange drink, which is a substitute for fresh orange juice. If Tang gets cheaper, some people might switch from buying orange juice to buying Tang instead. That would mean less demand for orange juice, so the demand curve would shift to the left, not to the right.\n\nOption C is expectations of lower future prices for orange juice. If people think that orange juice is going to be cheaper in the future, they might delay their purchases and buy less now. That would also shift the demand curve to the left.\n\nOption D is expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers. If people expect their income to increase in the future, they might decide to spend more now on orange juice, anticipating that they can afford it. This could increase the current demand for orange juice, shifting the demand curve to the right.\n\nWait a minute, is that how it works? Let's think about it differently. Normally, if people expect their future income to be higher, they might save more now, expecting to spend more in the future. But in some cases, if they have confidence in their future earnings, they might spend more now, especially on durable goods or experiences. But orange juice is a consumable good, not a durable good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe higher expected future income makes them value their current consumption more, leading them to buy more now. I'm a bit unsure about this one.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If people expect their income to rise in the future, they might decide to treat themselves now by buying more orange juice. Or, they might want to maintain their current standard of living and buy the same amount, even if their income hasn't increased yet. But I'm not totally sure.\n\nMaybe I should look at what factors can shift the demand curve to the right. I know that besides price, there are other factors like consumer preferences, prices of related goods, income, and expectations about future prices and income.\n\nIn this case, option D is about expectations of higher future income. If consumers expect their income to rise, they might increase their current consumption, anticipating that they will be able to afford it in the future. This could lead to an increase in the demand for normal goods, like orange juice.\n\nOn the other hand, if orange juice is an inferior good, meaning that demand decreases as income increases, then expectations of higher future income might decrease current demand. But orange juice is generally considered a normal good, so an expectation of higher income should increase current demand.\n\nComparing all the options, option D seems to be the most likely to cause a shift to the right in the demand curve for orange juice.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain about the effect of expected higher income on current consumption. Maybe I should consider the permanent income hypothesis, which suggests that people base their consumption on their long-term income expectations rather than their current income. If that's the case, then expectations of higher future income would lead to an increase in current consumption, including orange juice.\n\nAlternatively, if people are liquidity constrained, meaning they can't borrow against their future income, they might not be able to increase their current consumption even if they expect higher future income.\n\nHowever, assuming that consumers can smooth their consumption over time, expectations of higher future income would allow them to consume more now.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's quickly review why the other options aren't likely to cause a rightward shift in the demand curve.\n\nOption A: A bumper crop of oranges affects supply, not demand.\n\nOption B: A decrease in the price of a substitute (Tang) would likely decrease the demand for orange juice.\n\nOption C: Expectations of lower future prices might decrease current demand as people wait for prices to drop.\n\nTherefore, option D is indeed the most plausible answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
