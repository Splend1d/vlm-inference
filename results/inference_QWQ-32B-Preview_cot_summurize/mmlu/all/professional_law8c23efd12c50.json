She was running late for the meeting and could not find a legal parking spot, so she decided to park illegally in front of a fire hydrant. This was in violation of a local ordinance that prohibited parking within 50 feet of a fire hydrant. The lawyer figured that it was better to get a ticket than to miss her meeting with an important client. The spot where she parked was next to the site of the construction of the new building. While the lawyer was at her meeting, an accident occurred at the construction site. A large crane was being used to lift a load of bricks. A cable on the crane broke, and the bricks fell. Most of them landed on top of the lawyer's car. The load of bricks that fell on the lawyer's car caused the gas tank of the car to rupture and explode. Shrapnel from the explosion flew in all directions and injured a pedestrian who was talking on the sidewalk near the lawyer's car. If the pedestrian sues the lawyer and relies on the doctrine of negligence per Se, which of the following, if true, is the lawyer's best defense?\n\nA. Payment of a small fine is the only penalty provided in the ordinance for those who park too close to fire hydrants.\nB.

                    "text": "So there's this scenario where a lawyer parks her car illegally in front of a fire hydrant because she's running late for a meeting. She knows it's against the law, but she decides to take the risk. While she's at her meeting, a crane at a construction site nearby has a cable break, and bricks fall onto her car, causing the gas tank to rupture and explode. This explosion injures a pedestrian on the sidewalk.\n\nNow, the pedestrian is suing the lawyer, and they're using something called \"negligence per se.\" I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D is the lawyer's best defense, assuming that what they're saying is true.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what negligence per se is. From what I recall, negligence per se is a legal doctrine that says if someone violates a law, and that violation causes harm to another person, then the person who violated the law is automatically considered negligent. It's like a shortcut in proving negligence because the law itself establishes a standard of care.\n\nSo, in this case, the lawyer violated the local ordinance by parking within 50 feet of a fire hydrant. If that violation led to the pedestrian's injury, then the lawyer could be held negligent per se.\n\nBut, there must be some limits to this doctrine, right? I mean, you don't want people to be liable for every little law they break that has nothing to do with the harm that occurred. So, maybe there are some defenses the lawyer can use.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"Payment of a small fine is the only penalty provided in the ordinance for those who park too close to fire hydrants.\"\n\nIs this a good defense? Well, the idea here might be that since the penalty for parking illegally is just a small fine, the legislature didn't intend for more severe consequences like being sued for injuries caused by someone else's actions. Maybe the lawyer can argue that the small fine is the only recourse allowed, and therefore, she shouldn't be liable for the pedestrian's injury.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if that makes sense. The size of the penalty for violating the ordinance might not necessarily limit the lawyer's liability for injuries caused by her violation. So, maybe this isn't the strongest defense.\n\nOption B: \"The police never issued a ticket to the lawyer for parking in front of the fire hydrant.\"\n\nHmm. So, the lawyer didn't get ticketed for parking illegally. Does that matter? Well, the fact that she wasn't ticketed doesn't change the fact that she violated the ordinance. Negligence per se is based on the violation itself, not on whether she was caught or penalized for it. So, I don't think this is a good defense.\n\nOption C: \"The purpose of the parking ordinance was to facilitate access to the hydrant by fire trucks, not to protect against accidents like the one that occurred when bricks fell on the lawyer's car.\"\n\nThis seems more promising. The idea here is that the law was meant to prevent one specific type of harm\u2014obstructing fire trucks from accessing hydrants\u2014and not to prevent the kind of accident that actually happened, which was bricks falling and causing an explosion.\n\nIn negligence per se, there's sometimes an requirement that the harm that occurred was the type of harm that the law was intended to prevent. This is sometimes called the \"purpose\" or \"intent\" of the law.\n\nSo, if the law was solely to ensure fire trucks can access hydrants, and the harm here was from an exploding car due to falling bricks, which isn't related to fire truck access, then maybe the lawyer can argue that negligence per se doesn't apply because the harm wasn't within the scope of what the law was intended to prevent.\n\nThat sounds like a solid defense.\n\nOption D: \"The pedestrian would not have been injured if the construction company had properly maintained the crane.\"\n\nThis seems like it's pointing the finger at someone else\u2014the construction company. The implication is that the construction company's negligence in maintaining the crane was the real cause of the pedestrian's injury, not the lawyer's illegal parking.\n\nIn legal terms, this might be an argument about causation or contributory negligence. The lawyer is trying to say that even if she parked illegally, it was the construction company's fault that led to the bricks falling and the explosion, which directly caused the pedestrian's injury.\n\nSo, perhaps the lawyer can argue that her violation of the parking ordinance wasn't the cause of the pedestrian's injury; the construction company's negligence was.\n\nBut, in negligence per se, the focus is on whether the violation was a cause in fact of the harm. Even if the construction company was negligent, if the lawyer's illegal parking contributed to the sequence of events that led to the injury, she might still be liable.\n\nHowever, this could still be a relevant defense, perhaps reducing her liability or shifting some blame to the construction company.\n\nComparing options C and D, I think option C is stronger because it goes directly to whether negligence per se even applies in this situation. If the law wasn't meant to prevent this type of harm, then the doctrine shouldn't apply.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, accepts that negligence per se might apply but tries to argue that someone else was more at fault.\n\nTherefore, the lawyer's best defense is likely option C: the purpose of the parking ordinance was to facilitate access to the hydrant by fire trucks, not to protect against accidents like the one that occurred when bricks fell on the lawyer's car.\n\nThis argument questions the applicability of negligence per se in this context, which could potentially defeat the pedestrian's case altogether, whereas option D might only mitigate the lawyer's liability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
