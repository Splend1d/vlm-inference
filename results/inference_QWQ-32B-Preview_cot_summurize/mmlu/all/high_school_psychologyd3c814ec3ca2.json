That's because she helped a company redesign its offices to improve employee morale and productivity. Industrial/organizational psychology is all about applying psychological principles to the workplace to make it better for everyone.\n\nLet me think about the other options to make sure. Counseling psychology is more about helping individuals deal with personal issues and emotional problems. Educational psychology focuses on how people learn and develop in educational settings, like schools. Developmental psychology looks at how people grow and change over their lifespan, from childhood to old age.\n\nBut in this case, Dr. Bonneau is working with a company to improve office design for better morale and productivity. That sounds like something an industrial/organizational psychologist would do. They often look at things like workplace environment, organizational culture, and how to make work more satisfying and efficient for employees.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. industrial/organizational.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
