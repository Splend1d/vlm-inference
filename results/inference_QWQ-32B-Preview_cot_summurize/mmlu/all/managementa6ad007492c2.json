Long-term.\n\nStrategic planning is a process that organizations use to set goals, determine the actions needed to achieve those goals, and allocate resources to execute those actions. It involves looking ahead and considering the future direction of the organization, often over a period of several years or even decades.\n\nHere's why the other options aren't the best fit:\n\n- B. Medium-term: While some aspects of strategic planning might have medium-term implications, the core of strategic planning is about long-term vision and goals.\n\n- C. Short-term: Short-term plans are more about day-to-day operations and immediate objectives, whereas strategic plans are about overarching goals and directions.\n\n- D. Unspecified time it takes to achieve an aim: Strategic plans do have specific time frames, even if those frames can be flexible. They usually outline goals and strategies to be achieved within a defined period.\n\nSo, in summary, strategic plans are long-term in nature, focusing on the big picture and the future direction of an organization."
