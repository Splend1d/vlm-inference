I remember learning that the popes in Rome are considered to be the successors of Saint Peter, who was one of Jesus's apostles and is often regarded as the first leader of the early Christian church.\n\nLet me think about this again. The question is asking about the \"director successor,\" which probably means the main or primary successor. Among the options, Peter, Paul, Jesus, and Matthew, I need to figure out who the Roman bishop, or pope, is said to directly succeed.\n\nI know that Peter was called the \"rock\" by Jesus, and that's why the Catholic Church sees him as the foundation of the church. In Matthew 16:18, Jesus says to Peter, \"And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.\" So, this verse is often used to support the idea that Peter is the chief apostle and the first pope.\n\nPaul is also an important figure in Christianity, but he wasn't one of the original twelve apostles; he had a conversion experience and became a key missionary. While his contributions are immense, he's not typically considered the head that Peter was.\n\nJesus is the central figure of Christianity, but he wasn't a bishop in the way that the pope is. The pope is considered to be the leader of the Catholic Church on earth, succeeding Peter, who was Jesus's disciple.\n\nMatthew was another one of the twelve apostles and is traditionally credited with writing the Gospel of Matthew, but he isn't specifically linked to the papacy in the same way Peter is.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm pretty sure the answer is A. Peter.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any basis for the pope being the successor of Paul. Paul was a major figure in spreading Christianity, and he did write many letters to early churches. However, the See of Rome, which is the bishopric of Rome, traces its origin back to Peter, not Paul. Although Paul also founded a church in Rome and was martyred there, the papal succession is linked to Peter.\n\nSimilarly, Jesus is the head of the church, but in terms of earthly leadership, Peter is seen as the first bishop of Rome.\n\nMatthew, as another apostle, doesn't have any special succession claims in the same manner.\n\nTherefore, the most correct answer is A. Peter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
