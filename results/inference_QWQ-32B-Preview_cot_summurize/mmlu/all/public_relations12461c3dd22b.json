The question is: \"According to Esman (1972), which publics help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance?\" And the options are A. Enabling, B. Functional, C. Normative, and D. Diffused.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Esman (1972) said about publics in the context of organizations. I remember that Esman categorized different types of publics based on their relationship and impact on organizations. Let me think about each option:\n\nA. Enabling: This sounds like publics that enable the organization to function or exist. Maybe they provide necessary support or authority.\n\nB. Functional: This might refer to publics that serve specific functions within the organization, like customers or suppliers.\n\nC. Normative: This could be publics that influence the organization's norms or standards, perhaps regulators or industry bodies.\n\nD. Diffused: This might refer to publics that have a more dispersed or less direct impact on the organization.\n\nGiven the question, it's asking for publics that help the organization exist by lending authority or assistance. That sounds a lot like enabling publics, which provide the necessary support for the organization to operate.\n\nLet me double-check by recalling Esman's definitions. Esman (1972) classified publics into three main categories: enabling, functional, and normative.\n\n- Enabling publics are those that provide the essential resources or authority that allow the organization to function. Without them, the organization couldn't exist.\n\n- Functional publics are involved in the day-to-day operations and activities of the organization. They are necessary for the organization to carry out its tasks.\n\n- Normative publics influence the organization's values, standards, and behaviors. They shape how the organization ought to behave.\n\nSo, based on this, enabling publics seem to be the ones that help the organization exist by lending authority or assistance.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't any confusion with the other options. Functional publics are important for operations, but they might not necessarily provide the authority or assistance for the organization to exist. Normative publics influence standards, which is different from providing authority or assistance to exist. Diffused publics seem to have a more indirect impact, so they probably aren't the ones lending authority or assistance directly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Enabling.\n\nJust to be thorough, I might want to look up Esman (1972) to confirm this, but since I'm supposed to answer based on my knowledge, I'll go with enabling publics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
