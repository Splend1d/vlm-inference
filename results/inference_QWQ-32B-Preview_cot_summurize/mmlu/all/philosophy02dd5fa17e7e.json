                    "text": "I'm going through this question about Locke's ideas, and I need to figure out what he believed happens when people form a society. The question is: \"According to Locke, every man, by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself under an obligation to everyone of that society to submit to the determination of_____. The options are A. the majority, B. the king, C. the judges, or D. his own will.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall Locke's views on social contract and government. Locke was a philosopher who influenced a lot of modern political thought, especially in democratic societies. He believed that people have natural rights, like life, liberty, and property, and that governments are created to protect these rights.\n\nIn his theory, people consent to form a government, which is kind of like forming a team or a group where everyone agrees to work together for the common good. But once they've formed this government, they have to follow certain rules and submit to its decisions in some way.\n\nNow, the question is asking what they submit to. Is it the majority decision, the king's decision, the judges', or their own will?\n\nLet me think about this. Locke was against absolute monarchy, so option B, the king, doesn't seem right because he argued against unlimited power in the hands of a single ruler.\n\nOption C, the judges, might be part of the government, but Locke didn't propose that judges should have the final say in everything. He thought that the legislative power should be the primary authority.\n\nOption D, his own will, doesn't make sense because if everyone just followed their own will, there would be chaos and no need for a government.\n\nSo, that leaves option A, the majority. Locke did believe in the idea that in a society, decisions should be made by the majority, but with certain protections for the minority and individual rights.\n\nIn his \"Second Treatise of Government,\" Locke discusses that in the state of nature, people have the natural right to enforce the law of nature, but to avoid conflicts and protect their rights more effectively, they agree to leave the state of nature and form a government.\n\nOnce in a society, they agree to be governed by the majority, but with some constraints. For example, the government should not have the power to take away people's natural rights.\n\nSo, it seems like the answer should be A, the majority.\n\nBut to make sure, let me double-check. Maybe Locke had a different view.\n\nI recall that Locke emphasized the social contract and the idea that government derives its authority from the consent of the governed. This consent is typically expressed through majority rule, but with safeguards for individual rights.\n\nAlso, Locke discussed the separation of powers, suggesting that different functions of government should be divided among different bodies to prevent abuse of power. But in terms of decision-making, especially in the legislative branch, majority rule would seem to be the mechanism.\n\nMoreover, Locke talked about the right of the people to revolt if the government fails to protect their rights. This implies that the government is accountable to the people, and majority rule is a way to express the will of the people.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that when people form a society, they agree to submit to the determinations of the majority, as long as their fundamental rights are respected.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is A. the majority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
