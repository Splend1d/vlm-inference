Let me see what I can find.\n\nFirst, I recall that fertility rates have been declining worldwide over the past few decades. In the 1960s, the global fertility rate was over 5 children per woman, and it has been decreasing since then. So, option D, which is 4.5 children per woman, seems too high for 2015.\n\nOption A is 1.5 children per woman, which seems too low. I know that some developed countries have fertility rates below 2, but I don't think the global average was that low in 2015.\n\nOption B is 2.5, and option C is 3.5. I need to decide between these two.\n\nI think I've heard that the replacement fertility rate is around 2.1 children per woman, which is the rate needed to keep the population stable (not counting migration). Since the global fertility rate has been decreasing but is still above 2.1 in many parts of the world, I would guess that in 2015 it was above 2.5.\n\nWait, but I also recall that the global fertility rate has been approaching 2.5 children per woman in recent years. Let me try to recall specific data.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, in 2015, the global total fertility rate was approximately 2.5 children per woman. So, option B seems correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider other sources. The World Bank data also shows that the global fertility rate was around 2.5 in 2015.\n\nMoreover, I remember that fertility rates vary greatly by region. For example, in Africa, the fertility rate was higher, around 4.7 children per woman, while in Europe, it was around 1.6.\n\nSo, when averaged globally, it makes sense that the worldwide fertility rate would be around 2.5 in 2015.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. 2.5 children per woman.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
