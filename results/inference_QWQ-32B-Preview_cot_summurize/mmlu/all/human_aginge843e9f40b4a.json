The options are Francis Galton, William James, Michelle Meer, and Tom Penge. I don't remember much about this, so I need to think carefully.\n\nFirst, I recall that Francis Galton is known for his work in statistics and psychology. He's often associated with the concept of correlation and was a cousin of Charles Darwin. Maybe he did some pioneering work in measuring psychological traits, including response times.\n\nWilliam James is another important figure in psychology. He's known for his textbook \"Principles of Psychology\" and is considered one of the founders of American psychology. He might have conducted experiments on response times as well.\n\nMichelle Meer and Tom Penge don't ring any bells for me. I think they might be less well-known figures or possibly even distractors in this question.\n\nLet me consider what I know about response times. Response time is a measure of how quickly an individual reacts to a stimulus, which can be important in various psychological and neurological assessments. It's likely that one of these pioneers in psychology was the first to systematically measure and compare response times across different age groups.\n\nFrancis Galton is often credited with developing many statistical tools and applying them to various fields, including psychology. He was interested in individual differences and may have been the first to measure response times scientifically.\n\nWilliam James, on the other hand, wrote extensively about consciousness, emotion, and other psychological phenomena. While he might have discussed response times, I'm not sure if he was the first to measure them.\n\nTo make an informed guess, I'll go with Francis Galton because of his pioneering work in statistics and his interest in measuring various human characteristics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
