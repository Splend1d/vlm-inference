The testes are the male reproductive glands that are responsible for producing sperm and secreting hormones. \n\nTo provide a bit more detail:\n\n- **Glans penis**: This is the sensitive tip of the penis, covered by the prepuce (foreskin). It contains a high concentration of nerve endings and is involved in sexual sensation but does not produce hormones.\n\n- **Prepuce**: Also known as the foreskin, this is the retractable layer of skin that covers the glans penis. Its primary function is to protect the glans and maintain moisture, but it does not produce hormones.\n\n- **Prostate**: This is a gland in the male reproductive system that surrounds the urethra just below the bladder. It produces a significant portion of the fluid that makes up semen, which helps to nourish and transport sperm. While the prostate plays a crucial role in reproduction, it does not produce male hormones.\n\n- **Testes**: Located in the scrotum, the testes are where sperm are produced, and they also secrete testosterone and other androgens, which are essential for the development of male secondary sexual characteristics and the maintenance of fertility.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Testes."
