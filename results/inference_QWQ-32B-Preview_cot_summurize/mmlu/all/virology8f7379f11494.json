                    "text": "Filoviruses are a group of viruses that include Ebola virus and Marburg virus, both of which can cause severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates. Understanding the morphology of filoviruses is crucial for their identification, study, and the development of countermeasures against them.\n\nOption A suggests that filoviruses have a \"very large ball-like structure.\" While some viruses do have spherical shapes, such as certain retroviruses or herpesviruses, filoviruses are not known for their ball-like appearance. Therefore, option A is not correct.\n\nOption B describes filoviruses as \"long filamentous threads.\" This description aligns closely with the actual morphology of filoviruses. Under electron microscopy, filoviruses appear as long, filamentous particles that can vary in length from a few hundred nanometers up to meters in some cases, although the infectious virions are typically around 1 um in length. These filaments can appear in various forms, including straight rods, branched structures, or even tangled masses resembling \"worms\" or \"noodles.\" This unique appearance is one of the hallmarks of filoviruses and is the basis for their name, derived from the Latin word \"filum,\" meaning thread.\n\nOption C proposes that filoviruses have an \"icosahedral virion.\" Icosahedral symmetry is common among many viruses, including adenoviruses and poliovirus, due to its efficient packing of genetic material. However, filoviruses do not exhibit this type of symmetry; their non-enveloped nucleocapsid is not organized into a regular geometric shape like an icosahedron. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D describes filoviruses as having \"floppy membranes without defined morphology.\" While filoviruses do have an envelope derived from the host cell membrane, which could be considered \"floppy,\" their overall structure is not amorphous. The virions have a distinct filamentous shape, indicating a defined morphology rather than a shapeless membrane. Thus, option D does not accurately describe filovirus morphology.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is option B: filoviruses are characterized by their long filamentous threads. This morphology is not only visually distinctive but also has implications for their assembly, release from host cells, and interaction with host factors. Understanding these aspects is essential for developing vaccines and antiviral therapies against filovirus infections.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n1. Bray M, Geisbert TW.
