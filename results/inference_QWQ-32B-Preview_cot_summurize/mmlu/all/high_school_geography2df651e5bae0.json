                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, in food. It asks about what opponents of GMOs in food are afraid of. The options are:\n\nA. will hinder global trade.\n\nB. make plants more resistant to disease.\n\nC. may cause irreversible changes in humans.\n\nD. make plants more resistant to drought.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what GMOs are. GMOs are organisms whose genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally. This often involves inserting genes from one organism into another to give it desired traits, like resistance to pests or tolerance to drought.\n\nNow, opponents of GMOs in food probably have concerns about the safety or the ethics of consuming genetically modified products. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Will hinder global trade.\n\nI'm not sure about this one. GMOs are widely used in agriculture, especially in countries like the United States, Brazil, and Argentina. Some countries have regulations or bans on GMO imports, which could affect global trade. But is this what opponents are afraid of? Maybe some, but I think their main concerns are more about health and environmental impacts.\n\nB. Make plants more resistant to disease.\n\nActually, this is often presented as a benefit of GMOs. By making plants resistant to diseases, farmers can have more stable crops and potentially higher yields. So, opponents might not be afraid of this; instead, they might be concerned about the unintended consequences of these modifications.\n\nC. May cause irreversible changes in humans.\n\nThis seems like a plausible concern for opponents. There's a fear that consuming GMOs could have unknown effects on human health, possibly leading to long-term or irreversible changes. This is a common argument against GMOs\u2014that not enough is known about their effects on human biology.\n\nD. Make plants more resistant to drought.\n\nAgain, this is typically seen as a benefit, especially in regions where water is scarce. By making plants more drought-resistant, GMOs could help in areas prone to drought, improving food security. So, opponents might not be afraid of this aspect; they might still have concerns about the safety or the environmental impact.\n\nConsidering these points, I think option C, \"may cause irreversible changes in humans,\" is the most likely answer. It aligns with the common fears and concerns expressed by opponents of GMOs regarding human health.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there are other reasons why opponents might be afraid of GMOs. For example, some people are concerned about the environmental impact, like gene flow to non-GMO crops or the development of pesticide-resistant weeds. However, the question specifically mentions \"in food,\" so it's probably focusing on human consumption aspects.\n\nAlso, some opponents are concerned about the monopoly power of biotech companies that develop GMO seeds, but again, that seems more related to economic and regulatory issues rather than direct health concerns from consuming GMOs.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is C, \"may cause irreversible changes in humans.\" This captures the health-related fears that many opponents have regarding GMOs in food.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
