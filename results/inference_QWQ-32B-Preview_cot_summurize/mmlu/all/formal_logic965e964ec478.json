                    "text": "So I have this problem here, and I need to construct truth tables for the propositions I \u2261 ~H and ~(~I \u2261 H), and then determine if they are logically equivalent, contradictory, or neither, and whether they are consistent or inconsistent. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these propositions mean. I have I \u2261 ~H, which means \"I if and only if not H.\" And the other proposition is ~(~I \u2261 H), which is \"not (not I if and only if H).\" I need to construct truth tables for both of these and compare them.\n\nTo construct a truth table, I need to consider all possible truth values for the variables involved, which are I and H. Since there are two variables, there will be 4 possible combinations: both true, both false, I true and H false, and I false and H true.\n\nLet me list out the truth values for I and H:\n\n1. I = T, H = T\n\n2. I = T, H = F\n\n3. I = F, H = T\n\n4. I = F, H = F\n\nNow, for each of these rows, I need to calculate the truth values for both propositions.\n\nStarting with I \u2261 ~H:\n\nFirst, find ~H for each row:\n\n1. H = T \u2192 ~H = F\n\n2. H = F \u2192 ~H = T\n\n3. H = T \u2192 ~H = F\n\n4. H = F \u2192 ~H = T\n\nNow, I \u2261 ~H:\n\n1. I = T, ~H = F \u2192 T \u2261 F = F\n\n2. I = T, ~H = T \u2192 T \u2261 T = T\n\n3. I = F, ~H = F \u2192 F \u2261 F = T\n\n4. I = F, ~H = T \u2192 F \u2261 T = F\n\nSo, the truth values for I \u2261 ~H are: F, T, T, F\n\nNext, ~(~I \u2261 H):\n\nFirst, find ~I for each row:\n\n1. I = T \u2192 ~I = F\n\n2. I = T \u2192 ~I = F\n\n3. I = F \u2192 ~I = T\n\n4. I = F \u2192 ~I = T\n\nNow, ~I \u2261 H:\n\n1. ~I = F, H = T \u2192 F \u2261 T = F\n\n2. ~I = F, H = F \u2192 F \u2261 F = T\n\n3. ~I = T, H = T \u2192 T \u2261 T = T\n\n4. ~I = T, H = F \u2192 T \u2261 F = F\n\nNow, negate that:\n\n1. ~(F) = T\n\n2. ~(T) = F\n\n3. ~(T) = F\n\n4. ~(F) = T\n\nSo, the truth values for ~(~I \u2261 H) are: T, F, F, T\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets of truth values:\n\nI \u2261 ~H: F, T, T, F\n\n~(~I \u2261 H): T, F, F, T\n\nLooking at these, I can see that they are not the same, so they are not logically equivalent. Also, they are not exact opposites; for example, in row 2, I \u2261 ~H is T and ~(~I \u2261 H) is F, and in row 3, both are F. So, they are not contradictory.\n\nNow, for consistency and inconsistency: two propositions are consistent if there is at least one row where both are true. Looking at the truth values:\n\n- Row 1: I \u2261 ~H = F, ~(~I \u2261 H) = T \u2192 not both true\n\n- Row 2: I \u2261 ~H = T, ~(~I \u2261 H) = F \u2192 not both true\n\n- Row 3: I \u2261 ~H = T, ~(~I \u2261 H) = F \u2192 not both true\n\n- Row 4: I \u2261 ~H = F, ~(~I \u2261 H) = T \u2192 not both true\n\nWait, in all rows, they don't have both being true at the same time. So, are they inconsistent? No, because inconsistency means that there is no row where both are true, but they can both be false sometimes.\n\nWait, in row 3, I \u2261 ~H is T and ~(~I \u2261 H) is F, and in row 4, I \u2261 ~H is F and ~(~I \u2261 H) is T. So, they never share the same truth value; whenever one is true, the other is false, and vice versa.\n\nWait, actually, in row 3, both are false, so they are both false in that row. Wait, no: I \u2261 ~H is T and ~(~I \u2261 H) is F in row 3.\n\nWait, let's re-examine row 3:\n\nI = F, H = T\n\n~H = F\n\nI \u2261 ~H: F \u2261 F \u2192 T\n\n~I = T\n\n~I \u2261 H: T \u2261 T \u2192 T\n\n~(~I \u2261 H): ~T \u2192 F\n\nSo, I \u2261 ~H is T and ~(~I \u2261 H) is F.\n\nSimilarly, in row 4:\n\nI = F, H = F\n\n~H = T\n\nI \u2261 ~H: F \u2261 T \u2192 F\n\n~I = T\n\n~I \u2261 H: T \u2261 F \u2192 F\n\n~(~I \u2261 H): ~F \u2192 T\n\nSo, I \u2261 ~H is F and ~(~I \u2261 H) is T.\n\nSo, indeed, in no row are both propositions true at the same time, but there is at least one row where both are false (row 3). Wait, in row 3, I \u2261 ~H is T and ~(~I \u2261 H) is F, so they are not both false.\n\nWait, in row 3:\n\nI \u2261 ~H: T\n\n~(~I \u2261 H): F\n\nSo, they are not both false.\n\nIn row 4:\n\nI \u2261 ~H: F\n\n~(~I \u2261 H): T\n\nAgain, not both false.\n\nSo, in no row are both propositions true or both false; they always have opposite truth values.\n\nTherefore, they are contradictory because they always have opposite truth values.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought they are not contradictory. Maybe I need to check again.\n\nLogical equivalence means that the truth values are the same in every row.\n\nContradictory means that the truth values are always opposite.\n\nConsistent means that there is at least one row where both are true.\n\nInconsistent means that there is no row where both are true.\n\nSo, in this case, since the truth values are always opposite, they are contradictory.\n\nWait, but in row 3, I \u2261 ~H is T and ~(~I \u2261 H) is F, which is opposite, and in row 4, I \u2261 ~H is F and ~(~I \u2261 H) is T, which is also opposite.\n\nIn row 1, I \u2261 ~H is F and ~(~I \u2261 H) is T, opposite.\n\nIn row 2, I \u2261 ~H is T and ~(~I \u2261 H) is F, opposite.\n\nSo, in every row, their truth values are opposite, which is the definition of contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Contradictory.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to see this.\n\nLet me see if I can simplify the second proposition, ~(~I \u2261 H).\n\nFirst, ~I \u2261 H is the same as ~I \u2261 H.\n\nThen, ~(~I \u2261 H) is the negation of that.\n\nWait, I know that P \u2261 Q is logically equivalent to ~(P \u2261 Q) \u2261 ~P \u2261 Q.\n\nWait, actually, ~(P \u2261 Q) is equivalent to P \u2261 ~Q.\n\nSo, ~(~I \u2261 H) \u2261 ~I \u2261 ~H.\n\nWait, is that right?\n\nLet me recall: the negation of a biconditional P \u2261 Q is equivalent to P \u2261 ~Q.\n\nSo, ~(~I \u2261 H) \u2261 ~I \u2261 ~H.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the first proposition, I \u2261 ~H.\n\nSo, I \u2261 ~H and ~I \u2261 ~H.\n\nAre these contradictory?\n\nLet me see: I \u2261 ~H means that I and ~H have the same truth value.\n\n~I \u2261 ~H means that ~I and ~H have the same truth value.\n\nBut ~I and I are opposites, so if I and ~H are the same, and ~I and ~H are the same, that would mean ~I and I are the same, which is only possible if both are false, but that's not generally the case.\n\nWait, maybe I should just compare I \u2261 ~H and ~I \u2261 ~H directly.\n\nIf I \u2261 ~H, then ~I \u2261 H.\n\nSo, ~I \u2261 H.\n\nBut the second proposition is ~I \u2261 ~H.\n\nSo, ~I \u2261 H vs. ~I \u2261 ~H.\n\nThese can only both be true if H \u2261 ~H, which is only possible if H is both true and false, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, they cannot both be true at the same time, and their truth values are always opposite, confirming that they are contradictory.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Contradictory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
