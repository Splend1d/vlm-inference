                    "text": "So, there's this question about what happens to the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output if a major earthquake destroys a lot of the plant and equipment on the West Coast. We're supposed to assume that the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what aggregate supply is. Aggregate supply is the total amount of goods and services that firms are willing and able to sell at a given price level. The upward sloping aggregate supply curve means that as the price level increases, the quantity of output supplied also increases. That makes sense because if prices are higher, firms can make more profit by producing more.\n\nNow, the question is about a major earthquake that destroys a lot of plant and equipment on the West Coast. Plant and equipment are part of the capital stock that firms use to produce goods and services. If a lot of that is destroyed, it means that the productive capacity of the economy has been reduced. In other words, firms can't produce as much as before because they've lost some of their means of production.\n\nSo, if the productive capacity decreases, that should shift the aggregate supply curve to the left. A leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve means that at any given price level, less output is supplied.\n\nNow, let's think about what that does to the equilibrium price level and equilibrium quantity of output.\n\nIf the aggregate supply curve shifts leftward, and assuming the aggregate demand curve stays the same, the new equilibrium will have a higher price level and a lower quantity of output.\n\nLet me draw a quick graph in my mind to visualize this.\n\nInitially, we have an aggregate demand curve and an aggregate supply curve intersecting at some point, which is the equilibrium with price level P and quantity Q.\n\nNow, if aggregate supply shifts leftward because of the destruction caused by the earthquake, the new aggregate supply curve will be to the left of the original one.\n\nThe new equilibrium will be at the intersection of the new aggregate supply curve and the unchanged aggregate demand curve. At this new intersection, the price level is higher than P, say P1, and the quantity of output is lower than Q, say Q1.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nB. The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\n\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nD. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output decrease.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option A seems to be correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the destruction of plant and equipment affects aggregate demand as well. For example, if many firms are destroyed, maybe people spend less, or investment decreases. But the question seems to be focusing on the supply side, assuming that the aggregate supply curve is shifting.\n\nAlso, perhaps the upward sloping aggregate supply curve is specifically the short-run aggregate supply curve, and in the long run, things might be different. But the question doesn't specify the time frame, so I'm assuming it's about the short run.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if the earthquake destroys a lot of capital, maybe the economy shifts to a new long-run equilibrium with a lower level of potential output. But again, the question seems to be about the immediate effect on the equilibrium price level and quantity of output, assuming an upward sloping aggregate supply curve.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial thought, I think the correct answer is A: the equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
