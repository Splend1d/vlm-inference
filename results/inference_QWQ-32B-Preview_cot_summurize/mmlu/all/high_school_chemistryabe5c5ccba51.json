                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about making a dilution of sulfuric acid. I have a stock solution that's 12.0 M, and I need to make up 100 mL of a 4.0 M solution using that stock and water. There are four options provided, and I need to figure out which one is the best procedure to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how dilutions work. I remember that when you dilute a solution, you're adding solvent (in this case, water) to a concentrated solution (the stock sulfuric acid) to reduce its concentration to the desired level.\n\nThe basic formula for dilutions is:\n\n\\[ M_1 V_1 = M_2 V_2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( M_1 \\) is the initial molarity (the stock solution's molarity),\n\n- \\( V_1 \\) is the volume of the stock solution needed,\n\n- \\( M_2 \\) is the final molarity (the desired concentration),\n\n- \\( V_2 \\) is the final volume of the solution.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- \\( M_1 = 12.0 \\, M \\)\n\n- \\( M_2 = 4.0 \\, M \\)\n\n- \\( V_2 = 100 \\, mL \\)\n\nI need to find \\( V_1 \\), the volume of the stock solution to use.\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\n\\[ 12.0 \\, M \\times V_1 = 4.0 \\, M \\times 100 \\, mL \\]\n\nSolving for \\( V_1 \\):\n\n\\[ V_1 = \\frac{4.0 \\, M \\times 100 \\, mL}{12.0 \\, M} \\]\n\n\\[ V_1 = \\frac{400}{12} \\, mL \\]\n\n\\[ V_1 = 33.\\overline{3} \\, mL \\]\n\nSo, I need approximately 33.3 mL of the stock solution.\n\nNow, the total volume of the final solution is 100 mL, so the volume of water to add would be:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{water}} = V_2 - V_1 \\]\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{water}} = 100 \\, mL - 33.3 \\, mL \\]\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{water}} = 66.7 \\, mL \\]\n\nOkay, so I need to add 33.3 mL of the 12.0 M stock solution and 66.7 mL of water to make 100 mL of 4.0 M sulfuric acid.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Add 33.3 mL of water to the flask, and then add 66.7 mL of 12.0 M acid.\n\nB. Add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask, and then dilute it with 66.7 mL of water.\n\nC. Add 67.7 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask, and then dilute it with 33.3 mL of water.\n\nD. Add 67.7 mL of water to the flask, and then add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid.\n\nOption C has the volumes reversed: it suggests adding 67.7 mL of acid and 33.3 mL of water, which doesn't match what I calculated. Option D also has the volumes reversed. So, those are probably incorrect.\n\nBetween options A and B, both have the correct volumes of acid and water, but the order of addition is different.\n\nOption A suggests adding water first and then acid, while option B suggests adding acid first and then water.\n\nI need to think about which order is safer or more appropriate for diluting sulfuric acid.\n\nI recall that when diluting sulfuric acid, it's important to add the acid to the water, not the other way around. This is because sulfuric acid is highly exothermic when it dissolves in water, and adding water to acid can cause a violent reaction or even cause the solution to splash out of the container.\n\nTherefore, the safer procedure is to add the acid to the water, which is what option B describes.\n\nSo, the best procedure is to add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask and then dilute it with 66.7 mL of water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
