                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the statement that correctly characterizes an autoimmune disease. So, first things first, I should probably remember what an autoimmune disease is.\n\nAn autoimmune disease is when your immune system mistakes part of your body for something foreign and starts attacking it. It's like your body's defense system getting confused and turning on itself.\n\nOption A says: \"T cells attack healthy body cells.\" Hmm, T cells are a type of white blood cell that plays a big role in the immune system. If they're attacking healthy body cells, that sounds a lot like an autoimmune disease. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B: \"An aneurysm is a weakness in the wall of a blood vessel that causes it to balloon out. The vessel can rupture and cause a hemorrhage.\" This sounds more like a condition related to blood vessels, maybe related to hypertension or something like that. But it doesn't sound like an autoimmune disease.\n\nOption C: \"Several factors cause hypertension: smoking, being overweight, lack of physical activity, and too much salt in the diet.\" Again, this is about hypertension, which is high blood pressure. It's a cardiovascular issue, not an autoimmune disease.\n\nOption D: \"Alzheimer's disease is caused by the buildup of plaque within the brain, causing brain cells to die.\" Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease, related to the brain, but not an autoimmune disease.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, only option A seems to be directly related to the definition of an autoimmune disease. The other options are about different types of health conditions that aren't autoimmune in nature.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. T cells attack healthy body cells.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
