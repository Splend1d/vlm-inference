I remember that Goldthorpe is a sociologist who has done work on social classes, especially in the context of Britain. So, I need to recall his classification system.\n\nI think Goldthorpe developed a class schema that goes beyond the traditional working class and middle class distinction. He introduced the concept of service class, but I need to remember exactly what it entails.\n\nOption A says \"those in non-manual occupations, exercising authority on behalf of the state.\" Hmm, that sounds like it could be related to public sector workers or something like that. But I'm not sure if that's exactly what Goldthorpe meant by service class.\n\nOption B mentions \"people working in consultancy firms who were recruited by big businesses.\" That seems more like a specific type of professional or managerial role in the private sector. I don't recall Goldthorpe specifically referring to consultancy firms when discussing the service class.\n\nOption C is about \"the young men and women employed in domestic service in the nineteenth century.\" Now, domestic service is a historical term for people working in households, like maids, butters, gardeners, etc. That seems more related to a different time period and perhaps a different class category.\n\nOption D says \"those who had worked in the armed services.\" That would include military personnel, but I don't think that's what Goldthorpe was referring to with the term 'service class.'\n\nLet me think again. Goldthorpe's class schema includes categories like employment relations, occupational characteristics, and some other factors. I think the service class in his framework refers to people who are in non-manual jobs but not necessarily in positions of authority. Maybe it's more about the type of service they provide.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about public service occupations, like teachers, nurses, civil servants, etc., who provide services to the public but aren't necessarily exercising authority on behalf of the state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about people who work in service industries, like retail, hospitality, etc.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them perfectly match what I'm thinking. Maybe I need to consider the context in which Goldthorpe used the term 'service class.'\n\nLet me consider option A again: \"those in non-manual occupations, exercising authority on behalf of the state.\" This sounds a bit like higher-level civil servants or managers in the public sector. Maybe Goldthorpe classified such people as the service class.\n\nOption B seems too narrow, focusing only on consultancy firms and big businesses. While these people might be part of a service class, it seems too specific.\n\nOption C is clearly historical and doesn't seem relevant to Goldthorpe's modern class analysis.\n\nOption D is about people who have worked in the armed services, which again seems like a separate category.\n\nI think the best answer is A: those in non-manual occupations exercising authority on behalf of the state. This seems to align with Goldthorpe's classification of a service class involved in administrative and managerial roles in the public sector.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
