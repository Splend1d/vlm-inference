                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about waiting times for a roller coaster. It says the waiting times are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. There are 150,000 riders in the first summer, and I need to find the shortest time interval that includes 100,000 riders. The options are:\n\nA. 0 to 31.7 minutes\n\nB. 31.7 to 39.3 minutes\n\nC. 25.3 to 44.7 minutes\n\nD. 25.3 to 35 minutes\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a normal distribution with mean (\u03bc) = 35 minutes and standard deviation (\u03c3) = 10 minutes. The total number of riders is 150,000, and I need to find the shortest time interval that includes 100,000 riders.\n\nSo, essentially, I need to find an interval on this normal distribution that covers 100,000 out of 150,000 riders, which is approximately 66.67% of the total riders. I need to find the shortest interval that includes this proportion of the data.\n\nIn a normal distribution, the shortest interval that includes a given proportion of the data is the one centered on the mean. However, in this case, option B is not centered on 35 minutes, while option C is wider and includes more time, and option D is only up to the mean.\n\nWait, but let's think about it. The question is asking for the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders. So, I need to find the smallest range of waiting times that includes 100,000 riders out of 150,000.\n\nFirst, I should find what proportion 100,000 is of 150,000:\n\n100,000 / 150,000 = 2/3 \u2248 0.6667\n\nSo, I need to find the time interval that includes the middle 66.67% of the riders, since the normal distribution is symmetric.\n\nTo find this interval, I need to find the z-scores that correspond to the cumulative probabilities of (1 - 0.6667)/2 = 0.16665 in each tail.\n\nWait, actually, no. If I want the middle 66.67% of the data, I need to find the z-scores that correspond to the cumulative probabilities of 0.16665 in each tail because 1 - 0.6667 = 0.3333, and divided by 2 is 0.16665.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use the standard normal distribution table to find the z-scores that correspond to cumulative probabilities of 0.16665 and 0.83335.\n\nLooking up in the z-table, for a cumulative probability of 0.16665, the z-score is approximately -0.99, and for 0.83335, it's approximately +0.99.\n\nSo, the interval in terms of z-scores is from -0.99\u03c3 to +0.99\u03c3.\n\nGiven that \u03c3 = 10 minutes, this would be:\n\nLower limit: 35 - 0.99*10 = 35 - 9.9 = 25.1 minutes\n\nUpper limit: 35 + 0.99*10 = 35 + 9.9 = 44.9 minutes\n\nSo, the interval should be approximately 25.1 to 44.9 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25.3 to 44.7 minutes, which is very close to what I just calculated.\n\nBut wait, option A is 0 to 31.7 minutes. That seems too low, because 0 minutes waiting time is the minimum possible, and 31.7 is less than the mean of 35.\n\nOption B is 31.7 to 39.3 minutes. That's a narrower interval, but it's not centered on the mean.\n\nOption D is 25.3 to 35 minutes, which is from one standard deviation below the mean to the mean itself.\n\nBut, in a normal distribution, the shortest interval covering a certain proportion is the one centered on the mean. So, option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nHowever, let's verify the calculations to make sure.\n\nFirst, find the z-scores corresponding to the cumulative probabilities that capture the middle 66.67% of the data.\n\nAs previously calculated, z \u2248 \u00b10.99.\n\nSo, the interval in minutes is:\n\nLower limit: 35 - 0.99*10 = 25.1 minutes\n\nUpper limit: 35 + 0.99*10 = 44.9 minutes\n\nOption C is 25.3 to 44.7 minutes, which is very close to this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are based on slightly different z-score calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not asking for the middle 66.67%, but rather any interval that includes 100,000 riders, and I need to find the shortest such interval.\n\nIn that case, it might not necessarily be the one centered on the mean.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that.\n\nIn a normal distribution, the shortest interval for a given proportion is indeed the one centered on the mean.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to get a shorter interval by choosing asymmetric bounds.\n\nFor example, perhaps taking a higher proportion above the mean where the density is higher could result in a shorter interval.\n\nWait, but in a normal distribution, the density is highest at the mean and decreases symmetrically on both sides.\n\nSo, the shortest interval for a given proportion is indeed the one centered on the mean.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's double-check by calculating the actual number of riders in each interval.\n\nFirst, for option C: 25.3 to 44.7 minutes.\n\nConvert these to z-scores:\n\nz1 = (25.3 - 35)/10 = -0.97\n\nz2 = (44.7 - 35)/10 = 0.97\n\nUsing the z-table, the cumulative probabilities are:\n\nFor z = -0.97, cumulative probability \u2248 0.1660\n\nFor z = 0.97, cumulative probability \u2248 0.8340\n\nSo, the proportion between 25.3 and 44.7 minutes is 0.8340 - 0.1660 = 0.6680, which is approximately 66.8% of the riders.\n\nGiven that there are 150,000 riders, the number of riders in this interval is:\n\n0.6680 * 150,000 \u2248 100,200 riders\n\nWhich is more than 100,000.\n\nSimilarly, for option B: 31.7 to 39.3 minutes.\n\nz1 = (31.7 - 35)/10 = -0.33\n\nz2 = (39.3 - 35)/10 = 0.43\n\nCumulative probabilities:\n\nz = -0.33 \u2248 0.3707\n\nz = 0.43 \u2248 0.6664\n\nProportion between 31.7 and 39.3 minutes: 0.6664 - 0.3707 = 0.2957, or 29.57% of riders.\n\nThat's only about 44,355 riders, which is less than 100,000.\n\nOption A: 0 to 31.7 minutes.\n\nz1 = (0 - 35)/10 = -3.5\n\nz2 = (31.7 - 35)/10 = -0.33\n\nCumulative probabilities:\n\nz = -3.5 \u2248 0.0002\n\nz = -0.33 \u2248 0.3707\n\nProportion between 0 and 31.7 minutes: 0.3707 - 0.0002 = 0.3705, or 37.05% of riders.\n\nThat's about 55,575 riders, still less than 100,000.\n\nOption D: 25.3 to 35 minutes.\n\nz1 = (25.3 - 35)/10 = -0.97\n\nz2 = (35 - 35)/10 = 0\n\nCumulative probabilities:\n\nz = -0.97 \u2248 0.1660\n\nz = 0 \u2248 0.5000\n\nProportion between 25.3 and 35 minutes: 0.5000 - 0.1660 = 0.3340, or 33.4% of riders.\n\nThat's about 49,500 riders, again less than 100,000.\n\nTherefore, only option C includes more than 100,000 riders.\n\nMoreover, since it's the only option that includes enough riders, and given that it's the shortest interval among those that do include 100,000 riders, it must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's a shorter interval that includes 100,000 riders.\n\nSuppose I consider an interval from, say, 26 to 44 minutes.\n\nz1 = (26 - 35)/10 = -0.9\n\nz2 = (44 - 35)/10 = 0.9\n\nCumulative probabilities:\n\nz = -0.9 \u2248 0.1841\n\nz = 0.9 \u2248 0.8159\n\nProportion between 26 and 44 minutes: 0.8159 - 0.1841 = 0.6318, or 63.18% of riders.\n\nThat's about 94,770 riders, which is less than 100,000.\n\nSo, making the interval slightly shorter than option C reduces the number of riders below 100,000.\n\nTherefore, option C is indeed the shortest interval that includes at least 100,000 riders.\n\nThus, the answer is C. 25.3 to 44.7 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
