Primary research, B. Descriptive research, C. Causal research, D. Secondary research.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out which one of these terms refers to second-hand data that was collected by someone else for their own purposes. Let me think about what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, primary research. I think that's when you collect data directly yourself, for your own specific research question. So, if I'm doing a study and I go out and collect survey data or conduct experiments myself, that's primary research. So, that's not second-hand data.\n\nNext, descriptive research. I recall that descriptive research is aimed at describing the characteristics of a phenomenon. It could involve collecting data, but the key here is that it's about describing what is. But it doesn't specify whether the data is collected by you or someone else.\n\nThen, causal research. That's when you're trying to establish cause-and-effect relationships between variables. Again, this can involve collecting your own data or using existing data, but the focus is on causality.\n\nFinally, secondary research. This sounds promising. Secondary research involves using data that has been collected by someone else for a different purpose. So, it's essentially repurposing existing data for your own research questions.\n\nGiven that definition, it seems like secondary research matches the description of second-hand data collected for someone else's purposes.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I should look up the definitions quickly.\n\nOkay, looking up primary research: it's original research conducted by the researcher for a specific purpose. So, that's firsthand data collection.\n\nDescriptive research: aims to describe characteristics of a population or phenomenon, often using surveys or observations.\n\nCausal research: focuses on understanding cause-and-effect relationships, often through experiments or quasi-experiments.\n\nSecondary research: involves analyzing data or information that has been collected by others, often for different purposes.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, second-hand data collected for someone else's purposes is indeed secondary research.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Secondary research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
