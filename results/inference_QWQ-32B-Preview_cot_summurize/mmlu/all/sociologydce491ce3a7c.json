It's sincere and accurate, without political bias.\n\nB. It represents all similar documents that didn't survive.\n\nC. It has both a literal and an interpretable meaning.\n\nD. It's a sound original or a reliable copy with known authorship.\n\nI need to figure out which one Scott would agree with. I don't remember exactly what Scott said, but I think I can reason through this.\n\nOption A talks about sincerity and accuracy, and being free from political bias. That sounds like it's about the content being truthful and unbiased. But authenticity might be more about whether the document is what it claims to be, rather than just the truthfulness of its content.\n\nOption B says it should represent all similar documents that didn't survive. I'm not sure about that. Authenticity is usually about the document itself, not about its representativeness of a larger group of documents.\n\nOption C mentions both literal and interpretable meaning. That seems more related to interpretation rather than authenticity. Authenticity is about whether the document is genuine, not about how we interpret it.\n\nOption D talks about being a 'sound' original or a reliable copy with known authorship. This sounds a lot like the standard definitions of authenticity I've come across. A authentic document should be what it purports to be, not a forgery, and its origin should be known.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Authenticity in documents usually involves verifying that the document is original or a accurate copy, and that it comes from the person or source it claims to come from. So, known authorship is important.\n\nAlso, a 'sound' original would mean it's in good condition and hasn't been altered significantly, I suppose. A reliable copy would be one that accurately reproduces the original.\n\nOption A seems more about the content being truthful, which is different from authenticity. Authenticity is more about the document being what it claims to be, regardless of whether the content is true or biased.\n\nOption B is about representativeness, which doesn't seem directly related to authenticity.\n\nOption C is about interpretation, which again is separate from authenticity.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, D seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any overlap or if I'm missing something.\n\nAuthenticity can involve ensuring that the document hasn't been tampered with, that it's from the stated time period, and that it's by the claimed author. All of these are more in line with option D.\n\nOption A's focus on sincerity and accuracy might be important for historians, but it's more about the document's reliability as a source of information, not about its authenticity.\n\nSimilarly, option B's representativeness is more about the document's value in understanding a broader context, not about its authenticity.\n\nOption C seems to be about hermeneutics or interpretation theory, which is again separate from authenticity.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D: a document is 'authentic' if it is a 'sound' original or a reliable copy of known authorship.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
