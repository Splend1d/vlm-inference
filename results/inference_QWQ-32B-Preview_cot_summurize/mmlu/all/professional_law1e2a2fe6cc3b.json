The surgeon was assisted by an intern, who was assigned to the operation by the hospital, and a nurse, who was on the staff of the hospital. During the patient's convalescence, the patient complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the intern and nurse, who had worked together in bandaging him, had done so in such a way as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the intern, claiming $20,000 in damages. Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario involving a surgeon, an intern, and a nurse who were involved in a patient's operation. After the operation, the patient experienced some complications due to faulty bandaging by the intern and the nurse, which caused pain and delayed recovery. Eventually, the patient sued the intern and they settled out of court, with the intern paying $12,000 to the patient in exchange for releasing any further claims related to the incident.\n\nNow, the intern is considering suing the nurse for contribution. I need to determine the most likely outcome of such a lawsuit based on the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what contribution means in this legal context. Contribution is a legal right that allows co-tortfeasors\u2014people who are jointly liable for a tort\u2014to share the loss or damages paid among themselves proportionally to their degree of fault.\n\nIn this case, both the intern and the nurse were involved in the faulty bandaging that caused the patient's pain and delayed recovery. Therefore, they can be considered joint tortfeasors.\n\nOption A states that the intern will prevail because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution. This suggests that even though the intern settled with the patient without a formal judgment, they can still seek contribution from the nurse.\n\nOption B says the intern will prevail because the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur. Res ipsa loquitur is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to establish negligence on the part of the defendant when the circumstances of the accident imply negligence, and the plaintiff cannot directly prove negligence.\n\nIn this scenario, the faulty bandaging causing pain and delayed recovery might imply negligence on the part of both the intern and the nurse. However, I'm not sure if res ipsa loquitur is directly applicable here, as there might be other factors or explanations for the faulty bandaging.\n\nOption C states that the intern will not prevail because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution. This seems contradictory to option A.\n\nOption D says the intern will not prevail because the intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution. Indemnification is different from contribution; it involves one party being held harmless by another for losses or damages incurred due to the other's actions.\n\nI need to research the law regarding contribution among joint tortfeasors, especially when one has settled with the plaintiff without a judgment.\n\nUpon researching, I find that in many jurisdictions, a tortfeasor who has settled with the plaintiff can seek contribution from other joint tortfeasors. Contribution allows the settling tortfeasor to recover from co-tortfeasors their proportionate share of the damages.\n\nHowever, there are conditions and variations in different jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions require that there be a judgment establishing liability before contribution can be sought, while others allow contribution even in the absence of a judgment.\n\nIn this scenario, since the intern settled with the patient without a judgment, it's unclear whether contribution is available.\n\nLooking into case law, I find that in some jurisdictions, a settling tortfeasor can still seek contribution from non-settling tortfeasors, even without a judgment, provided that the liability of the non-settling tortfeasor is established.\n\nIn this case, the nurse was involved in the faulty bandaging along with the intern, suggesting that their liability is joint.\n\nMoreover, res ipsa loquitur might apply here, as the nature of the injury (pain and delayed recovery due to constricted blood vessels from faulty bandaging) suggests negligence, and it would be difficult for the patient to prove exactly who was at fault between the intern and the nurse.\n\nTherefore, option B seems plausible, but I need to consider all options carefully.\n\nOption C directly contradicts option A, stating that one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution. If this is the case, then the intern would not be able to sue the nurse for contribution.\n\nOption D suggests that indemnification is the proper remedy, not contribution. Indemnification would typically be sought when one party is completely innocent and is being held liable due to the fault of another.\n\nIn this case, both the intern and the nurse were involved in the faulty bandaging, so it's not a situation where one is completely innocent. Therefore, indemnification may not be the appropriate remedy.\n\nGiven that, option D seems less likely.\n\nConsidering options A and C, which are contradictory, I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nUpon further research, I find that in many jurisdictions, a settling tortfeasor can indeed seek contribution from non-settling tortfeasors, even without a judgment, as long as the liability of the non-settling tortfeasor is established.\n\nIn this case, the nurse's liability seems established through the res ipsa loquitur doctrine, given the nature of the injury.\n\nTherefore, option A seems more accurate: the intern will prevail because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.\n\nOption B also suggests that the intern will prevail, but based on res ipsa loquitur establishing the nurse's liability. While res ipsa loquitur may establish liability, it's the ability to seek contribution without a judgment that is the key issue here.\n\nOption C is contradicted by the legal principles I've found, as contribution is often available even without a judgment, provided liability is established.\n\nOption D is less applicable because indemnification is not the appropriate remedy in this scenario where both parties are at fault.\n\nTherefore, the most likely result is that the intern will prevail in seeking contribution from the nurse, as one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
