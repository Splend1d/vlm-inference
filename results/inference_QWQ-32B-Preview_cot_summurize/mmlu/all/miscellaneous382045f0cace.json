Now, I know that Yorkshire pudding is a traditional English dish, often served with roast meat. I think it's basically like a savory pudding made from a batter.\n\nI remember that the basic ingredients for Yorkshire pudding are usually flour, eggs, milk, and sometimes meat drippings, especially if it's being served with roast meat. The drippings add flavor and help in the cooking process. So, eggs, milk, and meat drippings sound like they should be in it.\n\nBut what about chocolate? That seems out of place. Yorkshire pudding is definitely not sweet; it's savory. So, I'm guessing chocolate isn't an ingredient in it.\n\nLet me double-check. Maybe in some variations, chocolate is used, but I don't think so. Traditionally, Yorkshire pudding should not have chocolate in it. It's more like a custard-like batter that's cooked until puffy and crispy.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. chocolate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
