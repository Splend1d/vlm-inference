                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability question. I need to determine which statement is true about any two events A and B. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: P(A \u222a B) implies events A and B are independent.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what P(A \u222a B) represents. It's the probability that either event A or event B or both occur. Independence between two events means that the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, events A and B are independent if P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B).\n\nBut P(A \u222a B) is equal to P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). There's no direct implication here about independence. So, I don't think this statement is necessarily true.\n\nOption B says: P(A \u222a B) = 1 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.\n\nMutually exclusive events are those that cannot occur at the same time, meaning P(A \u2229 B) = 0.\n\nNow, if P(A \u222a B) = 1, that means the probability of either A or B occurring is certain, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they can't occur together. They could overlap, but the total probability still sums up to 1.\n\nFor example, consider a die roll where A is rolling an even number and B is rolling a number greater than 3. P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/2, and P(A \u2229 B) = 1/3 (since 4 and 6 are both even and greater than 3). So, P(A \u222a B) = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/3 = 2/3, which is not 1. Maybe I need to adjust the example.\n\nLet's say A is rolling a number less than 5, and B is rolling a number greater than 2. P(A) = 4/6 = 2/3, P(B) = 4/6 = 2/3, P(A \u2229 B) = numbers 3,4  which is 2/6 = 1/3. So, P(A \u222a B) = 2/3 + 2/3 - 1/3 = 5/6, still not 1.\n\nHmm, maybe if A is rolling an even number and B is rolling an odd number, then P(A \u222a B) = P(even) + P(odd) - P(even \u2229 odd) = 1/2 + 1/2 - 0 = 1. In this case, A and B are mutually exclusive because P(A \u2229 B) = 0.\n\nBut is this always the case? What if A and B are not mutually exclusive but their union still covers the entire sample space?\n\nLet's consider A is rolling a number less than 4, and B is rolling a number greater than 1. P(A) = 3/6 = 1/2, P(B) = 5/6, P(A \u2229 B) = rolling a 2 or 3, which is 2/6 = 1/3. So, P(A \u222a B) = 1/2 + 5/6 - 1/3 = 3/6 + 5/6 - 2/6 = 6/6 = 1. Here, A and B are not mutually exclusive because P(A \u2229 B) = 1/3 \u2260 0.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a B) = 1 does not imply that A and B are mutually exclusive. Therefore, option B is false.\n\nOption C says: P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies events A and B are independent.\n\nIndependence is defined by P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B). If P(A \u2229 B) = 0, that means A and B cannot occur together, which is the definition of mutually exclusive events.\n\nBut mutually exclusive events are only independent if P(A) = 0 or P(B) = 0. In general, mutually exclusive events are dependent because the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other (since they can't both happen).\n\nTherefore, P(A \u2229 B) = 0 does not imply independence; it implies mutual exclusivity, which is different. So, option C is false.\n\nOption D says: P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.\n\nAs I just mentioned, P(A \u2229 B) = 0 is the definition of mutually exclusive events. So, this statement is true.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A: False, P(A \u222a B) doesn't imply independence.\n\n- Option B: False, P(A \u222a B) = 1 doesn't imply mutual exclusivity.\n\n- Option C: False, P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies mutual exclusivity, not independence.\n\n- Option D: True, P(A \u2229 B) = 0 is the definition of mutual exclusivity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
