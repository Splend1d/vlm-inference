                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a single-electron atom where the electron is in the l = 2 state. It's asking for the number of allowed values of the quantum number m_l. The options are 5, 4, 3, and 2. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what these quantum numbers represent. In quantum mechanics, especially when dealing with atoms, there are several quantum numbers that describe the state of an electron.\n\nThe principal quantum number, n, determines the energy level of the electron. The angular momentum quantum number, l, describes the shape of the orbital. And the magnetic quantum number, m_l, describes the orientation of the orbital in space.\n\nFor a given value of l, m_l can take on integer values from -l to +l, including zero. So, if l = 2, then m_l can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2. That's a total of 5 possible values.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nl = 2\n\nm_l = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2\n\nSo, there are 5 allowed values for m_l when l = 2.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that there are no restrictions or special cases for single-electron atoms that might change this. A single-electron atom would be hydrogen-like, meaning it has only one electron, such as hydrogen, helium ion (He^+), lithium ion (Li^{2+}), and so on.\n\nIn these atoms, the electron orbits the nucleus without any electron-electron interactions, which simplifies the quantum mechanical description. However, the rules for quantum numbers should still hold as per standard quantum mechanics.\n\nSo, for l = 2, m_l ranges from -2 to +2 in integer steps, which gives us 5 possible values.\n\nLet me double-check this with the formula for the number of allowed m_l values. The number of allowed m_l values for a given l is 2l + 1.\n\nSo, plugging in l = 2:\n\nNumber of m_l values = 2(2) + 1 = 5\n\nYes, that matches what I thought earlier.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, I'll recall what each value of l corresponds to:\n\n- l = 0 corresponds to an s orbital\n\n- l = 1 corresponds to a p orbital\n\n- l = 2 corresponds to a d orbital\n\n- l = 3 corresponds to an f orbital\n\nAnd so on.\n\nEach orbital type has a certain number of orientations, which are described by m_l.\n\nFor d orbitals (l = 2), there are 5 possible orientations: m_l = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.\n\nThis is consistent with what I learned in chemistry classes, where d orbitals include shapes like dz\u00b2, dxz, dyz, dxy, and dx\u00b2-y\u00b2, corresponding to the five m_l values.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 5.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 2\n\nI think A. 5 is the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something about the single-electron atom that affects this. Perhaps there's a spin-orbit interaction or some other effect that changes the number of allowed m_l values.\n\nIn single-electron atoms, the spin-orbit coupling can split the energy levels, but it shouldn't affect the number of m_l values; it should only cause a splitting within each m_l level.\n\nMoreover, m_l is related to the projection of the angular momentum along a given axis, usually the z-axis, and its allowed values are independent of the atom being single-electron or not.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the number of allowed m_l values for l = 2 is indeed 5.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll consider if there are any external magnetic fields or other perturbations that might affect m_l. In the absence of such fields, which is the standard case unless specified otherwise, m_l can take on all values from -l to +l.\n\nSo, no, no external factors are mentioned in the question, so I don't need to consider any adjustments.\n\nThus, the answer should be A. 5.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. Quantum numbers can sometimes be tricky, but in this case, it's pretty straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
