                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which theory of emotion cognitive psychologists are most likely to support. The options are social facilitation theory, two-factor theory, thalamic theory, and James-Lange theory. I think I need to understand what cognitive psychologists focus on and then see which of these theories aligns with their perspective.\n\nCognitive psychology is all about how we process information, think, remember, and perceive the world. So, they're interested in mental processes and how they influence our behavior and emotions. Emotions, from a cognitive perspective, are probably seen as involving thoughts, appraisals, and interpretations of events.\n\nLet me look at each theory one by one.\n\nFirst, social facilitation theory. I think this is more about how our performance is affected by the presence of others, not specifically about emotions. So, maybe not directly related to emotion theories.\n\nNext, the two-factor theory of emotion. I recall that this theory, proposed by Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer, suggests that emotions arise from a combination of physiological arousal and cognitive labeling. So, according to this, our experience of emotion depends on how we interpret our physiological responses. This seems pretty cognitive, as it involves thinking and interpreting.\n\nThen, there's the thalamic theory, also known as the Cannon-Bard theory, proposed by Walter Cannon and Philip Bard. This theory states that emotion and physiological responses occur simultaneously, rather than one causing the other. It suggests that we feel fear and then react physiologically, like sweating or increased heart rate, at the same time.\n\nLastly, the James-Lange theory, proposed by William James and Carl Lange, suggests that emotions occur as a result of physiological responses. So, according to this, if you see a bear and start running, your body's reaction to running makes you feel afraid.\n\nComparing these, the two-factor theory seems most aligned with cognitive psychology because it emphasizes the role of cognition in interpreting physiological responses to produce emotions. The James-Lange theory suggests that emotions are the result of physiological responses, which is more physiological than cognitive. The thalamic theory proposes that emotion and physiological responses happen simultaneously, without one causing the other, which doesn't emphasize cognition as much. Social facilitation theory seems unrelated to emotion theories altogether.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. two-factor theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
