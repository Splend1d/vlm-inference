The scenarios are:\n\n1. I answered the phone and hung up as soon as I heard my mom start talking.\n\n2. I stole the show at the talent show.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on general US standards in 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Answering the phone and hanging up immediately when your mom starts talking. Hmm, this seems disrespectful. Ignoring someone, especially a family member, without a good reason could be seen as rude or unethical. In general, treating family members with respect is important, and hanging up on someone without giving them a chance to speak might be considered wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Stealing the show at a talent show. \"Stealing the show\" usually means being so good that you outshine everyone else. It's often used in a positive way, implying that your performance was outstanding and captured everyone's attention. In this context, it doesn't seem morally wrong at all. It's more of a compliment to your skills and performance.\n\nSo, based on this, Scenario 1 seems morally wrong, and Scenario 2 does not.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe there was a really good reason why the person hung up. Perhaps their mom was in the middle of a dangerous situation and calling for help, and the person didn't realize it. But the scenario doesn't specify any such context, so I have to go with the general understanding.\n\nFor Scenario 2, stealing the show is generally appreciated and admired, so it's hard to see how that could be morally wrong.\n\nSo, yes, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
