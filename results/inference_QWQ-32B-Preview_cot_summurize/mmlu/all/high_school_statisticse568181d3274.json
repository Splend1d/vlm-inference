In statistics, the 25th percentile (also known as the first quartile) is the value below which 25% of the data falls. For a normal distribution, this corresponds to a z-score where the cumulative probability is 0.25.\n\nThe z-score is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( X \\) is the value we're trying to find,\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean (45 g),\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation (4 g).\n\nHowever, since we're working backwards from the percentile to find \\( X \\), we need to find the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.25 and then use it to find \\( X \\).\n\nLooking up the z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.25 in a standard normal distribution table, we find that it is approximately -0.674. This means that 25% of the data falls below a z-score of -0.674.\n\nNow, we can plug this z-score back into the formula to find \\( X \\):\n\n\\[ -0.674 = \\frac{(X - 45)}{4} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( X \\):\n\n\\[ X = 45 + (-0.674 \\times 4) \\]\n\n\\[ X = 45 - 2.696 \\]\n\n\\[ X \\approx 42.304 \\]\n\nRounding to one decimal place, this is approximately 42.3 grams.\n\nTherefore, the mass of an egg that is at the 25th percentile is closest to option B, 42.3 g.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42.3 \\text{ g}} \\]"
