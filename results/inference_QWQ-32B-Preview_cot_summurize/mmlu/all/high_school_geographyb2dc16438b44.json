                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about international relations. It's asking about a voluntary association of three or more countries that are willing to give up some measure of sovereignty. The options are nationalism, devolution, supranationalism, and complementarity. I think I need to understand what each of these terms means to pick the right one.\n\nFirst, nationalism is about a strong identification with one's nation and a desire for self-governance. That seems opposite to giving up sovereignty, so maybe that's not the right choice.\n\nDevolution is when a central government grants more autonomy to regional governments. But in this case, it's about countries giving up sovereignty to a larger entity, not regions gaining autonomy from a central government.\n\nSupranationalism sounds like it involves countries working together above the national level, perhaps sharing or pooling some of their sovereignty for common goals. That seems pretty close to what the question is describing.\n\nComplementarity, I'm not sure about that term in this context. I think it might relate to different systems or entities working together in a way that they complement each other's functions, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me think again. The key points are: it's a voluntary association of three or more countries, and they're giving up some measure of sovereignty.\n\nNationalism is about asserting national identity and sovereignty, so that doesn't fit.\n\nDevolution is about decentralizing power within a country, not about countries giving up sovereignty to each other.\n\nSupranationalism seems to fit because it's about countries agreeing to work together in a way that sometimes requires giving up some national sovereignty for the benefit of the group.\n\nComplementarity might refer to different legal or political systems working in tandem, but it doesn't specifically describe an association of countries giving up sovereignty.\n\nSo, I think the answer is supranationalism. For example, the European Union is a supranational organization where member countries have agreed to harmonize certain policies and laws, which requires giving up some sovereignty in those areas.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\nA. Nationalism: This is about promoting the interests of one's own nation and is often associated with preserving national sovereignty, not giving it up.\n\nB. Devolution: This is about transferring powers from a central government to regional governments within a country, which isn't relevant to countries giving up sovereignty to each other.\n\nC. Supranationalism: This involves countries ceding some degree of sovereignty to a higher authority that oversees their interactions in certain areas.\n\nD. Complementarity: This term is used in various fields, but in international relations, it might refer to different institutions or legal systems working together without necessarily involving a transfer of sovereignty.\n\nBased on this, supranationalism seems to be the most appropriate term for a voluntary association of countries giving up some sovereignty.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
