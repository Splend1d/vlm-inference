                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about Article 103 of the UN Charter. The question is: \"Are there any limits to the application of Article 103 of the UN Charter?\" And then it gives options A through D. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Article 103 is about. I think it has something to do with the relationship between the UN Charter and other international agreements. Oh, right! Article 103 says that in the event of a conflict between obligations under the UN Charter and obligations under any other international agreement, the obligations under the Charter prevail.\n\nSo, the question is asking if there are any limits to this provision. That is, are there cases where Article 103 doesn't apply, or where other international agreements can take precedence over the Charter?\n\nOption A says \"No, there are no limits to Article 103.\" That seems too absolute. International law is complex, and there are usually exceptions and limitations to general rules.\n\nOption B says \"Yes, Article 103 cannot trump multilateral treaties.\" Hmm, that sounds interesting. Maybe some multilateral treaties have provisions that override the Charter in certain situations.\n\nOption C says \"Yes, Article 103 of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms.\" Jus cogens are peremptory norms of international law from which no derogation is permitted. These are fundamental principles like prohibitions on genocide, slavery, and torture. It makes sense that these norms would take precedence over any conflicting obligations under the Charter.\n\nOption D says \"Yes, when a case is submitted to the ICJ, Article 103 ceases to have any effect.\" I don't think that's correct. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the principal judicial organ of the UN, and it interprets and applies the Charter. So, it's unlikely that Article 103 would cease to have effect just because a case is brought before the ICJ.\n\nLet me consider this further. Article 103 establishes that the Charter prevails in case of conflict with other international agreements. But, as with many legal provisions, there might be exceptions.\n\nJus cogens norms are considered to be fundamental principles from which no derogation is permitted. Therefore, it's plausible that these norms take precedence over the Charter's provisions, including Article 103. In other words, if there's a conflict between an obligation under the Charter and a jus cogens norm, the jus cogens norm should prevail.\n\nAs for multilateral treaties, while they are important, I don't know if there's a general rule that they can trump the Charter. Some multilateral treaties might have provisions that relate to the Charter, but I don't think there's a blanket exception for all multilateral treaties.\n\nAlso, regarding Option D, the ICJ is responsible for interpreting the Charter and international law. So, it's unlikely that Article 103 would cease to have effect simply because a case is brought before the Court.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is Option C: \"Yes, Article 103 of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms.\"\n\nTo confirm this, I can think about some authoritative sources or cases that might have addressed this issue.\n\nFor example, the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility mention that jus cogens norms take precedence over conflicting obligations. Article 27 of those articles states that a state cannot invoke a treaty to escape its obligations under customary international law as jus cogens.\n\nAdditionally, in the Lotus case, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) held that \"internationally, there is no rule of law applicable to States except those rules which States have recognized as such.\" However, this was before the development of the concept of jus cogens.\n\nMore recently, in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, the ICJ referred to the importance of pacta sunt servanda, but also acknowledged the existence of peremptory norms.\n\nFurthermore, in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ discussed the relationship between the UN Charter and jus cogens norms, indicating that certain norms are obligatory for all states, regardless of their consent.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations and authorities, it seems that jus cogens norms take precedence over conflicting provisions in the UN Charter, including Article 103.\n\nSo, I'm confident that Option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
