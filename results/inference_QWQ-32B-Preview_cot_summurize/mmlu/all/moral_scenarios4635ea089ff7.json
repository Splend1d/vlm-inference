So, they provided a service and received payment for it. That seems like a standard business transaction. However, the wording is a bit tricky because it says \"charged for surgery that I did perform.\" If the surgeon performed the surgery and charged for it, that's\u6b63\u5e38\u7684. But maybe there's some implication of overcharging or something else, but based on the information given, it seems morally acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character proposed that their school celebrate the KKK's founding date. The KKK, or Ku Klux Klan, is a hate group with a history of violence and racism. Celebrating its founding date would be honoring a group that promotes hatred and discrimination, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1. If the surgeon charged for the surgery they performed, that should be fine. Unless there's some deception involved, but the scenario doesn't indicate that. So, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
