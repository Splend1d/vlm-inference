                    "text": "So I've got this question here about what happens to the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output when consumer confidence increases, assuming an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what aggregate supply and aggregate demand are. Aggregate supply is the total amount of goods and services that firms are willing to produce at a given price level, and aggregate demand is the total amount of goods and services that individuals and institutions are willing to buy at a given price level.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping. I think that's important because it affects how changes in aggregate demand will impact the equilibrium price level and quantity of output.\n\nConsumer confidence is a measure of how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are about the economy's health. When consumer confidence increases, people are more likely to spend money because they feel good about the economy and their own financial situations.\n\nSo, if consumer confidence increases, that should shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, right? Because at every price level, people are willing to buy more goods and services.\n\nAlright, so with aggregate demand shifting to the right and aggregate supply being upward sloping, what happens to the equilibrium price level and quantity of output?\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Initially, there's an aggregate supply curve that's upward sloping and an aggregate demand curve, and they intersect at some point, which is the equilibrium.\n\nWhen aggregate demand increases, the new aggregate demand curve is shifted to the right. So, the new equilibrium should be at a higher price level and a higher quantity of output, assuming the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping.\n\nWait, but I should make sure about this. Maybe I should draw a quick graph in my mind.\n\nImagine the x-axis is the quantity of output, and the y-axis is the price level. The upward-sloping aggregate supply curve starts from the origin and goes upward to the right. The aggregate demand curve is downward sloping, starting from the top left to the bottom right.\n\nInitially, they intersect at point A, which has price level P1 and quantity Q1.\n\nNow, if aggregate demand increases due to higher consumer confidence, the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right to AD'.\n\nThe new equilibrium is where AD' intersects the upward-sloping AS curve, say at point B, which has a higher price level P2 and a higher quantity Q2.\n\nSo, in this case, both the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output increase.\n\nWait, but I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect this outcome. For example, if the aggregate supply curve were horizontal or vertical, that might change things, but the problem specifies an upward-sloping AS curve, so I think my initial conclusion holds.\n\nLet me check the multiple-choice options:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nB. The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\n\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nD. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output decrease.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option C seems correct: the equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A suggests that the price level increases while output decreases. That would typically happen if there's a leftward shift in aggregate supply, leading to higher prices and lower output, but in this case, it's aggregate demand that's increasing.\n\nOption B says the price level decreases and output increases. That might happen if aggregate supply increases while aggregate demand stays the same, but here, it's aggregate demand that's increasing.\n\nOption D indicates that both price level and output decrease, which would occur if aggregate demand decreases, but again, in this scenario, aggregate demand is increasing.\n\nTherefore, only option C makes sense given the information provided.\n\nI think I've got it right, but it's always good to double-check economic concepts like this. Maybe I should look up a standard macroeconomics textbook to confirm.\n\nYeah, according to most macroeconomics textbooks, an increase in consumer confidence shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right, leading to a higher equilibrium price level and a higher equilibrium quantity of output, assuming an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
