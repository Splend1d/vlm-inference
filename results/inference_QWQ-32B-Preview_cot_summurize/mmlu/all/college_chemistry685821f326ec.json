                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which group 13 element has a more stable +1 oxidation state compared to its +3 oxidation state. The options are boron (B), aluminum (Al), indium (In), and thallium (Tl). I need to decide between these four.\n\nFirst, I recall that group 13 elements have three valence electrons, which generally makes +3 oxidation states possible, as they can lose all three electrons. However, some elements in this group can also form +1 oxidation states by losing only one electron. The question is asking which one among these elements prefers the +1 oxidation state over the +3 state.\n\nLet me consider each element one by one.\n\nStarting with boron (B). Boron is the lightest element in group 13. I know that boron typically forms covalent bonds and has a tendency to form electron-deficient compounds. Its common oxidation state is +3, as in boron trifluoride (BF3). I don't recall boron commonly forming compounds in the +1 oxidation state. So, probably, for boron, the +3 oxidation state is more stable than +1.\n\nNext, aluminum (Al). Aluminum is also a lightweight metal that forms aluminum ions with a +3 charge, as in aluminum oxide (Al2O3). I don't think aluminum commonly forms compounds in the +1 oxidation state. So, similar to boron, aluminum prefers the +3 oxidation state.\n\nNow, indium (In). Indium is heavier than aluminum and is in the same group. I know that indium can form both +3 and +1 oxidation states. For example, indium(III) chloride (InCl3) and indium(I) chloride (InCl). I think indium has a greater ability to form the +1 oxidation state compared to aluminum, but I'm not sure if it's more stable than the +3 state.\n\nFinally, thallium (Tl). Thallium is the heaviest among these elements and is known for its toxicity. Thallium can also exhibit both +3 and +1 oxidation states. Thallium(III) compounds like thallium(III) oxide (Tl2O3) are known, but thallium commonly forms thallium(I) compounds, such as thallium(I) chloride (TlCl). In fact, thallium is one of the elements where the +1 oxidation state is more stable than the +3 state, especially in aqueous solutions.\n\nI recall that for heavier elements in group 13, the stability of the +1 oxidation state increases due to the inert pair effect. The inert pair effect refers to the tendency of the outermost s-electrons to remain paired and not participate in bonding as the atomic number increases. This is more pronounced in heavier elements due to poor orbital overlap and increased electron-electron repulsion.\n\nSo, applying this concept, the inert pair effect should be more significant for indium and thallium compared to aluminum and boron. Between indium and thallium, thallium is heavier and should exhibit a more stable +1 oxidation state.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is thallium (Tl).\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for which group 13 element the +1 oxidation state is more stable than the +3 oxidation state. So, I need to confirm if thallium indeed has a more stable +1 state compared to +3.\n\nI remember that in thallium's case, the +1 oxidation state is indeed more stable than the +3 oxidation state, especially in aqueous solutions. This is because the energy required to ionize thallium to Tl3+ is significantly higher due to the inert pair effect, making Tl+ the preferred oxidation state.\n\nIndium also shows some inert pair effect, but not as pronounced as thallium. Indium can form both In3+ and In+, but In3+ is still more common than In+ in many compounds.\n\nTherefore, among the options given, thallium is the element for which the +1 oxidation state is more stable than the +3 oxidation state.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Tl.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's quickly review the oxidation states of these elements.\n\n- Boron (B): Primarily +3; +1 is rare.\n\n- Aluminum (Al): Primarily +3; +1 is uncommon.\n\n- Indium (In): Both +3 and +1 are possible; +3 is still more common.\n\n- Thallium (Tl): Both +3 and +1 are possible; +1 is more stable than +3.\n\nHence, thallium is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
