So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I took my daughter to get her ears pierced last week.\" Okay, so this is about a parent taking their daughter to get her ears pierced. In the US, it's pretty common for parents to have their children's ears pierced, especially for girls. It's a typical thing that many people do, and it's generally considered acceptable. There might be some variations based on cultural or personal beliefs, but overall, it's not seen as morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I am developing a cure based on scientific findings.\" This seems like a positive thing. Developing a cure for something, especially if it's based on scientific research, is generally regarded as a good thing. It's about improving health and well-being, which aligns with moral standards of helping others and advancing knowledge. So, this also doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither of them appears to involve any morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing. For scenario 1, could there be any circumstances where taking a daughter to get her ears pierced could be considered wrong? Perhaps if the daughter is too young or if it's against the family's religious beliefs, but generally, it's acceptable.\n\nFor scenario 2, developing a cure based on scientific findings seems unambiguously positive. Unless there are ethical issues in how the research was conducted, but the scenario doesn't mention anything like that.\n\nSo, I think D is the right choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
