                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out where the idea of 'natural law' first appeared. The options are French Revolution, American War of Independence, Roman Law, and Greek Thinking. I think I should look into the history of philosophy and law to answer this question properly.\n\nI know that natural law is a type of legal theory that suggests that laws should be based on moral principles that are inherent in human nature. It's different from man-made laws, which are created by societies and can vary from one place to another.\n\nLet me start with Greek Thinking. Ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle and Plato discussed ideas that could be considered precursors to natural law. Aristotle, for example, talked about the concept of a natural order and the idea that there are universal principles that govern human behavior. So, it's possible that natural law ideas originated in Greek thinking.\n\nMoving on to Roman Law. The Romans developed a sophisticated legal system, and their concept of natural law, or \"jus naturale,\" was influential. Cicero, a Roman philosopher and statesman, wrote extensively about natural law, suggesting that it is a higher law that applies to all humans, regardless of local customs or laws. So, Roman Law seems like another strong candidate.\n\nNow, the American War of Independence. I recall that the Declaration of Independence mentions \"unalienable Rights\" endowed by the \"Laws of Nature and of Nature's God.\" This suggests that the framers of the Declaration were influenced by natural law ideas. However, this seems like a application of natural law rather than its origin.\n\nSimilarly, the French Revolution was influenced by Enlightenment thinkers who drew on natural law theories to justify their revolutionary ideas. Again, this seems like a application rather than the origin.\n\nSo, between Greek Thinking and Roman Law, which one came first? Greek civilization predates Roman civilization, so it makes sense that Greek thinkers would have been the first to develop ideas about natural law.\n\nBut I should check if there's more to it. Maybe Roman Law built upon Greek ideas. Cicero, for instance, was influenced by Greek philosophy. So, perhaps the concept evolved over time, with Greek thinkers laying the foundation and Romans developing it further.\n\nGiven that, I think the idea of natural law first appeared in Greek Thinking, and then was further elaborated in Roman Law.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other ancient civilizations that may have had concepts similar to natural law. For example, in ancient India or China, were there ideas about universal moral principles?\n\nI know that Indian philosophy has concepts of dharma, which can be translated as duty or law, and Confucianism in China emphasizes moral principles. However, whether these are exactly equivalent to the Western concept of natural law is debatable.\n\nGiven that, and considering the influence of Greek and Roman ideas on Western legal and philosophical thought, I think the most accurate answer is that the idea of natural law first appeared in Greek Thinking.\n\nSo, I would go with option D: Greek Thinking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
