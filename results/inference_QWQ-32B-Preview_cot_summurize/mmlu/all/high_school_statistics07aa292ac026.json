                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem. I've got a service station that does oil changes and tire replacements. Here are the details:\n\n- 60% of customers request an oil change.\n\n- 30% request tire replacements.\n\n- 10% request both services.\n\nAnd the question is: If a customer requests an oil change, what's the probability that they do not request tire replacements?\n\nOkay, so I need to find the probability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they have requested an oil change.\n\nFirst, let's recall some probability concepts. Specifically, conditional probability. The formula for conditional probability is:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the probability of event A happening given that B has happened.\n\n- \\( P(A \\cap B) \\) is the probability of both A and B happening.\n\n- \\( P(B) \\) is the probability of B happening.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- Let O be the event that a customer requests an oil change.\n\n- Let T be the event that a customer requests tire replacements.\n\nWe're given:\n\n- \\( P(O) = 60\\% \\) or 0.6\n\n- \\( P(T) = 30\\% \\) or 0.3\n\n- \\( P(O \\cap T) = 10\\% \\) or 0.1\n\nWe need to find the probability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they have requested an oil change. In other words, \\( P(T^c | O) \\), where \\( T^c \\) is the complement of T (not requesting tire replacements).\n\nUsing the complement rule, we know that:\n\n\\[ P(T^c | O) = 1 - P(T | O) \\]\n\nSo, if I can find \\( P(T | O) \\), I can easily find \\( P(T^c | O) \\).\n\nFrom the conditional probability formula:\n\n\\[ P(T | O) = \\frac{P(T \\cap O)}{P(O)} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n\\[ P(T | O) = \\frac{0.1}{0.6} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667 \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ P(T^c | O) = 1 - 0.1667 = 0.8333 \\]\n\nSo, the probability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they have requested an oil change, is approximately 0.833 or 83.3%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.42\n\nB. 0.5\n\nC. 0.7\n\nD. 0.833\n\nOption D matches our calculation.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I identified the events correctly: O for oil change, T for tire replacements.\n\nGiven probabilities:\n\n- P(O) = 0.6\n\n- P(T) = 0.3\n\n- P(O \u2229 T) = 0.1\n\nI used the formula for conditional probability:\n\n\\[ P(T | O) = \\frac{P(O \\cap T)}{P(O)} = \\frac{0.1}{0.6} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667 \\]\n\nThen, the probability of not requesting tire replacements given an oil change is:\n\n\\[ P(T^c | O) = 1 - P(T | O) = 1 - 0.1667 = 0.8333 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of sets. If 60% request oil changes, and 10% request both oil changes and tire replacements, then the percentage that requests only oil changes is:\n\n\\[ P(O \\cap T^c) = P(O) - P(O \\cap T) = 0.6 - 0.1 = 0.5 \\]\n\nThen, the probability of not requesting tire replacements given that they request an oil change is:\n\n\\[ P(T^c | O) = \\frac{P(O \\cap T^c)}{P(O)} = \\frac{0.5}{0.6} \\approx 0.8333 \\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 0.833.\n\nI think that makes sense. The other options are not matching our calculations.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nSuppose I try to use the general probability formula:\n\n\\[ P(O) = P(O \\cap T) + P(O \\cap T^c) \\]\n\nWe know P(O) and P(O \u2229 T), so P(O \u2229 T^c) = 0.6 - 0.1 = 0.5, as before.\n\nThen, \\( P(T^c | O) = \\frac{P(O \\cap T^c)}{P(O)} = \\frac{0.5}{0.6} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.8333 \\)\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI can't see any mistake in this approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 0.833.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
