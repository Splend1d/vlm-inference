                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about David painting cubes, and I need to figure out how big a cube he can cover with a certain amount of paint. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nFirst, it says that the amount of paint needed is directly proportional to the surface area. That makes sense because the more surface area there is, the more paint you'll need to cover it. So, if I can find out how much paint is needed per unit of surface area, I can apply that to find out how big a cube he can cover with a different amount of paint.\n\nOkay, so he can cover a cube with side length 2 feet using 16 quarts of paint. I need to find out what side length he can cover with 169 quarts.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the surface area of a cube is given by 6 times the square of the side length, since a cube has 6 faces and each face is a square with area side squared.\n\nSo, for a cube with side length 2 feet, the surface area A is:\n\nA = 6 * (2)^2 = 6 * 4 = 24 square feet.\n\nNow, he uses 16 quarts to cover 24 square feet. So, the paint per square foot is 16 quarts / 24 square feet = 2/3 quarts per square foot.\n\nOkay, now, with 169 quarts of paint, I need to find out how much surface area he can cover. Since he uses 2/3 quarts per square foot, then the total surface area he can cover with 169 quarts is:\n\nA = 169 quarts / (2/3 quarts per square foot) = 169 * (3/2) = (169*3)/2 = 507/2 = 253.5 square feet.\n\nNow, I need to find the side length of a cube that has a surface area of 253.5 square feet. Let's denote the side length as S. Then,\n\nSurface area A = 6 * S^2 = 253.5\n\nSo, S^2 = 253.5 / 6 = 42.25\n\nTherefore, S = sqrt(42.25) = 6.5 feet.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the options, none of them is 6.5 feet. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the surface area. Let's go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, establish the relationship between paint and surface area.\n\nGiven that paint is directly proportional to surface area, we can set up a proportion.\n\nLet P be the paint in quarts, and A be the surface area in square feet.\n\nThen, P = k * A, where k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nFrom the given, when P = 16 quarts, A = 6 * (2)^2 = 24 square feet.\n\nSo, 16 = k * 24 \u21d2 k = 16/24 = 2/3 quarts per square foot.\n\nNow, for P = 169 quarts, A = P / k = 169 / (2/3) = 169 * 3/2 = 507/2 = 253.5 square feet.\n\nNow, for a cube with surface area A = 6 * S^2 = 253.5\n\nSo, S^2 = 253.5 / 6 = 42.25\n\nS = sqrt(42.25) = 6.5 feet.\n\nBut 6.5 is not among the options. Wait, maybe I need to express it differently.\n\n6.5 feet is the same as 13/2 feet, because 13 divided by 2 is 6.5.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 13/4\n\nB. 8\n\nC. 13/2\n\nD. 13\n\nSo, option C is 13/2, which is 6.5 feet. That must be the answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, since paint is directly proportional to surface area, and surface area is proportional to the square of the side length, then paint is proportional to the square of the side length.\n\nSo, P \u221d S^2\n\nTherefore, P1 / P2 = S1^2 / S2^2\n\nGiven P1 = 16 quarts, S1 = 2 feet\n\nP2 = 169 quarts, S2 = ?\n\nSo, 16 / 169 = (2)^2 / S2^2\n\n16 / 169 = 4 / S2^2\n\nCross-multiplying: 16 * S2^2 = 169 * 4\n\nS2^2 = (169 * 4) / 16 = (169 * 1) / 4 = 169 / 4\n\nS2 = sqrt(169/4) = 13/2 feet.\n\nYes, that's the same answer I got earlier, confirmed by this different method.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 13/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{2}} \\]"
