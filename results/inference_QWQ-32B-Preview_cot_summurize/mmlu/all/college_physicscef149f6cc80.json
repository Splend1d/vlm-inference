                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about measuring the disintegration of a radioactive isotope. The student made 10 one-second measurements and got these counts: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. Now, I need to figure out how long the student should count to determine the rate with an uncertainty of only 1 percent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The uncertainty in the measurement is related to the statistics of radioactive decay, which follows a Poisson distribution. In a Poisson process, the mean and the variance are equal. So, if I have a mean count rate, lambda, then the variance is also lambda.\n\nThe uncertainty in the mean is often expressed as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements. But in a Poisson process, the standard deviation is the square root of the mean. So, the uncertainty in the mean would be sqrt(lambda)/n, where n is the number of measurements.\n\nWait, actually, I need to be careful here. In Poisson statistics, the uncertainty in the total count is sqrt(total count), and the uncertainty in the mean count rate is sqrt(total count)/time.\n\nBut let's start by analyzing the data given.\n\nI have 10 one-second measurements:\n\n3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the mean count rate over these 10 seconds.\n\nTotal counts = 3 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 20\n\nTotal time = 10 seconds\n\nMean count rate, lambda = total counts / total time = 20 / 10 = 2 counts per second\n\nNow, in a Poisson process, the standard deviation of the count rate is sqrt(lambda)/sqrt(time). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me recall: for a Poisson distribution, the variance of the number of counts in a given time interval is equal to the mean number of counts in that interval.\n\nSo, if I have a time interval t, the mean number of counts is lambda*t, and the standard deviation is sqrt(lambda*t).\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty in the mean count rate is sqrt(lambda*t)/(t) = sqrt(lambda/t)\n\nSo, the relative uncertainty is (uncertainty in mean)/mean = (sqrt(lambda/t))/lambda = 1/(sqrt(lambda*t))\n\nWe want this relative uncertainty to be 1%, or 0.01.\n\nSo, 1/(sqrt(lambda*t)) = 0.01\n\nTherefore, sqrt(lambda*t) = 100\n\nSquaring both sides: lambda*t = 10000\n\nWe already estimated lambda = 2 counts per second\n\nSo, t = 10000 / 2 = 5000 seconds\n\nSo, the answer seems to be 5000 seconds, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if this is the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total counting time to achieve the desired uncertainty.\n\nIn radioactive decay, the uncertainty in the total count N is sqrt(N), and the count rate is N/t, so the uncertainty in the count rate is (sqrt(N)/t).\n\nThe relative uncertainty is (sqrt(N)/t)/(N/t) = 1/sqrt(N)\n\nWe want 1/sqrt(N) = 0.01, so sqrt(N) = 100, thus N = 10000 counts\n\nSo, to get 10000 counts at a rate of 2 counts per second, the time required is t = N / lambda = 10000 / 2 = 5000 seconds\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nBut maybe I should verify the value of lambda more accurately.\n\nGiven the 10 measurements: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5\n\nMean = 20 / 10 = 2 counts per second\n\nBut perhaps I should calculate the variance as well to see if it's consistent with Poisson statistics.\n\nIn a Poisson distribution, mean = variance.\n\nHere, mean = 2\n\nVariance = sum((x_i - mean)^2)/n\n\nCalculating:\n\n(3-2)^2 + (0-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (4-2)^2 + (0-2)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (5-2)^2\n\n= 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 9 = 24\n\nVariance = 24 / 10 = 2.4\n\nSo, the variance is slightly higher than the mean, which might indicate overdispersion, but for radioactive decay, Poisson statistics should hold, so perhaps this slight difference is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the mean count rate as 2 counts per second and proceed with the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, to achieve a relative uncertainty of 1%, I need to measure for t = 10000 / lambda seconds.\n\nGiven lambda = 2 counts per second, t = 5000 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 5000 s\n\nBut let's see why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption A: 80 s\n\nIf t = 80 s, then N = lambda*t = 2*80 = 160 counts\n\nRelative uncertainty = 1/sqrt(160) \u2248 0.079 or 7.9%, which is much higher than 1%.\n\nOption B: 160 s\n\nt = 160 s, N = 2*160 = 320 counts\n\nRelative uncertainty = 1/sqrt(320) \u2248 0.056 or 5.6%, still higher than 1%.\n\nOption C: 2000 s\n\nt = 2000 s, N = 2*2000 = 4000 counts\n\nRelative uncertainty = 1/sqrt(4000) \u2248 0.0158 or 1.58%, which is closer but still above 1%.\n\nOption D: 5000 s\n\nt = 5000 s, N = 2*5000 = 10000 counts\n\nRelative uncertainty = 1/sqrt(10000) = 0.01 or 1%, which is exactly what's required.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 5000 s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
