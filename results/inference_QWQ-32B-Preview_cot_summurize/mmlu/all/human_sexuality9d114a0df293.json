                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about a famous quote related to privacy and government involvement. The quote is: \"The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation.\" I need to identify which former Canadian Prime Minister said this. The options are:\n\nA. Clark\n\nB. Mulroney\n\nC. King\n\nD. Trudeau\n\nFirst, I need to recall who these prime ministers are and perhaps look up some information about them to see which one is associated with this quote.\n\nLet's start with option A: Clark. I believe this refers to Joe Clark, who was the Prime Minister of Canada from June 4, 1979, to March 3, 1980. He was a Conservative politician. I don't recall him being particularly known for this quote, but maybe I need to check.\n\nOption B: Mulroney. Brian Mulroney was the Prime Minister from September 17, 1984, to June 25, 1993, also a Conservative. He was involved in several significant events, like the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and the Meech Lake Accord. Again, I don't recall him being associated with this particular quote.\n\nOption C: King. This might be William Lyon Mackenzie King, who was the Prime Minister for an extensive period, including from December 29, 1935, to November 15, 1948. He was a Liberal and played a crucial role during World War II. I don't think he is known for this quote.\n\nOption D: Trudeau. This likely refers to Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who was the Prime Minister from April 20, 1968, to June 4, 1979, and then from March 3, 1980, to June 30, 1984, also a Liberal. He was a prominent figure in Canadian politics and is known for\u63a8\u884cthe policy of multiculturalism and the patriation of the Canadian constitution, including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nGiven that, I suspect that the quote might be from Pierre Trudeau, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up the quote to confirm.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that the quote \"The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation\" is indeed associated with Pierre Elliott Trudeau. He said this in the context of debates over decriminalizing homosexuality in Canada. Trudeau was known for his views on individual liberty and privacy, and this quote reflects that stance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Trudeau.\n\nTo make sure, let's briefly consider why the other options are not correct.\n\nJoe Clark, as mentioned, was Prime Minister for a short period and is not known for this particular quote.\n\nBrian Mulroney succeeded Clark and is known for different policies and initiatives, not for this quote.\n\nWilliam Lyon Mackenzie King was a significant figure in Canadian history but is not associated with this quote.\n\nThus, the answer is D. Trudeau.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
