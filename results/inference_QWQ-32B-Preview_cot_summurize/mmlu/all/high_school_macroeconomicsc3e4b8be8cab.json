The options are:\n\nI. is used to calculate inflation rates.\n\nII. is an alternative to the CPI.\n\nIII. is more accurate than the CPI.\n\nAnd we have to choose which of these statements are true.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the GDP deflator is. I know that it's a measure that shows the level of prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy. It's like a broad measure of price levels.\n\nStatement I says it's used to calculate inflation rates. Well, inflation is the rate at which prices increase over time. So, if the GDP deflator is a measure of price levels, then yes, it can be used to calculate inflation by looking at the percentage change over time. So, I think statement I is true.\n\nStatement II says it's an alternative to the CPI. CPI is the Consumer Price Index, which is another measure of inflation that tracks the price changes of a basket of goods and services purchased by consumers. So, yes, the GDP deflator is another way to measure price levels and inflation, different from the CPI. So, statement II seems true as well.\n\nStatement III says it's more accurate than the CPI. Now, this is a bit tricky because accuracy can be subjective and depends on what you're trying to measure. The GDP deflator is considered to be a more comprehensive measure because it includes all domestically produced final goods and services, whereas the CPI only includes a basket of goods and services typically purchased by consumers. So, in terms of covering the entire economy, the GDP deflator might be more comprehensive. However, if you're specifically interested in the cost of living for consumers, the CPI might be more relevant. So, whether one is more accurate than the other depends on the context. But in terms of covering the entire economy, perhaps the GDP deflator is more accurate.\n\nGiven that, I think statements I and II are definitely true, and III could be considered true depending on the perspective. But since the question is phrased in a way that suggests a definitive answer, maybe III isn't universally accepted as true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Only I is true.\n\nB. I and II are true.\n\nC. I and III are true.\n\nD. II and III are true.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I think B is the correct answer because both I and II are true, and III is somewhat subjective.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is the GDP deflator used to calculate inflation rates? Yes. Is it an alternative to the CPI? Yes. Is it more accurate than the CPI? Well, that's debatable, as it depends on what aspect you're measuring.\n\nTherefore, the safest choice is B, I and II are true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
