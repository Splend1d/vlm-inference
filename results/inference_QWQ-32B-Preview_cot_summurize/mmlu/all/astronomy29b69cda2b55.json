                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out why the jovian planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, have that bulge around their equators, making them look squashed. There are four options here, and I need to pick the right one.\n\nOption A says it's because of their large systems of moons and rings gravitationally attracting mass around the equator. Hmm, that makes sense because moons and rings are around the equator, so their gravity could pull material towards that area. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the main reason.\n\nOption B says it's because they are much more massive than the terrestrial planets. Well, yes, they are more massive, but does that directly cause the bulge? Maybe being more massive affects their shape, but I think there's a more specific reason.\n\nOption C mentions their rapid rotation flinging mass near the equator outward. I remember that rotation can cause a bulge due to centrifugal force. Jovian planets do rotate very quickly; for example, Jupiter rotates once in about 10 hours. So, that seems plausible.\n\nOption D talks about internal heat sources exerting pressure against the sides of the planets. I know that jovian planets have internal heat, but does that directly cause the equatorial bulge? Maybe it contributes, but I think the rotation is a bigger factor.\n\nLet me think about this. The equatorial bulge is a common feature in rotating planets, and it's more pronounced in planets that rotate quickly. Since jovian planets are large and rotate rapidly, it makes sense that centrifugal force would cause the equator to bulge outward.\n\nAlso, their large mass means that gravity is strong, but the rotation still causes the bulge. Maybe mass is a factor, but rotation seems more directly related to the bulge.\n\nAs for the moons and rings, their gravitational influence might have some effect, but I don't think it's the primary cause of the bulge.\n\nAnd internal heat could affect the planet's overall shape, but I think rotation is a more significant factor here.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C: Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider all options again.\n\nOption A: Moons and rings attracting mass around the equator. While moons do affect the planet's gravity, I don't think their effect is strong enough to cause the bulge. The bulge is more a result of the planet's own rotation.\n\nOption B: More massive than terrestrial planets. While mass does affect gravity, it's not directly related to the bulge unless combined with rotation.\n\nOption C: Rapid rotation flinging mass outward at the equator. This seems directly related to the equatorial bulge.\n\nOption D: Internal heat sources exerting pressure. Internal heat might affect the planet's structure, but I don't think it's the main cause of the bulge.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
