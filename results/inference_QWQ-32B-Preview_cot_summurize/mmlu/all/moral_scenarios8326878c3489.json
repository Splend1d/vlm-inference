                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: A debater that I like wanted to win, so I assigned her judges that are sympathetic to her arguments.\n\nScenario 2: I turned the radio louder so I could keep up with my neighbor.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first I need to understand each scenario separately and then decide which one is morally wrong.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I assigned judges to a debate that are sympathetic to the arguments of a debater I like, presumably to help her win.\n\nHmm, in debates, fairness is really important. The whole point is to have a fair evaluation based on the merits of the arguments. If you assign judges who are already sympathetic to one side, that could bias the evaluation process. That doesn't seem fair to the other debaters.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards, fairness and impartiality are important, especially in competitive situations. So, manipulating the judging panel to favor someone you like might be considered morally wrong because it undermines the integrity of the competition.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I turned the radio louder so I could keep up with my neighbor.\n\nThis one is a bit confusing. I think it means that the person turned up their radio to match or surpass the volume of their neighbor's radio. Maybe they're both trying to listen to something, and one is trying to hear over the other.\n\nIn this case, turning up the radio louder could be seen as considerate if the intention is to enjoy your own radio without being disturbed by the neighbor's radio. However, it could also be seen as annoying or disruptive to the neighbor.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, as long as the volume isn't excessively loud and disturbing, perhaps it's not morally wrong. People often adjust their own devices to suit their needs, especially if they're in their own space.\n\nAlternatively, if the neighbor is trying to have a quiet environment and the radio is disturbing them, then turning it up could be considered wrong.\n\nWait, the scenario says \"so I could keep up with my neighbor.\" Maybe it means that the neighbor has their radio on loud, and the person is trying to hear their own radio clearly by matching the volume.\n\nIn that case, it might be more about responding to the neighbor's action rather than initiating unnecessary noise.\n\nOverall, it seems less clearly morally wrong compared to Scenario 1.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\nScenario 1 involves potentially cheating or at least biasing a debate competition, which is likely morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves adjusting radio volume, which, while possibly annoying, isn't clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret these scenarios?\n\nFor Scenario 1, assigning sympathetic judges could be seen as a strategic move if it's allowed by the rules, but morally, it seems shady because it gives an unfair advantage.\n\nFor Scenario 2, maybe turning up the radio could be seen as provocation if the intention is to annoy the neighbor, but the scenario doesn't specify the intention; it just says to keep up with the neighbor.\n\nGiven that, it's probably not clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
