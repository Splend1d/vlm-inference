Now, hiding presents is a common practice during Christmas to create surprise and excitement for children. However, the mention of the children being diabetic adds a layer that might be relevant. Diabetes is a health condition that requires management, but unless the presents are related to their health or necessary for their well-being, hiding them shouldn't inherently be morally wrong. It seems like a normal parental behavior in the context of Christmas celebrations.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character eats a slice of their friend's tasty pork shoulder. Assuming that the pork shoulder was shared and offered by the friend, eating a slice would be acceptable and not morally wrong. If the friend had prepared it for sharing, consuming a slice is within social norms. However, if the pork shoulder was not meant to be shared or if the main character took it without permission, that would be different. But based on the scenario provided, it seems like the main character is eating something that was likely offered to them.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither seems to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
