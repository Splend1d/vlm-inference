                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about four identical alternators working in parallel, and I need to find the short circuit level at the busbar. Let's see what I've got:\n\n- Each alternator is rated for 20 MVA at 11 kV.\n\n- The subtransient reactance is 16%.\n\n- They're all working in parallel.\n\nAnd the options for the short circuit level are A. 500 MVA, B. 400 MVA, C. 125 MVA, D. 100 MVA.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The short circuit level at the busbar is essentially the total fault MVA that the system can deliver in case of a short circuit. Since the alternators are working in parallel, their capacities add up in some way to determine the total short circuit capacity.\n\nBut, it's not just about adding their MVA ratings because reactance comes into play, especially since it's given as subtransient reactance. Reactance affects the flow of short circuit current.\n\nLet me recall the formula for short circuit MVA. I think it's related to the generator's MVA rating and its reactance.\n\nFor a single machine, the short circuit MVA can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Short Circuit MVA} = \\frac{\\text{Machine MVA}}{X_d} \\]\n\nWhere \\( X_d \\) is the reactance.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm if this is correct. Actually, I think it's:\n\n\\[ \\text{Short Circuit MVA} = \\text{Machine MVA} \\times \\frac{1}{X_d} \\]\n\nBut that doesn't seem right dimensionally. Let me think again.\n\nActually, I recall that short circuit current is inversely proportional to reactance. So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of impedance.\n\nFor a generator, the short circuit current is given by:\n\n\\[ I_{sc} = \\frac{V}{X} \\]\n\nWhere \\( V \\) is the voltage and \\( X \\) is the reactance.\n\nThen, the short circuit MVA can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ S_{sc} = V \\times I_{sc} = V \\times \\frac{V}{X} = \\frac{V^2}{X} \\]\n\nBut I have the machine's MVA rating, which is \\( S = V \\times I \\), so \\( I = \\frac{S}{V} \\).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nSince all alternators are identical and working in parallel, their reactances are in parallel too.\n\nThe total reactance \\( X_{\\text{total}} \\) would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{X_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{X} + \\frac{1}{X} + \\frac{1}{X} + \\frac{1}{X} = \\frac{4}{X} \\]\n\nSo, \\( X_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{X}{4} \\)\n\nGiven that \\( X \\) is the subtransient reactance of one machine, which is 16%.\n\nBut wait, reactance is usually expressed as a per unit value or in ohms. Here it's given as 16%, which likely means 16% of the machine's rated impedance.\n\nWait, per unit reactance is often defined as:\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{X_{\\text{pu}}}{100} \\]\n\nSo, 16% reactance means \\( X = 0.16 \\) per unit.\n\nNow, to find the short circuit MVA, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[ S_{sc} = \\frac{S}{X} \\]\n\nWhere \\( S \\) is the machine's MVA rating and \\( X \\) is the reactance in per unit.\n\nFor one machine:\n\n\\[ S_{sc,1} = \\frac{20 \\text{ MVA}}{0.16} = 125 \\text{ MVA} \\]\n\nBut since there are four machines in parallel, their short circuit capacities add up:\n\n\\[ S_{sc,\\text{total}} = 4 \\times 125 \\text{ MVA} = 500 \\text{ MVA} \\]\n\nSo, the total short circuit level at the busbar would be 500 MVA.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nEach machine can supply 125 MVA into a short circuit, and there are four of them, so together they can supply 500 MVA.\n\nBut, I need to consider if there's any limiting factor, like the busbar's impedance or something. But the problem seems to be only about the generators in parallel, so perhaps that's it.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 500 MVA, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut let me consider if I'm missing something. Is there a different way to approach this problem that might give a different answer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for short circuit current and then convert it to MVA.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, find the short circuit current for one machine:\n\n\\[ I_{sc,1} = \\frac{S_{rated}}{V} = \\frac{20 \\text{ MVA}}{11 \\text{ kV}} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^6 \\text{ VA}}{11 \\times 10^3 \\text{ V}} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^3 \\text{ A}}{11} \\approx 1818.18 \\text{ A} \\]\n\nBut this is the machine's rated current.\n\nFor short circuit current, considering subtransient reactance:\n\n\\[ I_{sc,1} = \\frac{V}{X_d''} \\]\n\nBut \\( X_d'' \\) is given in per unit, so I need to find the actual reactance in ohms.\n\nFirst, find the base impedance:\n\n\\[ Z_{base} = \\frac{V^2}{S} = \\frac{(11 \\times 10^3)^2}{20 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{121 \\times 10^6}{20 \\times 10^6} = 6.05 \\Omega \\]\n\nThen, the subtransient reactance in ohms is:\n\n\\[ X_d'' = X_{\\text{pu}} \\times Z_{base} = 0.16 \\times 6.05 = 0.968 \\Omega \\]\n\nSo, the short circuit current for one machine is:\n\n\\[ I_{sc,1} = \\frac{V}{X_d''} = \\frac{11 \\times 10^3}{0.968} \\approx 11363.64 \\text{ A} \\]\n\nThen, for four machines in parallel:\n\n\\[ I_{sc,\\text{total}} = 4 \\times 11363.64 \\approx 45454.56 \\text{ A} \\]\n\nNow, convert this total short circuit current back to MVA:\n\n\\[ S_{sc,\\text{total}} = V \\times I_{sc,\\text{total}} = 11 \\times 10^3 \\times 45454.56 \\approx 4999999.99 \\text{ VA} \\approx 500 \\text{ MVA} \\]\n\nAgain, I get 500 MVA, which matches option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to think about this. Since all machines are identical and in parallel, their individual short circuit capacities add up directly.\n\nGiven that, and since each machine can provide 125 MVA (as calculated earlier), four machines would provide 500 MVA in total.\n\nI think this is the correct approach, and the answer should be A. 500 MVA.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if the busbar voltage remains at 11 kV during the short circuit. In actuality, the bus voltage would drop during a short circuit, but for these calculations, we often use the pre-fault voltage.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there are other impedance elements in the system that aren't accounted for, like transmission lines or transformers between the generators and the busbar. But the problem doesn't mention any, so I assume it's just the generators directly connected to the busbar.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the reactance given is the subtransient reactance, which is used for the initial phase of the short circuit, typically for the first few cycles. If the question is asking for the steady-state short circuit level, perhaps I should use a different reactance value. However, since it specifies subtransient reactance, and short circuit levels are often based on the initial conditions, I think using subtransient reactance is appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given data and the standard method of calculating short circuit MVA for generators in parallel, the total short circuit level at the busbar is 500 MVA.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500 \\text{ MVA}} \\]"
