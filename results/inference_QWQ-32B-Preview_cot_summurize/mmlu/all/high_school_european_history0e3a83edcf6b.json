We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. \u2026\nWe barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.\nDr. John Wallis, Account of Some Passages of his Life, 1700\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the main interest of Wallis's group was\n\nA. undermining of the traditional worldview\nB. creating of a secular science to challenge the Church\nC. ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad\nD. the regulation of new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Dr. John Wallis, written in 1700, recalling his experiences around 1645 in London. He talks about being part of a group of like-minded individuals interested in natural philosophy and the \"New Philosophy\" or \"Experimental Philosophy.\" They used to meet weekly to discuss various scientific topics, excluding theology and state affairs. The group's focus was on areas like physics, anatomy, geometry, astronomy, and more. They were discussing recent discoveries such as the circulation of blood, the Copernican hypothesis, and observations made with telescopes.\n\nThe question is asking what the main interest of Wallis's group was, and it gives four options:\n\nA. Undermining the traditional worldview\n\nB. Creating a secular science to challenge the Church\n\nC. Ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad\n\nD. Regulating new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the passage mentions that they were interested in \"the New Philosophy or Experimental Philosophy.\" This suggests that they were engaged with emerging scientific ideas and methods, which were likely different from the traditional scholastic approach that was prevalent at the time.\n\nOption A suggests that their main interest was to undermine the traditional worldview. While it's possible that their discussions of new scientific ideas could have challenged traditional views, the passage doesn't explicitly state that their goal was to undermine anything. They seem more interested in exploring and understanding new ideas.\n\nOption B proposes that they were creating a secular science to challenge the Church. Again, while their focus on experimental and natural philosophy might have had implications for traditional religious views, the passage doesn't indicate that challenging the Church was their primary aim. In fact, they explicitly excluded theological discussions from their meetings, which might suggest that they wanted to keep science and religion separate rather than directly challenging the Church.\n\nOption C suggests that their main interest was to ascertain the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad. The passage does mention that they discussed \"the state of these studies, as then cultivated at home and abroad,\" which aligns with this option. They were interested in knowing how these new ideas were being developed and received in different places.\n\nOption D proposes that they were regulating new knowledge to ensure it didn't undermine traditional values. While they may have had some concern about the impact of new ideas, there's no explicit mention in the passage of them trying to regulate knowledge or protect traditional values. Their focus seems more on exploring and discussing new scientific concepts.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems to be the most directly supported by the information in the passage. They were interested in the state of the New Philosophy both in England and abroad, which aligns with their discussions on the circulation of blood, the Copernican hypothesis, and other contemporary scientific topics.\n\nMoreover, the fact that they excluded theology and state affairs from their discussions suggests that their primary focus was indeed on understanding and advancing scientific knowledge, without getting entangled in religious or political debates.\n\nTherefore, I would infer that the main interest of Wallis's group was to ascertain the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
