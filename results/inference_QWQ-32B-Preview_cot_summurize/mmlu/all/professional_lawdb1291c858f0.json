                    "text": "So here's this scenario with a baseball card dealer, a collector, and a courier, and there's some shady business going on. The dealer sold a rare card to the collector, but instead of giving the real card to the courier, he gave a counterfeit one that's worthless. The police got wind of this and stopped the courier before he could leave the city limits, and now the dealer is being charged with attempting to obtain property by false pretenses.\n\nThe question is about the dealer's defense strategy. He's arguing that the scheme hadn't progressed far enough to constitute an attempt. So, he's trying to say that it was just talk, or maybe he changed his mind, or something like that. Now, the options are about whether it's advantageous for him to claim that the courier was an accomplice, or just an innocent delivery guy, and so on.\n\nLet's break this down.\n\nFirst, what's the crime here? Attempted obtaining property by false pretenses. That means the dealer is trying to get the collector's money by pretending that he's giving a real rare card, but actually giving a fake one.\n\nFor an attempt, generally, the law looks at whether the person took a substantial step towards committing the crime. It's not enough to just think about it or talk about it; there has to be some action that goes beyond mere preparation.\n\nIn this case, the dealer gave the courier an envelope with a counterfeit card, and the courier was supposed to deliver it to the collector, get the money, and bring it back to the dealer. So, the dealer has taken some concrete steps: he prepared a fake card, gave it to the courier, and set into motion the plan to deceive the collector.\n\nNow, the dealer is saying that the scheme hadn't progressed far enough to be considered an attempt. So, he's trying to argue that his actions weren't substantial enough to constitute an attempt.\n\nOption A says it would be to his advantage to claim that the courier was his accomplice and was participating in the scheme to receive a share of the proceeds. If the courier was an accomplice, that might suggest that the dealer had a more advanced plan, with someone helping him carry it out. That could potentially make his actions seem more deliberate and substantial, which might not help his defense that the scheme wasn't far along enough.\n\nOption B says it would be advantageous to claim that the courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the dealer to make the delivery. If the courier was just an innocent delivery person, unaware of the deception, that might suggest that the dealer hadn't fully enlisted someone else into the scheme. It could be seen as the dealer trying to distance himself from the courier, implying that the courier was just a tool in the process, not a collaborator.\n\nOption C says it would be advantageous to claim that the courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the collector to make the delivery. Wait, that doesn't make sense with the scenario. The dealer hired the courier to pick up the card and deliver it to the collector, then bring back the money. So, the courier was hired by the dealer, not by the collector. So, this option seems misinformed about the facts.\n\nOption D says it makes no difference whether the courier was the dealer's accomplice or was an innocent agent. Meaning, regardless of the courier's knowledge or involvement, the dealer's actions would still constitute an attempt.\n\nFirst, option C can probably be eliminated because it's factually incorrect. The courier was hired by the dealer, not by the collector.\n\nNow, between options A, B, and D, which one is best for the dealer's defense?\n\nIf the dealer claims that the courier was his accomplice, that might suggest a more concerted effort to commit the fraud, which could strengthen the prosecution's case that there was a substantial step towards the crime.\n\nIf the dealer claims that the courier knew nothing and was just hired to make the delivery, that might suggest that the courier was an innocent party, and perhaps the dealer hadn't fully implemented his plan yet. This could support the dealer's argument that the scheme hadn't progressed far enough to be an attempt.\n\nOption D says it makes no difference, but in law, the knowledge and intent of the parties can be relevant in determining the level of culpability.\n\nGiven that, it seems that option B would be more advantageous for the dealer. By claiming that the courier knew nothing about the scheme and was just hired for delivery, the dealer might be able to argue that the courier was an innocent agent, and therefore, the dealer's actions weren't yet a substantial step towards completing the crime.\n\nHowever, in reality, the dealer gave the courier a fake card, knowing that it was going to be delivered to the collector in place of the real one. That seems like a pretty substantial step towards committing the fraud.\n\nBut from a legal defense perspective, arguing that the courier was unaware might help in\u58f0\u79f0 the dealer hadn't yet fully executed his plan, or that the courier wasn't an active participant in the fraud.\n\nAlternatively, option D suggests that whether the courier was an accomplice or an innocent agent doesn't make a difference. But in criminal law, the knowledge and intent of co-conspirators can be important.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to understand what constitutes an attempt in this context.\n\nGenerally, attempt requires intent to commit the crime, and a substantial step beyond mere preparation that demonstrates that intent.\n\nIn this case, the dealer's intent is clear: to deceive the collector into paying for a fake card. The question is whether giving the fake card to the courier constitutes a substantial step.\n\nIf the courier was an accomplice, that might strengthen the argument that the dealer had taken a substantial step, because there's active collaboration.\n\nIf the courier was unaware, then the dealer might argue that the plan hadn't yet been set in motion, or that the courier was just a tool, and the dealer could still back out.\n\nBut in reality, by giving the fake card to the courier, the dealer has taken a significant step towards completing the fraud.\n\nSo, from a strategic defense perspective, the dealer might try to minimize the importance of that step by claiming that the courier was unaware and innocent, suggesting that the plan wasn't yet fully executed.\n\nTherefore, option B might be advantageous for the dealer.\n\nOption A, claiming the courier was an accomplice, might backfire because it could show a more concerted effort to commit the crime.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the courier was hired by the dealer, not the collector.\n\nOption D suggests that it makes no difference, but in law, the knowledge and involvement of others can be relevant.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is probably B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{b}} \\]"
