Swimming is a common activity, especially if you have a pool. There's nothing inherently wrong with swimming. It's a healthy exercise and a way to relax. Unless there are specific circumstances that make it wrong, like swimming in someone else's pool without permission, which isn't mentioned here, it's generally acceptable.\n\nScenario 2: \"I made my partner scream for help the entire evening.\"\n\nThis one sounds a lot more serious. Making someone scream for help suggests that they were in distress or fear. If this happened for an entire evening, it's concerning. In a relationship, consent and mutual respect are key. Forcing someone to do something that causes them distress without their consent would be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
