                    "text": "I think the answer is B. Big Gulp. I remember seeing that at 7-Eleven stores when I go there for Slurpees and other stuff. But let me make sure. So, 7-Eleven is a big convenience store chain, right? They sell all sorts of things, including drinks. And they have these really large sodas that are famous for their size.\n\nOption A is Big Slurp. That sounds familiar because 7-Eleven has Slurpee machines, which are like frozen drinks. But I think Big Slurp might be related to that, not the sodas. Wait, no, Slurpees are already called Slurpees, so probably not.\n\nOption B is Big Gulp. Yeah, I've seen signs and cups labeled \"Big Gulp\" at 7-Eleven. I think that's their name for their extra-large soda servings.\n\nOption C is Big Drink. That seems pretty generic. I don't recall seeing that term specifically at 7-Eleven.\n\nOption D is Big Sip. Hmm, that sounds like a marketing term, but I don't remember seeing it used by 7-Eleven for their large sodas.\n\nSo, based on my experience and what I recall, I'm going with B. Big Gulp. But to be absolutely sure, maybe I should look it up online or check their website.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that in some places, there might be similar names used by other stores, but Big Gulp is definitely associated with 7-Eleven.\n\nLet me think about this again. If I go to a 7-Eleven store, and I want to buy a large soda, like a two-liter or something even bigger, the cup they give me says \"Big Gulp\" on it. So, that must be their trademarked name for those large sodas.\n\nAlso, I think other stores might have similar large drink options, but they use different names, like \"Family Size\" or something else. But 7-Eleven specifically uses \"Big Gulp.\"\n\nI don't think \"Big Slurp\" is correct because, as I said, Slurpees are already called that, and it's a different product altogether.\n\n\"Big Drink\" seems too generic and doesn't ring any bells in terms of 7-Eleven's branding.\n\n\"Big Sip\" sounds catchy, but again, I don't recall seeing that used by 7-Eleven for their large sodas.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is B. Big Gulp.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there have been any changes recently. Maybe 7-Eleven has changed the name of their large soda cups. But as far as I know, it's still Big Gulp.\n\nAlso, I should consider if Big Gulp is only used in certain regions. Maybe in some places, they use a different name. But generally, I think Big Gulp is the standard across the United States.\n\nIn international 7-Eleven stores, things might be different, but since the question doesn't specify a location, I'm assuming it's referring to the U.S. context.\n\nSo, all things considered, I believe the correct answer is B. Big Gulp.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
