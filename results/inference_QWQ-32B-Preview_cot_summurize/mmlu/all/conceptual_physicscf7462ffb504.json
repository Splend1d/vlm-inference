It asks, \"Interference is characteristic of...\" and gives options: A. sound waves, B. light waves, C. water waves, D. all of these. I need to decide which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what interference means in the context of waves. Interference is when two or more waves meet and combine to form a new wave pattern. This can be constructive, where the waves add up to make a bigger wave, or destructive, where they cancel each other out.\n\nNow, let's think about each type of wave:\n\nA. Sound waves: Sound is a type of mechanical wave that travels through a medium like air, water, or solids. When two sound waves meet, they can interfere with each other. For example, if you have two speakers playing the same note, at certain points the waves will add up, making the sound louder, and at other points, they might cancel each other out, making the sound quieter. So, interference is definitely a characteristic of sound waves.\n\nB. Light waves: Light is an electromagnetic wave, which doesn't need a medium to travel through. Just like sound waves, light waves can also interfere with each other. A classic example is the double-slit experiment, where light passing through two slits interferes with itself, creating a pattern of bright and dark bands on a screen. This demonstrates both constructive and destructive interference. So, interference is also a characteristic of light waves.\n\nC. Water waves: When you think about waves in water, like when you drop two stones into a pond, the ripples from each stone spread out and eventually meet. Where the crests of the waves meet, they create a higher crest, and where a crest meets a trough, they can cancel each other out. This is again interference, showing that it's a characteristic of water waves as well.\n\nGiven that interference occurs in sound waves, light waves, and water waves, it seems like the correct answer should be D. all of these.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's a type of wave where interference doesn't occur. I know that interference is a fundamental property of waves, whether they're mechanical like sound and water waves, or electromagnetic like light waves. In fact, interference is a key concept in wave theory and is observed in various types of waves, including seismic waves, radio waves, and more.\n\nSo, unless there's a specific context or exception that I'm missing, it seems safe to conclude that interference is characteristic of all these types of waves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
