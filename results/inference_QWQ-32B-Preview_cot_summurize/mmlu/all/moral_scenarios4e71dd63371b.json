The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I helped my friend get out of the house after he lost his girlfriend.\n\nScenario 2: I went skinny-dipping in the community pool, while everyone was at the poolside.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario based on general US standards around 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Helping a friend who lost his girlfriend. Losing a girlfriend can be tough, and friends often help each other during tough times. Helping someone get out of the house might mean taking them out, distracting them, or just being there for them. This seems like a supportive and caring action, which is generally considered morally positive or at least neutral. So, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Going skinny-dipping in a community pool when everyone is at the poolside. Skinny-dipping means swimming naked, and doing this in a public place like a community pool where others are present could be considered inappropriate and intrusive. It invades other people's privacy and could make them uncomfortable, especially since nudity is generally not acceptable in public spaces in the US. This seems like it would be considered morally wrong because it disrespects others' boundaries and comfort levels.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat corresponds to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1 that I'm missing. Helping a friend could involve different actions, some of which might be morally wrong. For example, if \"helping\" involved encouraging dangerous behavior or something like that. But based on the information given, it seems like straightforward assistance to a friend in need, which is generally okay.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, involves nudity in a public space where others are present. This is typically against social norms and possibly even legal regulations in many places in the US. So, it's reasonable to consider this action as morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
