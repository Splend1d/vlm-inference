                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. So, there's a farmer who owned a tract of land in the country with fee-simple ownership. That means he had full ownership rights over the property. In 1986, he moved to the city, and in 1987, a man took possession of the land as an adverse possessor. Adverse possession is when someone occupies someone else's land without permission and claims it as their own after a certain period defined by law.\n\nThe man stayed on the land from 1987 to 1997, which is 10 years, and then left for one year to care for his sick mother in 1998, returning in 1999. The statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. So, from 1987 to 2010, when the farmer wants to move back, it's been 23 years.\n\nNow, the farmer sues the man in ejectment to get his land back. We need to determine the most probable judicial determination.\n\nOption A says the farmer would lose because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous. Option B says the farmer would lose because the man fulfilled the required statutory period. Option C says the farmer would win because the man's possession wasn't continuous, and Option D says the farmer would win because he's the titleholder of record.\n\nFirst, let's understand adverse possession requirements. Generally, to establish adverse possession, the possessor must possess the land openly, notoriously, exclusively, hostilely, and continuously for the statutory period.\n\nIn this case, the man took possession in 1987 and was on the land until 1997, then left for one year in 1998, and returned in 1999 until at least 2010. So, from 1987 to 1997 is 10 years, plus from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years, totaling 21 years.\n\nBut there's a break in possession from 1997 to 1998, where the man left to care for his sick mother. This raises the question of whether the possession was continuous.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, temporary absences don't necessarily break the continuity of possession, especially if the possessor intends to return and does so within a reasonable time. The man left for one year to care for his sick mother, which seems like a legitimate reason for a temporary absence.\n\nSome states allow for minor breaks in possession without defeating the continuity, particularly if the possessor maintains the intent to return and does so promptly after the interruption.\n\nHowever, the statutory period is 20 years. If the possession isn't continuous, then the clock might reset when the possessor leaves and starts again when he returns.\n\nIn this scenario, from 1987 to 1997 is 10 years, and from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years, totaling 21 years. But because there was a one-year absence in 1998, we need to see if that breaks the continuity.\n\nIf the continuity is broken, then the 10 years from 1987 to 1997 don't count toward the 20-year period, and the man would have to start over when he returns in 1999. In that case, from 1999 to 2010 is only 11 years, which is less than the 20-year requirement.\n\nAlternatively, if the court considers the one-year absence as a temporary interruption that doesn't break the continuity, then the total possession time would be from 1987 to 2010, which is 23 years, exceeding the 20-year requirement.\n\nGiven that, options A and B suggest the farmer would lose because the possession was continuous and the statutory period was met. Options C and D suggest the farmer would win because possession wasn't continuous or because he's the titleholder of record.\n\nConsidering the statutory period is 20 years, and assuming the possession was continuous despite the one-year absence, the man might be able to claim adverse possession. However, the key issue is whether that one-year absence breaks the continuity.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a temporary absence for a legitimate reason, especially if the possessor intends to return and does so promptly, may not break the continuity. In this case, the man left to care for his sick mother, which is a reasonable excuse, and returned the following year.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that the court would consider the possession continuous, allowing the man to meet the 20-year requirement.\n\nOn the other hand, some courts might require strict continuity without any breaks, in which case the one-year absence could reset the clock, making the man's possession time from 1999 to 2010, which is only 11 years, falling short of the 20-year period.\n\nGiven the options, if the court finds that possession was continuous despite the one-year absence, then options A and B would be plausible, with the farmer losing because the man fulfilled the statutory period.\n\nIf the court finds that the possession wasn't continuous due to the one-year absence, then options C and D would be more likely, with the farmer winning.\n\nConsidering the statutory period is 20 years, and the total time from 1987 to 2010 is 23 years, but with a one-year gap, the decisive factor is whether that gap breaks the continuity.\n\nGiven that, I think the most probable judicial determination would be that the farmer would win because the man's possession was not continuous due to the one-year absence in 1998.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that adverse possession laws vary by jurisdiction, and some courts might interpret continuity differently.\n\nBut based on the information provided and assuming strict continuity is required, option C is the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
