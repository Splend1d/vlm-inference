Exposure to a nonaggressive model\n\nB. Opportunities for catharsis\n\nC. Social skills training\n\nD. A threat of retaliation from a high-status person\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these strategies entails and how they might influence a child's aggressive behavior.\n\nStarting with option A, exposure to a nonaggressive model. This probably refers to modeling behavior, where children learn by observing others. If they are exposed to models who handle situations without aggression, they might learn to do the same. This seems like it could be effective.\n\nOption B mentions opportunities for catharsis. Catharsis is the idea that allowing someone to vent their feelings, perhaps through activity or expression, can reduce pent-up aggression. However, I've heard that this approach might not always work, especially if it reinforces the idea that aggression is an acceptable way to deal with feelings.\n\nSocial skills training, option C, involves teaching children how to interact positively with others, manage emotions, and resolve conflicts without aggression. This seems like it would be very effective.\n\nOption D is a threat of retaliation from a high-status person. This might involve intimidating the child into not being aggressive by threatening consequences. While this could potentially reduce aggressive behavior in the short term, I wonder about its long-term effectiveness and whether it might even increase aggression.\n\nLet me think about each one more carefully.\n\nFor option A, modeling nonaggressive behavior is a well-established concept in psychology, particularly in social learning theory. Children learn a lot by observing others, especially adults and peers. If they see that nonaggressive approaches work, they are more likely to adopt those approaches themselves. So, this seems like a good strategy.\n\nOption B, catharsis, has been a popular idea for a long time\u2014that letting aggression out in a safe way can reduce overall aggression. However, research has shown that this isn't always the case. In some instances, engaging in aggressive behavior, even in a controlled setting, can actually increase aggression rather than decrease it. This is because it may reinforce aggressive responses to feelings and situations. So, this might not be the most effective strategy.\n\nSocial skills training, option C, is widely recognized as an effective approach to reducing aggression in children. By teaching them how to communicate effectively, manage their emotions, and resolve conflicts peacefully, they develop the tools needed to handle situations without resorting to aggression. This seems like it should be very effective.\n\nOption D, threatening retaliation, might work in the short term by instilling fear, but it's not a constructive approach. It doesn't teach children anything about how to manage their behavior or handle their emotions in a healthy way. In the long run, this could lead to increased aggression or other behavioral problems. Additionally, using threats can damage relationships and may not be ethical or appropriate in an educational or caregiving setting.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems that exposure to a nonaggressive model, social skills training, and possibly even catharsis (though its effectiveness is questionable) are more constructive approaches compared to threatening retaliation.\n\nTherefore, I think that option D, a threat of retaliation from a high-status person, would probably be the least effective strategy for reducing aggressiveness in children. It doesn't address the root causes of aggression and may have negative side effects.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider whether any of the other options could be less effective under certain circumstances.\n\nFor example, exposure to a nonaggressive model might not be effective if the child doesn't identify with the model or if the model's behavior isn't seen as relevant to the child's situation. However, in general, modeling is a powerful influence.\n\nSocial skills training is typically very effective, but it does require time and effort to implement properly. If not done correctly, it might not have the desired impact.\n\nCatharsis, as I mentioned earlier, might sometimes backfire and increase aggression. So, while it's possible that it could help in some cases, it's not a reliable strategy.\n\nComparing all these, the threat of retaliation seems like the least effective and most potentially harmful approach.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
