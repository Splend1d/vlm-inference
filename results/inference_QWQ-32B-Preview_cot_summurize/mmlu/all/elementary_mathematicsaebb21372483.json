                    "text": "So I have this problem here: 26.1 millimeters is equal to blank decimeters. And I have these options: A. 0.261, B. 261, C. 2.61, and D. 2,610. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between millimeters and decimeters. I know that both are units of length in the metric system, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conversions.\n\nI remember that the base unit for length in the metric system is the meter. So, maybe I can convert millimeters to meters and then meters to decimeters.\n\nLet me look up the prefixes. \"Milli-\" means one-thousandth (1/1000), and \"deci-\" means one-tenth (1/10). So, 1 millimeter is 0.001 meters, and 1 decimeter is 0.1 meters.\n\nMaybe I can use these conversions to find out how many decimeters are in 26.1 millimeters.\n\nFirst, convert millimeters to meters:\n\n26.1 mm * (1 m / 1000 mm) = 0.0261 meters.\n\nNow, convert meters to decimeters:\n\n0.0261 m * (10 dm / 1 m) = 0.261 decimeters.\n\nSo, 26.1 millimeters is equal to 0.261 decimeters.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 0.261, which matches what I just calculated.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the relationship between millimeters and decimeters directly. Since 1 meter is 10 decimeters and 1 meter is 1000 millimeters, then 1 decimeter is 100 millimeters.\n\nWait, is that right? Let's see:\n\n1 meter = 10 decimeters\n\n1 meter = 1000 millimeters\n\nTherefore, 1 decimeter = 100 millimeters.\n\nSo, to convert millimeters to decimeters, I can divide the number of millimeters by 100.\n\n26.1 mm / 100 = 0.261 dm.\n\nAgain, that matches option A.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the metric system prefixes, moving from milli- to deci- involves moving three places to the left because milli- is 10^-3 and deci- is 10^-1.\n\nWait, actually, that's not quite right. The exponent difference between milli- and deci- is two places, not three.\n\nWait, let's think about it in terms of exponents.\n\n1 millimeter is 10^-3 meters.\n\n1 decimeter is 10^-1 meters.\n\nSo, to convert from millimeters to decimeters, I need to multiply by 10^-3 / 10^-1 = 10^(-3 - (-1)) = 10^-2 = 0.01.\n\nWait, that means 1 millimeter is 0.01 decimeters.\n\nTherefore, 26.1 mm * 0.01 = 0.261 dm.\n\nAgain, that confirms option A.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of place value. Since 1 decimeter is 100 millimeters, then 26.1 millimeters is 26.1 / 100 = 0.261 decimeters.\n\nEverything I'm doing points to option A being correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the conversion factors again.\n\nI know that:\n\n1 m = 1000 mm\n\n1 m = 10 dm\n\nTherefore, 10 dm = 1000 mm\n\nSo, 1 dm = 100 mm\n\nTherefore, 26.1 mm is 26.1 / 100 = 0.261 dm.\n\nAgain, confirming option A.\n\nI think I've checked this enough. It seems clear that the correct answer is A. 0.261.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
