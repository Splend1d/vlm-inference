                    "text": "So I've got this economics problem here. It says that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, and I need to find out the largest total increase in GDP that can result from $500 of new spending. The options are A. $400, B. $500, C. $625, and D. $2,500. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is. MPC is the fraction of additional income that a person or economy spends on consumption. So, if MPC is 0.8, that means for every extra dollar earned, 80 cents are spent on consumption.\n\nNow, the question is about the total increase in GDP from new spending. I think this has something to do with the multiplier effect in economics. The multiplier effect says that an initial increase in spending can lead to a bigger increase in GDP because the initial spending becomes income for others, who then spend a portion of it, and so on.\n\nThe formula for the spending multiplier is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\text{MPC}} \\]\n\nGiven that MPC is 0.8, plugging that in:\n\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.8} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the multiplier is 5. That means that every dollar of new spending can lead to a $5 increase in GDP.\n\nNow, if there's $500 of new spending, the total increase in GDP would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total increase in GDP} = \\text{Multiplier} \\times \\text{Initial spending} = 5 \\times 500 = 2500 \\]\n\nLooking back at the options, D. $2,500 matches this calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Is there any reason why the multiplier wouldn't apply here, or perhaps there's a different approach to this problem?\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the marginal propensity to save (MPS), which is 1 - MPC. Since MPC is 0.8, MPS is 0.2. The multiplier is indeed 1 / MPS, which is again 5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the sequence of spending. The initial spending is $500. Then, since MPC is 0.8, the next round of spending is 0.8 \u00d7 500 = $400. Then, the following round is 0.8 \u00d7 400 = $320, and so on.\n\nSo, the total increase in GDP would be the sum of this infinite geometric series:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total increase} = 500 + 400 + 320 + 256 + \\dots \\]\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio. Here, \\( a = 500 \\) and \\( r = 0.8 \\), so:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{500}{1 - 0.8} = \\frac{500}{0.2} = 2500 \\]\n\nAgain, $2,500.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any leaks in the economy that might reduce the multiplier effect, like taxes or imports. The problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume it's a closed economy with no taxes or imports, meaning the multiplier is indeed 5.\n\nAlternatively, if there were leakages, the multiplier would be smaller, but since there are no leakages mentioned, the full multiplier applies.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the question is trying to trick me by offering $400 as an option, which is just 0.8 \u00d7 500, the first round of consumption only. But the question asks for the total increase in GDP, which should account for all subsequent rounds of spending, leading back to $2,500.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of what MPC represents. But I think I've applied it correctly.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should look up the formula quickly to confirm.\n\n[Imagines looking up a reference or recalling from memory.]\n\nYes, confirmed: the spending multiplier is indeed \\( \\frac{1}{1 - \\text{MPC}} \\).\n\nSo, with MPC = 0.8, multiplier = 5, total increase in GDP = 5 \u00d7 500 = 2500.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
