Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Moreland's description of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire. So, the passage is talking about how in Northern India during a certain period, the existence of separate states was often just a matter of words. It explains that zamindars, who were local landlords or chiefs, paid revenue to the Mughal Empire, but their position was dependent on whether they paid this revenue or not.\n\nIf a zamindar didn't pay the revenue, it could be seen as a claim to sovereignty, meaning they were asserting their independence from the Mughal Empire. However, the passage also notes that sometimes these omissions in paying revenue could be due to other reasons, not necessarily a bid for independence. It gives examples of regions like Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur where there were many chiefs and tribes in an \"anomalous position,\" meaning their status was unclear or irregular.\n\nThese chiefs and tribes sometimes paid the required revenue, sometimes rebelled openly, and sometimes just didn't pay because the Mughal authorities didn't enforce collection. So, it seems like there was a lot of variability in how revenue was collected and whether these local chiefs were dependent on the Mughal Empire or not.\n\nNow, the question is asking which generalization is best supported by this description. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire.\n\nThe passage doesn't mention anything about religion. It talks about zamindars paying revenue, but doesn't specify that this was based on their religion. So, this option doesn't seem supported by the information given.\n\nB. Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.\n\nThis seems plausible. The passage mentions specific regions like Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur, where there were numerous chiefs and tribes in an anomalous position regarding revenue payment. This suggests that in different geographical areas, the situation with revenue collection might have been different. So, this could be a possible generalization.\n\nC. Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.\n\nThe passage only discusses revenue collection from zamindars and doesn't provide information about other potential sources of income for the Mughal Empire. So, we can't generalize that revenue collection was the only source of funds.\n\nD. The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire.\n\nThe passage mentions Rajputana as an example of a region where there were many chiefs and tribes with an unclear status regarding revenue payment. However, it doesn't claim that this was typical of the entire Mughal Empire. In fact, the first sentence suggests that in Northern India, the existence of separate states was often just a matter of words, implying a different situation elsewhere.\n\nSo, considering these points, option B seems to be the best generalization supported by the passage. It acknowledges that geographical differences may have influenced which groups paid taxes, based on the examples provided in the passage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
