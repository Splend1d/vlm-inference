                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Derek Parfit and his views on equality. So, the question is: Why does Parfit oppose equality? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Parfit actually says about equality. I remember that in his book \"Reasons and Persons,\" he discusses various principles of distributive justice, including equality. Parfit is known for his critical analysis of different ethical theories, so it's likely that he has some nuanced views on equality.\n\nOption A says that he argues an unequal society is inevitable. Hmm, that sounds a bit too deterministic for Parfit. While he might acknowledge that inequality is a persistent feature of many societies, I don't recall him stating that inequality is inevitable. He's more focused on what moral principles we should use to evaluate and possibly reform social structures.\n\nOption B claims that he says by giving priority to the needs of the poor, we can increase equality. This sounds a bit like prioritarianism, which is a theory that Parfit does discuss. Prioritarianism gives extra weight to the interests of the worse off. So, if Parfit endorses prioritarianism, he might argue that prioritizing the poor can lead to greater equality, but I need to be careful because endorsing prioritarianism doesn't necessarily mean opposing equality overall.\n\nOption C asserts that he claims we are each responsible for our own poverty. This sounds like a libertarian view, where individual responsibility is emphasized, and state intervention is minimized. While Parfit does consider libertarian positions, I don't think he endorses the idea that everyone is solely responsible for their poverty. He acknowledges that circumstances can play a significant role in one's life outcomes.\n\nOption D says he rejects the idea of equality altogether. This seems a bit too strong. Parfit does critique strict equality, but to say he rejects equality altogether might not be accurate. He explores various conceptions of distributive justice and argues for what he calls the \"impersonal principle,\" which considers the total amount of welfare in society rather than how it is distributed.\n\nLet me think again. Parfit is critical of strict egalitarianism because it may require excessive sacrifices from some to achieve equality, which could be inefficient or unfair in certain ways. He prefers prioritarianism, which focuses on improving the situation of the worst off without necessarily achieving complete equality.\n\nGiven that, option B seems the most plausible. By giving priority to the needs of the poor, we can increase equality, but perhaps not achieve perfect equality. This aligns with prioritarianism, which Parfit endorses.\n\nWait, but the question is about why Parfit opposes equality. So, if he endorses prioritarianism, which aims to help the poor, but not necessarily achieve equality, then perhaps he opposes equality in the sense that equality shouldn't be the sole goal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he opposes certain forms of equality, like equality of outcome, but supports other forms, like equality of opportunity.\n\nI need to remember that Parfit distinguishes between different aspects of equality and argues that prioritarianism can capture our concerns for the worse off without committing to strict equality.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is B: He claims that by giving priority to the needs of the poor, we can increase equality. This suggests that Parfit opposes strict equality in favor of a more nuanced approach that still addresses inequality but doesn't require complete equalization.\n\nOption A seems less likely because Parfit is more about moral theory than making predictions about social structures.\n\nOption C doesn't align with Parfit's views, as he recognizes the impact of luck and circumstances on people's lives.\n\nOption D is probably too broad, as Parfit does value some forms of equality, just not strict equality of outcome.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
