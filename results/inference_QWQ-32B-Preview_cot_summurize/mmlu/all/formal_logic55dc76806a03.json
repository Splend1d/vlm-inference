                    "text": "So I've got these premises in propositional logic, and I need to figure out which of the options is a direct consequence of them. Let's list out the premises again to keep them clear:\n\n1. U \u2283 W\n\n2. W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y)\n\n3. (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z\n\n4. ~Z\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. U \u2283 Z\n\nB. U \u2228 W\n\nC. ~W\n\nD. ~(X \u2261 ~Y)\n\nOkay, first step is to understand what an \"immediate consequence\" means. I think it means that it's something that follows directly from the premises with just one step of reasoning. So, I need to see which of these options can be derived directly from the given premises without needing additional steps.\n\nLet me look at each premise and see how they connect.\n\nStarting with premise 1: U \u2283 W\n\nThis tells me that if U is true, then W is true.\n\nPremise 2: W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y)\n\nThis says that if W is true, then X is equivalent to not Y.\n\nPremise 3: (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z\n\nSo, if X is equivalent to not Y, then Z is true.\n\nPremise 4: ~Z\n\nThis simply states that Z is false.\n\nAlright, with ~Z being false, I can use that to see what else must be false.\n\nLooking at premise 3: (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z\n\nSince Z is false, for this implication to hold true, the antecedent (X \u2261 ~Y) must also be false. Because if (X \u2261 ~Y) were true, then Z would have to be true, but Z is false. Therefore, (X \u2261 ~Y) must be false.\n\nSo, ~(X \u2261 ~Y) is true.\n\nLooking at option D: ~(X \u2261 ~Y)\n\nThis matches what I just derived. So, D seems like a direct consequence.\n\nBut let's make sure none of the other options are more direct or also direct consequences.\n\nOption A: U \u2283 Z\n\nDoes U imply Z directly from the premises?\n\nFrom premise 1, U \u2283 W, and from premise 2, W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y), and premise 3, (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z.\n\nSo, there's a chain: U \u2283 W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z.\n\nTherefore, U \u2283 Z is true, but this seems like it's derived from a chain of implications, not a single step.\n\nSo, while it's a consequence, it might not be an \"immediate\" one.\n\nOption B: U \u2228 W\n\nThis says U or W is true.\n\nBut from the premises, I don't have any information about the truth values of U or W directly. Only their implications to other propositions.\n\nSo, I can't conclude that U \u2228 W is true based on the given premises in a single step.\n\nOption C: ~W\n\nIs W false?\n\nFrom premise 1, U \u2283 W, and premise 2, W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y), and premise 3, (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z, and premise 4, ~Z.\n\nSince Z is false, and (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z, then (X \u2261 ~Y) must be false, as I concluded earlier.\n\nNow, if (X \u2261 ~Y) is false, and W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y), then for W to be true, (X \u2261 ~Y) would have to be true, but it's false. Therefore, W must be false.\n\nSo, ~W is true.\n\nWait a minute, option C is ~W, which is true.\n\nBut earlier, I thought option D was the immediate consequence.\n\nHowever, option C is also directly derivable from the premises.\n\nLet me see which one is more directly consequence.\n\nGiven that ~Z is true, and (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z is true, then (X \u2261 ~Y) must be false, as I thought.\n\nAnd since W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y), and (X \u2261 ~Y) is false, then W must be false.\n\nSo, ~W is true.\n\nSo, both D and C seem to be direct consequences.\n\nBut the question asks for \"an\" immediate consequence, not \"the\" immediate consequence, so maybe both are correct.\n\nBut perhaps I need to choose the one that is most directly derived.\n\nLet's see: from premise 3 and premise 4, I can directly infer ~(X \u2261 ~Y), without needing to go through W.\n\nWhereas to infer ~W, I need to go through the implication W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y), and know that (X \u2261 ~Y) is false.\n\nSo, perhaps D is more immediate, while C is a step further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects only one answer, and I need to choose the best one.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. U \u2283 Z (seems like a derived consequence, not immediate)\n\nB. U \u2228 W (no direct support from premises)\n\nC. ~W (derived through a step)\n\nD. ~(X \u2261 ~Y) (directly follows from premise 3 and premise 4)\n\nSo, D seems to be the most immediate consequence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
