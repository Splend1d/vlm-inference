I think it was something about how they are things that exist outside of individual people, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me look back at the options:\n\nA says \"ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that are collective and social in origin.\" That sounds familiar. Durkheim was big on the idea that society shapes individuals, so maybe social facts are those things that are bigger than any one person, like norms and values that everyone follows.\n\nB mentions \"the way scientists construct knowledge in a social context.\" Hmm, that sounds more like social constructivism or something from science studies. I don't think that's what Durkheim meant by social facts.\n\nC says \"data collected about social phenomena that are proven to be correct.\" Well, Durkheim was a founder of sociology and emphasized the scientific study of society, but I don't think social facts are just data that are proven correct. That seems too narrow.\n\nD is \"ideas and theories that have no basis in the external, physical world.\" That sounds more like abstract concepts or maybe even delusions. I don't think that's what Durkheim had in mind when he talked about social facts.\n\nSo, going back to option A, \"ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that are collective and social in origin,\" that aligns with what I recall about Durkheim's definition. He saw social facts as external to the individual and having a coercive power over people's behavior. For example, laws, moral norms, and even things like fashion trends could be considered social facts because they influence how people act and think, even if individuals aren't always aware of it.\n\nI think the key here is understanding that social facts are objective realities that exist within society and can be studied scientifically. Durkheim wanted to establish sociology as a legitimate science, similar to the natural sciences, and social facts were his way of identifying the unique subject matter of sociology.\n\nSo, based on that, I believe the correct answer is A. Ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that are collective and social in origin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
