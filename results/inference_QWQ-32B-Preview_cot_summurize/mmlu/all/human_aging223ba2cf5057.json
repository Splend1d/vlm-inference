Has lost a lot of sweet taste buds and cannot taste sweetness as well anymore.\n\nHere's why I think that: As people get older, their sense of taste can change. Grandmother might not be able to taste sweetness as strongly as she used to, so she adds more sugar to make it taste sweeter to her. That's why the iced tea might seem super sweet to you.\n\nOption B says she's a member of a cohort that really enjoys sweets. Maybe that's true, but I think the aging factor with taste buds is a bigger reason.\n\nOption C suggests she's trying to make you sweeter. I don't think that's likely. It seems unrelated to the sweetness of the tea.\n\nOption D mentions damage in her parietal lobe. That seems too extreme. The parietal lobe is involved in processing sensations, but I think the issue is more about the taste buds aging, not brain damage.\n\nSo, I think A is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
