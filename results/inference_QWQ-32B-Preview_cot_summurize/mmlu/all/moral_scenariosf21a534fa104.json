                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I keyed a random stranger's car and felt good about it.\n\nScenario 2: I gave my teething infant a dog biscuit to chew on.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to look at each scenario separately and decide whether it's morally wrong or not, based on what's generally accepted in the US around 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Keying a random stranger's car and feeling good about it.\n\nSo, keying a car means scratching the paint with a key or something sharp. It's damaging someone's property without their consent. In the US, property damage is generally considered wrong because it hurts someone else's belongings and can cost them money to fix.\n\nMoreover, feeling good about it adds a layer of malicious intent or enjoyment from causing harm, which is even more morally questionable. Most people would agree that intentionally damaging someone's property for no good reason is wrong.\n\nSo, I think Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Giving my teething infant a dog biscuit to chew on.\n\nThis one is a bit different. Teething infants often need things to chew on to soothe their gums. Parents might give them teething rings or other appropriate items.\n\nGiving a dog biscuit to a baby to chew on seems unusual. Dog biscuits are meant for dogs, not humans, especially not infants. There might be hygiene issues or choking hazards. Also, dog biscuits aren't designed with infant safety in mind.\n\nHowever, whether this is morally wrong is a bit tricky. Morally wrong usually implies some kind of intentional harm or neglect. If the parent gives the baby a dog biscuit without considering the potential risks, it could be seen as negligent, which might be considered morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parent thought it was harmless or didn't know better. In that case, it might not be intentionally wrong.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, parents are expected to prioritize their children's safety and well-being. Giving a baby something that isn't intended for infants could be seen as not fulfilling that responsibility.\n\nSo, I would say Scenario 2 is also morally wrong, but perhaps less severe than Scenario 1.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for which one is clearly morally wrong. Maybe Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, while Scenario 2 is more of a gray area.\n\nLet me think differently. In Scenario 1, the action is clearly intentional harm to someone else's property, which is straightforwardly wrong. In Scenario 2, it's more about potential harm due to negligence or lack of knowledge.\n\nPerhaps, in 2020, ordinary moral standards would consider Scenario 1 clearly wrong, but Scenario 2 might not be universally seen as wrong, especially if the parent didn't know better.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that giving a baby something inappropriate to chew on is wrong because it endangers the child, similar to how not providing proper care could be morally wrong.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider what ordinary people would think.\n\nIf someone keys a stranger's car and feels good about it, that's clearly malicious and wrong.\n\nIf someone gives their baby a dog biscuit to chew, some might think it's unusual, but not necessarily morally wrong, especially if no harm came from it.\n\nAlternatively, others might see it as negligent and therefore wrong.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, while Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure about Scenario 2.\n\nLet me look it up a bit.\n\nFirst, keying a car is clearly vandalism and illegal, and morally wrong because it's damaging someone else's property without their consent and with malicious intent.\n\nAs for giving a dog biscuit to a teething infant, it's not illegal, but it might not be the best choice for the baby's health and safety.\n\nDog biscuits aren't designed for human consumption, especially not for infants, who have different nutritional needs and could choke on them.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, prioritizing the baby's well-being would suggest that giving them something more appropriate would be better.\n\nHowever, if no harm came from it and it was a one-time thing, maybe it's not clearly morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if it becomes a habit or if the parent consistently makes poor choices regarding the baby's care, that could be seen as neglectful and morally wrong.\n\nBut in this specific scenario, it's just one instance of giving a dog biscuit to a teething infant.\n\nI think most people would say it's not the greatest idea, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, perhaps only Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, making the answer B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that both scenarios involve some level of wrongness, then A. Wrong, Wrong would be the answer.\n\nBut based on my earlier thoughts, I lean towards B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think C and D can be eliminated because Scenario 1 seems clearly wrong.\n\nBetween A and B, I think B is more appropriate because Scenario 2 is not clearly morally wrong, even if it's not the best decision.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
