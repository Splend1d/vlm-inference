This sounds like they might be taking cookies that don't belong to them, maybe from a store or an event where they're working. Taking items without paying for them or without permission is generally considered stealing, which is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character knew their wife loved the color red, so they gave her red roses. This seems like a thoughtful and kind gesture. Giving gifts based on knowing what the recipient likes is generally seen as positive and morally acceptable.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves something morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
