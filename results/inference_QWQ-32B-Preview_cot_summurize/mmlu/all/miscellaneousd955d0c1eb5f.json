While other file types like .jpg (images), .pdf (Portable Document Format), and .wav (audio files) can sometimes carry viruses, especially if they are being used as a disguise for executable content, .exe files are the primary targets for virus scans due to their direct execution capabilities. It's always a good practice to scan all types of files, but prioritizing .exe files is essential for maintaining system security."
