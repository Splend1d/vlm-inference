                    "text": "So here's this scenario: a guy is driving really fast, like way over the speed limit in a residential area, and he loses control, jumps the curb, and hits a woman walking on the sidewalk. She gets really hurt\u2014internal injuries, broken legs, and ends up in the hospital for 11 months, and now she's permanently disabled. The question is, if this guy is charged with attempted murder, should he be found guilty or not, and why?\n\nFirst off, attempted murder is a serious charge. It usually requires that the defendant had the intent to kill someone or that his actions showed a deliberate disregard for human life, essentially equivalent to intending to kill.\n\nOption A says he should be found guilty because a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts. So, if driving that fast in a residential area is likely to cause harm, maybe even death, then maybe he should be held responsible for intending those consequences.\n\nOption B says he should be guilty because his actions show willful and wanton disregard for the safety of others. Willful and wanton conduct is often considered in negligence cases, but here it's being applied to a criminal charge. So, if his reckless driving shows that he didn't care about the safety of others, that might be enough for attempted murder.\n\nOption C says he should be found not guilty because he didn't intend to kill the woman. This seems straightforward. Attempted murder requires intent to kill, and if he didn't have that intent, then maybe he shouldn't be convicted of attempted murder.\n\nOption D says not guilty because he lost control of the vehicle. But losing control doesn't necessarily mean he didn't act recklessly beforehand. He was driving way too fast in a residential area, so maybe losing control is a consequence of his reckless behavior.\n\nLet me think about this. In criminal law, intent is key for attempted murder. But sometimes, courts look at reckless behavior as equivalent to intent if it shows a conscious disregard for life.\n\nIn this case, driving over 100 mph in a residential area is extremely reckless. It's not just a traffic violation; it's behavior that endangers the lives of others. So, maybe the law presumes that he intended the consequences of his actions, which could include serious injury or death.\n\nOn the other hand, attempted murder typically requires a specific intent to kill. Just being reckless might not be enough to establish that specific intent.\n\nBut some jurisdictions have laws that allow for a charge of attempted murder based on conduct that is so reckless that it demonstrates a disregard for human life, equivalent to intent to kill.\n\nAlso, the fact that the victim suffered severe injuries and is now permanently disabled might influence the severity of the charge.\n\nI think option A is plausible because the natural and probable consequences of driving that fast in a residential area could include harming or killing someone. So, if he engaged in that behavior, he's presumed to intend those consequences.\n\nOption B is also tempting because his conduct was willful and wanton, showing a disregard for the safety of others. But again, is that enough to constitute attempted murder?\n\nOption C argues that without intent to kill, he shouldn't be found guilty of attempted murder. That seems logical, but perhaps in this context, his extreme recklessness can be equated with intent.\n\nOption D seems weak because losing control was a result of his reckless driving. He chose to drive at an excessive speed, knowing or should have known that it could lead to loss of control.\n\nMaybe the better approach is to consider the legal definitions. Attempted murder usually requires an intent to kill. Reckless behavior that causes serious harm might lead to other charges, like aggravated assault or reckless endangerment, but not necessarily attempted murder.\n\nIn some places, there might be a charge like \"attempted murder by acts exhibiting extreme indifference to human life.\" So, it's possible that his actions could be construed as attempted murder.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he should be charged with a lesser offense, like aggravated assault or reckless endangerment, since he didn't specifically intend to kill anyone.\n\nBut the question is specifically about attempted murder.\n\nLet me consider the victim's perspective. She was going about her business, walking on the sidewalk, and gets severely injured due to this guy's reckless driving. It's tragic, and she's now permanently disabled. So, from an emotional standpoint, one might think he should be held accountable to the fullest extent.\n\nLegally, though, attempted murder might be a stretch unless the jurisdiction allows for recklessness to be equated with intent in this context.\n\nI think the answer is C: not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill the woman. Attempted murder requires specific intent to kill, and while his actions were reckless and caused serious harm, without that specific intent, he shouldn't be found guilty of attempted murder.\n\nOption A is attractive, but the presumption of intent for natural and probable consequences might not rise to the level of intent to kill required for attempted murder.\n\nOption B is similar, but again, willful and wanton disregard might not be equivalent to intent to kill.\n\nOption D is weak because losing control was a result of his reckless behavior.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill the woman.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
