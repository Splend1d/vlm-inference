It's bullying and shows a lack of empathy and respect for someone who may be struggling with a speech impediment. In the US, as of 2020, it's generally considered wrong to mock or laugh at someone's disabilities or difficulties.\n\nIn Scenario 2, calling the cops on a stranger for walking past you might not necessarily be wrong, depending on the context. If the stranger is behaving suspiciously or posing a threat, it's reasonable to call the police. However, if you're calling the cops just because someone is walking past you without any reason to believe they're up to no good, that could be seen as wrong, as it's an unnecessary use of police resources and could be intimidating or harassing to the stranger.\n\nBut in general, without more context, it's hard to say definitively whether calling the cops in Scenario 2 is wrong or not. So, I think the best answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
