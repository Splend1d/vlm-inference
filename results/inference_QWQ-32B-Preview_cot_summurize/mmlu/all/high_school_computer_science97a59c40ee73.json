Let's see what each one does.\n\nOption A is `int(x [,base])`. I know that `int()` is a built-in function in Python that can convert a number or a string to an integer. The `[base]` part is optional and is used when converting from a string in a different base, like binary or hexadecimal. So, for example, `int(\"10\", 2)` would convert the binary string \"10\" to the integer 2. So, this seems like a likely candidate.\n\nOption B is `long(x [,base])`. Hmm, I remember that in Python 2, there were `int` and `long` types, where `long` could handle larger numbers. But in Python 3, all integers are treated as long, so the `long` function doesn't exist anymore. So, this probably isn't the right choice for Python 3.\n\nOption C is `float(x)`. This function converts a number or a string to a floating-point number. So, if I have a string like \"123.45\", `float(\"123.45\")` would give me the float 123.45. But the question is about converting to an integer, not a float, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D is `str(x)`. This function converts a number or other types to a string. For example, `str(123)` would give me the string \"123\". Again, this is the opposite of what we need.\n\nSo, based on this, it looks like option A, `int(x [,base])`, is the correct function to convert a string to an integer in Python 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
