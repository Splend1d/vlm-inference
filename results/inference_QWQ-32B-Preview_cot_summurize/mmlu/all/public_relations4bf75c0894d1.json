                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these entities can't sue for libel. So, first things first, what is libel? Libel is like when someone writes something false and bad about you that hurts your reputation. It's different from slander, which is spoken. So, libel is in writing or other permanent forms, like online posts or newspapers.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these can't sue for libel. That means, which one doesn't have the right to go to court and say, \"Hey, someone wrote something bad and false about us, and it hurt our reputation.\"\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. A politician. Politicians are public figures, right? They're involved in government and politics, and there's a lot of scrutiny on them. I think they can sue for libel, but maybe there are special rules for them because they're public figures.\n\nB. A house of worship. This sounds like a church, mosque, synagogue, or other religious places. I'm not sure if organizations can sue for libel. Maybe they can.\n\nC. A government institution. Like the city hall or the police department. Are these entities that can have reputations damaged by false statements? Probably, but maybe there are special considerations for government entities.\n\nD. A publicly-traded company. These are companies whose stocks are traded on the stock market, like Apple or Google. I think companies can sue for libel if false statements harm their reputation or stock price.\n\nWait a minute, I remember that for public figures, like politicians, it's harder to win a libel case because they have to prove actual malice, meaning the person who made the false statement knew it was false or didn't care whether it was true or not. So, while politicians can sue for libel, it's more difficult for them.\n\nBut the question is about which one cannot sue for libel, not just that it's harder for some.\n\nLet me think about houses of worship. Are they considered legal entities? I think they are, like non-profit organizations. So, they should be able to sue for libel if their reputation is harmed by false statements.\n\nGovernment institutions are interesting. They are part of the government, so maybe there are sovereign immunity issues. Sovereign immunity is a legal principle that says the government can't be sued without its consent. So, perhaps government institutions can't sue for libel because of sovereign immunity.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Maybe they can waive sovereign immunity in certain cases.\n\nPublicly-traded companies are businesses, and businesses can definitely sue for libel if false statements harm their reputation or financial status.\n\nWait, but I think all of these entities can sue for libel, but maybe under certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me by including an entity that isn't capable of holding a legal claim for libel.\n\nLet me consider each one again:\n\n- Politicians: Can sue, but it's harder due to the actual malice standard.\n\n- Houses of worship: Should be able to sue as legal entities.\n\n- Government institutions: Maybe protected by sovereign immunity.\n\n- Publicly-traded companies: Can sue for libel.\n\nHmm. Maybe the government institution can't sue for libel because of sovereign immunity.\n\nBut I recall that in some cases, government entities can waive sovereign immunity and bring lawsuits, including for libel.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the house of worship can't sue for libel because of some religious freedom considerations, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe it's different in various jurisdictions. Libel laws can vary by country and even within countries.\n\nAssuming this is a general question, perhaps the answer is the government institution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps none of them cannot sue for libel, but that seems unlikely because the question is expecting one of these options to be the correct answer.\n\nLet me see if I can find a pattern or recall any specific laws related to libel and these entities.\n\nI think the key here is understanding sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity generally protects the government from being sued without its consent. So, if a government institution is part of the sovereign, it might be immune from suit for libel.\n\nHowever, sometimes governments do have procedures for bringing claims on behalf of government entities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the house of worship can't sue for libel because of the First Amendment's freedom of religion and speech provisions. But that doesn't directly relate to libel claims by religious institutions.\n\nWait, in the US, religious institutions can bring libel claims. In fact, there have been cases where churches have sued for libel.\n\nSo, perhaps that's not the answer.\n\nLooking back, the most plausible option is the government institution, due to sovereign immunity.\n\nBut to confirm, I should think about whether government entities can indeed sue for libel.\n\nIn some cases, government entities can bring libel claims, especially if they are acting in a capacity other than their governmental functions. For example, if a government-run hospital is libeled in a way that affects its business operations, it might be able to sue for libel.\n\nHowever, there are complexities and limitations due to sovereign immunity.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the government institution is the entity that cannot sue for libel.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. A government institution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
