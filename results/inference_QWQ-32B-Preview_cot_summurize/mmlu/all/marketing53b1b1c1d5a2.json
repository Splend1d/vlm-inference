The options are Opinion followers, Opinion formers, Public relations, and Opinion leaders. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nOpinion followers\u2014 that sounds like people who follow others' opinions. Maybe they don't create opinions themselves but tend to agree with what influential people say. So, they might be the audience that's being targeted, but I'm not sure if this is the approach used to reach them.\n\nOpinion formers\u2014 this seems a bit different. These are probably the people who shape opinions, maybe through their positions in society, media, or expertise. They could be the ones creating the content for those TV and radio programs.\n\nPublic relations\u2014 that's a broad field that involves managing the spread of information between an organization and the public. It could include using media like TV and radio to communicate messages and educate audiences. This seems promising.\n\nOpinion leaders\u2014 similar to opinion formers, these are individuals who influence the opinions of others. They might be featured in TV and radio programs to share their insights and shape public perception.\n\nNow, the question is about an approach that uses TV and radio programs to convey information and educate a large audience. So, it's not just about the people who follow opinions or the leaders who form them, but more about the method or strategy used to reach and inform those audiences.\n\nPublic relations seems like the most fitting answer because it encompasses the strategies and tactics used to manage communication with the public, which can include producing and broadcasting educational content through media channels like television and radio.\n\nLet me double-check. Opinion formers and opinion leaders are more about the individuals who influence others, but the question is about the approach or method used to educate the audience through media. Public relations is a field that would employ such methods to achieve communication goals.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. Public relations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
