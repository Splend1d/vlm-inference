                    "text": "So Jean threw a softball 9 feet, and Lee threw it 3 times as far as Jean. We need to find out which equation helps us determine the distance \\( d \\) that Lee threw the ball.\n\nLet's break this down. If Jean threw it 9 feet, and Lee threw it 3 times as far, that means Lee threw it \\( 3 \\times 9 \\) feet, right? Because \"3 times as far\" means we multiply Jean's distance by 3 to get Lee's distance.\n\nSo, Lee's distance \\( d \\) should be equal to \\( 3 \\times 9 \\). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. \\( d \\times 3 = 9 \\)\n\nB. \\( d + 3 = 9 \\)\n\nC. \\( 3 + 9 = d \\)\n\nD. \\( 3 \\times 9 = d \\)\n\nWhich one matches what we just figured out?\n\nWe said \\( d = 3 \\times 9 \\), so that looks like option D.\n\nBut let's make sure the others are wrong.\n\nOption A says \\( d \\times 3 = 9 \\). If we solve for \\( d \\), that would be \\( d = 9 / 3 = 3 \\), which would mean Lee threw it 3 feet, but we know Lee threw it farther than Jean's 9 feet, so that can't be right.\n\nOption B says \\( d + 3 = 9 \\), so \\( d = 9 - 3 = 6 \\) feet. Again, that's less than Jean's throw, which doesn't make sense because Lee threw it farther.\n\nOption C says \\( 3 + 9 = d \\), so \\( d = 12 \\) feet. While that's farther than Jean's throw, it's not \"3 times as far.\" Three times 9 is 27, not 12.\n\nSo, option D, \\( 3 \\times 9 = d \\), which is \\( d = 27 \\) feet, makes the most sense.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of it as Lee's distance is 3 multiplied by Jean's distance. So \\( d = 3 \\times 9 \\).\n\nWait a minute, is there a way that another equation could also be correct?\n\nLet's see. If we have \\( d = 3 \\times 9 \\), that's straightforward. But maybe there's another way to represent it.\n\nFor example, if we have \\( d \\times 3 = 9 \\), that would imply \\( d = 9 / 3 = 3 \\), which is not correct.\n\nSimilarly, addition doesn't make sense in this context because we're dealing with \"times as far,\" which indicates multiplication.\n\nSo, indeed, the correct equation is \\( d = 3 \\times 9 \\), which is option D.\n\nJust to double-check, if Lee threw it 3 times as far as Jean, and Jean threw it 9 feet, then Lee threw it \\( 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\) feet.\n\nIf we use option D, \\( d = 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\), which matches.\n\nIf we use option A, \\( d \\times 3 = 9 \\), then \\( d = 3 \\) feet, which is less than Jean's throw, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nOption B, \\( d + 3 = 9 \\), so \\( d = 6 \\) feet, again less than Jean's throw.\n\nOption C, \\( 3 + 9 = d \\), so \\( d = 12 \\) feet, which is more than Jean's throw but not three times as far.\n\nOnly option D correctly represents the relationship between Jean's and Lee's throws.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \\( 3 \\times 9 = d \\)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
