The question is: \"What are the two principal answers to whether life has any meaning for us?\" And then it gives four options:\n\nA. the external view and the internal view\n\nB. the pessimist's view and the optimist's view\n\nC. the religious view and the liberal view\n\nD. the theistic view and the agnostic's view\n\nHmm, I need to think about what the main approaches are to finding meaning in life. I guess there are different philosophical and religious perspectives on this.\n\nOption A mentions external and internal views. I think the external view might be about meaning coming from outside ourselves, like from society, God, or some universal purpose. Whereas the internal view could be about creating our own meaning or finding purpose from within ourselves. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption B talks about pessimist and optimist views. Pessimists might say life has no meaning, while optimists might see meaning in positive aspects of life. But I feel like this is a bit too simplistic. It's more about attitude than about the structure of meaning.\n\nOption C mentions religious and liberal views. Religious views often provide specific meanings based on faith and doctrine, while liberal views might be more inclusive and diverse, allowing for personal interpretations. But this seems a bit narrow, as there are many non-religious perspectives that aren't necessarily liberal.\n\nOption D is about theistic and agnostic views. Theistic views involve belief in a God or higher power who may provide meaning, while agnostics might be unsure about the existence of such a being and thus have different approaches to meaning. This seems similar to the external and internal views in some ways, but perhaps not comprehensive enough.\n\nI think Option A makes the most sense because it divides approaches based on whether meaning is sought externally or internally, which covers a wide range of philosophical and religious positions.\n\nLet me consider this further. In philosophy, there's a distinction between objective and subjective meaning, which might align with external and internal views. Objective meaning would be something that exists independently of our beliefs, perhaps assigned by a higher power or inherent in the universe. Subjective meaning, on the other hand, is created by individuals based on their experiences and choices.\n\nMoreover, existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre argue that life has no inherent meaning, and it's up to individuals to create their own purpose. This would fall under the internal view. Conversely, many religious traditions provide external meanings and purposes for life.\n\nAlso, moral realists might argue that there are objective moral truths that give life meaning, which could be considered an external view, while moral relativists might see meaning as derived from individual or cultural perspectives, aligning with the internal view.\n\nSo, overall, I believe that the two principal answers to whether life has any meaning for us are indeed the external view and the internal view.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
