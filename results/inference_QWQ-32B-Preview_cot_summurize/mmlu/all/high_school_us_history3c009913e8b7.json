We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nWhich of the following is LEAST associated with the Populist movement?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see. I have this passage from the Populist Party Platform in 1892, and it's talking about how the two major political parties have been fighting for power and plunder, and they haven't done anything to fix the problems the people are facing. It mentions that these parties are ignoring important issues like the tariff, and instead focusing on a sham battle over the tariff to distract from real problems like corruption and oppression by big businesses and financial interests.\n\nThe Populists are saying that they want to return the government to the hands of the \"plain people,\" and that their goals align with the Constitution's purposes, like establishing justice and promoting the general welfare.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options is least associated with the Populist movement. The options are:\n\nA. Support of labor unions\n\nB. Secret ballot elections\n\nC. Free coinage of silver\n\nD. Deregulation of railroads and utilities\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Populist movement was about. From what I've read, the Populist Party, also known as the People's Party, emerged in the late 19th century, primarily representing the interests of farmers and workers who were facing economic hardships. They were against the domination of big business and finance and sought reforms to make the government more responsive to the needs of ordinary people.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Support of labor unions: The Populists did support labor unions because they saw them as a way for workers to collectively bargain for better wages and working conditions, which aligned with their goal of helping the \"plain people.\"\n\nB. Secret ballot elections: This refers to the practice of voting in private, without others knowing how you voted. The Populists advocated for this because they wanted to ensure that people could vote freely without fear of retaliation from powerful interests who might try to influence their votes.\n\nC. Free coinage of silver: This was a key economic policy supported by the Populists. They wanted the government to coin silver freely, which would increase the money supply and make it easier for farmers and other debtors to pay off their debts, as it was believed to cause mild inflation.\n\nD. Deregulation of railroads and utilities: This one seems a bit tricky. The Populists were generally against the power of big corporations, including railroads and utilities, which often exploited farmers and small businesses with high rates and unfair practices. Therefore, they tended to support regulation of these industries to protect consumers and small producers, rather than deregulation.\n\nGiven this, it seems like option D, deregulation of railroads and utilities, is least associated with the Populist movement because they actually favored regulation to curb the power of these corporations.\n\nTo double-check, let's see if the platform mentions anything related to railroads or utilities. The passage doesn't explicitly mention railroads or utilities, but it does mention \"controlling influences\" and \"corporations\" that are oppressing the people. So, it's reasonable to infer that the Populists were against the unchecked power of these entities and would support regulations to protect the public.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Deregulation of railroads and utilities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
