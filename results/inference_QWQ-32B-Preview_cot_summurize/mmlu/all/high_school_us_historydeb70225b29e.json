I believe that the rights of the free colored persons need only to be vindicated before the U.S. Supreme Court, to be obtained; that no prejudice or sophistry . . . can prevent their acknowledgement . . . and that the present laws, affecting your condition, are clearly unconstitutional. The fact that you have been treated, by common consent and common usage, as aliens and brutes, is not proof that such treatment is legal, but only shows the strength, the bitterness, and the blindness of prejudice.\"\n\u2014William Lloyd Garrison, \"To the Free People of Color of the United States,\" The Liberator, January 15, 1831\nThe argument put forth by William Lloyd Garrison in the passage was later contradicted in which of the following Supreme Court decisions?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here from William Lloyd Garrison, way back in 1831, arguing that free colored persons in the U.S. are American citizens and should have all the rights that come with that. He's pretty confident that if this was taken to the Supreme Court, it would be settled in their favor, and that any laws treating them otherwise are unconstitutional. He sees the current treatment as a result of prejudice, not law.\n\nNow, the question is asking which Supreme Court decision later contradicted Garrison's argument. The options are Dred Scott v. Sanford from 1857, Ex parte Milligan from 1866, Plessy v. Ferguson from 1896, and Brown v. Board of Education from 1954.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Garrison is saying. He believes that free African Americans are citizens and should have the same rights as any other citizen, regardless of color. He thinks that the Constitution doesn't allow for any distinction based on color or condition, except for slaves, I suppose.\n\nSo, which Supreme Court case went against this idea?\n\nLet's look at Dred Scott v. Sanford from 1857. I remember that Dred Scott was a slave who sued for his freedom after living in free territories. The Supreme Court ruled that he wasn't a citizen and had no right to sue in federal court. The court also said that Congress couldn't ban slavery in the territories. This seems directly against Garrison's argument because it's saying that African Americans, even if free, aren't citizens and don't have the rights citizens have.\n\nEx parte Milligan is from 1866. I think this case was about martial law and civil liberties during the Civil War. Lambdin Milligan was a civilian who was tried by a military tribunal during the war. The Supreme Court ruled that military tribunals couldn't try civilians when civil courts were open. While it's an important case about civil liberties, it doesn't directly address the citizenship of African Americans.\n\nPlessy v. Ferguson in 1896 is about segregation. Homer Plessy, who was of mixed race, sat in a white-only railway car in Louisiana and was arrested. The Supreme Court upheld the segregation law, establishing the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. While this case accepts that African Americans are citizens after the 14th Amendment, it allows for segregation, which is a different issue from whether they are citizens at all.\n\nBrown v. Board of Education in 1954 overturned Plessy by saying that segregation in schools is unconstitutional, but again, this assumes that African Americans are citizens with equal rights.\n\nSo, comparing these, Dred Scott v. Sanford seems to be the one that directly contradicts Garrison's argument that free colored persons are citizens with all the rights of citizens. In Dred Scott, the court says they aren't citizens and don't have the right to sue in federal court.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
