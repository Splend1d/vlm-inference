                    "text": "Let's think about this problem step by step. We have a sphere starting from rest at the top of a hill that has a constant angle of inclination. The sphere is allowed to roll without slipping down the hill. We need to figure out what force provides the torque that causes the sphere to rotate.\n\nFirst, let's recall that torque is what causes rotation, and it's related to the force applied at a certain distance from the axis of rotation. The formula for torque is \u03c4 = r \u00d7 F, where r is the position vector from the axis to the point where the force is applied, and F is the force vector.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the sphere is rolling down the hill without slipping. That means that the point where the sphere touches the hill is instantaneously at rest relative to the hill. So, there's no slipping, which implies that the static friction is acting here, not kinetic friction.\n\nLet's list out all the forces acting on the sphere:\n\n1. **Gravity (mg)**: Acts downward, where m is the mass of the sphere and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n2. **Normal force (N)**: Acts perpendicular to the surface of the hill.\n\n3. **Frictional force (f)**: Since the sphere is rolling without slipping, this is static friction.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these forces provides the torque that causes the sphere to rotate.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. **Static friction**: This force acts at the point of contact between the sphere and the hill. Since the sphere is rolling without slipping, static friction is present to prevent slipping.\n\nB. **Kinetic friction**: This would be present if there were slipping, but the problem states that the sphere is rolling without slipping, so kinetic friction is not involved.\n\nC. **The normal force of the hill on the sphere**: This force acts perpendicular to the surface of the hill, passing through the center of the sphere. Since it passes through the center, its lever arm is zero, meaning it doesn't create any torque.\n\nD. **Gravity**: Gravity acts downward through the center of mass of the sphere. If we consider the axis of rotation to be through the point of contact, the gravity force doesn't necessarily pass through the axis, so it might create a torque.\n\nWait a minute, but in the case of rolling without slipping, the axis of rotation is better considered to be through the center of the sphere, not the point of contact. Actually, in rolling motion, it's more accurate to think of the sphere rotating about its center, with an additional translation of the center.\n\nLet me correct that. In rolling without slipping, the motion can be thought of as a combination of rotation about the center and translation of the center. However, the instantaneous axis of rotation is at the point of contact with the ground.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider the torque about the center of mass.\n\nLet's choose the center of mass as the axis for calculating torque, which is a common approach.\n\nSo, the net torque about the center of mass is what causes the sphere to rotate about its center.\n\nNow, let's look at the forces again:\n\n1. **Gravity (mg)**: Acts downward through the center of mass. Since it acts through the center, its lever arm is zero, so it doesn't create any torque about the center.\n\n2. **Normal force (N)**: Acts perpendicular to the surface, typically passing through or very close to the center of mass, especially if the hill is inclined but the surface is still perpendicular to the hill. Assuming it passes through the center, its lever arm is zero, so no torque.\n\n3. **Static friction (f)**: Acts at the point of contact, which is a distance equal to the radius (r) away from the center. So, it has a non-zero lever arm.\n\nTherefore, the static friction force is the one providing the torque about the center of mass.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTorque (\u03c4) = r \u00d7 f\n\nSince f is the static friction force and r is the radius vector from the center to the point of contact, this torque is what causes the sphere to rotate.\n\nAdditionally, we can think about the direction of this torque. If the hill is inclined downward, and static friction acts up the hill (opposing the relative motion that would occur if there were slipping), then the torque would be such that it causes the sphere to rotate in a way that the top of the sphere moves downward, which is consistent with rolling down the hill.\n\nAlso, recalling that for rolling without slipping, the linear acceleration (a) and angular acceleration (\u03b1) are related by a = r\u03b1, and the torque is related to the moment of inertia (I) and angular acceleration by \u03c4 = I\u03b1.\n\nGiven that \u03c4 = r f, and \u03c4 = I \u03b1, we can set them equal: r f = I \u03b1.\n\nAnd since a = r \u03b1, we can express f in terms of a: f = I a / r\u00b2.\n\nThis shows that there is a direct relationship between the frictional force and the linear acceleration, which makes sense in the context of rolling motion.\n\nTherefore, the force that provides the torque causing the sphere to rotate is static friction.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Static friction.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are not correct.\n\nB. Kinetic friction: As mentioned earlier, kinetic friction would be present if there were slipping, but the problem states that the sphere is rolling without slipping, so static friction is the relevant frictional force.\n\nC. The normal force: As discussed, the normal force acts perpendicular to the surface and passes through the center, so it doesn't create any torque about the center of mass.\n\nD. Gravity: Gravity acts through the center of mass, so its lever arm is zero about the center, and thus it doesn't create any torque.\n\nTherefore, the only force providing the torque that causes the sphere to rotate is static friction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
