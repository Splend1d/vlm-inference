                    "text": "Let's see. I remember that Pluto was once thought to have no satellites, but I think that's changed over time with better observations. I think the correct answer is D, one large satellite, which is Charon. But I also recall hearing about some smaller satellites discovered later. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, Pluto was discovered in 1930, and its largest moon, Charon, was discovered much later, in 1978. Charon is relatively large compared to Pluto, about half its size, which is why it's often referred to as a \"double dwarf planet\" system.\n\nThen, with more advanced telescopes and space missions, smaller moons were discovered. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope found Nix and Hydra in 2005, and later Kerberos in 2011 and Styx in 2012. So, in total, Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx.\n\nGiven that, option A says \"one medium sized satellite and two small satellites,\" which doesn't match because there are five moons, with Charon being the largest, and the others being smaller.\n\nOption B says \"no satellites,\" which is incorrect since we know Pluto has at least five moons.\n\nOption C says \"one large satellite and three small satellites.\" This is closer, but Pluto actually has one large satellite, Charon, and four smaller ones.\n\nOption D says \"one large satellite,\" which is partially correct but doesn't account for the other smaller satellites.\n\nGiven that the question says \"our current best observations show that Pluto has,\" I think the most accurate answer would be C, \"one large satellite and three small satellites.\" However, I know that there are actually four smaller satellites, not three. Maybe the question is considering Nix and Hydra as the two smaller ones and Kerberos and Styx as even smaller, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering Charon as the large satellite and the other four as small, making it \"one large satellite and three small satellites,\" but that seems off since four is more than three.\n\nWait, maybe the question is outdated, and when it was written, only three smaller moons were known besides Charon. But according to my knowledge, there are four smaller moons besides Charon.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should go with C, \"one large satellite and three small satellites,\" assuming that's the closest option, even though I know there are actually four smaller moons.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering Charon as the large satellite and Nix and Hydra as medium-sized, with Kerberos and Styx as small. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nI think I need to consider what the \"current best observations\" were at the time the question was written. If it was written before the discovery of Kerberos and Styx, then option C might have been correct, but now we know there are four smaller moons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the sizes differently, with Charon as large, Nix and Hydra as medium, and Kerberos and Styx as small.\n\nBut I'm getting too confused. I think the best answer is C, \"one large satellite and three small satellites,\" even though I know that's not entirely accurate now.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
