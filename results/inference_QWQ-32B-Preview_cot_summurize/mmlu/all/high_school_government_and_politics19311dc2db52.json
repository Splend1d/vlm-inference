I remember something about federal judges being appointed for life, but I'm not entirely sure about the details. Let me think this through.\n\nOption A says that federal judges serve four-year terms that coincide with the presidential term. I don't think that's right. I believe federal judges have lifetime appointments, not fixed terms like four years.\n\nOption B says they are appointed for life and can only be removed by impeachment. That sounds familiar. Impeachment is a process to remove public officials for serious misconduct, and I think federal judges can be impeached if they engage in such behavior.\n\nOption C says they are elected by Congress and serve ten-year terms. Wait, I thought federal judges are appointed, not elected. And ten-year terms don't sound right for federal judges.\n\nOption D says they are appointed for life and cannot be removed from office. Hmm, this seems similar to option B, but it doesn't mention impeachment. I think option B is more accurate because while judges are appointed for life, there is a provision for impeachment in case of misconduct.\n\nLet me double-check. The U.S. Constitution provides that federal judges shall hold their offices during good behavior, which effectively means they have lifetime appointments unless they are impeached and removed from office. So, impeachment is a way to remove them from office if they engage in improper conduct.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the correct answer. It acknowledges their lifetime appointments but also mentions the possibility of removal through impeachment.\n\nI should probably look this up to make sure I'm correct. According to Article III of the U.S. Constitution, federal judges are appointed for life, subject to good behavior. This means they serve until they die, retire, or are impeached and removed from office.\n\nImpeachment is a formal process where a legislative body levels charges against a high official of the government. In the U.S., the House of Representatives can impeach a federal judge, and the Senate can convict and remove them from office.\n\nSo, option B is accurate because it mentions that federal judges are appointed for life and can only be removed by impeachment. Option D is too absolute because it doesn't account for the possibility of impeachment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because federal judges do not have fixed terms like the president's four-year terms. Option C is also incorrect because judges are appointed, not elected, and their terms are not limited to ten years.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: They are appointed for life and can only be removed by impeachment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
