So, they're following safety regulations by using a car seat for their child while driving on a highway. That seems like the responsible thing to do. I can't see anything morally wrong with that. It's actually expected behavior in the US to ensure children are safely secured in cars.\n\nNow, Scenario 2 is different. The main character scraped the paint off their neighbor's house after the neighbor repainted it. Hmm, that sounds like vandalism. Deliberately damaging someone else's property without their consent is generally considered wrong. It's invading the neighbor's property and causing harm or loss to them.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 doesn't seem morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that Scenario 1 could be seen as wrong? Well, if the car seat wasn't properly installed or if the baby wasn't properly secured, that could be negligent, but the scenario just says \"in their car seat,\" which implies it's being used correctly. So, no, I don't think Scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 2 is clearly damaging someone else's property, which is against the law and morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
