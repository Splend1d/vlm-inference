                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about dualism in international law. So, dualism is a concept that deals with the relationship between international law and domestic law. Let's look at each option to see which one correctly describes dualism.\n\nOption A says: \"Dualism suggests that international and domestic law are part of a unified legal system.\" Hmm, that sounds more like monism, where international and domestic laws are part of one unified system. Dualism, I think, is different.\n\nOption B: \"Under dualism, international and domestic laws comprise distinct legal systems.\" Okay, this seems plausible. Dualism emphasizes that international law and domestic law are separate entities.\n\nOption C: \"Dualism suggests that international and domestic law are distinct but equal in hierarchy.\" This builds on option B by adding that they are equal in hierarchy. I need to recall if that's accurate.\n\nOption D: \"Dualism suggests that international and domestic law are distinct legal systems whereby domestic law always prevails.\" This introduces a hierarchy where domestic law always takes precedence over international law.\n\nLet me think about this. Dualism is a theory that treats international law and domestic law as two separate legal systems. So, international laws do not automatically become part of domestic law; they need to be translated or incorporated through specific mechanisms, like legislation.\n\nIn dualism, international law and domestic law are indeed distinct, which aligns with option B. But what about their hierarchy? In dualism, it's often the case that domestic law prevails in case of conflict, but I'm not entirely sure if that's always the rule.\n\nOption C says they are distinct but equal in hierarchy. Maybe in some systems, but I think in practice, domestic law often takes precedence.\n\nOption D says domestic law always prevails. Is that accurate for dualism?\n\nI need to recall the key features of dualism. Dualism holds that international law and domestic law are separate legal systems, and international law is not part of the domestic legal system unless it is incorporated through domestic legislation.\n\nSo, under dualism, international law does not automatically become part of domestic law. Therefore, international laws need to be transformed into domestic laws through appropriate domestic procedures.\n\nGiven that, option B seems the most accurate: \"Under dualism, international and domestic laws comprise distinct legal systems.\"\n\nOption C adds that they are equal in hierarchy, but I'm not sure if that's a universal truth in dualism. Perhaps in some countries, domestic law takes precedence, while in others, international law may have supremacy in certain areas.\n\nOption D says domestic law always prevails, but I think that might be going too far. In some dualist systems, international law might have supremacy in certain areas, especially if the country has ratified international treaties that allow for direct application.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing dualism with monism. In monism, international and domestic laws are part of one unified system, and international law can be directly applied by domestic courts. In dualism, international law needs to be incorporated into domestic law through specific measures.\n\nSo, in dualism, the two legal systems are distinct, and international law doesn't automatically form part of domestic law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: \"Under dualism, international and domestic laws comprise distinct legal systems.\"\n\nOptions C and D make additional claims about hierarchy that may not universally hold true in dualist systems.\n\nSo, I think B is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
