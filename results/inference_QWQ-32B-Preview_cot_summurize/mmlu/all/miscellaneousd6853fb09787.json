Nabisco.\n\nHere's a little background: Nabisco, which stands for National Biscuit Company, is an American baking company that was founded in 1898. They are known for producing a variety of cookies and snacks, with Oreo being one of their most famous products. Oreo cookies were first introduced in 1912 and have since become a global icon in the world of snacks.\n\nGeneral Mills, option A, is another large American manufacturer of consumer foods, but they don't make Oreos. Keebler, option C, is a brand owned by Kellogg's and is known for cookies and crackers, but not Oreos. Kraft, option D, is a division of Mondelez International and focuses on processed foods like macaroni and cheese, cheeses, and lunchmeats, among others, but not Oreos.\n\nSo, to summarize, if you're ever asked who makes Oreos, you can confidently say Nabisco!"
