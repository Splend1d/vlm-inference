                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the family life cycle. So, the family life cycle is a concept used in marketing and sociology to understand how families change over time and how these changes affect consumer behavior. The question is asking which statement best describes it.\n\nOption A says it's a way to apply psychographic segmentation. Psychographic segmentation involves dividing consumers based on psychological traits, lifestyles, and values. While the family life cycle can be related to psychographics, it's more specifically about the stages families go through, so this might not be the best fit.\n\nOption B says it refers to the process of family formation and dissolution. That sounds promising because the family life cycle does indeed describe how families form, grow, and eventually dissolve, whether through divorce or the death of members.\n\nOption C mentions that it provides insights into the relationships among age, occupation, income, and housing. While these factors can be related to the family life cycle, they are more demographic variables. The family life cycle is more about the stage the family is in, which can influence these demographics, but it's not solely about their relationships.\n\nOption D states that it's composed of 11 stages of personal growth from infancy to retirement. This seems to be describing more of an individual's life cycle rather than that of a family. Families go through stages like forming, having children, empty nesting, and so on, which are different from personal growth stages.\n\nSo, considering these points, option B seems to be the most accurate description of the family life cycle. It's about the process of family formation and dissolution, encompassing all the stages a family goes through over time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
