                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about chicken feathers and their colors. There's a rooster and a hen, both with gray feathers, and they produce chicks that are gray, black, and white. The numbers are 17 gray, 7 black, and 8 white chicks. I need to figure out the simplest explanation for how these colors are inherited based on the options given.\n\nLet me first make sure I understand what's being asked. Both parents are gray, and their offspring include gray, black, and white chicks. So, there's some kind of genetic interaction going on here that's causing these different phenotypes in the offspring.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The trait for gray is epistatic over the trait for black.\n\nB. The trait for gray is epistatic over the trait for white.\n\nC. The traits for black and white color demonstrate incomplete dominance.\n\nD. The traits for black and white color demonstrate codominance.\n\nI need to think about what these terms mean and see which one best fits the observed offspring ratios.\n\nFirst, let's recall what epistasis is. Epistasis is when one gene masks or affects the expression of another gene. So, if gray is epistatic over black or white, that means that the presence of the gray trait prevents the expression of black or white.\n\nIncomplete dominance is when the heterozygote expresses a blend of the two parents' traits. For example, if black and white are the parents, the offspring might be gray as a blend.\n\nCodominance is when both parents' traits are expressed separately in the offspring. For example, both black and white spots on the same chicken.\n\nGiven that, let's analyze the options.\n\nOption A says gray is epistatic over black. That would mean that whenever gray is present, black is masked. So, if both parents are gray, and they produce black chicks, that would suggest that the gray trait isn't completely dominant or epistatic over black, because some black chicks are still showing up.\n\nWait, but in epistasis, it's possible for the epistatic trait to be incomplete or have varying degrees, but typically, epistasis involves one gene controlling the expression of another.\n\nOption B says gray is epistatic over white. Similar to option A, if gray is epistatic over white, then white should be masked whenever gray is present. But again, white chicks are appearing in the offspring, so that seems contradictory.\n\nOption C says black and white show incomplete dominance, resulting in gray. That makes sense because gray could be a blend of black and white. If both parents are gray (heterozygous for black and white), then their offspring could show a ratio where some are black, some are white, and some are gray, depending on the genotypes.\n\nOption D says black and white show codominance. That would mean that both traits are expressed together, but in the context of feather color, that might look different. Maybe spotted or something, but the problem mentions gray, black, and white chicks, not a combination of colors.\n\nGiven that, option C seems plausible. If black and white exhibit incomplete dominance, their hybrids would be gray.\n\nNow, looking at the numbers: 17 gray, 7 black, and 8 white chicks. That's a total of 32 chicks. If we consider a 1:1:1 ratio, that would be approximately 10.67 of each, but we have 17 gray, which is more than expected.\n\nWait, maybe it's a 9:3:3:1 ratio somehow, but that's for two genes with independent assortment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two genes involved, one for black and one for white, and gray is the intermediate phenotype.\n\nLet me consider that. Suppose there are two genes, A and B. Let's say A is for black and B is for white. If both are present, the chick is gray.\n\nBut that might be complicating it. The problem is asking for the simplest explanation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's one gene with three alleles: black, white, and gray, with gray being intermediate.\n\nBut then, if both parents are gray, and they produce black and white offspring, that suggests that gray is heterozygous for black and white.\n\nThat aligns with incomplete dominance, where the heterozygote has an intermediate phenotype.\n\nSo, in that case, if both parents are gray (heterozygous for black and white), then the expected ratio would be 1 black: 2 gray: 1 white, which is a 1:2:1 ratio.\n\nLooking back at the numbers: 17 gray, 7 black, and 8 white. That's close to a 2:1:1 ratio, but not exactly.\n\nWait, 17 gray, 7 black, and 8 white. Let's see:\n\n17:7:8 simplifies to approximately 2.14:0.87:0.87, which is roughly 2:1:1.\n\nNot perfect, but in biological experiments, there can be variations due to small sample sizes or other factors.\n\nSo, option C seems plausible.\n\nOption D, codominance, would perhaps result in a different phenotype, not necessarily gray, black, and white, but possibly a combination like black and white together.\n\nBut the problem states distinct colors, so maybe not.\n\nOption A and B, epistasis, seem less likely because epistasis typically involves one trait masking another, but here, all three phenotypes are appearing.\n\nWait, maybe epistasis is still possible if there are interacting genes.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose there are two genes involved: one that determines if the color is expressed (say, gene E for expression), and another that determines the color (gene C for color).\n\nIf gene E is dominant (E) , the color is expressed, and if it's recessive (e), the feathers are white.\n\nGene C could have alleles for black (C) and gray (c), with C being dominant over c.\n\nSo, if a chicken has EE or Ee, and CC, it's black; if it's Cc, it's gray; if it's cc, it's gray; and if it's ee, it's white.\n\nWait, that might be too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe gene E controls whether the feathers are colored or white, and gene C controls the color itself.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that the parents are both gray and produce black, gray, and white offspring, the simplest explanation is incomplete dominance between black and white, with gray being the intermediate phenotype.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
