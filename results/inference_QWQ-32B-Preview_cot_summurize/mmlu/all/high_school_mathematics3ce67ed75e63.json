                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that when three standard dice are tossed, we get numbers a, b, and c, and we need to find the probability that their product, a times b times c, equals 180. The options are fractions: 1/30, 1/72, 1/71, and 1/70.\n\nFirst off, I know that a standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. So each of a, b, and c can be any of those numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when tossing three dice is 6 multiplied by itself three times, which is 6^3 = 216.\n\nNow, I need to find out in how many of these 216 outcomes the product a*b*c equals 180.\n\nSo, the probability will be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is the number of times a*b*c = 180 divided by 216.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 180 to understand what combinations of a, b, and c can give us that product.\n\n180 can be factored into primes as follows:\n\n180 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^1\n\nNow, since a, b, and c are each between 1 and 6, let's see the prime factors of each possible number on a die:\n\n1: 1 (no prime factors)\n\n2: 2\n\n3: 3\n\n4: 2^2\n\n5: 5\n\n6: 2 * 3\n\nSo, each of a, b, and c can contribute certain prime factors to the product.\n\nWe need the combined prime factors of a, b, and c to be 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^1.\n\nLet's see how we can distribute these prime factors among a, b, and c.\n\nFirst, the factor of 5 must come from one of the dice, since only the number 5 on a die has the prime factor of 5.\n\nSo, one of the dice must show a 5.\n\nNow, the remaining two dice must provide the factors 2^2 and 3^2.\n\nLet's consider the possible combinations for a, b, and c.\n\nCase 1: One die shows 5, and the other two show numbers that multiply to 36 (since 5*36=180).\n\nBut 36 = 2^2 * 3^2.\n\nNow, looking at the possible numbers on a die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nWe need two numbers whose product is 36.\n\nLet's see which pairs of numbers from 1 to 6 multiply to 36.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- 6 and 6: 6*6=36\n\n- 4 and 9, but 9 is not on a die.\n\n- 3 and 12, but 12 is not on a die.\n\n- 2 and 18, not on die.\n\n- 1 and 36, not on die.\n\nSo, the only possible pair is 6 and 6.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the other two dice must both show 6.\n\nSo, one die shows 5, and the other two show 6.\n\nNow, how many ways can this happen?\n\nThere are three dice, and any one of them can show the 5, while the other two show 6.\n\nSo, there are 3 such outcomes.\n\nWait, but let's confirm if there are other possible combinations.\n\nWait a second, is there another way to get a product of 180 with three numbers, each between 1 and 6?\n\nLet me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different combination where one die shows a 5, and the other two show numbers whose product is 36, but as we saw, only 6 and 6 satisfy that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way where the factors are distributed differently.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet's consider that a, b, and c are each one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nWe need a*b*c = 180.\n\nLet's list out all possible triplets (a,b,c) where a, b, c are between 1 and 6, and their product is 180.\n\nStarting with a=1:\n\n1*b*c=180 \u21d2 b*c=180\n\nBut the maximum b*c can be is 6*6=36, which is less than 180.\n\nSo a cannot be 1.\n\na=2:\n\n2*b*c=180 \u21d2 b*c=90\n\nAgain, 6*6=36 < 90.\n\nSo a cannot be 2.\n\na=3:\n\n3*b*c=180 \u21d2 b*c=60\n\nPossible pairs for b and c:\n\nLet's see:\n\n- 5*12, but 12 is not on die.\n\n- 6*10, 10 not on die.\n\n- 4*15, 15 not on die.\n\n- 3*20, no.\n\n- 2*30, no.\n\n- 1*60, no.\n\nSo no solutions here.\n\na=4:\n\n4*b*c=180 \u21d2 b*c=45\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- 5*9, 9 not on die.\n\n- 3*15, 15 not on die.\n\n- etc.\n\nNo solutions here.\n\na=5:\n\n5*b*c=180 \u21d2 b*c=36\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- 6*6, yes.\n\n- 4*9, 9 not on die.\n\n- etc.\n\nSo only b=6 and c=6.\n\nSimilarly, a=6:\n\n6*b*c=180 \u21d2 b*c=30\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- 5*6, yes.\n\n- 6*5, yes.\n\n- 3*10, 10 not on die.\n\n- etc.\n\nSo b=5 and c=6, or b=6 and c=5.\n\nTherefore, in addition to the earlier case where one die shows 5 and the other two show 6, there are also cases where one die shows 6, another shows 5, and the third shows 6.\n\nWait, hold on.\n\nLet me list all possible triplets:\n\n1. (5,6,6)\n\n2. (6,5,6)\n\n3. (6,6,5)\n\n4. (5,6,6)\n\nWait, isn't that the same as the first one?\n\nWait, no, they are permutations.\n\nSo, are there more?\n\nWait, from a=5, b=6, c=6\n\nFrom a=6, b=5, c=6\n\nFrom a=6, b=6, c=5\n\nThat's three distinct ordered triplets.\n\nIs there any other combination?\n\nWait, let's check a=5, b=6, c=6\n\na=6, b=5, c=6\n\na=6, b=6, c=5\n\nIs there a way to have a=5, b=5, c=?\n\nWait, 5*5*c=180 \u21d2 25*c=180 \u21d2 c=7.2, which is not an integer, so not possible.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations would not work.\n\nSo, only these three ordered triplets satisfy a*b*c=180.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 6^3=216.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 3/216 = 1/72.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1/72.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1/30\n\nB. 1/72\n\nC. 1/71\n\nD. 1/70\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. 1/72.\n\nBut wait a second, let me double-check.\n\nIs there any other possible triplet that I might have missed?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWe have a*b*c=180\n\nLet me list all possible triplets:\n\n- (5,6,6)\n\n- (6,5,6)\n\n- (6,6,5)\n\nAre there any others?\n\nLet me see, is there a way to get 180 with different numbers?\n\nWait, 180 divided by 5 is 36, so 5*6*6=180\n\n180 divided by 6 is 30, so 6*5*6=180, and 6*6*5=180\n\nIs there a way to get 180 with 4 in the mix?\n\nLet's try a=4:\n\n4*b*c=180 \u21d2 b*c=45\n\nPossible b and c: 5 and 9, but 9 is not on die.\n\nOr 3 and 15, 15 not on die.\n\nOr 1 and 45, 45 not on die.\n\nSo no solutions here.\n\na=3:\n\n3*b*c=180 \u21d2 b*c=60\n\nPossible b and c: 5 and 12, but 12 not on die.\n\nOr 4 and 15, 15 not on die.\n\nNo solutions.\n\na=2:\n\n2*b*c=180 \u21d2 b*c=90\n\nOnly 90 is beyond the reach of two dice, maximum is 6*6=36.\n\na=1:\n\n1*b*c=180 \u21d2 b*c=180\n\nAgain, 6*6=36 < 180.\n\nSo, indeed, only the three triplets where one die shows 5 and the other two show 6.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 3/216 = 1/72.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 1/72.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{72}} \\]"
