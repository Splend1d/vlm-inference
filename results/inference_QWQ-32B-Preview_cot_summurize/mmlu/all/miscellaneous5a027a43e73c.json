I don't watch a lot of TV, so I'm not sure about this one. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that 'House of Style' is a fashion and lifestyle show. So, it probably airs on a network that has other shows related to fashion or entertainment. Let's consider each option:\n\nA. E - I think E is a network, but I'm not sure what kind of shows they have. Maybe it's more geared towards educational or informational programming.\n\nB. WB - WB stands for the Warner Bros. network, right? I think they have drama series and some comedies, but I'm not sure if they have a fashion show.\n\nC. MTV - MTV is known for music videos and reality shows. They used to have a lot of pop culture content, including fashion-related shows. Maybe 'House of Style' is on MTV.\n\nD. Home Shopping Network - That's where they sell products directly to consumers. It seems unlikely that a fashion show would air there, although they might have some fashion content.\n\nHmm, between these options, MTV seems the most likely. I recall that MTV had shows like \"The Hills\" and \"16 and Pregnant,\" which were reality shows, but they also had fashion content. Maybe 'House of Style' is one of their shows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's on E! Because E! has entertainment news and shows like \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" which sometimes involve fashion. But I think E! is more focused on celebrity news and gossip.\n\nWB seems less likely because they might have more dramatic shows, like \"Smallville\" or \"Supernatural,\" which aren't related to fashion.\n\nAnd the Home Shopping Network is probably not the right fit unless 'House of Style' is a show that promotes fashion products for sale.\n\nLet me try to recall if I've heard of 'House of Style' before. I think it was a show hosted by Carson Kressley, who was also on \"Queer Eye.\" Yes, that sounds familiar. Carson Kressley is known for his work on \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,\" which was on Bravo.\n\nWait a minute, if Carson Kressley hosted 'House of Style,' and he was on Bravo, maybe 'House of Style' is on Bravo as well. But Bravo isn't one of the options here. So perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them are Bravo, so maybe 'House of Style' was on a different network.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it was on Lifetime or something like that. But again, Lifetime isn't an option here.\n\nGiven the choices, I'm going to guess that 'House of Style' airs on MTV. It seems the most plausible option based on the network's history of featuring fashion and entertainment content.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
