In a decimal number, the place values increase from right to left, so the MSD is the leftmost digit.\n\nLet's consider an example to understand this better. Take the number 54321.\n\n- The digit on the far left is 5, which is in the ten-thousands place.\n\n- The next digit is 4, which is in the thousands place.\n\n- Then comes 3 in the hundreds place.\n\n- Followed by 2 in the tens place.\n\n- Finally, 1 in the ones place.\n\nHere, the digit with the highest place value is 5, which is the MSD.\n\nSo, in the decimal number system, the MSD is the first digit from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. First digit from left to right\n\nTo further clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. First digit from right to left: This would be the least significant digit (LSD), which has the lowest place value.\n\nC. Middle digit: This would only be correct if the number has an odd number of digits, but it's not a general rule for MSD.\n\nD. Mean of all digits: This is not related to the concept of MSD, which is about place value, not the average of the digits.\n\nMSD is an important concept in understanding the value and representation of numbers in any positional numeral system, including the decimal system we use daily.\n\n"
