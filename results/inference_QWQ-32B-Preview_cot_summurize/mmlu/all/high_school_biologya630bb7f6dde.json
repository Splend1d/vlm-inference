                    "text": "Let's see. So, we have hydrangea flowers that have one gene for flower color, and depending on the soil type, the flowers can range from blue to pink. All the plants are the same genetically, but their flower colors vary based on the soil. I need to pick the statement that best explains this phenomenon.\n\nOption A says that the alleles show incomplete dominance, where neither trait is dominant, and there's a blending of traits. Hmm, incomplete dominance is when you have, say, red and white flowers, and the heterozygote is pink. But in this case, it's not about the blending of different alleles; it's about how the environment affects the expression of the same gene.\n\nOption B talks about codominance, where both traits show depending on the environment. Codominance is when both alleles are expressed separately, like in a person who has both A and B blood types, resulting in AB blood type. But here, it's not about both traits showing; it's about the environment influencing the expression of the same trait.\n\nOption C says that the environment alters the expression of a trait. That sounds promising because it directly mentions that the soil type affects the flower color, even though the plants have the same genetic makeup.\n\nOption D mentions polygenic inheritance, which is when multiple genes contribute to a single trait, like human height or skin color. But in this case, it's specified that there's only one gene for flower color, so polygenic inheritance doesn't apply here.\n\nGiven these explanations, it seems like option C is the best choice because it acknowledges that the environment (soil type) is influencing the expression of the flower color trait, even though the genetic makeup remains the same.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
