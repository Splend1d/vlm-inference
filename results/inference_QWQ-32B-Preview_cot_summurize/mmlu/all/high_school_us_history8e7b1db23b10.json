                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the Progressive Party and their stance on the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913. First, I need to understand what the Progressive Party was all about and what their goals were, especially in terms of economic policies.\n\nFrom the platform statement provided, it seems like the Progressive Party was all about promoting the idea of a government that truly represents the people, ensuring equal opportunity and industrial justice. They believed in the power of the people to shape the constitution and the country according to the general welfare, not just for the benefit of a few.\n\nNow, the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was a piece of legislation passed in 1913 during Woodrow Wilson's presidency. I recall that this tariff reduced the overall tax rates on imported goods, which was a shift from the higher tariffs that were in place at the time. So, it was about lowering duties on imports.\n\nGiven that the Progressive Party was focused on promoting the general welfare and potentially reforming economic practices, I need to think about how they would view a reduction in tariffs.\n\nOption A suggests that they would endorse the tariff because they were supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"Square Deal.\" I know that Roosevelt's Square Deal was about ensuring fairness in business and protecting consumers, but I'm not sure if that directly translates to supporting lower tariffs. Maybe I need to look deeper into what the Square Deal entailed.\n\nOption B says that they would endorse it because most Democrats advocated lower duties. Well, Woodrow Wilson was a Democrat, and the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was a Democratic policy. But the Progressive Party was distinct from the Democrats, even if there might have been some overlaps in ideology. So, I'm not sure if that's the right reason.\n\nOption C claims they wouldn't endorse it because they were supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism.\" New Nationalism was Roosevelt's vision for reforming the economy and government, emphasizing the power of the federal government to regulate big business and promote social welfare. Again, I need to see how this relates to tariffs.\n\nOption D says they wouldn't endorse it because they were opponents of Woodrow Wilson. While it's possible that some Progressives might have opposed Wilson, I don't think that's the primary reason for their stance on the tariff. It's more about their principles and policies.\n\nLet me try to connect the dots. The Progressive Party was all about addressing national problems through a sense of justice and ensuring that the government works for the people. They believed in using the government's power to establish equal opportunity and industrial justice.\n\nNow, regarding tariffs, higher tariffs can protect domestic industries from foreign competition, which might benefit certain sectors of the economy but could also lead to higher prices for consumers. Lower tariffs, on the other hand, can make imported goods cheaper, which might benefit consumers but could also harm domestic industries that can't compete with cheaper imports.\n\nGiven that Progressives were concerned with the general welfare and equal opportunity, they might have supported lower tariffs if they believed it would benefit the overall economy and consumers. However, they might also have been concerned about protecting certain domestic industries or workers.\n\nI need to consider the context of the time. In the early 20th century, there was a lot of debate about tariffs and their impact on the economy. The Progressive movement was partly a response to the problems caused by industrialization and economic inequalities.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt's New Nationalism called for stronger federal regulation of business to prevent monopolies and ensure fair competition. It also emphasized the need for social welfare programs.\n\nGiven that, it seems like Roosevelt's New Nationalism was more about regulating big business and promoting social welfare, rather than specifically about tariffs. However, it's possible that Progressives who supported New Nationalism might have had certain views on tariffs based on their overall economic philosophy.\n\nOn the other hand, the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was associated with the Democrats and Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom agenda, which focused on reducing tariffs, breaking up trusts, and promoting free trade.\n\nSo, if Progressives were more aligned with Roosevelt's New Nationalism, which seemed to emphasize stronger government regulation, they might have had mixed feelings about lowering tariffs. Some might have seen lower tariffs as a way to promote competition and reduce the power of monopolies, while others might have been concerned about the impact on domestic industries and workers.\n\nHowever, looking back at the platform statement, it says that the people should utilize their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice. It also mentions that the country belongs to the people and its resources should be used to promote the general interest.\n\nGiven that, it seems like Progressives would support policies that benefit the general welfare and promote equality. If lower tariffs achieve that by making goods cheaper for consumers, they might support it. But if it harms certain sectors of the economy or leads to job losses, they might oppose it.\n\nI think the key here is to understand the Progressive mindset: they were reformers who wanted to address the injustices of their time and make the system work better for everyone, not just the wealthy elite.\n\nConsidering that, I think they would generally endorse the Underwood-Simmons Tariff if they believed it would benefit the general welfare and promote equal opportunity. Since the tariff reduction was part of Wilson's New Freedom agenda, which aimed to restore competition and reduce the power of trusts, it aligns somewhat with Progressive goals.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A: Yes, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"Square Deal.\" Although Square Deal and New Nationalism are related, I think the Progressive Party, being more aligned with Roosevelt's ideas, would support policies that promote fairness and competition, which lower tariffs might achieve.\n\nBut wait, option A mentions \"Square Deal,\" while option C mentions \"New Nationalism.\" I need to be careful here. Roosevelt's Square Deal was his earlier platform, and New Nationalism was his later, more evolved set of ideas. The Progressive Party was formed after Roosevelt's attempt to run for president in 1912 under the Bull Moose Party, which was an extension of his New Nationalism ideas.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is more accurate, that they wouldn't endorse the tariff because they were supporters of New Nationalism, which might have different economic policies than the Democratic New Freedom agenda.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should look at it differently.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the Progressive Party was a third party formed as a response to the existing Democratic and Republican parties. If the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was a Democratic policy, and Progressives were a separate entity, they might not necessarily endorse it, especially if they had their own platform and policies.\n\nHowever, if the tariff reduction aligned with their goals of promoting general welfare and equal opportunity, they might support it regardless of which party proposed it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Progressives were more concerned with issues like trust-busting, conservation, and social welfare, and the tariff issue was secondary. In that case, their endorsement of the tariff might not be a given.\n\nLooking back at the platform statement, it emphasizes the need to maintain a government that works for the people and to use sovereign powers to establish equal opportunity and industrial justice. It doesn't specifically mention tariffs, so I need to infer their stance based on general principles.\n\nI think that Progressives would support any policy that promotes the general welfare and equal opportunity, regardless of party affiliation. If the Underwood-Simmons Tariff achieved that by making goods cheaper for consumers and promoting competition, they might endorse it.\n\nTherefore, option A seems plausible: Yes, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"Square Deal,\" which was about fairness and regulation.\n\nAlternatively, option B also suggests yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties. But since Progressives were not Democrats, I'm not sure if that's the right reason.\n\nOption C says no, because they were supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism.\" But as I thought earlier, New Nationalism was about stronger federal regulation and social welfare, which might or might not align with lower tariffs.\n\nOption D says no, because they were largely opponents of Woodrow Wilson. While it's possible that Progressives might have opposed Wilson, especially since Roosevelt ran against him in 1912, I don't think opposition to Wilson would solely determine their stance on the tariff.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is A: Yes, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"Square Deal.\" This implies that they valued fairness and regulation, which might align with supporting a tariff reduction if it promotes competition and benefits consumers.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the Progressive Party would generally endorse the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 because it aligns with their goals of promoting equal opportunity and industrial justice, in line with Teddy Roosevelt's Square Deal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
