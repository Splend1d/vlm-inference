                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand the Engle-Granger test and what its null hypothesis means when applied to the residuals of a cointegrating regression. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, cointegration is about checking if two or more non-stationary time series have a stationary linear combination, meaning they move together in the long run. So, if variables are cointegrated, it suggests there's a long-term equilibrium relationship between them.\n\nNow, the Engle-Granger test is a way to test for cointegration between two variables. It involves estimating a regression between the variables to get the residuals and then testing those residuals for stationarity.\n\nSo, in this case, we're applying the Engle-Granger test to the residuals from a potentially cointegrating regression. The null hypothesis in this context would be related to whether these residuals are stationary or not.\n\nLet me think about this. If the residuals are stationary, that would mean the linear combination of the variables is stationary, which is the definition of cointegration. So, if the null hypothesis is that the residuals are non-stationary, then rejecting the null would imply that the residuals are stationary, meaning the variables are cointegrated.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful here. Sometimes null hypotheses are stated differently in various tests. So, I should double-check what exactly the null hypothesis is in the Engle-Granger test.\n\nI recall that in the Engle-Granger test, the null hypothesis is that there is no cointegration among the variables, meaning the residuals are non-stationary. So, if we fail to reject the null, it means the variables are not cointegrated.\n\nAlternatively, if we reject the null, it suggests that the residuals are stationary, and hence the variables are cointegrated.\n\nSo, in this case, the null hypothesis would be that the variables are not cointegrated.\n\nBut let me make sure about this. Maybe I should look back at some notes or a textbook to confirm.\n\nOkay, according to my econometrics textbook, the Engle-Granger two-step method involves:\n\n1. Estimating the cointegrating regression to obtain residuals.\n\n2. Testing the residuals for unit roots using a unit root test like ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller).\n\nIn the second step, the null hypothesis of the ADF test is that the residuals have a unit root, meaning they are non-stationary. Therefore, the null hypothesis in the Engle-Granger test is that there is no cointegration.\n\nSo, to rephrase, in the Engle-Granger test:\n\n- Null hypothesis (H0): The variables are not cointegrated (residuals are non-stationary).\n\n- Alternative hypothesis (H1): The variables are cointegrated (residuals are stationary).\n\nTherefore, if we reject the null, we conclude that the variables are cointegrated.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it asks for the interpretation of the null hypothesis when the Engle-Granger test is applied to the residuals of a potentially cointegrating regression.\n\nGiven that, the null hypothesis is that the variables are not cointegrated.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be:\n\nB. The variables are not cointegrated.\n\nWait, but let's check if there are any other interpretations or possible answers that might be tricky.\n\nOption A says \"The variables are cointegrated.\" But according to what I've just recalled, that would be the alternative hypothesis, not the null.\n\nOption C says \"Both variables are stationary.\" Stationarity of the variables themselves is different from cointegration, which deals with non-stationary variables that have a stationary linear combination.\n\nOption D says \"Both variables are non-stationary.\" Well, in cointegration, it's possible for both variables to be non-stationary, but their linear combination is stationary. So, the null hypothesis isn't directly about the stationarity of the variables themselves but about the stationarity of their linear combination.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation of the null hypothesis in the Engle-Granger test is that the variables are not cointegrated.\n\nSo, the answer should be B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any conditions or nuances I'm missing.\n\nFor instance, the Engle-Granger test assumes that there is only one cointegrating relationship between two variables. If there are more than two variables, things get more complicated, but in this case, we're dealing with two variables.\n\nAlso, the test relies on the residuals from the cointegrating regression being I(0), meaning stationary.\n\nSo, in summary, the null hypothesis is no cointegration, which corresponds to the residuals being non-stationary.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: The variables are not cointegrated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
