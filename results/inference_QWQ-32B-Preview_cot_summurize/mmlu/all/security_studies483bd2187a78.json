Hmm, this seems a bit tricky because globalization is a complex concept, and all these options touch on different aspects of it. Let me read each one carefully.\n\nOption A says that globalization is about shared hegemonic values creating an ideological community, mostly based on capitalist economics. Now, hegemony usually refers to the dominance of one group or nation over others, so this seems to suggest that globalization is driven by the spread of dominant ideas, particularly capitalist ones. That does ring true to some extent, as many argue that globalization has been driven by the spread of capitalist economic practices and ideologies. But is this the fullest picture?\n\nOption B describes globalization as the intensification of worldwide social relations and increasing interdependence, resulting from the compression of space and time through new technologies. This sounds a lot like how we often think of globalization\u2014people and places becoming more connected due to advances in technology, making the world feel smaller. This seems comprehensive, as it includes social relations and interdependence, not just economic factors.\n\nOption C says globalization is the 'shrinking' of the global community, drawing people closer, primarily at economic and technical levels, starting in the early 20th century from western Europe. This also mentions ideological expeditions originating from western Europe. So, it's similar to option A in highlighting the role of western Europe and ideological spread but specifies the early 20th century as the starting point. But I thought globalization has been a process spanning centuries, maybe even starting with colonialism.\n\nOption D places the origin of globalization in the 1980s, originating in Western Europe as a center of political power and technological advancement, facilitated by advances in communications and travel. This seems to pinpoint a specific time period, which might not fully capture the broader historical perspective of globalization.\n\nHmm, considering these options, I think option B provides the most accurate and comprehensive description of globalization. It acknowledges the intensification of worldwide social relations and interdependence, which encompasses not just economic aspects but also social and cultural exchanges. Additionally, it attributes this phenomenon to advancements in technology that have compressed space and time, making connections across the globe faster and more frequent.\n\nOption A is somewhat narrow, focusing mainly on the spread of hegemonic values and capitalism, which is indeed a part of globalization, but perhaps not the entirety of it. Option C limits the starting point to the early 20th century, whereas many scholars argue that globalization has deeper historical roots. Option D's timeframe is even narrower, starting in the 1980s, which might correspond to the era of neoliberal globalization but doesn't account for earlier global connections.\n\nTherefore, I believe option B is the best description of our understanding of globalization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
