                    "text": "So I need to find the greatest common factor of 36 and 90. The options are 6, 18, 36, and 180. I think the greatest common factor is the largest number that divides both 36 and 90 without leaving a remainder. Let me check each option.\n\nFirst, 6. Does 6 divide both 36 and 90? Well, 36 divided by 6 is 6, and 90 divided by 6 is 15. Both are whole numbers, so yes, 6 is a common factor. But is it the greatest one? Let's check the next option.\n\nNext is 18. Does 18 divide 36 and 90? 36 divided by 18 is 2, and 90 divided by 18 is 5. Both are whole numbers, so 18 is also a common factor. It's larger than 6, so it's a better candidate for the greatest common factor.\n\nNow, 36. Does 36 divide both 36 and 90? 36 divided by 36 is 1, which is fine, but 90 divided by 36 is 2.5, which is not a whole number. So, 36 doesn't divide 90 evenly. Therefore, 36 is not a common factor of both numbers.\n\nLastly, 180. Does 180 divide 36 and 90? 36 divided by 180 is 0.2, and 90 divided by 180 is 0.5, neither of which are whole numbers. So, 180 is not a common factor.\n\nBased on this, the greatest common factor should be 18. But wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a larger common factor that's not in the options. Let's try to find all the factors of both numbers.\n\nFactors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.\n\nFactors of 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90.\n\nNow, the common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.\n\nAmong these, the greatest is 18. So, the answer should be 18.\n\nBut the question says \"greatest common factor\" and one of the options is 18, so that should be correct. However, I recall that sometimes people talk about the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is the same as the greatest common factor (GCF). Maybe there's a confusion there.\n\nWait a minute, in the options, B is 18 and D is 180. But 180 is larger than 18, but as I saw, 180 doesn't divide both numbers. So, it can't be the greatest common factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use prime factorization to find the GCF.\n\nLet's factorize both numbers into primes.\n\n36 can be factored as 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3, or 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2.\n\n90 can be factored as 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5, or 2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5.\n\nNow, the GCF is the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors.\n\nCommon prime factors are 2 and 3.\n\nThe lowest power of 2 in both factorizations is 2\u00b9.\n\nThe lowest power of 3 in both is 3\u00b2.\n\nSo, GCF = 2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18.\n\nAgain, this confirms that 18 is the greatest common factor.\n\nI think the answer is indeed 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
