                    "text": "Organizations retain outside public relations counsel for several reasons, and among the options you've provided, A, B, and D are major reasons. Let's break down each option to understand why:\n\nA. They offer flexibility of talents and skills.\n\nThis is a significant reason. External PR agencies often have a pool of specialists with diverse skills and experiences. They can bring in experts who are specifically suited to handle particular aspects of a campaign or crisis, offering flexibility that in-house teams might lack due to limited resources or expertise.\n\nB. They bring greater credibility to the work.\n\nWhile this can be a factor, it's not universally true. The credibility of external PR counsel depends on their reputation and track record. Some organizations might perceive external agencies as more credible because they are seen as objective third parties, but this isn't always the case. In some instances, in-house teams might be viewed as more credible because they have intimate knowledge of the organization's culture and goals.\n\nC. They will provide sound ROI on the project or program.\n\nThis is a common expectation, but it's not necessarily a guaranteed reason for retaining external PR counsel. While good agencies should be able to demonstrate their value and ROI, the actual return depends on various factors, including the agency's performance, the clarity of objectives, and the alignment between the agency and the organization's goals. Therefore, this is more of an expectation rather than a guaranteed reason for retention.\n\nD. They can provide more attention and detail to a project that in-house staff.\n\nThis is another important reason. External agencies often have the capacity to dedicate more time and resources to specific projects because they can allocate their workforce accordingly. In-house teams might be spread thin across multiple ongoing tasks and may not have the bandwidth to give detailed attention to every project. External agencies can step in to provide the necessary focus and detail required for particular initiatives.\n\nIn summary, organizations retain outside PR counsel primarily for the flexibility of talents and skills they offer (A) and the ability to provide more attention and detail to projects (D). The credibility they bring (B) can be a factor but is not universally applicable, and while providing sound ROI (C) is an expectation, it's not a guaranteed reason for retention.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A, D} \\]"
