                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about unpolarized light passing through two ideal linear polarizers, and the angle between their transmission axes is 45 degrees. I need to find out what percentage of the incident intensity is transmitted through both polarizers. The options are 100%, 75%, 50%, or 25%.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how polarizers work with unpolarized light. Unpolarized light means that the light waves have electric fields oscillating in all directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation, and there's no preferred direction.\n\nWhen unpolarized light hits the first polarizer, it reduces the intensity by half because the polarizer blocks all components of the electric field except those aligned with its transmission axis. So, if the incident intensity is I\u2080, after the first polarizer, the intensity is I\u2081 = I\u2080 / 2.\n\nNow, the light that passes through the first polarizer is polarized along the transmission axis of that polarizer. When this polarized light hits the second polarizer, which has its transmission axis at 45 degrees to the first one, some of it will be blocked depending on the angle between the two axes.\n\nMalus's law tells us that the intensity after the second polarizer is I\u2082 = I\u2081 * cos\u00b2\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers.\n\nIn this case, \u03b8 is 45 degrees, so I\u2082 = (I\u2080 / 2) * cos\u00b2(45\u00b0).\n\nI know that cos(45\u00b0) is \u221a2 / 2, so cos\u00b2(45\u00b0) is (\u221a2 / 2)\u00b2 = (2 / 4) = 0.5.\n\nTherefore, I\u2082 = (I\u2080 / 2) * 0.5 = I\u2080 / 4.\n\nSo, the transmitted intensity through both polarizers is I\u2080 / 4, which is 25% of the incident intensity.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Unpolarized light becomes polarized after the first polarizer, and then Malus's law applies to that polarized light as it passes through the second polarizer.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 25%, which is option D.\n\nHowever, I recall that there's a concept called the polarization identity or something similar, but I think I've applied the correct principles here.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using Jones calculus or something more advanced, but for this level, Malus's law should suffice.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that for two polarizers at 90 degrees, no light is transmitted, which makes sense because cos\u00b2(90\u00b0) = 0. And at 0 degrees, all the polarized light passes through, so cos\u00b2(0\u00b0) = 1.\n\nAt 45 degrees, cos\u00b2(45\u00b0) = 0.5, but since the first polarizer already reduces the intensity by half, the total transmission is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, or 25%.\n\nSo, I think 25% is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about what happens if there were more polarizers or different angles. But in this case, it's just two polarizers at 45 degrees.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that for unpolarized light passing through two polarizers, the average transmitted intensity is I\u2080 * (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/2, but in this case, since the first polarizer already polarizes the light, then Malus's law applies directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the exact formula for unpolarized light through two polarizers.\n\nUpon looking it up, I find that for unpolarized light incident on two polarizers with an angle \u03b8 between their transmission axes, the transmitted intensity is I = (I\u2080 / 2) * cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nYes, that matches what I had earlier. So, for \u03b8 = 45\u00b0, I = (I\u2080 / 2) * (0.5) = I\u2080 / 4, which is 25%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\%} \\]"
