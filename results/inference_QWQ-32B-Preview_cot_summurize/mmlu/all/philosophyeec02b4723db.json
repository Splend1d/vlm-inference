                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Anscombe's view on \"moral obligation.\" The options are:\n\nA. the norms of a society.\n\nB. the feelings of an individual.\n\nC. the commands of God.\n\nD. no real concept at all.\n\nI remember that Anscombe was a philosopher who wrote about ethics, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I think she had some criticisms of how people talk about moral obligation.\n\nLet me think about this. Anscombe, in her essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" argues that the concept of moral obligation is often used without a proper foundation. She suggests that the idea of moral obligation comes from a religious framework, particularly the idea that moral laws are God's commands.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, she might be saying that \"moral obligation\" doesn't make sense in a non-religious context because without God's commands, there's no one issuing obligations in the same way.\n\nOption C mentions \"the commands of God,\" which seems relevant, but Anscombe might be critiquing that very idea. She may be arguing that in a secular society, talking about moral obligations without a divine lawgiver is problematic.\n\nOption A, \"the norms of a society,\" sounds like it could be a substitute for moral obligation in a secular context. Maybe people think that moral obligations are just social norms, but I don't recall Anscombe specifically linking moral obligation to social norms.\n\nOption B, \"the feelings of an individual,\" seems more related to ethical subjectivism, where morality is based on personal feelings. Again, I don't think Anscombe directly equates moral obligation with individual feelings.\n\nOption D, \"no real concept at all,\" might be close to what Anscombe is suggesting. She may be arguing that moral obligation is a confused concept without a coherent meaning in contemporary philosophy.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about what Anscombe thinks \"moral obligation\" currently signifies, not necessarily what she thinks about it. So maybe it's asking for her description of how people use the term, not her evaluation of it.\n\nIn that case, perhaps she thinks that people understand moral obligation as the commands of God, even in a secular context. But I need to double-check that.\n\nLooking back at \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe argues that the concept of moral obligation is inherited from a Christian framework where moral laws are God's commands. In a secular context, she thinks that this concept is misguided because there is no divine lawgiver issuing commands.\n\nSo, perhaps she would say that \"moral obligation\" currently signifies \"the commands of God,\" but in a secular context, this doesn't make sense because there is no God issuing commands.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she thinks that in contemporary usage, \"moral obligation\" doesn't signify any real concept at all, because the basis for moral obligation has been lost.\n\nI think option D, \"no real concept at all,\" might be the best answer. Anscombe is critiquing the use of the term \"moral obligation\" in a way that assumes a divine lawgiver, which isn't present in secular ethics. Therefore, she might conclude that the term doesn't signify anything meaningful in contemporary discourse.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\nOption A: \"the norms of a society.\" While societal norms can influence what is considered moral, Anscombe doesn't seem to equate moral obligation directly with social norms. She is more critical of the idea of moral obligation itself.\n\nOption B: \"the feelings of an individual.\" This seems more related to emotivism or subjectivism in ethics, which Anscombe doesn't directly address in her critique of moral obligation.\n\nOption C: \"the commands of God.\" This is certainly part of Anscombe's discussion, as she references the divine command theory. However, she is arguing that in a secular context, this notion doesn't hold, which might make \"moral obligation\" a vacuous concept.\n\nOption D: \"no real concept at all.\" This seems to align with Anscombe's view that the concept of moral obligation is being used without its traditional theological underpinnings, rendering it without a clear meaning.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think the best answer is D. Anscombe is suggesting that \"moral obligation\" doesn't have a real concept in contemporary philosophy because the framework that supported it (divine command theory) is no longer accepted, and thus the term is being used without a coherent foundation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
