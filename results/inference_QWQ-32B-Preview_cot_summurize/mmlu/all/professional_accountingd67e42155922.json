                    "text": "Let's dive into this auditing question. So, the scenario is that an auditor wants to include an emphasis-of-matter paragraph in their audit report for a nonissuer's financial statements. The purpose is to draw the users' attention to a particular matter that's important for understanding the financials. Now, we need to figure out what the auditor should do according to standard auditing practices.\n\nFirst off, let's recall what an emphasis-of-matter paragraph is. It's a section in the audit report that highlights a significant matter in the financial statements, which is properly presented and disclosed, but the auditor wants to draw more attention to it. This could be something like a going concern uncertainty, a major transaction, or a significant accounting policy change.\n\nOption A suggests that the auditor should indicate in the audit report that the emphasis-of-matter paragraph is required by law or regulation. Hmm, I don't think that's accurate. While there might be regulations governing audit reports, the decision to include an emphasis-of-matter paragraph is typically based on the auditor's professional judgment, not a legal requirement. So, I'd say A is not the right choice.\n\nOption B says that the auditor should notify the appropriate regulatory authority if the auditor's opinion was modified on the basis of the matter. Wait a minute, an emphasis-of-matter paragraph is used when the auditor's opinion isn't modified; it's just to highlight a significant matter that's already properly presented in the financial statements. If the auditor's opinion is modified, that would be a different type of paragraph, like a qualification or an adverse opinion. So, B seems incorrect because the emphasis-of-matter paragraph is used when the opinion isn't modified.\n\nOption C proposes modifying the introductory paragraph to direct the reader to the emphasis-of-matter paragraph. The introductory paragraph is where the auditor states that they have audited the financial statements and describes the responsibilities of the auditor and management. I don't recall any standard that requires modifying the introductory paragraph to point to the emphasis-of-matter paragraph. Usually, the emphasis-of-matter paragraph is clearly labeled and placed in a prominent section of the audit report.\n\nOption D suggests including the paragraph immediately after the opinion paragraph in the audit report. Now, this sounds familiar. In standard audit reporting, any emphasis-of-matter paragraphs typically follow the opinion paragraph. This is done to ensure that the auditor's opinion is presented first, and then any additional matters that the auditor wants to highlight are addressed afterward. This sequencing helps users understand the auditor's overall opinion and then consider any additional information provided in the emphasis-of-matter paragraph.\n\nGiven this, option D seems to be the correct approach. The auditor should include the emphasis-of-matter paragraph immediately after the opinion paragraph in the audit report. This placement ensures that users read the auditor's opinion first and then are directed to consider the highlighted matter in conjunction with the financial statements.\n\nTo summarize, among the given options, D is the most appropriate action for an auditor to take when including an emphasis-of-matter paragraph in an audit report for a nonissuer's financial statements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
