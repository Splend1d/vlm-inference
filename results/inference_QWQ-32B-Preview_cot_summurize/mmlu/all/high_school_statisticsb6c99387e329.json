                    "text": "So I have this statistics problem here. It says that I did 10 independent tests, each testing the null hypothesis that the mean is 25 against the alternative that the mean is less than 25, and each test is at the 0.05 significance level. I need to find the probability of committing at least one Type I error across these 10 tests.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Type I error is. A Type I error occurs when I reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. The significance level \u03b1 is the probability of making a Type I error in a single test. Here, \u03b1 is 0.05 for each test.\n\nSince the tests are independent, I can think about the probability of not making a Type I error in a single test, which would be 1 - \u03b1 = 0.95.\n\nNow, if I have 10 independent tests, the probability of not making a Type I error in any of them is (0.95)^10.\n\nSo, the probability of making at least one Type I error in the 10 tests would be 1 minus the probability of not making a Type I error in any of them. That is:\n\nP(at least one Type I error) = 1 - (0.95)^10\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, calculate 0.95 to the power of 10:\n\n0.95^10 = ?\n\nI know that 0.95^2 = 0.9025\n\n0.95^3 = 0.857375\n\nContinuing this, or better yet, I can use a calculator for this.\n\nUsing a calculator: 0.95^10 \u2248 0.59874\n\nSo, P(at least one Type I error) = 1 - 0.59874 \u2248 0.40126\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.05\n\nB. 0.40\n\nC. 0.50\n\nD. 0.60\n\nThe closest answer is B. 0.40.\n\nSo, the probability of committing a Type I error and incorrectly rejecting a true H0 with at least one of the 10 tests is approximately 0.40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
