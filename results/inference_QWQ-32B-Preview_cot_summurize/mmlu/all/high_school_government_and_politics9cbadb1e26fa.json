                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the Supreme Court's doctrine of incorporation. So, the doctrine of incorporation is a legal principle that applies the Bill of Rights to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Basically, it means that certain fundamental rights protected by the federal Constitution are also protected against abridgment by the states.\n\nOkay, let's look at each option to see which one best describes this doctrine.\n\nOption A: \"Although the Constitution empowers the federal government to regulate international trade, states may establish boycotts of goods imported from countries that use child labor.\" Hmm, this seems to be about state regulation of trade and possibly international relations, but it doesn't mention the Bill of Rights or the Fourteenth Amendment. So, this doesn't sound like the doctrine of incorporation.\n\nOption B: \"While the Congress creates laws, and the executive branch enacts and enforces those laws, only the Supreme Court may decide which laws and executive actions are unconstitutional.\" This is more about the Supreme Court's power of judicial review, which is different from the doctrine of incorporation. Judicial review is the Court's authority to interpret the Constitution and invalidate laws that violate it, but it's not specifically about applying the Bill of Rights to the states.\n\nOption C: \"The Fifth Amendment guarantees that an individual may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process, and this protection provides a legal justification for those who do not wish to serve on a jury.\" This is discussing the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and its relation to jury service. While it mentions due process, it's not explaining the incorporation doctrine, which is about applying the Bill of Rights to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOption D: \"The Bill of Rights articulates certain rights in order to protect individuals from the federal government, and the Fourteenth Amendment extends most of those rights to protect individuals from the state governments as well.\" Ah, this sounds promising. The Bill of Rights originally limited only the federal government, and the incorporation doctrine uses the Fourteenth Amendment to apply most of these rights to the states as well. This seems to be a accurate description of the incorporation doctrine.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option D best describes the Supreme Court's doctrine of incorporation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
