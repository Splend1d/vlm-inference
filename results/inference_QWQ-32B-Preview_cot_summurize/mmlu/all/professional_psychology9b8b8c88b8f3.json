So, vocational interest inventories are tools that help people understand their interests in relation to different careers or jobs. They're like questionnaires that ask about your preferences and then match them to occupations that might be a good fit based on those interests.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these options vocational interest inventories are generally not recommended as. The options are:\n\nA. educational decision-making aids\n\nB. employment selection devices\n\nC. aids to self-understanding\n\nD. occupational information sources\n\nLet me think about each one.\n\nOption A: educational decision-making aids. I think these inventories can be helpful for educational decisions because they can guide students toward courses or programs that align with their interests. So, probably recommended for this purpose.\n\nOption B: employment selection devices. Hmm, this is interesting. Vocational interest inventories are designed to assess interests, not necessarily abilities or job performance. So, using them to select employees might not be the best approach because interests don't always correlate directly with job performance. Maybe this is the one that's not recommended.\n\nOption C: aids to self-understanding. Definitely, these inventories are meant to help individuals understand their own interests better, so they are recommended for this purpose.\n\nOption D: occupational information sources. These inventories often provide information about different occupations based on the interests assessed, so they serve as a source of occupational information.\n\nSo, considering this, it seems like option B, employment selection devices, is the one that vocational interest inventories are generally not recommended as. I think that makes sense because selecting employees should probably be based on more than just interests; factors like skills, experience, and qualifications are also important.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. If I look back at option A, educational decision-making aids, yes, interests are crucial in education to keep students motivated and engaged in their studies. So, using these inventories for educational decisions is advisable.\n\nOption C, aids to self-understanding, is pretty much the primary purpose of these inventories. They help individuals gain insight into their own interests and preferences.\n\nOption D, occupational information sources, these inventories often come with descriptions of occupations that match the individual's interests, so they do serve as a source of information about different careers.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be B, employment selection devices, as vocational interest inventories are not typically recommended for selecting employees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
