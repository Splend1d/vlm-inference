                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have Albert Attorney, who's a solo practitioner in Littletown, and he drafted an estate plan in 1990 that violated the rule against perpetuities. The testator died in 2004, and at that point, the mistake was discovered. Because of the error, the estate plan wasn't admitted to probate, and the assets were distributed according to the state's intestacy statute instead.\n\nNow, Gordon Greedy was supposed to be a substantial taker under the estate plan, but since the plan wasn't admitted, he didn't receive anything under the intestacy statute because he's not a relative. The state's statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years, and Gordon is suing Albert for professional malpractice in 2005.\n\nWe need to figure out the best defense Albert can assert. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely.\n\nB. The legal fee for the original estate plan was never paid.\n\nC. The rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in the locality of Littletown to understand.\n\nD. Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: the statute of limitations has run.\n\nThe statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years. The mistake was discovered in 2004 when the testator died, and Gordon is suing in 2005, which is within three years. So, it seems like the lawsuit is timely. But wait, maybe there's more to it.\n\nIn professional malpractice cases, the clock often starts ticking when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury. This is known as the discovery rule. So, even if the mistake was made in 1990, Gordon might not have known about it until 2004 when the testator died and the estate was distributed differently than expected.\n\nGiven that Gordon is suing in 2005, which is within three years of discovering the injury in 2004, the statute of limitations hasn't run yet. So, option A might not be the best defense.\n\nNext, option B: the legal fee for the original estate plan was never paid.\n\nWhether the legal fee was paid or not probably doesn't directly relate to the malpractice claim. Malpractice is about the professional duty owed to the client, not about payment for services rendered. So, this might not be a strong defense.\n\nOption C: the rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in Littletown to understand.\n\nThis is an interesting one. The rule against perpetuities is indeed a complex area of law, and it's possible that a lawyer in a small town might not be as well-versed in it as a lawyer in a bigger city. However, lawyers are expected to competently handle the matters they undertake, and if they don't feel competent, they should refer the client to someone else or educate themselves on the topic.\n\nClaiming that the rule is too complicated might not hold up as a defense because the law is what it is, and lawyers are bound to know and apply it correctly. So, this might not be the best defense.\n\nFinally, option D: Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan.\n\nWait a minute, Gordon was named as a substantial taker under the estate plan, which means he was intended to receive something under the plan. However, because the plan was invalid due to the rule against perpetuities violation, the assets went to the intestacy statute instead, and Gordon didn't receive anything because he's not a relative.\n\nSo, if Gordon was named in the estate plan, he likely had standing to challenge the plan or to sue for malpractice related to the plan's invalidity.\n\nBut perhaps Albert could argue that Gordon wasn't an eligible taker under the estate plan, but that seems contrary to the facts presented, which say that Gordon was named as a substantial taker under the plan.\n\nTherefore, this option doesn't seem like a strong defense.\n\nGiven all this, none of the options seem particularly strong, but perhaps the best defense Albert can assert is option A: the statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that since Gordon discovered the injury in 2004 and is suing in 2005, which is within three years, the statute of limitations hasn't run.\n\nHowever, maybe there's confusion about when the cause of action accrued.\n\nIn professional malpractice, the cause of action typically accrues when the plaintiff sustains damage as a result of the defendant's negligent act or omission.\n\nIn this case, the negligent act was drafting an invalid estate plan in 1990, but the damage\u2014Gordon not receiving the bequest\u2014occurred in 2004 when the testator died and the plan wasn't admitted to probate.\n\nSo, applying the discovery rule, the clock starts ticking when Gordon discovered or should have discovered the injury, which is in 2004.\n\nSuing in 2005 is within the three-year statute of limitations.\n\nTherefore, the statute of limitations hasn't expired, and option A isn't a strong defense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Albert can argue that the statute of limitations began running in 1990 when the estate plan was drafted, but that seems contrary to the discovery rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different legal theory or exception that applies, but based on the information given, it seems like the lawsuit is timely.\n\nLooking back at the other options:\n\nOption B: the legal fee was never paid.\n\nThis might be relevant if Albert can argue that there's no attorney-client relationship because the fee wasn't paid, but in reality, lawyers often continue to work even if fees aren't paid, and the attorney-client relationship is generally established upon agreement to provide legal services, not upon payment.\n\nSo, this seems like a weak defense.\n\nOption C: the rule against perpetuities is too complicated.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this is unlikely to hold up because lawyers are expected to know and apply the law correctly, even if it's complex.\n\nOption D: Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan.\n\nThis contradicts the facts, as Gordon was named as a substantial taker under the plan.\n\nTherefore, the best defense Albert can assert is probably none of the above, but since we have to choose, perhaps option A is the least worst, assuming that there's some argument about the statute of limitations.\n\nHowever, based on the standard discovery rule, the lawsuit seems timely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Albert can argue that Gordon doesn't have standing to sue for malpractice, but that seems unlikely because Gordon was the intended beneficiary under the estate plan and thus had a direct interest.\n\nAnother possible defense could be that the error was not the cause of Gordon's loss, but that seems hard to argue since the plan's invalidity directly led to the assets being distributed under intestacy instead of the plan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Albert can argue that the estate plan would have failed for other reasons, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven the options provided, I think the best defense Albert can assert is option A: the statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely.\n\nEven though, based on the discovery rule, it seems like the lawsuit is timely, perhaps Albert can argue that the cause of action accrued in 1990 when the estate plan was drafted, and thus the statute of limitations has run by 2005.\n\nHowever, this is a stretch, and likely not a strong defense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Albert can argue that Gordon waited too long to sue and is therefore estopped by laches, but laches is different from the statute of limitations and typically applies in equity.\n\nBut since this is a malpractice lawsuit, which is legal in nature, the statute of limitations would be the governing rule.\n\nIn conclusion, among the given options, A seems to be the best defense Albert can assert, despite its weaknesses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
