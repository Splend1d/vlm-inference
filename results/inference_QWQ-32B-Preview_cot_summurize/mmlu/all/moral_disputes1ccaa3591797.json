                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Arthur's critique of Singer's approach to world hunger and poverty. So, the question is: With respect to the issue of world hunger and poverty, Arthur points out that Singer ignores... and then it lists several options involving different principles. I need to recall what Arthur's argument was against Singer's view.\n\nPeter Singer is known for his ethical approach to global poverty, often advocating for a utilitarian perspective where individuals have a moral obligation to help those in need, up to the point of marginal utility. Essentially, he argues that people in affluent nations should give more to help those in poverty until they reach a point where giving more would cause them as much disutility as the utility it would provide to others.\n\nNow, Arthur seems to be critiquing Singer's approach, suggesting that Singer is overlooking certain principles. Let's look at the options one by one to see which one aligns with Arthur's critique.\n\nOption A: the principles of equality and harm. I recall that Singer does talk about equality in terms of considering all beings' interests equally, especially in his book \"Animal Liberation.\" However, in the context of global poverty, he emphasizes the equality of suffering and the moral imperative to reduce suffering regardless of geographical location. So, it's not clear that he's ignoring equality. As for harm, Singer's approach seems to focus on preventing harm through assistance. So, maybe not A.\n\nOption B: the principles of the right and the good. This seems a bit abstract. Perhaps Arthur is suggesting that Singer conflates what is right with what is good, or maybe he's ignoring some distinction between rights and goods. I'm not sure yet.\n\nOption C: the principles of rights and desert. Desert refers to what people deserve based on their actions or characteristics. Singer's approach seems more utilitarian, focusing on outcomes and reducing suffering, rather than on rights or desert. Maybe Arthur is pointing out that Singer doesn't consider whether people have a right to assistance or whether they deserve help based on certain criteria. This seems plausible.\n\nOption D: the principles of ability to help and desires. Singer does consider the ability to help; in fact, he argues that those who have the means to help without sacrificing their own basic needs should do so. As for desires, his approach is more about moral obligations than about personal desires. Maybe Arthur is suggesting that Singer doesn't account for people's desires in his moral calculus.\n\nTo decide between C and D, I need to recall Arthur's specific argument. I think Arthur might be emphasizing that Singer doesn't take into account the rights that people have or what they deserve, which would be option C. On the other hand, if Arthur is critiquing Singer for not considering people's abilities and desires in a more nuanced way, then option D might be more accurate.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If Arthur is arguing that Singer's approach is too demanding because it doesn't take into account people's own needs and desires, that would align more with option D. Alternatively, if Arthur is saying that Singer doesn't respect individual rights or consider who deserves help based on merit or need, then option C would be more fitting.\n\nI think the key here is to remember the specific points Arthur made in his critique. Unfortunately, without direct access to the text, I have to rely on my memory and logical deduction.\n\nGiven that, I'm going to lean towards option C: the principles of rights and desert. I think Arthur is likely arguing that Singer's utilitarian approach overlooks individual rights and the idea of desert, which are important considerations in moral decision-making.\n\nSo, my answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
