                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a linear function f with a nonzero slope, and we're given that c < d. We need to determine which of the statements A, B, C, or D must be false.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a linear function with a nonzero slope looks like. A linear function can be written in the form f(x) = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the slope is nonzero, m \u2260 0. This means the function is either increasing (if m > 0) or decreasing (if m < 0).\n\nGiven that c < d, we can analyze how f(c) and f(d) relate based on the slope.\n\nOption A: f(c) = f(d)\n\nFor a linear function with a nonzero slope, f(c) = f(d) would imply that c = d, because the function is one-to-one. But we're given that c < d, so c \u2260 d. Therefore, f(c) cannot equal f(d) if the slope is nonzero. So, option A must be false.\n\nOption B: f(c) \u2260 f(d)\n\nThis is the opposite of option A. Since we've established that f(c) cannot equal f(d) for a linear function with a nonzero slope when c \u2260 d, this statement must be true.\n\nOption C: f(c) > f(d)\n\nIf the slope m is negative, then the function is decreasing, meaning that as x increases, f(x) decreases. So, if c < d and m < 0, then f(c) > f(d). Therefore, this statement can be true.\n\nOption D: f(c) < f(d)\n\nIf the slope m is positive, then the function is increasing, meaning that as x increases, f(x) increases. So, if c < d and m > 0, then f(c) < f(d). Therefore, this statement can also be true.\n\nSo, among the options, only option A must be false.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any scenario where option A could be true?\n\nIf f is a linear function with a nonzero slope, and c \u2260 d, then f(c) cannot equal f(d). That's because a linear function with a nonzero slope is injective, meaning it never takes the same value twice. So, f(c) = f(d) only if c = d, which contradicts c < d.\n\nTherefore, option A must be false.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the function were constant, i.e., m = 0. Then f(x) = b for all x, so f(c) = f(d) regardless of c and d. But the problem specifies that the slope is nonzero, so this case doesn't apply.\n\nAlso, options C and D depend on the sign of the slope. If m > 0, then f(c) < f(d), and if m < 0, then f(c) > f(d). Since the problem states that the slope is nonzero but doesn't specify its sign, both C and D could be true depending on the sign of m.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
