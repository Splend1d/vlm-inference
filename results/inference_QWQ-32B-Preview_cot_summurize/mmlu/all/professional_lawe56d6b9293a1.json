                    "text": "So here's this malpractice case where a plaintiff is suing a doctor because he says the doctor didn't diagnose his emphysema properly. The plaintiff went to this doctor with chest pains and shortness of breath, and the doctor told him it was probably indigestion. But then he went to another doctor who found out he really had emphysema.\n\nNow, at trial, the plaintiff wants to call that second doctor as his first witness. This doctor wants to testify that the X-rays of the plaintiff's lungs showed distension, which is characteristic of emphysema. But the defendant's attorney objects to this testimony. The question is, should the testimony be admitted or excluded, and why?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Admitted, because a doctor is properly qualified as an expert in medical matters.\n\nWell, yeah, generally doctors are experts in medical matters, so they can give expert opinions. But is that enough in this case?\n\nB. Admitted, because the other doctor followed accepted medical practice in arriving at his opinion.\n\nAgain, if the doctor followed accepted medical practices, that seems reasonable. But is there something else we need to consider here?\n\nC. Excluded, because his opinion is based upon facts not in evidence.\n\nHmm, this is interesting. Is the doctor's opinion based on facts that haven't been presented in court yet? What facts is the doctor basing his opinion on? He's basing it on the X-rays of the plaintiff's lungs showing distension, which is characteristic of emphysema.\n\nSo, is the X-ray evidence itself entered into the trial? If not, then the doctor's opinion is based on evidence that the jury hasn't seen or hasn't been presented with. That could be a problem because the jury needs to evaluate the basis for the expert's opinion.\n\nD. Excluded, because the X-rays are the best evidence to show the distension of the plaintiff's lungs.\n\nThis is about the best evidence rule. The best evidence rule generally requires that the original document or evidence be presented, especially in cases where the content of that evidence is at issue.\n\nIn this case, the X-rays are the original evidence showing the distension of the lungs. If the plaintiff wants to prove that there was distension, the actual X-rays would be the best evidence.\n\nSo, if the doctor is testifying about what the X-rays show, but the X-rays themselves aren't being presented to the jury, then perhaps his testimony should be excluded in favor of producing the actual X-rays.\n\nBut wait, maybe the doctor needs to interpret the X-rays for the jury since it's medical evidence. Juries might not be able to interpret X-rays on their own.\n\nLet me think about this differently. In many cases, expert witnesses are allowed to interpret test results or medical images and explain them to the jury. So, perhaps the doctor can testify about what the X-rays show, but only if the X-rays are entered into evidence.\n\nI think the key here is whether the X-rays have been entered into evidence. If they have, then the doctor can testify about them. If not, then his testimony might be based on facts not in evidence, which would be a problem.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nC. Excluded, because his opinion is based upon facts not in evidence.\n\nThis seems relevant if the X-rays haven't been entered into evidence. The doctor's opinion is based on the X-rays, which are facts not yet in evidence.\n\nD. Excluded, because the X-rays are the best evidence to show the distension of the plaintiff's lungs.\n\nThis also suggests that the X-rays themselves should be presented as the best evidence of the distension.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is that the testimony should be excluded because the X-rays, being the best evidence, should be presented directly.\n\nBut, in practice, it's common for expert witnesses to interpret medical imagery and explain it to the jury. Maybe both the X-rays and the doctor's testimony are needed.\n\nHowever, since the question is about the objection at trial, and the doctor is proposing to testify about the X-rays, but there's no mention of the X-rays being entered into evidence yet, it's likely that the testimony should be excluded until the X-rays are admitted into evidence.\n\nTherefore, option C seems most appropriate: excluded, because his opinion is based upon facts not in evidence.\n\nOption D is also tempting, but C seems more directly applicable in this scenario.\n\nSo, I would go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
