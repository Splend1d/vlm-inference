Hmm, I'm not super confident about this, but I think I've heard something about Mars taking longer to orbit the Sun compared to Earth. Let me see what I remember.\n\nFirst off, I know that Earth takes about 365.25 days to orbit the Sun, which is why we have leap years every four years. That's one Earth year. Now, Mars is farther away from the Sun than Earth is. I think that means it takes longer to complete one orbit because the distance is greater.\n\nI recall that the farther a planet is from the Sun, the longer its orbital period. That makes sense because it has to travel a larger circumference. So, if Mars is farther out, its year should be longer than Earth's.\n\nBut how much longer? Is it twice as long? Four times? Or maybe just a little over Earth's year? I think the answer is more than one Earth year, but less than two. Wait, no, I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to recall some facts. I think Mars's day, called a sol, is a little longer than Earth's day, but that's not directly helpful here. I need to think about the orbital period.\n\nI think I've read that a Mars year is about 1.88 Earth years. If that's the case, then among the options given, 2 Earth years would be the closest approximation. So, option C. 2 might be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. If Mars's year is about 1.88 Earth years, then 2 is a reasonable approximation, especially since the question says \"approximately.\" Options A and B are too short, and option D is too long.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the relative speeds of the planets. Earth is closer to the Sun and moves faster in its orbit than Mars does. So, Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days, while Mars takes longer.\n\nI think I can confirm that Mars's orbital period is roughly 687 Earth days. Let's see, 687 days divided by 365.25 days per Earth year is approximately 1.88 Earth years. So, yes, about 2 Earth years.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
