It attracts filmmakers, actors, and industry professionals from around the globe and is known for showcasing a wide range of films, including premieres of highly anticipated movies and independent works.\n\nMarseille, option B, is the second-largest city in France and is known for its rich history and cultural diversity, but it is not primarily known for an international film festival.\n\nDijon, option C, is the capital of the Burgundy region and is famous for its mustard and historical architecture, but it does not host a significant international film festival.\n\nLyon, option D, is the third-largest city in France and is known for its cuisine, historical and architectural landmarks, and as a major center for banking and biotechnology. While Lyon does have its own film festival, known as the Lumi\u00e8re Festival, which celebrates the history of cinema, it is not as internationally renowned as the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Cannes."
