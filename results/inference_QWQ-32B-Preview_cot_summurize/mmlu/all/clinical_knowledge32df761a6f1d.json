It affects multiple systems of the body and requires immediate medical attention. Let's review each option to determine which one is not typically a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\nOption A: Stridor.\n\nStridor is a high-pitched, wheezing sound that occurs when there is partial blockage or narrowing of the upper airway, usually due to swelling or constriction. In anaphylaxis, swelling of the throat and tongue can cause airway obstruction, leading to stridor. Therefore, stridor is a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\nOption B: Bradycardia.\n\nBradycardia refers to an abnormally slow heart rate, typically defined as a heart rate below 60 beats per minute. In anaphylaxis, the body experiences a systemic reaction that can lead to vasodilation and a drop in blood pressure. To compensate for this, the heart may beat faster to maintain blood flow, which is known as tachycardia. Bradycardia is not a typical symptom of anaphylaxis; in fact, it is more commonly associated with conditions like heart block or certain medications.\n\nOption C: Severe wheeze.\n\nWheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound that occurs during breathing, usually when exhaling, due to narrowed airways. In anaphylaxis, bronchoconstriction can cause severe wheezing as the airways narrow, making breathing difficult. Therefore, severe wheezing is a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\nOption D: Rash.\n\nRashes, particularly hives (urticaria), are common in anaphylaxis. Hives are raised, itchy welts on the skin that can appear suddenly and may be accompanied by itching or burning sensations. Other types of rashes can also occur during anaphylactic reactions. Thus, rash is a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is Option B: Bradycardia. Anaphylaxis typically causes tachycardia rather than bradycardia due to the body's attempt to compensate for decreased blood pressure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
