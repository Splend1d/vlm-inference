                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here: a physician refers an asthmatic patient to me for therapy and wants regular progress reports. I need to figure out the most appropriate way to handle this request. There are four options provided, and I need to choose the best one.\n\nOption A says I should comply with the request because a physician must be involved whenever I treat someone for a physical condition. Hmm, well, as a psychologist or therapist, I understand that physical and mental health are connected, but does that mean a physician must always be involved in my treatment? I think the relationship between physical and mental health is important, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a physician has to be directly involved in every aspect of treatment. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption B suggests that I should tell the physician that psychological reports can only be sent to a psychiatrist or another psychologist. That seems pretty restrictive. As a therapist, I believe in the importance of interdisciplinary care. Sometimes, collaborating with other healthcare providers, including physicians, can be beneficial for the patient's overall well-being. So, limiting reports only to psychiatrists or other psychologists might not be in the best interest of the patient. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nOption C says I should tell the physician that I can send progress reports only with a written release by the patient. This sounds more in line with standard practice regarding confidentiality and patient consent. In therapy, maintaining confidentiality is crucial, and sharing information with other professionals should generally require the patient's permission. So, this seems like a reasonable approach.\n\nOption D is similar to option A, suggesting that I should comply with the request because the physician needs my input for the best treatment of the patient's physical condition. Again, while collaboration can be beneficial, I need to consider ethical and professional boundaries. As a therapist, my primary focus is on the patient's mental and emotional well-being, and while I can collaborate with physicians, especially in cases where mental health affects physical health, like in asthma, there need to be proper protocols in place regarding information sharing.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems to strike the right balance. It acknowledges the importance of collaboration but also respects the patient's right to confidentiality and requires their consent before sharing progress reports with the physician. This approach ensures that the patient is involved in decisions about their care and that their privacy is protected.\n\nSo, I think the most appropriate course of action is to tell the physician that I can send progress reports only with a written release by the patient.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
