                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a subring is. A subring of a ring \\( R \\) is a subset of \\( R \\) that is itself a ring under the same operations as \\( R \\). Now, a ring may or may not have a unity (a multiplicative identity). If \\( R \\) has a unity, say \\( 1_R \\), and \\( S \\) is a subring of \\( R \\), then \\( S \\) might or might not have the same unity as \\( R \\).\n\nHowever, there's a crucial point here: if \\( S \\) contains the unity of \\( R \\), then \\( 1_R \\) is also the unity of \\( S \\). But it's possible for \\( S \\) to have its own unity different from \\( 1_R \\), especially if \\( S \\) does not contain \\( 1_R \\). Wait, but in many definitions, a subring is required to contain the unity of the ring if the ring has one. This can vary depending on the text.\n\nIn some algebra texts, a subring is required to share the same unity as the ring, while in others, a subring does not necessarily need to contain the unity. This is a point of confusion for many students.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, I think the statement is not always true, because it depends on the definition being used. But to give a definitive answer, I need to consider the standard definitions.\n\nLet me recall: In abstract algebra, particularly in ring theory, there are varying conventions regarding whether a ring must have a multiplicative identity (unity) and whether subrings must share the same unity.\n\nIn some texts, like Dummit and Foote's \"Abstract Algebra,\" a ring is not required to have a unity, and a subring is not required to contain the unity of the ring. In such cases, a subring can have a different unity or no unity at all.\n\nHowever, in other texts, especially in more advanced treatments, it is often assumed that rings have a unity and that subrings share the same unity.\n\nGiven this, the statement \"The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring\" is not universally true because it depends on the specific definitions being used.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is False.\n\n**Statement 2:** Every field is an integral domain.\n\nAn integral domain is a commutative ring with unity (1 \u2260 0) and no zero divisors. A field is a commutative ring with unity where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nSo, in a field, we have:\n\n- Commutativity\n\n- Unity (1 \u2260 0)\n\n- No zero divisors (since if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0, because every non-zero element has an inverse)\n\nTherefore, every field satisfies the conditions to be an integral domain.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is True.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nStatement 1: False\n\nStatement 2: True\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
