The options are:\n\nA. the power of Apollo\n\nB. the strength of Hercules\n\nC. the courage of Achilles\n\nD. the wisdom of Solomon\n\nI know that Captain Marvel, also known as Shazam, gets his powers from saying the word \"Shazam,\" which is an acronym for the virtues of six ancient heroes and gods. So, S is for Solomon, H is for Hercules, A is for Atlas, Z is for Zeus, A is for Achilles, and M is for Mercury.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Captain Marvel has the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is the power of Apollo, but I don't remember Apollo being one of the ones whose powers Captain Marvel has. Instead, it's Zeus for power. So maybe A is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Option B is the strength of Hercules, which I know Captain Marvel has. Option C is the courage of Achilles, which also matches what I remember. Option D is the wisdom of Solomon, which is definitely one of his powers.\n\nSo, if A is the power of Apollo, and Captain Marvel gets his power from Zeus instead, then A would be the ability that Captain Marvel does not have.\n\nWait a minute, in some versions of the comics, Captain Marvel might have aspects related to Apollo, but based on the classic Shazam acronym, it's Zeus, not Apollo.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. the power of Apollo.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
