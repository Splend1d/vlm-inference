So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I made sure to dispose of my banana peel since someone could trip on it.\" Okay, so here, the person is being careful not to litter and is thinking about how their actions could affect others. Disposing of trash properly is generally considered a responsible and considerate thing to do. It shows respect for the environment and for other people who might be around. So, in this case, the person is doing something positive, not something wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I stirred the drink before giving it to the customer.\" This seems like a standard practice in serving drinks, especially if it's a mixed drink or something where the ingredients need to be combined properly. Stirring ensures that the drink is well-mixed and ready to be consumed. It's hard to see anything morally wrong with stirring a drink before serving it. In fact, it might be considered part of good customer service.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are either positive or at least neutral, without any moral wrongdoing.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nIn scenario 1, disposing of the banana peel is the right thing to do, as it prevents potential harm to others. Not doing so could be considered careless or even negligent, but the person is taking the responsible action.\n\nIn scenario 2, stirring the drink before serving is just part of the service. It's hard to see any moral issue here unless, perhaps, there's some context where stirring the drink would be inappropriate, but nothing like that is suggested in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves anything clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
