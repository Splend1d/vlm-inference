                    "text": "Let's see what this is about. Amy's therapist is nodding and saying \"yes, uh huh\" while she talks about her problems. And we need to figure out which type of therapy this is: psychoanalysis, behavior therapy, humanistic therapy, or cognitive therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these therapies is about.\n\nPsychoanalysis, I think, is like the original type of therapy developed by Freud. It focuses on uncovering repressed thoughts and feelings, often through techniques like free association and dream analysis. The therapist is pretty passive in this approach, just letting the patient talk and occasionally offering interpretations.\n\nBehavior therapy, on the other hand, is more about changing problematic behaviors. It's based on principles of learning theory, so techniques might include conditioning, reinforcement, and aversion therapy. The therapist is more active here, designing specific exercises and interventions to modify behavior.\n\nHumanistic therapy is about self-exploration and personal growth. It emphasizes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and congruence. Therapists in this approach are supportive and non-judgmental, creating a safe space for the client to explore their feelings and experiences.\n\nCognitive therapy focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and beliefs that lead to harmful behaviors or emotions. It's more structured and present-focused, with the therapist helping the client to challenge and reframe their thoughts.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the therapist is nodding and saying \"yes, uh huh\" while Amy talks about her problems. This sounds like the therapist is actively listening and showing empathy, which is a key component of humanistic therapy. In psychoanalysis, the therapist might be more silent, just letting Amy talk without much response. Behavior therapy is more about changing behaviors through specific techniques, so the therapist might be more directive. Cognitive therapy involves identifying and challenging thoughts, so the therapist would likely be more interactive, asking questions about Amy's thoughts and beliefs.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the therapist is using a humanistic approach, where they're providing a supportive environment for Amy to express herself without judgment. The nodding and verbal affirmations are ways of showing that they're listening and understanding, which aligns with the principles of humanistic therapy.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe other therapies also use active listening. Actually, active listening is important in many therapeutic approaches, but in humanistic therapy, it's particularly emphasized as a core component.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. humanistic therapy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
