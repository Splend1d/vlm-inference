                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about employees' incomes. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are 400 employees in total, and their incomes are normally distributed with a mean of $20,500 and a standard deviation of $3,750. I need to find out how many employees I expect to have an income between $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nFirst, I need to recall something about normal distributions. I know that in a normal distribution, data is symmetrically distributed around the mean, and the standard deviation tells me how spread out the data is. So, most of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean, but I think for exact calculations, I need to use z-scores and probably look up some values in a standard normal table.\n\nLet me write down the given information:\n\n- Mean (\u03bc) = $20,500\n\n- Standard deviation (\u03c3) = $3,750\n\n- Total employees = 400\n\n- Income range of interest: $13,000 to $28,000\n\nI need to find the number of employees whose income falls between $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nI think the first step is to convert the income values to z-scores. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nWhere X is the income value.\n\nSo, for $13,000:\n\nz1 = (13,000 - 20,500) / 3,750 = (-7,500) / 3,750 = -2\n\nAnd for $28,000:\n\nz2 = (28,000 - 20,500) / 3,750 = 7,500 / 3,750 = 2\n\nSo, I have z-scores of -2 and 2.\n\nNow, I need to find the area under the standard normal curve between z = -2 and z = 2. This area will represent the proportion of employees whose income falls within that range.\n\nI remember that the area under the standard normal curve between z = -1 and z = 1 is about 68%, and between z = -2 and z = 2 is about 95%. Wait, but I think that's a rough estimate. For more precise calculations, I should look up the z-scores in a standard normal table.\n\nLooking up z = 2 in the standard normal table, the cumulative area is approximately 0.9772.\n\nLooking up z = -2, the cumulative area is approximately 0.0228.\n\nTo find the area between z = -2 and z = 2, I subtract the smaller area from the larger one:\n\nArea = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544\n\nSo, approximately 95.44% of the employees have incomes between $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nNow, to find the number of employees, I multiply this proportion by the total number of employees:\n\nNumber of employees = 0.9544 * 400 \u2248 381.76\n\nSince the number of employees must be a whole number, I'll round it to the nearest whole number, which is 382.\n\nBut looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 50\n\nB. 100\n\nC. 200\n\nD. 390\n\nHmm, 382 is closest to 390, but I'm not sure if I did everything correctly.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the z-scores:\n\nFor $13,000:\n\nz1 = (13,000 - 20,500) / 3,750 = (-7,500) / 3,750 = -2\n\nFor $28,000:\n\nz2 = (28,000 - 20,500) / 3,750 = 7,500 / 3,750 = 2\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, the area between z = -2 and z = 2 is indeed approximately 0.9544.\n\nMultiplying by 400:\n\n0.9544 * 400 = 381.76, which rounds to 382.\n\nBut 382 is not one of the options. The closest is 390, but maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard normal table I'm referring to has slightly different values. Let me check again.\n\nLooking up z = 2, cumulative area is 0.9772.\n\nLooking up z = -2, cumulative area is 0.0228.\n\nDifference: 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the area between z = -2 and z = 2 is approximately 95.44%.\n\nSo, 95.44% of 400 is 0.9544 * 400 = 381.76.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a more precise value from the standard normal table.\n\nLet me look up z = 2 more precisely.\n\nIn my standard normal table, z = 2.00 corresponds to an area of 0.9772.\n\nSimilarly, z = -2.00 corresponds to 0.0228.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the distribution is not perfectly normal, or maybe there's a continuity correction I should apply.\n\nWait, but with 400 employees, and the central limit theorem, it's probably safe to assume normality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the normal distribution is continuous, while the number of employees is discrete, but I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mean and standard deviation are not in dollars, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if the calculation of the z-scores is correct.\n\nMean = $20,500\n\nStandard deviation = $3,750\n\nFor $13,000:\n\nz1 = (13,000 - 20,500) / 3,750 = (-7,500) / 3,750 = -2\n\nFor $28,000:\n\nz2 = (28,000 - 20,500) / 3,750 = 7,500 / 3,750 = 2\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the standard deviation is not $3,750, but perhaps it's something else, but as per the question, it's $3,750.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mean is different, but it's given as $20,500.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the incomes cannot be negative, but since $13,000 is above zero, it's probably not an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distribution is not exactly normal, but for practical purposes, we can assume it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the standard normal table values. Let me check another source.\n\nYes, z = 2 corresponds to approximately 0.9772, and z = -2 to 0.0228.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\nGiven that, 95.44% of 400 is 381.76, which rounds to 382.\n\nBut the closest option is 390, which is D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps instead of using z-scores, I can use the properties of the normal distribution.\n\nI know that approximately:\n\n- 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean.\n\n- 95% within two standard deviations.\n\n- 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n\nIn this case, $13,000 is two standard deviations below the mean, and $28,000 is two standard deviations above the mean.\n\nSo, according to the empirical rule, approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean.\n\nSo, 95% of 400 employees is 0.95 * 400 = 380 employees.\n\nThis is close to my earlier calculation of 382.\n\nBut again, the closest option is 390.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the empirical rule is not precise enough, and using the z-table is better, but I still get 382.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the normal distribution is symmetric, and calculate the exact probabilities.\n\nLet me try calculating the exact z-scores again.\n\nFor $13,000:\n\nz1 = (13,000 - 20,500) / 3,750 = (-7,500) / 3,750 = -2\n\nFor $28,000:\n\nz2 = (28,000 - 20,500) / 3,750 = 7,500 / 3,750 = 2\n\nNow, P(-2 < z < 2) = P(z < 2) - P(z < -2) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544.\n\nSo, 95.44% of employees have incomes between $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nTherefore, number of employees = 0.9544 * 400 = 381.76 \u2248 382.\n\nBut again, 382 is not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to round differently or consider something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the options, and D should be 380 instead of 390.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the normal approximation isn't perfect for discrete data, but since the sample size is large, it should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use a more precise value from the z-table.\n\nLooking up z = 2.00, the area is 0.9772.\n\nLooking up z = -2.00, area is 0.0228.\n\nDifference is 0.9544, as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standard deviation is not $3,750, but perhaps it's different, but as per the question, it's $3,750.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the continuity correction, but since it's a large sample size, it probably won't make much difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mean is different, but it's given as $20,500.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use a different method altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the cumulative distribution function for the normal distribution.\n\nBut I think that's essentially what the z-table is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use technology to get a more precise value.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to use the z-table, I'll stick with that.\n\nGiven that, I have 382 employees expected to have incomes between $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nBut since the closest option is 390, maybe that's the expected answer, considering some rounding differences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is designed to have an answer of 390, even though my calculation gives 382.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the distribution isn't perfectly normal, and adjust accordingly.\n\nBut without more information, I'll go with my calculation.\n\nTherefore, I would expect approximately 382 employees to have incomes between $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nSince 382 is closest to 390, I'll choose D. 390.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because my calculation gives 382, not 390.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options, and D should be 380.\n\nBut based on the calculations, I think 382 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
