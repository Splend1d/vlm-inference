                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the encomienda system during the colonization of the Americas. The encomienda was a system where Spanish conquerors were granted control over certain indigenous people, allowing them to collect tribute and labor from them. This system was a way to organize the exploitation of the native population for the benefit of the Spanish crown and its settlers.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options did NOT contribute to the ending of the encomienda system. So, we need to identify the factor that didn't play a role in its demise.\n\nOption A mentions the protests of Catholic missionaries against abuses of forced labor. This is a well-known factor. Many missionaries, like Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, witnessed the harsh treatment of natives under the encomienda system and advocated for reforms. Their protests and writings helped raise awareness in Spain about the mistreatment, leading to changes in policies.\n\nOption B talks about the lack of new land to assign to well-connected Spaniards and conquistadors. As the initial wave of conquests subsided, there was less new territory to distribute, which might have reduced the incentive to maintain the encomienda system. However, this seems like a less direct factor compared to others.\n\nOption C refers to the Spanish royal crown's desire to control the estates more directly. Over time, the crown became concerned about the power that encomenderos held and sought to centralize control. This led to reforms that limited the powers of encomenderos and increased direct royal administration.\n\nOption D mentions an increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas. Mestizos are people of mixed European and indigenous ancestry. If there was an increase in their numbers, and they were barred from encomiendas, this might have affected the labor force available for encomenderos.\n\nBut the question is which of these did NOT end the encomienda system. So, we need to think which one of these options wasn't a contributing factor to its termination.\n\nLet's consider each one:\n\nA: Missionaries' protests led to reforms, so this did contribute to the ending of the encomienda system.\n\nB: Lack of new land might have reduced the system's expansion but doesn't necessarily end it. Encomenderos could still hold onto existing encomiendas even if there was no new land to assign.\n\nC: The crown's desire for direct control led to reforms that curtailed the encomienda system, so this was a contributing factor.\n\nD: An increase in mestizos forbidden from working on encomiendas might have created labor shortages for encomenderos, potentially weakening the system.\n\nHowever, the key here is to find the option that did NOT end the encomienda system.\n\nOption D suggests that an increase in mestizos, who couldn't work on encomiendas, might have contributed to the system's end. But in reality, mestizos were often integrated into the social hierarchy in various ways, and their status could vary. It's not clear that their increase directly led to the end of the encomienda system.\n\nComparatively, options A, C, and B all have more direct links to the system's decline.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely D: an increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if this is accurate.\n\nFirst, missionaries' protests (A) did lead to the New Laws of 1542, which aimed to restrict the encomienda system.\n\nThe crown's desire for direct control (C) led to the eventual replacement of encomiendas with other forms of administration, like the repartimiento system.\n\nLack of new land (B) might have reduced the system's growth but wouldn't necessarily end existing encomiendas.\n\nAs for D, while an increase in mestizos might have social implications, it's not directly tied to the end of the encomienda system. Mestizos could have been absorbed into different parts of colonial society, not necessarily affecting the encomienda system's continuation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: an increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas, did NOT end the encomienda system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
