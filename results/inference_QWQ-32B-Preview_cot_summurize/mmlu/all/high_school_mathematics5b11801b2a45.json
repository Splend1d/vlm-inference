                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two equations:\n\n1. \\((2x + 3y)^2 = 4\\)\n\n2. \\(xy = -5\\)\n\nAnd we need to find the value of \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\).\n\nFirst, I notice that \\((2x + 3y)^2\\) expands to \\(4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2\\). So, from the first equation:\n\n\\[\n(2x + 3y)^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nWe're trying to find \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\), which is part of this expression. If I can isolate \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\), that would be great.\n\nLooking at the expanded form:\n\n\\[\n4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nI can subtract \\(12xy\\) from both sides to get:\n\n\\[\n4x^2 + 9y^2 = 4 - 12xy\n\\]\n\nNow, I know from the second equation that \\(xy = -5\\). So, plugging that in:\n\n\\[\n4x^2 + 9y^2 = 4 - 12(-5) = 4 + 60 = 64\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if there's any other consideration I should make.\n\nIs there a possibility of another solution or any constraints I might have missed?\n\nGiven that \\((2x + 3y)^2 = 4\\), this means that \\(2x + 3y = 2\\) or \\(2x + 3y = -2\\). But since we're squaring it, both cases lead to the same squared value.\n\nAlso, \\(xy = -5\\), which means one of them is positive, and the other is negative.\n\nBut in the calculation above, I didn't need to consider the individual values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), which is good because solving for both variables with only these two equations might be complicated.\n\nSo, it seems that \\(4x^2 + 9y^2 = 64\\) is the correct answer.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to express \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\) in terms of \\((2x + 3y)^2\\) and \\(xy\\).\n\nWe already did that above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could use substitution, solving for one variable in terms of the other from \\(xy = -5\\), and plugging into the first equation. But that might be more time-consuming.\n\nLet me try that quickly.\n\nFrom \\(xy = -5\\), we can express \\(x = -5/y\\).\n\nNow, plug this into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n(2(-5/y) + 3y)^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n(-10/y + 3y)^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nThis looks messy. Maybe it's better to stick with the first method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\) as part of the expression for \\((2x - 3y)^2\\), but I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nWait, actually, \\((2x - 3y)^2 = 4x^2 - 12xy + 9y^2\\). Hmm.\n\nSo, if I have \\(4x^2 + 9y^2 = 4 - 12xy\\) from earlier, and I know \\(xy = -5\\), then plugging in gives 4 + 60 = 64, as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider adding \\((2x + 3y)^2\\) and \\((2x - 3y)^2\\), but again, that might not be necessary.\n\nSo, I think the initial approach is solid, and the answer should be 64.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -5\n\nB. 13\n\nC. 64\n\nD. 25\n\nOption C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any possibility of a different answer.\n\nSuppose there's a mistake in assuming that \\(4x^2 + 9y^2 = 4 - 12xy\\).\n\nLet me re-express it:\n\nFrom \\((2x + 3y)^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 = 4\\), then indeed, \\(4x^2 + 9y^2 = 4 - 12xy\\).\n\nGiven \\(xy = -5\\), then \\(4x^2 + 9y^2 = 4 - 12(-5) = 4 + 60 = 64\\).\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to verify this by finding actual values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nFrom \\(xy = -5\\), and \\((2x + 3y)^2 = 4\\), maybe solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) explicitly.\n\nLet me attempt that.\n\nFrom \\(xy = -5\\), \\(x = -5/y\\).\n\nPlug into \\((2x + 3y)^2 = 4\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(2\\left(-\\frac{5}{y}\\right) + 3y\\right)^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{10}{y} + 3y\\right)^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nLet me set \\(z = y\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{10}{z} + 3z\\right)^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nTake square roots on both sides:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{10}{z} + 3z = 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad -\\frac{10}{z} + 3z = -2\n\\]\n\nLet's solve both equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{10}{z} + 3z = 2\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(z\\) (assuming \\(z \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[\n-10 + 3z^2 = 2z\n\\]\n\nRearrange:\n\n\\[\n3z^2 - 2z - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 120}}{6} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{124}}{6} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{31}}{6} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{31}}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(y = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{31}}{3}\\) or \\(y = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{31}}{3}\\).\n\nThen, \\(x = -5/y\\).\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{10}{z} + 3z = -2\n\\]\n\nMultiply by \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\n-10 + 3z^2 = -2z\n\\]\n\nRearrange:\n\n\\[\n3z^2 + 2z - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 120}}{6} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{124}}{6} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{31}}{6} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{31}}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(y = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{31}}{3}\\) or \\(y = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{31}}{3}\\).\n\n corresponding \\(x = -5/y\\).\n\nNow, plugging these values back into \\(4x^2 + 9y^2\\) should give us 64, as per our earlier calculation.\n\nBut since this involves messy square roots, and the initial algebraic manipulation led us to \\(4x^2 + 9y^2 = 64\\), I'm confident that 64 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{64}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]"
