                    "text": "So Theresa has 72 marbles, and she wants to put them into 9 equal groups. We need to find out how many marbles are in each group. Let's think about what operation we should use here.\n\nFirst, she's dividing the marbles into groups, right? So, division might be the way to go. Division is about splitting a total into equal parts. So, if she has 72 marbles and she's making 9 groups, we can divide 72 by 9 to find out how many marbles are in each group.\n\nLet me write that down: 72 \u00f7 9. If I do that calculation, 72 divided by 9 equals 8. So, each group would have 8 marbles.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 72 \u00f7 9 = 8\n\nThat matches what I just did.\n\nB. 72 \u2013 9 = 63\n\nSubtraction doesn't make sense in this context because we're not taking away marbles, we're dividing them into groups.\n\nC. 9 + 72 = 81\n\nAddition isn't appropriate here because we're not combining marbles in a way that would require addition.\n\nD. 9 \u00f7 72 = 0.125\n\nThis is dividing the number of groups by the total number of marbles, which doesn't give us the number of marbles per group.\n\nSo, the correct number sentence is A. 72 \u00f7 9 = 8.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. If she has 72 marbles and makes 9 groups with 8 marbles each, that adds up to 9 times 8, which is 72. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if she had 72 marbles and she subtracted 9, she'd have 63 marbles left, which doesn't relate to dividing into groups.\n\nAdding 9 and 72 gives 81, which isn't relevant to the problem.\n\nAnd dividing 9 by 72 gives a decimal, which isn't helpful for finding the number of marbles per group.\n\nSo, definitely, A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
