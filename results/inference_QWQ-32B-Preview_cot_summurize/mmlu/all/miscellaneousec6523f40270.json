                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about chili peppers, and I need to figure out which one of these options isn't a type of chili pepper. The options are A. habanero, B. cheyenne, C. jalapero, and D. guajillo. I think I know a bit about chili peppers, but maybe not all of these.\n\nFirst, habanero is definitely a type of chili pepper. I've heard of it before; it's known for being pretty spicy. So, A is probably not the answer.\n\nNext, cheyenne. I'm not sure about this one. I know there's a type of pepper called the Cheyenne pepper, but I'm not entirely sure if it's a chili pepper specifically. Maybe I should look that up later, but for now, I'll keep it in mind.\n\nThen, jalapero. Wait, I think there might be a typo here. I believe it's supposed to be \"jalape\u00f1o\" with a tilde over the n. Jalape\u00f1os are definitely a type of chili pepper. They're pretty common in Mexican cuisine and used in lots of dishes. So, C might not be the answer, but maybe there's a trick here with the spelling.\n\nLastly, guajillo. I'm familiar with guajillo chili peppers; they're used in many Latin American cuisines, especially in Mexico. So, D is probably not the answer either.\n\nHmm, so if all of these are types of chili peppers, maybe the question is tricking me. Alternatively, perhaps one of them is not actually a chili pepper. Let me think again.\n\nCheyenne: I recall that there is a pepper called the Cheyenne pepper, and it's often used in gardens for its ornamental value. It's red and pretty, but I'm not sure if it's considered a chili pepper in terms of its heat or usage in cooking.\n\nJalapero: I think it's probably a misspelling, and it should be jalape\u00f1o. Jalape\u00f1os are definitely chili peppers.\n\nMaybe the answer is C, jalapero, because it's misspelled, and the question is trying to trick me by using an incorrect spelling. Or perhaps it's cheyenne, as it might not be considered a chili pepper in the same way as the others.\n\nLet me consider the context. The question is \"Which of these is not a type of chili pepper?\" So, it's about identifying which one isn't a chili pepper. If jalapero is a misspelling of jalape\u00f1o, which is a chili pepper, then it would be incorrect to say it's not a chili pepper. Therefore, perhaps cheyenne is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe cheyenne is a type of pepper, but not specifically a chili pepper, meaning it doesn't have the same characteristics or heat level.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all of these are chili peppers, and the question is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that cheyenne is a type of sweet pepper, not a chili pepper. Is that possible?\n\nLet me try to recall: habanero is spicy, jalape\u00f1o is spicy, guajillo is spicy, and cheyenne might be sweet.\n\nYes, I think cheyenne peppers are sweet peppers, not hot peppers. Therefore, they aren't chili peppers, which are known for their heat.\n\nSo, in that case, the answer would be B. cheyenne.\n\nBut wait, I think some cheyenne peppers can be hot. I'm a bit confused now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe cheyenne is a variety that includes both sweet and hot peppers. I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cheyenne is a type of pepper that's not typically classified as a chili pepper.\n\nGiven that, perhaps cheyenne is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting guajillo, but that seems unlikely because guajillo is definitely a chili pepper.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps jalapero is the answer because of the misspelling, and the question is trying to trick me into thinking it's jalape\u00f1o, which is a chili pepper.\n\nBut that seems like a cheap trick.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps habanero is not considered a chili pepper, but that doesn't make sense because habanero is a type of chili pepper.\n\nWait, maybe habanero is a type of pepper, but not a chili pepper. No, that's not correct.\n\nI think habanero is a variety of chili pepper.\n\nSimilarly, guajillo is a variety of chili pepper.\n\nJalape\u00f1o is a variety of chili pepper.\n\nCheyenne might be a variety of sweet pepper.\n\nTherefore, cheyenne is not a chili pepper, making option B the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cheyenne is a type of chili pepper that I'm not familiar with.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider that all of these are chili peppers, and the question is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C, jalapero, due to the misspelling.\n\nBut that seems like a tricky answer, and I don't like relying on spelling mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps guajillo is not a chili pepper, but I know that's not true.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best answer is B, cheyenne, assuming that cheyenne peppers are not chili peppers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
