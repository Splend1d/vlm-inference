This can include a wide range of offenses, such as hacking, identity theft, phishing, malware distribution, cyberstalking, and online harassment, among others.\n\nOption A is partially correct but too narrow in scope. While some cyber-crimes do target national security, many others do not. Cyber-crime is not limited to activities that threaten national security; it encompasses a broad spectrum of illegal activities that can affect individuals, organizations, and governments alike.\n\nOption B is also partially correct but again too narrow. Financial and identity fraud are indeed significant components of cyber-crime, but they are not the only types of offenses committed in the digital realm. Cyber-crime includes a variety of other illegal activities beyond just financial and identity fraud.\n\nOption C, the theft of digital information, is another aspect of cyber-crime but again, it is not comprehensive. While information theft is a common form of cyber-crime, there are many other types of crimes that fall under this category, such as cyberbullying, online scams, and the distribution of illegal content.\n\nOption D is the most accurate and inclusive definition provided. It states that cyber-crime includes any crime that involves computers and networks. This broad definition encompasses all the various forms of illegal activities that are committed using digital technologies, whether they target individuals, businesses, or governmental entities.\n\nIn summary, cyber-crime is a broad term that refers to any criminal activity that involves the use of computers, networks, or other digital devices. It includes a wide range of offenses beyond just those that threaten national security, involve financial fraud, or entail the theft of digital information. Therefore, the best answer is D: Any crime that involves computers and networks."
