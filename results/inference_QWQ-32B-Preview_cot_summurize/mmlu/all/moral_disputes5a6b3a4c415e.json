                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about Kass's view on human reproductive cloning and the role of repugnance in moral judgment. So, the question is: According to Kass, the fact that people (like him) feel repugnance at the thought of human reproductive cloning\n\nA. shows conclusively that reproductive cloning is always wrong.\n\nB. shows conclusively that reproductive cloning is sometimes wrong.\n\nC. has nothing to do with the morality of cloning.\n\nD. is a sign that something is wrong with reproductive cloning.\n\nI need to figure out which option best represents Kass's perspective. I recall that Kass is known for his work in bioethics and has written about the moral significance of revulsion or repugnance in evaluating certain practices, including cloning.\n\nFirst, I should think about what repugnance means in this context. Repugnance is a strong feeling of dislike or aversion. Kass argues that such feelings can be a source of moral insight, suggesting that they may reflect deep-seated human intuitions about what is right or wrong.\n\nOption A says that feeling repugnance shows conclusively that cloning is always wrong. That seems pretty strong. Is Kass saying that just because someone feels repugnance, that settles the matter definitively? I don't think so. He might see repugnance as a reason to look deeper into the issue, but not as the final word.\n\nOption B says that repugnance shows that cloning is sometimes wrong. This is a bit nuanced. Maybe Kass thinks that repugnance indicates that cloning can be wrong in certain cases, but not universally. Hmm, possible, but I need to recall his exact stance.\n\nOption C claims that repugnance has nothing to do with the morality of cloning. This seems contrary to Kass's views, as he does believe that moral revulsion can be a sign of moral problems.\n\nOption D says that repugnance is a sign that something is wrong with cloning. This aligns with Kass's perspective that repugnance can be a moral emotion signaling that there is an issue worthy of concern.\n\nLet me think back to what I've read about Kass. In his essay \"The Wisdom of Repugnance,\" he discusses how repugnance can be a guide to moral truth, especially in the realm of bioethics. He argues that our revulsion toward certain practices, like cloning, is not just a baseless emotion but can reflect a prudent apprehension of what might be dangerous or degrading to human dignity.\n\nSo, according to Kass, repugnance shouldn't be dismissed outright but should be considered as a starting point for moral reflection. He doesn't claim that repugnance alone is sufficient to determine the morality of an action, but it is an important indicator that there may be moral concerns worth investigating.\n\nGiven that, option D seems the most accurate: repugnance is a sign that something is wrong with reproductive cloning. It suggests that there is cause for moral concern, even if further analysis is needed to fully understand the issues.\n\nOption A is too absolute. Kass doesn't suggest that repugnance alone can conclusively determine that something is always wrong. He recognizes that moral reasoning requires more than just emotional responses.\n\nOption B, \"sometimes wrong,\" might be closer, but it's not as precise as option D. Kass is more focused on the idea that repugnance signals a moral problem rather than making a judgment about the frequency or specific instances where cloning might be wrong.\n\nOption C is clearly contrary to Kass's view, as he does see a connection between repugnance and morality.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D: is a sign that something is wrong with reproductive cloning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
