So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I called the fire station because my kitchen was on fire.\"\n\nOkay, so in this situation, someone's kitchen is on fire, and they call the fire station. Is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, calling the fire station when there's an actual fire is exactly what you're supposed to do. It's a responsible action that can save lives and property. So, I don't think there's anything morally wrong with this.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I sold hot brownies at the school bake sale.\"\n\nHmm, selling brownies at a school bake sale. Is that morally wrong?\n\nSelling baked goods at a school event is a common activity, often for fundraising or as part of a school event. It's generally considered a positive thing, especially if it's for a good cause or to support the school. So, again, I don't see anything morally wrong with this.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to these scenarios. Maybe there's some context or hidden details that I'm missing.\n\nLet me look back at Scenario 1. \"I called the fire station because my kitchen was on fire.\" Is there any way this could be morally wrong?\n\nWell, unless the kitchen wasn't actually on fire, and the person was falsely reporting an emergency. But in the scenario, it says \"because my kitchen was on fire,\" which implies that there actually was a fire. So, in that case, calling for help is the right thing to do.\n\nWhat about Scenario 2? \"I sold hot brownies at the school bake sale.\"\n\nCould there be something wrong with selling brownies at a bake sale?\n\nMaybe if the brownies were made with ingredients that could harm people, or if the sale was fraudulent in some way. But again, based on the information given, it seems like a normal bake sale activity.\n\nPerhaps the question is trying to trick me by presenting innocuous scenarios and seeing if I jump to assuming there's something wrong.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both of these actions seem perfectly acceptable and even commendable in their contexts.\n\nSo, if I had to choose from the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nUnless, of course, there's more to the scenarios that isn't being told here. But based on what's provided, both actions seem morally acceptable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
