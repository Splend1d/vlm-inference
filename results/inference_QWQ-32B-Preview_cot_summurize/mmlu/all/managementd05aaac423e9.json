These dimensions are skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and job feedback. So, among the options provided, A. Task identity, B. Autonomy, and D. Feedback are all part of the job characteristics model.\n\nOption C. Reward is not explicitly one of the five core job dimensions in the job characteristics model. However, it's worth noting that rewards can influence job satisfaction and performance indirectly. The model focuses more on the intrinsic characteristics of the job itself rather than external rewards.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Reward.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nHackman, J.
