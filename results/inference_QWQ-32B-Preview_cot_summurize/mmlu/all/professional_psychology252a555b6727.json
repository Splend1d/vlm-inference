                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about the differences between traditional research and program evaluation. I need to find out which statement is NOT true about those differences. Okay, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Program evaluation questions are often identified through the needs of a program\u2019s staff and stakeholders, while traditional research questions are identified by researchers using previous, existing research.\" Hmm, that sounds right. Program evaluation is usually driven by the practical needs of the program, so the questions come from what the program staff and stakeholders need to know. On the other hand, traditional research is more about building on existing knowledge, so researchers look at previous studies to find gaps or areas to explore further. So, this seems accurate.\n\nOption B: \"Program evaluation uses unique quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect data. These methods are different from those that are used in traditional research.\" Now, I'm a bit unsure here. I know that both program evaluation and traditional research use quantitative and qualitative methods, but I'm not sure if program evaluation uses uniquely different methods. Maybe they use similar methods but adapt them to fit the specific needs of the program being evaluated. I think it's possible that some methods might be similar, but the way they're applied could differ. So, this statement might not be entirely accurate.\n\nOption C: \"Traditional research and program evaluation have different aims. Traditional research aims to test existing theories and discover generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation aims to collect information important for timely decision-making.\" Yeah, that makes sense. Traditional research is all about contributing to the body of knowledge, testing hypotheses, and making generalizations that can apply to broader contexts. Program evaluation, on the other hand, is more about providing useful information to make decisions about a specific program\u2014whether it's working, how it can be improved, and so on. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption D: \"Both traditional research and program evaluation may incorporate rigorous and systematic ways of collecting data in order to address their aims.\" Absolutely. Both approaches need to be systematic and rigorous to ensure that the data collected is reliable and valid. The methods might differ, but the underlying principle of rigor remains the same. So, this is true.\n\nOkay, so looking back, option B seems to be the one that's not entirely true. While program evaluation does use quantitative and qualitative methodologies, I don't think these methods are uniquely different from those used in traditional research. Maybe they are applied differently, but the methods themselves aren't necessarily unique to program evaluation.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
