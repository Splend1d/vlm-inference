But I'm not entirely sure, maybe it's a bit earlier or later. I should look it up to make sure.\n\nLet me think about this. My cousin's baby just started walking, and she told me he was about 1 year old when he took his first steps. So that seems to match with option C.\n\nBut I also recall that some babies walk earlier, like at 9 months, and some walk later, maybe at 15 or 16 months. So maybe 12 months is the average.\n\nI should consider the developmental milestones for babies. I know that sitting up, crawling, standing, and then walking are all part of their motor skill development. Maybe there's a standard timeline for when these milestones typically occur.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, children usually start walking independently between 12 and 18 months of age. So that would make options A and B too early, and D a bit late, but still within the normal range.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the typical age when children take their first steps, not when they walk independently. Maybe there's a difference.\n\nUpon further reflection, taking first steps might happen a bit earlier than walking independently. Some babies take their first steps around 10 or 11 months, but they might not be walking confidently until closer to 12 months.\n\nBut I think the general consensus is that most children start walking around 12 months. So, I'll go with C. 12 months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
