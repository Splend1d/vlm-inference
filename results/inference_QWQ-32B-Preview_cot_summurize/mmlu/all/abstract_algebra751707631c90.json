Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what a homomorphism is. A homomorphism is a function between two algebraic structures that preserves the operations. Here, we're dealing with groups, so it should preserve the group operation, which is addition in both Z and Z_2.\n\nSo, if \u03c6: Z \u2192 Z_2 is a homomorphism, then for any a, b in Z, \u03c6(a + b) = \u03c6(a) + \u03c6(b), where the addition on the left is in Z and on the right is in Z_2.\n\nNow, Z is the group of integers under addition, and Z_2 is the group with two elements, usually {0, 1}, also under addition modulo 2.\n\nI recall that Z is a cyclic group generated by 1, meaning every element in Z can be written as n*1 for some integer n.\n\nSo, if I can determine \u03c6(1), then I can determine \u03c6(n) for any n in Z, because \u03c6(n) = \u03c6(1 + 1 + ... + 1) = \u03c6(1) + \u03c6(1) + ... + \u03c6(1) = n*\u03c6(1) in Z_2.\n\nWait, but in Z_2, addition is modulo 2, so if \u03c6(1) = 0, then \u03c6(n) = 0 for all n. If \u03c6(1) = 1, then \u03c6(n) = n mod 2.\n\nSo, it seems like there are two possible homomorphisms:\n\n1. The trivial homomorphism where \u03c6(n) = 0 for all n in Z.\n\n2. The homomorphism where \u03c6(n) = n mod 2.\n\nAre there any others? Let's think about it.\n\nSuppose there was another homomorphism where \u03c6(1) = something else. But Z_2 only has two elements, 0 and 1. So \u03c6(1) can only be 0 or 1. That means only two possible homomorphisms.\n\nWait, but let's double-check if these are indeed homomorphisms.\n\nFirst, the trivial homomorphism \u03c6(n) = 0 for all n.\n\nCheck: \u03c6(a + b) = 0 = 0 + 0 = \u03c6(a) + \u03c6(b). So yes, that works.\n\nSecond, \u03c6(n) = n mod 2.\n\nCheck: \u03c6(a + b) = (a + b) mod 2 = (a mod 2) + (b mod 2) = \u03c6(a) + \u03c6(b). So that also works.\n\nAre there any other possibilities? If I try to define \u03c6 in some other way, say, \u03c6(n) = 0 for even n and \u03c6(n) = 1 for odd n, that's the same as \u03c6(n) = n mod 2, which is the second homomorphism.\n\nOr \u03c6(n) = 0 for all n, which is the first one.\n\nSo, only two options.\n\nWait, but maybe there are more complicated ways to define \u03c6. For example, could I define \u03c6 based on higher powers of n or something? But since Z is infinite cyclic, any homomorphism is determined by where it sends the generator 1.\n\nAnd since \u03c6 is a homomorphism, it has to satisfy \u03c6(a + b) = \u03c6(a) + \u03c6(b), so no matter what, \u03c6(n) = n * \u03c6(1).\n\nIn Z_2, \u03c6(1) can only be 0 or 1, leading to the two cases above.\n\nTherefore, there are only two homomorphisms from Z to Z_2.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2.\n\nBut let's see if there could be infinitely many homomorphisms somehow.\n\nSuppose I try to define \u03c6 in different ways for different subsets of Z. But again, since Z is cyclic, any homomorphism is determined by \u03c6(1), and \u03c6(1) can only be 0 or 1 in Z_2.\n\nTherefore, only two possibilities.\n\nI don't think there are infinitely many homomorphisms here.\n\nAlternatively, if \u03c6(1) were allowed to be any element in Z_2, but Z_2 only has two elements, so still only two choices.\n\nHence, the answer is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
