The options are:\n\nA. 240 to 680 nm.\n\nB. 360 to 620 nm.\n\nC. 380 to 740 nm.\n\nD. 420 to 810 nm.\n\nI remember that the visible spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that humans can see, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact wavelength range.\n\nI think visible light is somewhere in the range of a few hundred nanometers to a thousand or so. Let me think about this.\n\nI recall that violet light has shorter wavelengths and red has longer wavelengths. I think violet is around 400 nanometers and red is around 700 nanometers. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.\n\nLet me check option A: 240 to 680 nm. 240 nm seems too low; that's in the ultraviolet range, isn't it? UV light is shorter than visible light. So maybe A is not correct.\n\nOption B: 360 to 620 nm. 360 nm is still in the ultraviolet, I believe. And 620 nm is orange light, I think. So maybe B is partially correct but includes UV wavelengths.\n\nOption C: 380 to 740 nm. 380 nm sounds familiar; I've heard that as the start of the visible spectrum, violet light. And 740 nm is in the red range, maybe a little into the infrared. This seems plausible.\n\nOption D: 420 to 810 nm. 420 nm is blue light, and 810 nm is in the infrared range. So this seems too high on the upper end.\n\nConsidering this, option C seems the most accurate. But I should double-check.\n\nI know that the visible spectrum starts around 380 nm with violet and goes up to about 700-750 nm with red light. Some people can see a bit beyond these ranges, but generally, 380 to 740 nm covers the visible spectrum.\n\nAlso, option A includes wavelengths below 400 nm, which is UV, and option D goes up to 810 nm, which is infrared. So they include non-visible light.\n\nOption B is closer, but starting at 360 nm still includes some UV wavelengths.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. 380 to 740 nm.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should confirm the exact range of visible light. Maybe I can look it up in a textbook or a reliable source.\n\nWait, I don't have any resources right now, so I'll have to go with my memory.\n\nI'm fairly confident that 380 to 740 nm is the accepted range for the visible spectrum.\n\nSo, I'll go with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
