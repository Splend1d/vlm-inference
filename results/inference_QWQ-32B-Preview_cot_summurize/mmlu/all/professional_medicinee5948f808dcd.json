                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 76-year-old man who's coming in because he's waking up too early in the morning. He says he has no trouble falling asleep, but he consistently wakes up between 2 and 3 AM. He's a retired postal worker, physically active, and manages his diabetes with diet. He has a mild blood pressure of 135/90, which is a bit on the higher side but not overly concerning. He drinks one cup of coffee in the morning and has one alcoholic beverage before bed. His wife is in good health, and he doesn't have a history of depression, nightmares, or snoring. He also doesn't take any over-the-counter medications.\n\nSo, the main issue is this early-morning awakening. Insomnia is generally categorized into different types: trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early. In this case, it's the early waking that's the problem. The question is, what's the most appropriate management for this patient's insomnia?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Advise the patient to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol.\n\nB. Advise the patient to read and snack in bed to relax.\n\nC. Prescribe a vigorous pre-bedtime exercise regimen.\n\nD. Prescribe sertraline.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: discontinuing alcohol before bed. Alcohol can affect sleep architecture. It might help you fall asleep, but it can also cause disruptions in sleep later in the night. So, it's possible that the alcohol is contributing to his early waking. Advising him to stop or reduce his bedtime drink could be a reasonable first step.\n\nOption B suggests reading and snacking in bed to relax. Now, generally, it's recommended to associate bed with sleep and sex only, not with other activities like reading or eating, because it can condition your body to see bed as a place for alert activities rather than for sleep. So, this might not be the best advice.\n\nOption C is to prescribe a vigorous pre-bedtime exercise regimen. Exercise is good for sleep, but timing is important. Vigorous exercise close to bedtime can actually interfere with sleep because it increases alertness and heart rate. It's generally better to exercise earlier in the day.\n\nOption D is to prescribe sertraline, which is an antidepressant. Antidepressants are sometimes used off-label for insomnia, but given that the patient has no history of depression, and his insomnia seems relatively mild and possibly related to lifestyle factors, starting medication might be jumping the gun.\n\nSo, considering these points, option A seems like the most appropriate initial management: advising the patient to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol. It's a non-invasive, low-risk intervention that might directly address a contributing factor to his sleep disruption.\n\nBut let's think a bit more. The patient is physically active, manages his diabetes well, and has no significant health issues. His blood pressure is a bit high, but it's not severely elevated. Maybe monitoring his blood pressure and considering lifestyle modifications for that could be helpful, but it's not directly related to his sleep issue.\n\nAlso, since he's waking up early but has no trouble falling asleep, it might be a circadian rhythm issue. As people age, their sleep patterns can change, and they might naturally wake up earlier. However, since he's only 76, which is not extremely old, and he's otherwise healthy, it's worth exploring behavioral factors first.\n\nAnother thing to consider is his caffeine intake. He only has one cup of coffee in the morning, which shouldn't have a significant effect on nighttime sleep, especially since it's many hours before bedtime.\n\nSnoring and sleep apnea are not issues here, as he doesn't snore, so that's less likely to be a cause.\n\nGiven all this, starting with advising him to discontinue his bedtime alcohol drink seems like the most logical first step. If that doesn't help, then further evaluation or other interventions could be considered.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
