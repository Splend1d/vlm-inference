                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of the following is a fundamental economic question?\" And then there are four options:\n\nA. Who will get how much of each good and service?\n\nB. Who should pay taxes?\n\nC. Who will work?\n\nD. Who will make the economic decisions?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what fundamental economic questions are. I remember that economics is all about dealing with scarcity and making choices because we can't have everything we want. So, fundamental economic questions are basically about how societies decide what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom to produce it. These are often summarized as:\n\n1. What to produce?\n\n2. How to produce?\n\n3. For whom to produce?\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. \"Who will get how much of each good and service?\" This seems to be related to the \"for whom to produce\" question. So, that might be a fundamental economic question.\n\nB. \"Who should pay taxes?\" Hmm, taxes are a way for governments to raise revenue, but is this directly a fundamental economic question? It's more about funding government activities, which is important, but is it one of the core economic questions?\n\nC. \"Who will work?\" This seems related to the labor market and who participates in the workforce. While important, I'm not sure if it's one of the fundamental economic questions.\n\nD. \"Who will make the economic decisions?\" This might be related to the economic system a society chooses\u2014like capitalism, socialism, etc.\u2014which determines who makes the decisions about what, how, and for whom to produce.\n\nWait a minute, maybe all of these are related to fundamental economic questions in some way. But the question is asking which ONE is a fundamental economic question.\n\nLet me think again. The core economic questions are what to produce, how to produce, and for whom to produce. So, option A seems to be directly related to \"for whom to produce.\"\n\nOption D, \"who will make the economic decisions,\" is actually about the economic system and who has the authority to make decisions regarding what, how, and for whom to produce. So, it's more about the decision-making process in the economy.\n\nOption B, \"who should pay taxes,\" is more specific to government finance and revenue collection, which is a part of public economics but maybe not a fundamental economic question.\n\nOption C, \"who will work,\" is about labor participation, which is important for production, but again, it's more specific and not one of the core three questions.\n\nSo, between A and D, both seem relevant, but A is more directly aligned with one of the core economic questions, which is \"for whom to produce.\"\n\nMaybe the question is trying to get at the fact that fundamental economic questions include not just what, how, and for whom, but also how the economy is organized in terms of decision-making.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that fundamental economic questions encompass a broader set of issues.\n\nLet me check my textbook or notes to confirm.\n\nOkay, according to my economics textbook, the basic economic problems arise from scarcity and the need to make choices. The three fundamental questions are:\n\n1. What goods and services should be produced?\n\n2. How should these goods and services be produced?\n\n3. Who should receive the goods and services produced?\n\nSo, \"who should receive the goods and services\" aligns with option A, \"who will get how much of each good and service.\"\n\nOption D, \"who will make the economic decisions,\" is related but perhaps not exactly one of the core three questions.\n\nTherefore, based on this, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"which of the following is a fundamental economic question.\" Maybe more than one could be considered fundamental, but probably they expect only one answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the fundamental economic questions include not just the three core ones, but also questions about how the economy is organized.\n\nIn that case, option D could also be considered fundamental.\n\nHowever, given that the core three are what, how, and for whom to produce, and option A directly relates to \"for whom to produce,\" I think A is the safest answer.\n\nOption B and C seem more specific and not as central to the core economic problems.\n\nSo, I'll go with A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
