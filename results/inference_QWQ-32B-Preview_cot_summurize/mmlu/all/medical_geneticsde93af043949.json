The options are A. 1 in 10, B. 1 in 50, C. 1 in 100 to 1 in 200, and D. 1 in 1000. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what amniocentesis is. Amniocentesis is a prenatal test where a small amount of amniotic fluid is removed from the uterus for testing. It's usually done to detect chromosomal abnormalities, genetic disorders, or neural tube defects in the fetus.\n\nNow, regarding the risk of miscarriage. I know that amniocentesis is an invasive procedure, which means there is a small risk of complications, including miscarriage. But I'm not sure about the exact statistics.\n\nLet me think about this. I remember that the risk is relatively low, but not zero. Option A says 1 in 10, which is 10%, that seems too high. Option B is 1 in 50, which is 2%, that might be possible. Option C is 1 in 100 to 1 in 200, which is 1% to 0.5%, and Option D is 1 in 1000, which is 0.1%.\n\nI think the risk is higher than 0.1%, so Option D might be too low. Between Options B and C, I need to decide.\n\nI recall that in my biology class, the teacher mentioned that the risk of miscarriage from amniocentesis is about 1 in 100 to 1 in 200. That would make Option C the correct answer.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I should look it up. However, since this is a question I need to answer now, I'll go with my memory.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. 1 in 100 to 1 in 200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
