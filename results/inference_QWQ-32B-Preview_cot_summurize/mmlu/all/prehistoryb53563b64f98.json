                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on my human evolution timeline, but I think I can figure this out. So, Homo habilis is considered one of the earliest members of the genus Homo, known for their use of tools. I recall that they lived quite a long time ago, probably around 2 or 3 million years ago. Homo erectus came later; they were the first to really spread out of Africa and are known for their more human-like body proportions.\n\nLet me see the options:\n\nA. 4.5 million; 3.2 million\n\nB. 3.6 million; 2.8 million\n\nC. 2.5 million; 1.8 million\n\nD. 1.4 million; 800,000\n\nOption A has Homo habilis at 4.5 million years ago and Homo erectus at 3.2 million years ago. But I think Homo habilis emerged a bit later than that. I think 4.5 million years ago is before the split between chimpanzees and humans, so that might be too early.\n\nOption B has Homo habilis at 3.6 million years ago and Homo erectus at 2.8 million years ago. That seems plausible. I think Homo habilis did emerge around 2.8 to 1.5 million years ago, so 3.6 might be a bit early, but it's possible.\n\nOption C has Homo habilis at 2.5 million years ago and Homo erectus at 1.8 million years ago. This seems more in line with what I remember. Homo habilis is often dated to around 2.8 to 1.5 million years ago, and Homo erectus from about 1.8 million years ago to about 140,000 years ago.\n\nOption D has Homo habilis at 1.4 million years ago and Homo erectus at 800,000 years ago. That seems too recent for Homo habilis, as they are thought to have existed earlier than that.\n\nLet me double-check. I know that Homo habilis lived alongside some Australopithecines, who were around until about 2 million years ago. So, if Homo habilis emerged around 2.5 million years ago, that would make sense.\n\nHomo erectus, on the other hand, emerged after Homo habilis, so around 1.8 million years ago seems about right.\n\nI think option C is the correct one: Homo habilis emerged around 2.5 million years ago, and Homo erectus followed at around 1.8 million years ago.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should confirm these dates. Maybe I can look them up online or in a textbook, but since this is a quiz question, I'll have to go with my best guess based on memory.\n\nSo, I'll choose C. 2.5 million; 1.8 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
