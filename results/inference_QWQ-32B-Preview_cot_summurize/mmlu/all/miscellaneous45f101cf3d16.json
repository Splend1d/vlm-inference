This seems like a good idea because the glass can protect the sculptures from physical contact and dust. But I wonder if the glass might be breakable itself, and if that could pose a risk to the sculptures inside.\n\nB. On a series of pedestals. Pedestals are solid structures, so they might provide a stable base for the sculptures. However, if the pedestals are not secured to the floor, they could be knocked over, potentially damaging the sculptures.\n\nC. On wall-mounted shelves with sturdier works around them. This could provide a good display arrangement, but I'm not sure if having sturdier works around the fragile ones would actually offer any protection. Maybe it's more about visual balance than security.\n\nD. In shadow boxes with signs that read \"Do Not Touch.\" Shadow boxes are enclosed displays, similar to glass cases, but signs might not be enough to prevent people from trying to touch the sculptures.\n\nConsidering these options, I think the most secure way would be to place the fragile works in glass-paneled cases (option A). The glass provides a physical barrier that prevents direct contact, which is a major cause of damage to fragile items. Additionally, glass cases can be locked or have alarms to deter vandalism.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the potential drawbacks. For example, if the glass is not tempered or reinforced, it could break and potentially harm the sculptures inside. Also, depending on the design of the case, it might be difficult to clean or maintain the sculptures.\n\nComparatively, placing sculptures on pedestals (option B) might be less secure because pedestals can be bumped or knocked over, especially in areas with high foot traffic. While pedestals can be weighted or secured to the floor, there's still a risk.\n\nOption C, placing fragile sculptures on wall-mounted shelves surrounded by sturdier works, might offer some visual protection, but in terms of actual security, it doesn't seem to provide much. If someone wants to touch or damage a fragile sculpture, the presence of sturdier works nearby wouldn't necessarily stop them.\n\nOption D, using shadow boxes with signs, combines some protection from the shadow box but relies on signage to prevent touching. While this might discourage some people, it doesn't offer physical protection like a locked glass case would.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that placing fragile works of sculpture in glass-paneled cases (option A) is the most secure method among the choices provided. It provides a physical barrier that protects the sculptures from direct contact and potential damage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
