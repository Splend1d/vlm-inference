                    "text": "I'm going to attempt to answer this question about what Ross considers justice to be. I don't remember Ross's exact definition off the top of my head, but I think I can reason through this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Ross is. I believe Ross refers to W.D. Ross, a British philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly his theory of prima facie duties. So, in the context of ethics, justice would be one of the moral principles he discusses.\n\nOption A says justice is when all laws are followed. That seems too broad and perhaps too legalistic. While following laws is important, justice is often considered a deeper moral concept that may sometimes require breaking unjust laws. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption B mentions justice as adherence to contracts and promises. This sounds more like fidelity or keeping one's word, which is certainly an ethical duty, but I'm not sure if this fully captures justice as Ross would define it.\n\nOption C talks about the distribution of happiness in accordance with merit. This seems related to the idea of distributive justice, where goods and benefits are allocated based on merit or need. Ross does discuss justice in terms of giving people their due, so this might be a strong candidate.\n\nOption D is about punishing the guilty for their crimes. This sounds like retributive justice, which is another aspect of justice. Ross might consider this as part of justice, but I need to think about which one he emphasizes.\n\nLet me try to recall Ross's perspective. Ross's ethical theory is deontological, emphasizing various prima facie duties such as fidelity, reparation, gratitude, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Justice, in his view, is about giving each person their due, which could involve both rewarding merit and punishing wrongdoing.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C seems closest to giving people their due in terms of happiness based on merit, while option D is about punishing the guilty, which is another aspect of justice.\n\nPerhaps Ross sees justice as encompassing both rewarding merit and punishing demerit. But among the given options, C and D both seem relevant.\n\nWait, maybe Ross has a more specific definition. I think in his work, he discusses justice in terms of giving people what they deserve, which could include both positive and negative consequences based on their actions or merits.\n\nOption C focuses on the distribution of happiness according to merit, which aligns with giving people what they deserve in terms of benefits. Option D is about punishing the guilty, which is giving them what they deserve in terms of penalties.\n\nPerhaps Ross would consider both as aspects of justice, but in this multiple-choice question, I need to pick one.\n\nMaybe the question is referencing a specific statement by Ross where he defines justice in one of these ways.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is misattributed, and Ross actually defines justice differently.\n\nLet me consider if there's another philosopher named Ross who discusses justice differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's David Ross, but I think that's the same as W.D. Ross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different Ross.\n\nIn any case, assuming it's W.D. Ross, I need to think about his ethical theory.\n\nIn Ross's ethics, justice is one of the prima facie duties, alongside others like fidelity and non-maleficence.\n\nHe argues that justice involves giving each person what is rightfully theirs, which could include both positive goods and negative sanctions.\n\nGiven that, both options C and D seem relevant, but I need to choose one.\n\nOption C mentions the distribution of happiness in accordance with merit, which aligns with giving people what they deserve based on their merit.\n\nOption D is about punishing the guilty for their crimes, which is also giving people what they deserve, but in terms of punishment.\n\nPerhaps Ross emphasizes the idea of desert in justice, which would include both rewarding merit and punishing demerit.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for a single answer, and both C and D seem plausible, I need to decide which one is more central to Ross's conception of justice.\n\nLooking back at his writing, I recall that Ross discusses justice in terms of giving people their due, which can include both benefits and punishments.\n\nBut in this question, options C and D present two different aspects of that.\n\nPerhaps the question is designed to highlight the distributive aspect of justice, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, it might be focusing on the retributive aspect, which is option D.\n\nGiven that, I need to think about which one is more fundamental in Ross's view.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Ross defines justice primarily in terms of keeping promises and contracts, which is option B.\n\nWait, option B is about adhering to contracts and promises, which seems more related to fidelity than justice.\n\nIn Ross's framework, fidelity is a separate prima facie duty from justice.\n\nTherefore, option B might not be the best answer.\n\nOption A, about following all laws, seems more related to legal obedience than to moral justice.\n\nTherefore, between options C and D, I need to choose.\n\nConsidering that justice often involves both rewarding merit and punishing wrongdoing, perhaps Ross sees justice as encompassing both.\n\nHowever, since I have to pick one, I'll go with option C, as it seems more aligned with the idea of distributive justice, which is a central aspect of justice in many ethical theories.\n\nAdditionally, option D seems more specific to retributive justice, which is an important aspect but perhaps not the entirety of justice as Ross conceives it.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: when the distribution of happiness is in accordance with merit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
