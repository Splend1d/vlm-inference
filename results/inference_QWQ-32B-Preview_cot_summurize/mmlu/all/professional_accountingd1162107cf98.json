If the revaluation increase exceeds the revaluation decrease recognized in profit or loss, the excess is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nLet's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Year 1:**\n   - Acquired land for $100,000.\n   - At the end of year 1, the carrying amount was reduced to $90,000, which is the fair value at that date.\n   - This reduction of $10,000 ($100,000 - $90,000) is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n2. **Year 2:**\n   - The land is revalued again, and the fair value increases to $105,000.\n   - The revaluation increase is $15,000 ($105,000 - $90,000).\n\nNow, according to IFRS, the revaluation increase should first be used to reverse any previous revaluation decreases that were recognized in profit or loss. In this case, the previous revaluation decrease was $10,000, which was recognized in profit or loss in year 1.\n\nTherefore, the first $10,000 of the $15,000 revaluation increase in year 2 should reverse the previous decrease recognized in profit or loss. This means that $10,000 should be recognized in profit or loss (reversing the earlier decrease), and the remaining $5,000 should be recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nHowever, reviewing the options provided:\n\nA. By recognizing $10,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nB. By recognizing $15,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nC. By recognizing $15,000 in profit or loss.\n\nD. By recognizing $10,000 in profit or loss and $5,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe correct approach, based on IFRS revaluation model principles, would be to recognize $10,000 in profit or loss (to reverse the previous decrease) and $5,000 in other comprehensive income. Therefore, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut, it's important to note that under IAS 16, Property, Plant, and Equipment, revaluation increases that reverse earlier decreases recognized in profit or loss should be recognized in profit or loss to the extent of the earlier decrease, and any excess should be recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nD. By recognizing $10,000 in profit or loss and $5,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
