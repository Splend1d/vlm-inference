                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: there's a sphere with a radius of 2, and two parallel planes that are each 1 unit from the center of the sphere. These planes cut out a solid from the sphere, and I need to find the volume of that solid. The options are A. 8\u03c0, B. 32\u03c0/3, C. 25\u03c0/3, and D. 22\u03c0/3.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize what's happening here. There's a sphere, and two parallel planes are cutting through it, each 1 unit away from the center. So, the center of the sphere is equidistant from both planes. That means the distance between the two planes is 2 units because each is 1 unit from the center.\n\nI recall that when you have a sphere and you cut it with two parallel planes, the solid left between those planes is called a spherical frustum or a spherical zone. To find its volume, there might be a specific formula for that.\n\nLet me see. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius. But here, it's not the whole sphere; it's a part of it. So, I need something different.\n\nI think there's a formula for the volume of a spherical cap, and since the frustum is basically the difference between two spherical caps, maybe I can use that.\n\nWait, actually, I remember there's a formula for the volume of a spherical frustum or spherical zone. It should be something like V = (\u03c0h/6)(3a\u00b2 + 3b\u00b2 + h\u00b2), where a and b are the radii of the two bases, and h is the height of the frustum.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way for this specific problem.\n\nLet me consider the distance from the center to each plane is 1 unit, and the sphere has a radius of 2. So, the height of the sphere from one plane to the other is 2 units (since 1 unit above and 1 unit below the center).\n\nWait, no. The planes are 1 unit from the center on either side, so the distance between them is 2 units.\n\nBut in a sphere of radius 2, the height of the sphere along the axis perpendicular to the planes is actually the diameter, which is 4 units. So, the planes are cutting off 1 unit from the top and 1 unit from the bottom.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the volume of the sphere minus the volumes of the two spherical caps that are cut off by the planes.\n\nSo, volume of the solid = volume of the sphere - 2*(volume of each spherical cap).\n\nBut first, I need to find the volume of each spherical cap.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a spherical cap is V = (1/3)\u03c0h\u00b2(3r - h), where r is the radius of the sphere and h is the height of the cap.\n\nIn this case, the height of each cap, h, is the distance from the plane to the pole (the farthest point on the sphere in that direction). But since the plane is 1 unit from the center, and the radius is 2, the height of each cap should be r - distance from center to plane, which is 2 - 1 = 1 unit.\n\nSo, h = 1 unit for each cap.\n\nTherefore, volume of one cap = (1/3)\u03c0(1)\u00b2(3*2 - 1) = (1/3)\u03c0(1)(6 - 1) = (1/3)\u03c0(5) = 5\u03c0/3.\n\nSo, the volume of two caps is 2*(5\u03c0/3) = 10\u03c0/3.\n\nNow, the volume of the sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(2)^3 = (4/3)\u03c0(8) = 32\u03c0/3.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid between the two planes is 32\u03c0/3 - 10\u03c0/3 = 22\u03c0/3.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 22\u03c0/3.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this.\n\nIs the height of the cap really 1 unit? The plane is 1 unit from the center, and the radius is 2, so from the plane to the top of the sphere is 2 - 1 = 1 unit, which seems correct.\n\nAnd the formula for the volume of the cap seems right: V = (1/3)\u03c0h\u00b2(3r - h).\n\nPlugging in h = 1 and r = 2: V = (1/3)\u03c0(1)^2(6 - 1) = 5\u03c0/3 for one cap.\n\nTwo caps would be 10\u03c0/3.\n\nSphere volume is 32\u03c0/3.\n\nSubtracting, we get 22\u03c0/3.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the volume of a spherical frustum, which is V = (\u03c0h/6)(3a\u00b2 + 3b\u00b2 + h\u00b2), where a and b are the radii of the two bases, and h is the height of the frustum.\n\nIn this case, the two bases are the circles formed by the intersection of the planes with the sphere.\n\nFirst, I need to find the radii a and b of these circles.\n\nThe distance from the center to each plane is 1 unit, and the sphere has a radius of 2.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, the radius of each circle is sqrt(r\u00b2 - d\u00b2), where d is the distance from the center to the plane.\n\nSo, a = b = sqrt(2\u00b2 - 1\u00b2) = sqrt(4 - 1) = sqrt(3).\n\nWait, but in this case, since both planes are equidistant from the center, both bases should have the same radius, which is sqrt(3).\n\nAnd the height h of the frustum is the distance between the two planes, which is 2 units.\n\nPlugging into the formula: V = (\u03c0*2/6)(3*(sqrt(3))\u00b2 + 3*(sqrt(3))\u00b2 + 2\u00b2) = (\u03c0/3)(3*3 + 3*3 + 4) = (\u03c0/3)(9 + 9 + 4) = (\u03c0/3)(22) = 22\u03c0/3.\n\nSo, again, I get 22\u03c0/3.\n\nThis matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid is 22\u03c0/3, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach.\n\nAnother way is to integrate the volume between the two planes.\n\nThe equation of the sphere is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 4 (since r = 2).\n\nThe planes are at z = 1 and z = -1, since they are 1 unit from the center.\n\nSo, the volume between z = -1 and z = 1 can be found by integrating the area of circular cross-sections perpendicular to the z-axis.\n\nThe radius of each cross-section at height z is sqrt(4 - z\u00b2).\n\nSo, the area is \u03c0(4 - z\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the volume is the integral from z = -1 to z = 1 of \u03c0(4 - z\u00b2) dz.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nV = \u03c0 \u222b_{-1}^{1} (4 - z\u00b2) dz\n\n= \u03c0 [4z - (z\u00b3)/3] from -1 to 1\n\n= \u03c0 [(4*1 - (1)^3/3) - (4*(-1) - (-1)^3/3)]\n\n= \u03c0 [(4 - 1/3) - (-4 + 1/3)]\n\n= \u03c0 [4 - 1/3 + 4 - 1/3]\n\n= \u03c0 [8 - 2/3]\n\n= \u03c0 [(24 - 2)/3]\n\n= 22\u03c0/3.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I keep getting 22\u03c0/3 as the volume of the solid between the two planes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 22\u03c0/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
