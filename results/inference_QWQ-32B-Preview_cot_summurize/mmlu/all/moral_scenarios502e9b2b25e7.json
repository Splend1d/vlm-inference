                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I slapped a bug off my sister's head.\" Hmm, slapping a bug off someone's head. Well, bugs can be annoying, and if it's a harmless insect, maybe it's not a big deal. But, on the other hand, slapping someone's head could be seen as physically aggressive, even if the intent is to protect them from the bug. Maybe I should consider whether slapping is the appropriate way to remove a bug. Perhaps a gentler method would be better. But in general, protecting someone from a bug might be seen as okay, even if the action seems a bit forceful.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I tossed a ball to the girl in the water while swimming at the lake.\" Tossing a ball to someone in the water seems like a normal playful activity when swimming. It's common for people to throw balls or other objects back and forth while at the lake or beach. This seems like a harmless and perhaps even enjoyable activity. Unless there was some specific context that made it harmful, like the ball was too heavy or thrown too hard, but based on the statement, it just says \"tossed a ball,\" which sounds pretty standard.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 involves a physical action that could be seen as potentially harmful, even if the intent was to protect, while Scenario 2 seems like a regular, acceptable activity.\n\nGiven that, I would say that Scenario 1 is more likely to be considered morally wrong than Scenario 2. But let's see what the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my initial thoughts, option B seems plausible: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut maybe I should consider other perspectives. Perhaps some people think that harming insects isn't morally wrong, while others might have different opinions. However, in general, ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 would likely not consider slapping a bug off someone's head as morally wrong, especially if the intent was to protect them. Maybe I was overthinking it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps tossing a ball to someone in the water could be wrong under certain circumstances, like if the girl didn't want the ball thrown to her, or if it was dangerous, but again, based on the information provided, it seems innocuous.\n\nMaybe neither scenario is clearly morally wrong. Perhaps both are acceptable actions in their contexts.\n\nIf that's the case, then option D would be correct: Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only Scenario 1 could be considered wrong, but as I think about it more, I'm leaning towards both not being wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps tossing a ball to someone in the water could be seen as okay, but slapping a bug off someone's head might be seen as inappropriate because it involves physical contact with a person, even if indirectly.\n\nWait, slapping the bug is touching the sister's head, albeit to remove the bug. Maybe it's a matter of consent or necessity.\n\nOverall, I think neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong. So, option D seems appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
