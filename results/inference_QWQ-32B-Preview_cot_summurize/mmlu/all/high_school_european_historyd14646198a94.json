In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following beliefs, supported first by Calvin, does this passage seem to best support?\n\nA. Salvation\nB. Predestination\nC. Divinity of Jesus\nD. Simony\n"

                    "text": "Let's see. This passage is from John Calvin's \"Institutes of the Christian Religion\" from 1559. Calvin was a key figure in the Protestant Reformation, and his thoughts on theology, especially soteriology (the study of salvation), had a profound impact on Christian doctrine.\n\nThe passage talks about election, salvation, and the role of God's grace. It seems like Calvin is emphasizing that salvation comes solely from God's goodness and not from any merit on our part. He mentions that ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace clearly testifies that God saves those on whom there can be no claim. This sounds a lot like the concept of predestination, which is closely associated with Calvin's theology.\n\nPredestination is the idea that God has foreordained everything that will happen, including who will be saved and who will not. It's a central tenet of Calvinism, often summarized by the acronym TULIP, where the \"P\" stands for perseverance of the saints, but the overall doctrine includes the idea that God elects certain individuals to salvation based on His sovereign will, not on any foreseen merit in them.\n\nSo, option B, predestination, seems to be the belief that this passage best supports.\n\nOption A, salvation, is certainly discussed in the passage, but it's more about how salvation is attained\u2014through God's election and grace rather than human merit. So, while salvation is a key topic, the specific belief being supported here is the manner in which salvation is bestowed, which aligns more closely with predestination.\n\nOption C, the divinity of Jesus, isn't directly addressed in this passage. Calvin certainly believed in the divinity of Jesus, but that's not the main point being made here. The passage is more focused on how salvation is achieved and the role of God's election in that process.\n\nOption D, simony, is the buying or selling of ecclesiastical offices or benefits. This has nothing to do with the content of the passage, which is about salvation and election.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B, predestination.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
