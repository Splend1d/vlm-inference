                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a formula in propositional logic, and we need to translate it into natural English sentences using the given key. The formula is:\n\n(A \u2228 ~E) \u2261 (D \u2022 ~B)\n\nAnd the key is:\n\nA: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book.\n\nB: Izzy plays Minecraft.\n\nC: Emily stops working.\n\nD: Russell makes dinner.\n\nE: Ashleigh stops by.\n\nSo, first, I need to understand what this formula is saying. It's a biconditional statement, which means both sides are equivalent. In other words, the left side is true if and only if the right side is true.\n\nThe left side is (A \u2228 ~E), which means \"A or not E.\" Using the key, that's \"Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by.\"\n\nThe right side is (D \u2022 ~B), which means \"D and not B.\" Using the key, that's \"Russell makes dinner and Izzy does not play Minecraft.\"\n\nSo, putting it all together, the formula is saying: \"Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by\" if and only if \"Russell makes dinner and Izzy does not play Minecraft.\"\n\nNow, I need to match this meaning to one of the provided options.\n\nOption A: \"Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary condition for both Russell making dinner and Izzy not playing Minecraft.\"\n\nLet's break this down. A necessary condition means that for something to be true, the condition must be true. In other words, if P is a necessary condition for Q, then Q implies P.\n\nSo, if \"Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by\" is necessary for \"Russell making dinner and Izzy not playing Minecraft,\" then:\n\n(Russell makes dinner and Izzy does not play Minecraft) \u2192 (Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by)\n\nBut the biconditional in the original formula means both sides imply each other, not just one way. So this only captures one direction of the biconditional.\n\nOption B: \"Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary and sufficient condition for Russell making dinner and Izzy playing Minecraft.\"\n\nThis is closer because it includes both necessary and sufficient conditions, which aligns with the biconditional. However, there's a mismatch in the description: it says \"Izzy playing Minecraft\" instead of \"Izzy does not play Minecraft.\" In the original formula, it's ~B, which is \"Izzy does not play Minecraft.\" So this option is incorrect because it doesn't match the formula.\n\nOption C: \"Marina reads a Percy Jackson book unless Ashleigh stops by if, and only if, both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. \"Unless\" can be tricky. \"Marina reads a Percy Jackson book unless Ashleigh stops by\" can be interpreted as \"Marina reads a Percy Jackson book if Ashleigh does not stop by,\" which is similar to A \u2228 ~E. The \"if and only if\" connects this to \"Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft.\" So this seems to match the biconditional in the formula.\n\nOption D: \"Either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by just in case both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft.\"\n\n\"Just in case\" is another way to express a material implication, specifically Q just in case P means P \u2192 Q.\n\nSo, \"either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by\" just in case \"both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft\" means:\n\n(Russell makes dinner and Izzy does not play Minecraft) \u2192 (Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by)\n\nAgain, this only captures one direction of the biconditional, similar to option A.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C seems to be the closest match to the original formula because it captures both directions of the biconditional, even though the phrasing is a bit more convoluted.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's double-check.\n\nThe original formula is:\n\n(A \u2228 ~E) \u2261 (D \u2022 ~B)\n\nOption C says:\n\n\"Marina reads a Percy Jackson book unless Ashleigh stops by if, and only if, both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft.\"\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n\"Marina reads a Percy Jackson book unless Ashleigh stops by\" can be translated as \"Marina reads a Percy Jackson book if Ashleigh does not stop by,\" which is A \u2228 ~E.\n\n\"if, and only if, both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft\" directly translates to \u2261 (D \u2022 ~B).\n\nSo, yes, option C correctly captures the biconditional relationship.\n\nOption A only captures one direction, and option D is similar.\n\nOption B has a mistake in stating \"Izzy playing Minecraft\" instead of \"Izzy does not play Minecraft.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
