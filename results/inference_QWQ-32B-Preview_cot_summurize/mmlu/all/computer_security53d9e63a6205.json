When you request a web page, your request goes to the proxy server first, which then forwards the request to the target web server. The response from the web server is also routed through the proxy before reaching your browser. This setup allows the proxy to modify requests and responses in various ways, such as caching content to speed up access, filtering content based on security policies, or anonymizing your requests to enhance privacy.\n\nOption B refers more to an agent or bot that interacts with web applications on behalf of a user, which is different from a proxy's role. Option C seems to describe something like a web application wrapper or a desktop application that embeds a web browser, which is not related to proxy functionality. Option D might refer to offline browsing tools or simulators, but again, this is distinct from a web proxy's purpose.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
