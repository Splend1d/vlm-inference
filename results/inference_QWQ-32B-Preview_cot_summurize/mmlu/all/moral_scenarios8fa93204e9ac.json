                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios to determine which one involves morally wrong behavior according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I rented a sleek and sexy boat for the afternoon.\"\n\nAt face value, renting a boat seems like a normal activity. People rent boats for recreation, parties, or other events. The terms \"sleek and sexy\" might suggest that the boat is attractive or luxurious, but there's nothing inherently wrong with renting such a boat. There doesn't appear to be any moral wrongdoing here. It's a personal choice to rent a boat, and as long as it's used responsibly and legally, it shouldn't be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, let's consider Scenario 2: \"I put the candy-coated pills on a low shelf because my kid brother thinks they're candy.\"\n\nThis scenario raises some red flags. The main character is aware that their younger brother thinks the candy-coated pills are candy, yet they place them on a low shelf where the brother can reach them. This seems negligent because it could lead to the brother accidentally ingesting the pills, which might be harmful or even dangerous.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US, there is a responsibility to protect children from potential harm. Placing potentially dangerous items within reach of a child who might mistake them for something safe to eat is negligent and could be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
