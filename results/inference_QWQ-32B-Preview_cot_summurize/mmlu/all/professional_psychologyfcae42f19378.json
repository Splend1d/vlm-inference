                    "text": "So Dr. Lykowski is feeling hostile towards his therapy client because she reminds him of his wife whom he's divorcing. After three sessions, he's realizing this. Now, he's got to decide what to do next. There are four options presented:\n\nA. Refer the client to another therapist without telling the client the reason for the referral.\n\nB. Refer the client to another therapist after discussing the reason with her.\n\nC. Recognize that his feelings are due to countertransference and continue to work with the client.\n\nD. Consult with another psychologist to determine whether or not to continue seeing the client in therapy.\n\nFirst off, let's understand what's going on here. Countertransference is when a therapist's own unconscious needs and emotions are transferred onto the client. In this case, Dr. Lykowski is feeling hostile towards the client because she reminds him of his wife, with whom he's having marital issues. This is clearly a case of countertransference.\n\nNow, why is this a problem? Well, in therapy, the focus should be on the client's issues, not the therapist's. If the therapist is experiencing strong emotions towards the client, it can cloud their judgment and affect the therapeutic relationship. It might also lead to boundary issues or inappropriate actions.\n\nSo, what should Dr. Lykowski do?\n\nOption A is to refer the client to another therapist without explaining why. This seems like an avoidance tactic and might not be in the client's best interest. The client has already invested time and effort into the therapeutic relationship, and switching therapists could be disruptive. Also, not disclosing the reason might make the client feel there's something wrong with them, which isn't the case here.\n\nOption B is to refer the client after discussing the reason. This is better because at least there's transparency. The client is being informed that the referral is due to the therapist's personal issues, not because of anything the client has done. This maintains integrity and helps the client understand the situation. However, it still involves terminating the therapeutic relationship, which might not be necessary.\n\nOption C is to recognize the countertransference and continue working with the client. This could be possible if Dr. Lykowski is aware of his feelings and can manage them professionally. However, given that he's only realized this after three sessions and these feelings are quite strong (hostility), it might be challenging for him to remain objective. It's important for therapists to have their own self-awareness and sometimes, despite best efforts, personal issues can interfere with therapy.\n\nOption D is to consult with another psychologist. This is a good idea because getting supervision or consultation can provide Dr. Lykowski with guidance on how to handle this situation. The consultant might offer strategies to manage the countertransference or confirm whether it's advisable to continue therapy.\n\nConsidering all these options, I think the best course of action would be a combination of C and D. That is, Dr. Lykowski should recognize the countertransference and seek consultation from another psychologist to determine whether he can continue treating the client or if a referral is necessary.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the best single course of action, I need to choose one option.\n\nOption D seems the most appropriate because consulting with another psychologist allows Dr. Lykowski to get an external perspective on his situation. The consultant can provide insights and help Dr. Lykowski decide whether he can manage his feelings and continue therapy or if referring the client to someone else would be better for the client's welfare.\n\nOption B is also tempting because transparency is important, but forcing the client to be part of the therapist's personal issues might not be ideal. It's the therapist's responsibility to manage their own emotions and provide the best possible care to the client.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that consulting with another psychologist (Option D) is the best course of action for Dr. Lykowski in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
