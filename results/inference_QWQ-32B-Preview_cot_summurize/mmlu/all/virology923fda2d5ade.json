                    "text": "Given the scenario, we have a medical class of 147 students with a distribution of scores on a biochemistry final examination. The provided statistics are:\n\n- Mean: 67\n- Median: 76\n- Mode: 80\n- Standard deviation: 5.5\n- Variance: 30.25\n\nAdditionally, three students took a different form of the exam a week later.\n\nThe question is asking for the parameter that is most likely to be the least biased estimator of central tendency for this distribution.\n\nFirst, let's understand what central tendency means. Central tendency refers to the central value or typical value of a probability distribution. The three main measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode.\n\nGiven that the mean is 67, the median is 76, and the mode is 80, we can observe that these values are different, which suggests that the distribution of scores is skewed.\n\nIn a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal. However, in a skewed distribution, they differ. Specifically:\n\n- In a positively skewed distribution (long tail to the right), the mean is greater than the median, and the median is greater than the mode.\n\n- In a negatively skewed distribution (long tail to the left), the mean is less than the median, and the median is less than the mode.\n\nGiven that the mean (67) is less than the median (76), which is less than the mode (80), this suggests a negatively skewed distribution.\n\nIn a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is pulled towards the left by the long tail of low scores, while the median is less affected, and the mode is at the peak of the distribution.\n\nNow, considering that three students took a different form of the exam a week later, their scores could potentially affect the overall distribution. However, since only three students are involved out of 147, their impact might be minimal, but it's still something to consider.\n\nThe question is about identifying the least biased estimator of central tendency. Bias in estimators refers to the difference between the estimator's expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated.\n\nIn general:\n\n- The mean is the most efficient estimator (smallest variance) in a normal distribution but can be biased in skewed distributions.\n\n- The median is less sensitive to outliers and skewness, making it a more robust estimator in skewed distributions.\n\n- The mode can be useful in multimodal distributions but is not typically used as a measure of central tendency in continuous data.\n\nGiven that the distribution is negatively skewed, the mean is likely to be biased towards the lower scores, while the median is more representative of the typical score.\n\nTherefore, in this context, the median is likely to be the least biased estimator of central tendency.\n\nLet's consider why the other options are not as suitable:\n\n- Mean: As discussed, in a skewed distribution, the mean can be misleading because it is influenced by extreme values or skewness.\n\n- Mode: While the mode represents the most frequent score, it may not necessarily be a good measure of central tendency, especially in a continuous distribution where frequencies can be less meaningful.\n\n- Standard deviation: This is a measure of dispersion, not central tendency. It tells us about the spread of scores around the mean but does not indicate central tendency.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is the median.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
