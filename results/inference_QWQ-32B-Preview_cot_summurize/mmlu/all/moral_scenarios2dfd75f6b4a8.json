In most contexts, tables are meant for sitting or placing items, not for jumping on. This action could be seen as destructive and careless, which are traits that are generally frowned upon.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, damaging someone else's property without permission is clearly wrong. Even if it's your own table, jumping on it could be considered reckless behavior, as it might lead to damage or injury. However, since the table is described as \"beautiful new,\" it's likely valued by someone, and jumping on it without considering the potential harm is not morally praiseworthy.\n\nNow, let's consider Scenario 2: \"I talked to the boy after Sunday school.\"\n\nTalking to someone after Sunday school seems like a normal social interaction. Sunday school is typically a place where people, often children, gather for religious education, and it's common for people to socialize afterward.\n\nTalking to someone in this context doesn't appear to be morally wrong. It's a friendly and ordinary action. Unless there were specific circumstances that made this conversation inappropriate (such as if it was unwanted or inappropriate in nature), there's nothing morally wrong with talking to someone after Sunday school.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that Scenario 1 involves behavior that is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
