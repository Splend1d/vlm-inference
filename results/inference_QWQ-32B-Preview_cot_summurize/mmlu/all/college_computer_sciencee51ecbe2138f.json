Since we're using linear probing to resolve collisions, if a bucket is already occupied, we'll look at the next bucket in sequence, wrapping around to the beginning if necessary.\n\nWe need to insert the keys 13, 8, 24, 10, and 3 in that order into an initially empty hash table and determine what ends up in bucket number 2.\n\nLet's start by computing the hash for each key and see where they get placed.\n\n1. **Inserting 13:**\n\n   - h(13) = 13 mod 5 = 3\n\n   - Bucket 3 is empty, so 13 goes into bucket 3.\n\n2. **Inserting 8:**\n\n   - h(8) = 8 mod 5 = 3\n\n   - Bucket 3 is already occupied by 13.\n\n   - So, we probe the next bucket: (3 + 1) mod 5 = 4\n\n   - Bucket 4 is empty, so 8 goes into bucket 4.\n\n3. **Inserting 24:**\n\n   - h(24) = 24 mod 5 = 4\n\n   - Bucket 4 is already occupied by 8.\n\n   - Next bucket: (4 + 1) mod 5 = 0\n\n   - Bucket 0 is empty, so 24 goes into bucket 0.\n\n4. **Inserting 10:**\n\n   - h(10) = 10 mod 5 = 0\n\n   - Bucket 0 is already occupied by 24.\n\n   - Next bucket: (0 + 1) mod 5 = 1\n\n   - Bucket 1 is empty, so 10 goes into bucket 1.\n\n5. **Inserting 3:**\n\n   - h(3) = 3 mod 5 = 3\n\n   - Bucket 3 is occupied by 13.\n\n   - Next bucket: (3 + 1) mod 5 = 4\n\n   - Bucket 4 is occupied by 8.\n\n   - Next bucket: (4 + 1) mod 5 = 0\n\n   - Bucket 0 is occupied by 24.\n\n   - Next bucket: (0 + 1) mod 5 = 1\n\n   - Bucket 1 is occupied by 10.\n\n   - Next bucket: (1 + 1) mod 5 = 2\n\n   - Bucket 2 is empty, so 3 goes into bucket 2.\n\nNow, we need to find out what's in bucket number 2 after all these insertions.\n\nFrom the steps above:\n\n- Bucket 0: 24\n\n- Bucket 1: 10\n\n- Bucket 2: 3\n\n- Bucket 3: 13\n\n- Bucket 4: 8\n\nSo, bucket number 2 contains the key 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 3\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
