                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We're given that when the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers is divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), the result is 33. One of the integers is 45, and we need to find the smallest possible value of the other integer. The options are 165, 46, 45, and 9.\n\nFirst, I recall that there's a relationship between the LCM and GCD of two numbers. Specifically, for any two positive integers a and b, the product of their LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Mathematically, that's:\n\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(a, b) \\times \\text{gcd}(a, b) = a \\times b\n\\]\n\nIn this problem, we're given that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{lcm}(a, b)}{\\text{gcd}(a, b)} = 33\n\\]\n\nLet's denote the GCD of a and b as d. Then, we can express a and b in terms of d:\n\n\\[\na = d \\times m\n\\]\n\\[\nb = d \\times n\n\\]\n\nWhere m and n are positive integers that are coprime (their GCD is 1).\n\nUsing these expressions, the LCM of a and b can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(a, b) = d \\times m \\times n\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting into the given equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\times m \\times n}{d} = 33\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\nm \\times n = 33\n\\]\n\nSince m and n are coprime, we need to find pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that their product is 33 and their GCD is 1.\n\nLet's list the factor pairs of 33:\n\n1. (1, 33)\n\n2. (3, 11)\n\nThese are the only positive integer pairs since 33 is not divisible by any other numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these pairs can correspond to m and n, given that one of the integers (a or b) is 45.\n\nLet's assume a = 45. Then:\n\n\\[\na = d \\times m = 45\n\\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[\nb = d \\times n\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest possible b.\n\nLet's consider each pair:\n\n1. (m, n) = (1, 33)\n\n   - From a = d \u00d7 m = 45, we have d \u00d7 1 = 45 \u21d2 d = 45\n\n   - Then, b = d \u00d7 n = 45 \u00d7 33 = 1485\n\n2. (m, n) = (3, 11)\n\n   - From a = d \u00d7 m = 45, we have d \u00d7 3 = 45 \u21d2 d = 15\n\n   - Then, b = d \u00d7 n = 15 \u00d7 11 = 165\n\nSo, with these pairs, the possible values of b are 1485 and 165. The smallest among these is 165.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem asks for the smallest possible value of the other integer, and one of the options is 165. However, let's check if there are any other possible pairs or if we can have m and n swapped.\n\nActually, since m and n are coprime and their product is 33, the only pairs are (1,33) and (3,11). Swapping m and n would just swap a and b, but since a is fixed at 45, it doesn't create new possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of b is 165.\n\nBut let's double-check this result because the problem provides multiple choices, including 46, 45, and 9, which are smaller than 165. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me approach the problem differently. I know that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(a, b) = \\frac{a \\times b}{\\text{gcd}(a, b)}\n\\]\n\nSo, dividing LCM by GCD:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{lcm}(a, b)}{\\text{gcd}(a, b)} = \\frac{\\frac{a \\times b}{\\text{gcd}(a, b)}}{\\text{gcd}(a, b)} = \\frac{a \\times b}{\\text{gcd}(a, b)^2} = 33\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a \\times b}{\\text{gcd}(a, b)^2} = 33\n\\]\n\nGiven a = 45, let's denote d = gcd(45, b). Then, a can be expressed as a = d \u00d7 k, where k is an integer. Since a = 45, we have d \u00d7 k = 45, and k must divide 45.\n\nAlso, b can be expressed as b = d \u00d7 m, where m is an integer coprime with k (since d is the GCD).\n\nSubstituting a and b into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\times k \\times d \\times m}{d^2} = k \\times m = 33\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems familiar. So, k \u00d7 m = 33, with k and m being coprime.\n\nSince a = 45 = d \u00d7 k, and d divides 45, possible values of d are the divisors of 45, which are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45.\n\nLet's consider each possible d and find corresponding k and m.\n\n1. d = 1:\n\n   - k = 45 / 1 = 45\n\n   - m = 33 / k = 33 / 45 = 11/15 (not an integer) \u2192 invalid\n\n2. d = 3:\n\n   - k = 45 / 3 = 15\n\n   - m = 33 / 15 = 11/5 (not an integer) \u2192 invalid\n\n3. d = 5:\n\n   - k = 45 / 5 = 9\n\n   - m = 33 / 9 = 11/3 (not an integer) \u2192 invalid\n\n4. d = 9:\n\n   - k = 45 / 9 = 5\n\n   - m = 33 / 5 = 33/5 (not an integer) \u2192 invalid\n\n5. d = 15:\n\n   - k = 45 / 15 = 3\n\n   - m = 33 / 3 = 11 (integer)\n\n   - Check if k and m are coprime: gcd(3, 11) = 1 \u2192 valid\n\n   - Then, b = d \u00d7 m = 15 \u00d7 11 = 165\n\n6. d = 45:\n\n   - k = 45 / 45 = 1\n\n   - m = 33 / 1 = 33 (integer)\n\n   - Check if k and m are coprime: gcd(1, 33) = 1 \u2192 valid\n\n   - Then, b = 45 \u00d7 33 = 1485\n\nSo, the possible values of b are 165 and 1485, with 165 being the smallest.\n\nBut the problem provides options including 46, 45, and 9, which are smaller than 165. If 165 is the smallest possible, then why are these smaller options included? Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that d must be a divisor of 45.\n\nWait, actually, d must be a common divisor of a and b. Since a is 45, d must divide 45, but b is unknown. However, d must divide b as well. So, d is a common divisor of 45 and b.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(45, b) = 33 \\times \\text{gcd}(45, b)\n\\]\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(45, b) \\times \\text{gcd}(45, b) = 45 \\times b\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\n\n\\[\n33 \\times \\text{gcd}(45, b) \\times \\text{gcd}(45, b) = 45 \\times b\n\\]\n\n\\[\n33 \\times \\text{gcd}(45, b)^2 = 45 \\times b\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s denote d = gcd(45, b). Then, b = d \u00d7 m, where m is an integer coprime with 45/d.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express 45 in terms of its prime factors.\n\n45 = 3^2 \u00d7 5\n\nLet\u2019s assume that b has the form b = 3^p \u00d7 5^q \u00d7 r, where r is coprime with 3 and 5.\n\nThen, gcd(45, b) = 3^{min(2, p)} \u00d7 5^{min(1, q)}\n\nAnd lcm(45, b) = 3^{max(2, p)} \u00d7 5^{max(1, q)} \u00d7 r\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{lcm}(45, b)}{\\text{gcd}(45, b)} = 33\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3^{\\max(2, p)} \\times 5^{\\max(1, q)} \\times r}{3^{\\min(2, p)} \\times 5^{\\min(1, q)}} = 33\n\\]\n\nSimplifying exponents:\n\n\\[\n3^{\\max(2, p) - \\min(2, p)} \\times 5^{\\max(1, q) - \\min(1, q)} \\times r = 33\n\\]\n\nI know that for any exponents, max(a, b) - min(a, b) equals |a - b|.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n3^{|2 - p|} \\times 5^{|1 - q|} \\times r = 33\n\\]\n\nNow, 33 factors into primes as 3 \u00d7 11.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n3^{|2 - p|} \\times 5^{|1 - q|} \\times r = 3^1 \\times 11^1\n\\]\n\nSince r is coprime with 3 and 5, r must be 11.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n3^{|2 - p|} \\times 5^{|1 - q|} = 3^1 \\times 5^0\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n|2 - p| = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |1 - q| = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving these:\n\n1. |2 - p| = 1 \u21d2 p = 1 or p = 3\n\n2. |1 - q| = 0 \u21d2 q = 1\n\nSo, p can be 1 or 3, and q must be 1.\n\nTherefore, b = 3^p \u00d7 5^q \u00d7 11, where p is 1 or 3, q is 1, and r = 11.\n\nLet's compute b for each possible p:\n\n1. p = 1:\n\n   - b = 3^1 \u00d7 5^1 \u00d7 11 = 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 11 = 165\n\n2. p = 3:\n\n   - b = 3^3 \u00d7 5^1 \u00d7 11 = 27 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 11 = 27 \u00d7 55 = 1485\n\nSo, the possible values of b are 165 and 1485, with 165 being the smallest.\n\nBut the problem provides options including 46, 45, and 9, which are smaller than 165. If 165 is the smallest possible, then these options must be invalid. However, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that r = 11.\n\nWait, maybe r can be 1, but then the product would not reach 33.\n\nWait, no. From earlier:\n\n\\[\n3^{|2 - p|} \\times 5^{|1 - q|} \\times r = 3^1 \\times 11^1\n\\]\n\nSo, r must be 11 to account for the factor of 11.\n\nTherefore, b must include 11 as a factor, which means b must be a multiple of 11.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 165 = 15 \u00d7 11\n\nB. 46 = 2 \u00d7 23\n\nC. 45 = 9 \u00d7 5\n\nD. 9 = 9\n\nOnly 165 is a multiple of 11, so it seems like the only valid option.\n\nBut let's check if there's a possibility that r includes other factors besides 11, but that would contradict the coprimality with 3 and 5.\n\nWait, r is defined as the part of b that is coprime with 3 and 5, so it cannot include factors of 3 or 5.\n\nGiven that, and since 33 = 3 \u00d7 11, r must be 11, assuming that's the minimal case.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible b is 165.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to have r = 1 and adjust exponents to still satisfy the equation.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIf r = 1, then:\n\n\\[\n3^{|2 - p|} \\times 5^{|1 - q|} = 3^1 \\times 11^1\n\\]\n\nBut 11 is not a factor of the left side, which only includes 3 and 5, so this is impossible unless r includes 11.\n\nTherefore, r must include 11, making b a multiple of 11.\n\nThus, the smallest possible b is 165.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 165.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{165} \\]"
