Decreasing liberal bias in the news media\n\nB. Increasing visibility for individual candidates on TV\n\nC. Increasing concentration of ownership in the news media\n\nD. Decreasing cost of political ads on TV\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"less diverse\" means in this context. I think it's referring to a narrower range of perspectives or sources in network news coverage. So, if news is becoming less diverse, it might mean that there's less variety in the stories covered, the viewpoints presented, or the sources quoted.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says \"decreasing liberal bias in the news media.\" If there's less liberal bias, that might suggest that news is becoming more balanced or leaning elsewhere. But is that directly related to diversity in coverage? Maybe not necessarily. Diversity could exist regardless of bias, as long as multiple perspectives are represented. So, if bias is decreasing but coverage is still diverse, that wouldn't make sense. Maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B is \"increasing visibility for individual candidates on TV.\" If more candidates are getting TV time, that might actually increase diversity in the sense that more voices are being heard. But the question says \"less diverse,\" so this seems contradictory. Maybe I'm missing something, but at first glance, this doesn't seem like the right choice.\n\nOption C is \"increasing concentration of ownership in the news media.\" Hmm, this sounds interesting. If fewer companies own more of the media outlets, that could lead to homogenization of content. Basically, with fewer owners, there might be less variety in editorial decisions, perspectives, and the types of stories that get covered. This could definitely result in less diverse news coverage. This seems like a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nOption D is \"decreasing cost of political ads on TV.\" If political ads are cheaper, that might mean more groups can afford to run ads, which could actually increase diversity in the messages and perspectives presented. But again, the question is about news coverage becoming less diverse, not about ads. Maybe there's a connection I'm missing, but it's not immediately clear.\n\nComparing all these options, option C seems to make the most sense. When media ownership becomes more concentrated, it can lead to less diverse news coverage because fewer entities are controlling what stories are told and how they're presented. This aligns with concerns about media consolidation and its impact on journalistic diversity.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Increasing concentration of ownership in the news media.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
