By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nWhat traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?\n\nA. That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies\nB. That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation\nC.

                    "text": "This passage seems to be discussing the development of gunpowder weaponry in both Europe and China during the medieval period. It highlights how the different military challenges faced by these regions influenced their approaches to weapon development. Specifically, it mentions that in Western Europe, the need for effective siege weapons led to investment in and improvement of early cannons, whereas in China, the primary military threat came from mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons were not very effective. As a result, China focused on improving horse archer units instead.\n\nThe question asks which traditional view of world history this passage seems to challenge. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies.\n\nThe passage doesn't suggest that China was less technologically adept; in fact, it mentions that China did develop gunpowder weapons but chose to focus on other military technologies given their specific strategic needs. So, this option seems unlikely.\n\nB. That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation.\n\nThe passage doesn't discuss forms of government or political systems affecting innovation. It attributes the difference in technological focus to the different military threats each region faced, not to the type of government.\n\nC. That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts.\n\nAgain, the passage doesn't mention anything about religious influences on technological development or modernization efforts.\n\nD. That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change.\n\nThis option seems closest to what the passage is addressing. The passage suggests that China didn't neglect technological change outright but rather prioritized different technologies based on their strategic needs. By focusing on horse archer units instead of gunpowder weapons, China may have missed out on some technological advancements that Europe pursued, which could have contributed to Europe's later global dominance.\n\nHowever, the passage doesn't explicitly state that China was surpassed by Europe in global power due to this difference in technological focus. It only describes the different paths each region took in weapon development based on their military challenges.\n\nGiven the options, it seems that the passage is challenging the idea that China was less technologically innovative or that its political or religious systems stifled innovation. Instead, it suggests that strategic considerations led to different technological priorities.\n\nTherefore, the passage seems to challenge option A, the notion that China has always been less technologically adept than other Afro-Eurasian societies, by showing that China did develop gunpowder weapons but chose to focus on other areas based on its specific military needs.\n\nAlternatively, it could be seen as challenging option D, the idea that China was surpassed by Europe because it ignored technological benefits, by suggesting that China didn't ignore technology but rather made strategic choices based on its threats.\n\nBut since the passage doesn't directly address global power dynamics or Europe surpassing China, option A might be a better fit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
