                    "text": "Let's tackle this salaries expense problem step by step. I need to figure out how much Lind Co. should report as salaries expense in its income statement for the month ended June 30.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the company's payroll schedule. Lind Co. pays salaries every other Friday for the 10 workdays ending on that Friday. So, the payroll covers a two-week period consisting of 10 workdays.\n\nGiven that the last payroll was paid on June 18, which covered the workdays up to June 18. Now, we need to determine the salaries expense for the month of June ended on June 30.\n\nLet me look at the calendar for June to see how many days are in the month and identify the workdays.\n\nAssuming June has 30 days, and employees do not work on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nLet's list out the dates:\n\n- June 1: Let's see what day it is. For simplicity, I'll assume June 1 is a Monday.\n\nSo, the workdays in June would be:\n\n- June 1 (Mon)\n\n- June 2 (Tue)\n\n- June 3 (Wed)\n\n- June 4 (Thu)\n\n- June 5 (Fri)\n\n- June 8 (Mon)\n\n- June 9 (Tue)\n\n- June 10 (Wed)\n\n- June 11 (Thu)\n\n- June 12 (Fri)\n\n- June 15 (Mon)\n\n- June 16 (Tue)\n\n- June 17 (Wed)\n\n- June 18 (Thu)\n\n- June 19 (Fri)\n\n- June 22 (Mon)\n\n- June 23 (Tue)\n\n- June 24 (Wed)\n\n- June 25 (Thu)\n\n- June 26 (Fri)\n\n- June 29 (Mon)\n\n- June 30 (Tue)\n\nWait, but June has 30 days. Let me confirm the days:\n\nAssuming June 1 is a Monday:\n\n- June 1: Mon\n\n- June 2: Tue\n\n- June 3: Wed\n\n- June 4: Thu\n\n- June 5: Fri\n\n- June 6: Sat\n\n- June 7: Sun\n\n- June 8: Mon\n\n- June 9: Tue\n\n- June 10: Wed\n\n- June 11: Thu\n\n- June 12: Fri\n\n- June 13: Sat\n\n- June 14: Sun\n\n- June 15: Mon\n\n- June 16: Tue\n\n- June 17: Wed\n\n- June 18: Thu\n\n- June 19: Fri\n\n- June 20: Sat\n\n- June 21: Sun\n\n- June 22: Mon\n\n- June 23: Tue\n\n- June 24: Wed\n\n- June 25: Thu\n\n- June 26: Fri\n\n- June 27: Sat\n\n- June 28: Sun\n\n- June 29: Mon\n\n- June 30: Tue\n\nSo, the workdays in June are:\n\n- June 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30.\n\nTotal workdays in June: 22 days.\n\nNow, the last payroll was paid on June 18, covering the workdays up to June 18.\n\nSo, the workdays from June 1 to June 18 are:\n\n- June 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18.\n\nThat's 14 workdays.\n\nBut according to the problem, each payroll covers 10 workdays. So, the payroll on June 18 should cover the previous 10 workdays.\n\nWait, the problem says \"every other Friday for the 10 workdays then ending.\"\n\nSo, the payroll on June 18 covers the 10 workdays ending on June 18.\n\nSo, the 10 workdays ending June 18 are:\n\n- June 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.\n\nWait, no. If June 18 is included in the 10 workdays, then the 10 workdays would be:\n\n- June 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and perhaps part of the previous period.\n\nWait, I need to clarify.\n\nIf the payroll is paid every other Friday for the preceding 10 workdays, then the payroll on June 18 would cover the workdays from June 9 to June 18 (10 workdays).\n\nSo, workdays from June 9 to June 18: June 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18.\n\nWait, that's only 8 days. Let's count:\n\n- June 9\n\n- June 10\n\n- June 11\n\n- June 12\n\n- June 15\n\n- June 16\n\n- June 17\n\n- June 18\n\nThat's 8 days, but the problem says 10 workdays. Maybe I need to include more days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pay period is two weeks back.\n\nWait, perhaps the pay period is bi-weekly, every two weeks, covering 10 workdays.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps it's better to determine the number of workdays in June and see how many pay periods are covered.\n\nTotal workdays in June: 22.\n\nEach payroll covers 10 workdays.\n\nPayroll paid on June 18 covers the past 10 workdays.\n\nNow, we need to find the salaries expense for the month ended June 30.\n\nThe month-end balance in the salaries expense account before accruals is $14,000.\n\nWe need to determine the total salaries expense for June, considering the payrolls paid and any accruals needed.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many payrolls are covered in June.\n\nIf payrolls are every other Friday, then in a 30-day month, there would be payrolls on:\n\n- June 4\n\n- June 18\n\n- June 25\n\nWait, June has 30 days.\n\nAssuming payrolls are every other Friday:\n\n- If June 4 is a Friday, then next payroll would be June 18, and then June 25.\n\nSo, payrolls on June 4 and June 18 have already been paid, and June 25 is pending.\n\nBut the month ends on June 30, so June 25 payroll would be paid within June.\n\nWait, but the last payroll was paid on June 18.\n\nSo, from June 19 to June 30, there are workdays that have not been paid yet.\n\nNeed to accrue salaries for the workdays from June 19 to June 30.\n\nFirst, determine the number of workdays from June 19 to June 30.\n\nWorkdays in June:\n\n- June 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30.\n\nSo, from June 19 to June 30:\n\n- June 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30.\n\nThat's 8 workdays.\n\nEach payroll covers 10 workdays and is $10,000.\n\nSo, the salary rate per workday is $10,000 / 10 = $1,000 per workday.\n\nTherefore, for 8 workdays, the accrued salaries would be 8 * $1,000 = $8,000.\n\nNow, the month-end balance in the salaries expense account before accruals is $14,000.\n\nThis $14,000 likely includes the salaries paid on June 18 for the period ending June 18, plus any other payrolls paid in June.\n\nWait, no. The salaries expense account would include all salaries expense recognized in June, including accruals.\n\nBut to clarify, let's consider the following:\n\n- Salaries paid on June 18 cover the workdays up to June 18: 14 workdays (June 1 to June 18).\n\nBut according to earlier assumption, each payroll covers 10 workdays.\n\nWait, there's inconsistency.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nAssume that the payroll paid on June 18 covers the workdays from June 9 to June 18 (10 workdays).\n\nThen, from June 19 to June 30 is another 8 workdays that need to be accrued.\n\nSo, total salaries expense for June would be:\n\n- Salaries paid on June 18: $10,000\n\n- Accrued salaries for June 19 to June 30: 8 days * $1,000/day = $8,000\n\n- Total salaries expense: $10,000 + $8,000 = $18,000\n\nBut the problem states that the month-end balance in the salaries expense account before accruals is $14,000.\n\nThis $14,000 likely includes the $10,000 paid on June 18 and some accrued salaries from previous periods.\n\nWait, maybe not.\n\nPerhaps the $14,000 is the total salaries expense recorded so far in June before adjusting for the accrual at June 30.\n\nIn that case, the $14,000 would include the $10,000 paid on June 18 and any accrued salaries from earlier in the month.\n\nBut to reconcile, let's consider:\n\n- Salaries paid on June 18: $10,000 for workdays up to June 18.\n\n- Accrued salaries needed for workdays from June 19 to June 30: 8 days * $1,000/day = $8,000.\n\n- Therefore, total salaries expense for June should be $10,000 + $8,000 = $18,000.\n\nBut the account before accruals shows $14,000.\n\nPerhaps there was an earlier payroll or accrual.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $14,000 includes the $10,000 paid on June 18 and some accrued salaries from earlier in the month.\n\nWait, perhaps there was a payroll covering workdays before June 9, and that payroll was paid earlier in June.\n\nFor example, if payrolls are every other Friday, the payroll on June 4 would cover workdays up to June 4.\n\nThen, the payroll on June 18 would cover workdays from June 9 to June 18.\n\nSo, for June, there would be payrolls on June 4 and June 18, and an accrual for June 19 to June 30.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Payroll on June 4: covers workdays from May 25 to June 4 (assuming a consistent 10-workday period).\n\n- Payroll on June 18: covers workdays from June 9 to June 18.\n\n- Accrual needed for workdays from June 19 to June 30.\n\nSo, the salaries expense for June would include:\n\n- Payroll paid on June 18: $10,000\n\n- Accrued salaries for June 19 to June 30: 8 days * $1,000/day = $8,000\n\n- Total salaries expense: $10,000 + $8,000 = $18,000\n\nBut the account before accruals is $14,000.\n\nPerhaps there is another payroll in June.\n\nWait, if payrolls are every other Friday, in June there could be payrolls on June 4, June 18, and June 25.\n\nBut June 25 is within June, so there would be three payrolls in June.\n\nWait, June 25 would cover workdays from June 19 to June 25 (10 workdays?).\n\nWait, let's check the workdays:\n\n- June 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30.\n\nThat's only 8 days.\n\nWait, perhaps the pay period is different.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to calculate the total salaries expense for the entire month of June and then see what needs to be accrued.\n\nTotal workdays in June: 22.\n\nEach workday: $1,000.\n\nTotal salaries expense for June: 22 * $1,000 = $22,000.\n\nNow, payrolls paid in June:\n\n- Payroll on June 4: covers first 10 workdays (June 1 to June 12).\n\n- Payroll on June 18: covers next 10 workdays (June 15 to June 19).\n\nWait, that's 10 workdays per payroll.\n\nBut total workdays are 22, so need to see.\n\nWait, perhaps each payroll covers two weeks of workdays, which is 10 days.\n\nSo, payrolls are every other Friday, covering the previous 10 workdays.\n\nSo, payroll on June 4 covers workdays up to June 4.\n\nPayroll on June 18 covers workdays from June 9 to June 18.\n\nThen, accrual needed for workdays from June 19 to June 30.\n\nSo, total salaries expense for June: $22,000.\n\nSalaries paid in June: $10,000 (June 18 payroll).\n\nAccrued salaries: $12,000.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet's consider the following:\n\n- Total workdays in June: 22.\n\n- Each payroll covers 10 workdays.\n\n- Payrolls are every other Friday.\n\n- Last payroll was paid on June 18, covering workdays up to June 18 (14 workdays from June 1 to June 18).\n\nWait, but according to the problem, each payroll covers 10 workdays.\n\nSo, payroll on June 18 covers the last 10 workdays up to June 18.\n\nIf June 18 is the eighth workday of June, then the last 10 workdays would include some from May.\n\nWait, no. If payrolls cover the last 10 workdays up to the payroll date, then the payroll on June 18 would cover workdays from June 9 to June 18.\n\nThat's 10 workdays.\n\nThen, from June 19 to June 30 is another 8 workdays that need to be accrued.\n\nSo, total salaries expense for June: salaries paid on June 18 ($10,000) plus accrued salaries for June 19 to June 30 ($8,000).\n\nTotal: $18,000.\n\nBut the account before accruals is $14,000.\n\nPerhaps there was another payroll in June.\n\nWait, if payrolls are every other Friday, there could be payrolls on June 4 and June 18.\n\nPayroll on June 4 covers workdays from May 25 to June 4.\n\nPayroll on June 18 covers workdays from June 9 to June 18.\n\nAccrual needed for workdays from June 19 to June 30.\n\nSo, total salaries expense for June: payroll on June 18 ($10,000) plus accrued salaries ($8,000).\n\nTotal: $18,000.\n\nBut the account before accruals is $14,000.\n\nMaybe the $14,000 includes the payroll on June 4.\n\nWait, payroll on June 4 would be for workdays up to June 4, which is 4 workdays (June 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nAt $1,000 per day, that's $4,000.\n\nBut the total account before accruals is $14,000, which is more than the $10,000 paid on June 18.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the $14,000 includes the $10,000 paid on June 18 and some accrued salaries from earlier in the month.\n\nBut according to this, the only accrual needed is for June 19 to June 30, which is $8,000.\n\nSo, total salaries expense should be $10,000 + $8,000 = $18,000.\n\nBut the account before accruals is $14,000.\n\nMaybe there is an additional payroll on June 25 that is not yet paid, but since the month ends on June 30, any payroll after that would not be included.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the payrolls cover different periods.\n\nThis is getting too tangled.\n\nLooking back at the options, $18,000 is one of the choices.\n\nGiven the confusion and the time I've spent on this, I'll go with $18,000 as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nd. $18,000"
