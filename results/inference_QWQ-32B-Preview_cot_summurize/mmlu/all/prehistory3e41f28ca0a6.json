                    "text": "Let's see... I need to figure out who named the city Teotihuac\u00e1n. Let me think about what I know about Teotihuac\u00e1n.\n\nFirst off, Teotihuac\u00e1n was a huge ancient city in Mexico, right? It was one of the largest cities in the pre-Columbian Americas. I remember that it was at its height between around 100 BCE and 750 CE. But I'm not sure who named it.\n\nOption A says it was named by the Aztecs, who continued to make pilgrimages there after its collapse. I think that might be possible because the Aztecs were a later civilization, and they often attributed names to places they considered sacred. I recall that \"Teotihuac\u00e1n\" roughly translates to \"the place where gods were born\" in Nahuatl, the Aztec language. So, it makes sense that they named it something meaningful to them.\n\nOption B mentions the Spanish invaders destroying it and naming it. But I thought the Spanish arrived much later, around the 16th century, and by that time, Teotihuac\u00e1n was already in ruins. I don't think they named it; they just found it in that state.\n\nOption C suggests that the city's first king named it after his favorite deity. Well, I don't recall any specific information about a first king of Teotihuac\u00e1n or what its original name was. Teotihuac\u00e1n was a multi-ethnic city, and its founders are still a topic of debate among scholars. So, this option seems less likely.\n\nOption D proposes that Olmec traders named it after being impressed with its grandeur. The Olmecs were an earlier civilization, known as the \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica, but they were mostly active between 1200 BCE and 400 BCE. By the time Teotihuac\u00e1n was founded, the Olmec civilization was already in decline. While they might have had some influence, it seems unlikely that they named a city that came after their time.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most plausible answer is A: the Aztecs named the city Teotihuac\u00e1n and continued to pilgrimage there after its collapse. The name seems to have cultural and religious significance to them, and they were known to ascribe names to places they considered sacred.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check some facts. Teotihuac\u00e1n was abandoned around 750 CE, and the Aztecs rose to power much later, around the 14th century. So, there was a significant time gap between the city's collapse and the Aztecs' arrival. However, it's known that the Aztecs revered the place and made pilgrimages to it, considering it a site of great spiritual importance.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the original name of the city is not known. The inhabitants of Teotihuac\u00e1n used a language that hasn't been fully deciphered, and their culture didn't leave extensive written records like the Maya or the Aztecs. Therefore, the name \"Teotihuac\u00e1n\" is likely an Aztec designation because that's the name that has been passed down through history.\n\nAdditionally, the Aztecs had a practice of attributing names to places they encountered, often based on their own cultural and religious interpretations. So, it aligns with their behavior to name a place like Teotihuac\u00e1n based on its significance to them.\n\nOption B seems incorrect because the Spanish conquerors, while they did cause destruction in Mesoamerica, did not name Teotihuac\u00e1n. They encountered the ruins and may have recorded the name as given by the local people, who were likely influenced by Aztec nomenclature.\n\nOption C is speculative because there is no concrete evidence of a specific king founding the city and naming it after a deity. Teotihuac\u00e1n's origins are shrouded in mystery, and multiple groups may have contributed to its establishment.\n\nOption D is also unlikely because the Olmecs were a earlier civilization, and by the time Teotihuac\u00e1n was founded, they were already in decline. While they had a significant influence on later Mesoamerican cultures, it's not plausible that they named a city that came after their prime.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information and logical deduction, I conclude that the Aztecs named the city Teotihuac\u00e1n and continued to make pilgrimages there after its collapse.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
