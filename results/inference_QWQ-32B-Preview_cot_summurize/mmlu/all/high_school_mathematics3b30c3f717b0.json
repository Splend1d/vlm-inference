                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"A relative maximum value of the function y = (ln x)/x is\n\nA. 1\n\nB. e\n\nC. 2/e\n\nD. 1/e\"\n\nOkay, I need to find the relative maximum of the function y = (ln x)/x. I remember that to find relative maxima or minima of a function, I need to find its critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero or undefined. Then, I can determine whether these points are maxima or minima, maybe by using the second derivative test or by checking the sign of the first derivative around those points.\n\nSo, first things first, I need to find the derivative of y with respect to x. The function is y = (ln x)/x. This looks like a quotient of two functions: ln x and x. So, I should use the quotient rule for differentiation. The quotient rule says that if you have y = u/v, then y' = (u'v - uv')/v\u00b2.\n\nHere, u = ln x and v = x.\n\nSo, u' = 1/x and v' = 1.\n\nPlugging into the quotient rule:\n\ny' = [(1/x)(x) - (ln x)(1)] / x\u00b2\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n(1/x)(x) = 1\n\nSo, 1 - ln x\n\nTherefore, y' = (1 - ln x)/x\u00b2\n\nNow, to find the critical points, I set y' equal to zero or undefined.\n\nFirst, where is y' undefined? The denominator is x\u00b2, which is undefined when x = 0. But, in the original function y = (ln x)/x, the natural logarithm ln x is only defined for x > 0. So, x = 0 is not in the domain anyway. Therefore, y' is defined for all x > 0 except possibly where the numerator is zero.\n\nSo, set the numerator equal to zero:\n\n1 - ln x = 0\n\nln x = 1\n\nx = e\n\nOkay, so x = e is a critical point.\n\nNow, I need to determine if this is a relative maximum or minimum. I can use the second derivative test. So, I need to find y''.\n\nStarting with y' = (1 - ln x)/x\u00b2\n\nI'll use the quotient rule again. Here, u = 1 - ln x and v = x\u00b2.\n\nSo, u' = -1/x and v' = 2x.\n\nThen, y'' = [u'v - uv']/v\u00b2\n\n= [(-1/x)(x\u00b2) - (1 - ln x)(2x)] / x\u2074\n\n= [(-x) - (2x - 2x ln x)] / x\u2074\n\n= [-x - 2x + 2x ln x] / x\u2074\n\n= [-3x + 2x ln x] / x\u2074\n\nFactor out x in the numerator:\n\n= x(-3 + 2 ln x) / x\u2074\n\n= (-3 + 2 ln x)/x\u00b3\n\nNow, evaluate y'' at x = e:\n\ny''(e) = (-3 + 2 ln e)/e\u00b3\n\nSince ln e = 1:\n\ny''(e) = (-3 + 2(1))/e\u00b3 = (-3 + 2)/e\u00b3 = (-1)/e\u00b3\n\nWhich is negative because e\u00b3 is positive and -1 is negative.\n\nSo, y''(e) < 0, which means the function has a relative maximum at x = e.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the relative maximum value, not the x-coordinate. So, I need to find y(e).\n\ny(e) = (ln e)/e = 1/e\n\nWait a minute, but look at the options:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. e\n\nC. 2/e\n\nD. 1/e\n\nSo, option D is 1/e, which seems to be the value at x = e.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier calculation, I have y(e) = 1/e.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me double-check:\n\ny = (ln x)/x\n\nAt x = e:\n\nln e = 1\n\nSo, y(e) = 1/e\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me see if there's any other critical point or if I missed something.\n\nIs there any other x where y' = 0?\n\nWell, y' = (1 - ln x)/x\u00b2\n\nSet y' = 0:\n\n1 - ln x = 0 \u21d2 ln x = 1 \u21d2 x = e\n\nSo, only one critical point at x = e.\n\nAnd since y''(e) < 0, it's a relative maximum.\n\nTherefore, the relative maximum value is y(e) = 1/e.\n\nBut let me check the behavior as x approaches 0 and as x approaches infinity to confirm there are no other maxima.\n\nAs x approaches 0 from the right:\n\nln x approaches -infinity, so (ln x)/x approaches -infinity.\n\nAs x approaches infinity:\n\nln x grows slower than x, so (ln x)/x approaches 0.\n\nSo, the function decreases after x = e, and increases before x = e.\n\nTherefore, the relative maximum is indeed at x = e, and the value is 1/e.\n\nBut wait, option D is 1/e, but option C is 2/e.\n\nIs there a possibility that 2/e is the correct answer?\n\nLet me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are asking for the maximum value of y, but perhaps I need to consider the function more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the second derivative test.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the first derivative test to confirm.\n\nTo the left of x = e, for x < e, say x = 1:\n\ny'(1) = (1 - ln 1)/1\u00b2 = (1 - 0)/1 = 1 > 0\n\nSo, the function is increasing to the left of x = e.\n\nTo the right of x = e, for x > e, say x = e\u00b2:\n\ny'(e\u00b2) = (1 - ln(e\u00b2))/e\u2074 = (1 - 2)/e\u2074 = (-1)/e\u2074 < 0\n\nSo, the function is decreasing to the right of x = e.\n\nTherefore, x = e is a relative maximum.\n\nAnd y(e) = 1/e.\n\nBut let me check if this is indeed the maximum value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum value of y, and maybe 2/e is the correct answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the function more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to find the maximum value of y, not at x = e, but somewhere else.\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, the only critical point is at x = e, and it's a maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement or in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the function has an absolute maximum at x = e, and no other relative maxima.\n\nTherefore, the relative maximum value is 1/e.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option D is 1/e.\n\nBut the question says \"a relative maximum value\", and according to my calculations, it's 1/e.\n\nBut perhaps there is a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the x-coordinate of the maximum, not the y-coordinate.\n\nWait, no, it says \"a relative maximum value of the function y = (ln x)/x is\", which should be the y-value.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's see what y(e) is.\n\ny(e) = (ln e)/e = 1/e.\n\nSo, option D is correct.\n\nBut perhaps there is a trick here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function has another maximum.\n\nWait, but according to the first derivative test, it's increasing before x = e and decreasing after, so it's only one maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the behavior for x > e.\n\nBut as x approaches infinity, y approaches 0, which is less than 1/e.\n\nAnd as x approaches 0, y approaches -infinity.\n\nSo, indeed, the relative maximum is at x = e, and y = 1/e.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 1/e.\n\nBut perhaps the question is miswritten, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function has a higher value at some other point.\n\nBut according to my analysis, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the function has a horizontal tangent somewhere else.\n\nBut according to y' = (1 - ln x)/x\u00b2, the only solution to y' = 0 is x = e.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. 1/e.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there is any inflection point or anything like that.\n\nFrom y'' = (-3 + 2 ln x)/x\u00b3\n\nSet y'' = 0:\n\n-3 + 2 ln x = 0\n\nln x = 3/2\n\nx = e^(3/2)\n\nSo, at x = e^(3/2), there is an inflection point.\n\nBut that doesn't affect the relative maximum.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the relative maximum value is 1/e.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. } \\dfrac{1}{e}} \\]"
