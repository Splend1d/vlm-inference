                    "text": "So I've got this question here about expected returns on securities, and I need to find out the expected return of a portfolio that's equally weighted between Securities A and C. Let's see what I've got.\n\nFirst, the expected returns are given for three securities:\n\n- Security A: 7%\n\n- Security B: 12%\n\n- Security C: 5%\n\nBut the question is only about Securities A and C, and they're equally weighted in the portfolio. So, I don't think Security B is relevant here.\n\nAn equal weighted portfolio means that the investments in Securities A and C are split equally, right? So, 50% in A and 50% in C.\n\nTo find the expected return of the portfolio, I think I need to calculate the weighted average of the expected returns of A and C.\n\nSo, the formula for the expected return of the portfolio (Rp) should be:\n\nRp = (weight of A * expected return of A) + (weight of C * expected return of C)\n\nSince it's equally weighted, the weights are both 0.5.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nRp = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\n\nNow, calculating that:\n\nFirst, 0.5 times 7% is 3.5%.\n\nThen, 0.5 times 5% is 2.5%.\n\nAdding those together: 3.5% + 2.5% = 6%.\n\nSo, the expected return of the portfolio should be 6%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10%\n\nB. 8.50%\n\nC. 6%\n\nD. 12%\n\nOption C is 6%, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nIs there any reason why Security B would be included in this calculation? The question specifies Securities A and C, so I think it's okay to ignore Security B.\n\nAlso,\u786e\u8ba4\u4e00\u4e0b\u7b49\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u610f\u601d\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u540450%\uff1f\u56e0\u4e3a\u662fequal weighted\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u5404\u5360\u4e00\u534a\u3002\n\n\u518d\u60f3\u60f3\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u662f50:50\uff0c\u9898\u76ee\u5e94\u8be5\u4f1a specify\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u8bf430% in A and 70% in C\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u522b\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u91cc\u8bf4\u662fequal weighted\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u540450%.\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u518d\u7b97\u4e00\u904d\u5427\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6ca1\u6709\u7b97\u9519\u3002\n\n0.5 * 7% = 3.5%\n\n0.5 * 5% = 2.5%\n\n3.5% + 2.5% = 6%\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u5e94\u8be5\u662fC. 6%.\n\n\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e2a\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
