Yikes, that's a pretty intense situation. Now, according to the ethics codes from the American and Canadian Psychological Associations, I need to figure out what the first psychologist should do.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Speak with the colleague privately to resolve this incident informally.\n\nB. Report the colleague to the appropriate local, state/provincial, or national ethics committee.\n\nC. Say nothing further regarding this incident unless there's a complaint from the client.\n\nD. Contact the colleague's client to offer assistance and/or professional advice.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what the ethics codes say about these kinds of situations. I know that both the APA and the CPA have pretty strict guidelines about boundaries in therapy and about reporting ethical violations.\n\nOption A suggests talking to the colleague privately. That seems like a gentle approach, but given the seriousness of the violation, I'm not sure if that's sufficient. Boundary violations, especially sexual relationships with clients, are major ethical breaches. According to the ethics codes, psychologists are supposed to avoid dual relationships that could impair their judgment or exploit the client. Having a sexual relationship with a client is outright prohibited because it's incredibly exploitative and harmful to the client.\n\nOption B is to report the colleague to the ethics committee. This seems more appropriate because reporting serious ethical violations is crucial to protect clients and maintain the integrity of the profession. Ethics committees are set up to handle such complaints and take appropriate actions, which may include sanctions against the offending psychologist.\n\nOption C suggests saying nothing unless the client complains. That seems laissez-faire and not in line with ethical reporting requirements. In many jurisdictions, psychologists are mandated to report serious ethical violations by their colleagues. Turning a blind eye could potentially harm not only the current client but also future clients of the offending psychologist.\n\nOption D is to contact the colleague's client to offer assistance or advice. While it's noble to want to help the client, it might not be the best approach. The client is already in a vulnerable position, and approaching them directly could complicate things further. It's possible that the client doesn't realize the severity of the boundary violation or might feel pressured. Moreover, the first psychologist might not have the full context of the situation.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most appropriate action is to report the colleague to the ethics committee. This aligns with the ethical responsibility to report serious breaches of professional conduct. It ensures that the appropriate authorities are made aware of the situation and can take steps to protect the client and prevent further misconduct.\n\nI should also remember that ethics codes emphasize the importance of taking action when one becomes aware of ethical violations. Sitting on such information or trying to handle it informally could be seen as condoning the behavior, which is contrary to professional ethics.\n\nIn conclusion, option B seems to be the most ethically sound choice in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
