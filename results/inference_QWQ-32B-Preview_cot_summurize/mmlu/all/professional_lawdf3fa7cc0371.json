                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the legal effect of the landscaper's promise on March 25 is. So, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an existing contract for landscaping the front yard, and it seems like the homeowner is happy with the work done so far. On March 25, the homeowner proposes to the landscaper to do the backyard as well, under the same terms and conditions as the front yard, to be completed by May 1, and in return, the homeowner will pay $10,000 at that time. The landscaper agrees and they shake hands on it.\n\nSo, the question is asking about the probable legal effect of the landscaper's promise to landscape the backyard.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable unilateral contract.\n\nB. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.\n\nC. The landscaper's promise was voidable, since it was not in writing.\n\nD. The landscaper's promise was illusory, thereby creating an unenforceable contract.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nA unilateral contract is one where one party promises to pay or do something in exchange for the other party's performance of an act. So, for example, if I say, \"I'll pay you $100 if you mow my lawn,\" that's a unilateral contract. You perform the act of mowing the lawn, and I pay you $100.\n\nA bilateral contract is where both parties promise to do something. So, for example, \"I promise to sell you my car for $5,000, and you promise to buy it for that price.\"\n\nNow, in this scenario, the homeowner is proposing to pay $10,000 in exchange for the landscaper's promise to landscape the backyard by May 1. So, it seems like both parties are making promises here: the homeowner to pay $10,000 upon completion, and the landscaper to complete the backyard landscaping by May 1.\n\nSo, that sounds like a bilateral contract, right? Both are promising to do something.\n\nBut wait, let's see what a unilateral contract would look like in this context. If the homeowner said, \"I'll pay you $10,000 when you finish landscaping the backyard,\" and the landscaper starts working without promising to do it, that would be a unilateral contract. But in this case, the landscaper is promising to do the work by a specific date.\n\nAlso, considering that they already have an existing contract for the front yard, and the backyard work is to be on the same terms and conditions, maybe there's more to it.\n\nOption C says the promise was voidable because it wasn't in writing. Now, in contract law, there's something called the Statute of Frauds, which requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, especially those that can't be performed within one year. Here, the work is to be completed by May 1, which is less than a year from March 25, so maybe that doesn't apply. But I need to confirm the exact timing.\n\nOption D says the promise was illusory, making the contract unenforceable. An illusory promise is one where one party doesn't really commit to do anything. For example, \"I'll sell you this car if I feel like it.\" That's too vague and doesn't create an enforceable obligation.\n\nIn this case, the landscaper is promising to landscape the backyard by May 1, which seems like a concrete promise.\n\nSo, going back to options A and B, it seems like a bilateral contract because both parties are promising to do something: the homeowner to pay $10,000 upon completion, and the landscaper to complete the work by May 1.\n\nBut let's think about the existing contract. The front yard work is almost finished, and now they're adding the backyard work on the same terms and conditions. Maybe this is considered a modification or an addition to the existing contract.\n\nIn contract law, modifications to existing contracts generally need to satisfy the same requirements as original contracts, meaning there should be offer, acceptance, consideration, and sometimes, if it's subject to the Statute of Frauds, it needs to be in writing.\n\nHere, the homeowner is making an offer to the landscaper to do the backyard work under the same terms and conditions, with payment of $10,000 upon completion by May 1. The landscaper accepts by saying \"Agreed\" and they shake hands.\n\nNow, is this sufficient to create an enforceable contract? Well, generally, oral contracts are enforceable, except for those that fall under the Statute of Frauds, which require writing.\n\nThe Statute of Frauds typically includes contracts that can't be performed within one year, contracts for the sale of land, guarantees, etc. Here, the work is to be completed by May 1, which is less than two months from March 25, so it's definitely performable within one year. Therefore, probably not subject to the Statute of Frauds.\n\nSo, option C might not be correct.\n\nOption D suggests that the promise was illusory. But promising to landscape the backyard by May 1 is a concrete promise, not illusory.\n\nTherefore, it seems like the correct answer is B: The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider unilateral contract again. In a unilateral contract, the homeowner would be promising to pay upon completion of the act (landscaping the backyard), and the landscaper would perform the act in reliance on that promise.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, it seems like there's a mutual promise: the homeowner promises to pay $10,000 upon completion, and the landscaper promises to complete the work by May 1.\n\nSo, it's more aligned with a bilateral contract.\n\nAdditionally, since the work is to be completed by May 1, and the payment is due at that time, it's a straightforward exchange of promises.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
