This process occurs in the menstrual cycle, typically lasting about 28 days, but it can vary from person to person. During menstruation, the body expels blood, tissue, and mucus from the uterus through the vagina.\n\nTo provide a more comprehensive understanding, let's briefly touch on the other options as well:\n\nB. Ovulation: This is the release of a mature egg (ovum) from the follicle in the ovary. It typically occurs midway through the menstrual cycle and is the time when a person is most fertile.\n\nC. The luteal phase: This phase follows ovulation and lasts until the start of the next menstrual period. During this time, the corpus luteum forms in the ovary and produces progesterone to prepare the uterus for a potential pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, leading to a drop in hormone levels and the onset of menstruation.\n\nD. The follicular phase: This is the initial phase of the menstrual cycle, starting on the first day of menstruation and ending with ovulation. During this phase, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles, each containing an immature egg. One follicle typically dominates and matures to release an egg during ovulation.\n\nUnderstanding these different phases and processes is crucial for reproductive health and family planning."
