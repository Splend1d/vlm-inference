                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about what an accountant least likely performs during a review engagement of a nonissuer's financial statements. So, first things first, we need to understand what a review engagement entails.\n\nA review engagement is less extensive than an audit but more involved than a compilation. The accountant's objective is to perform analytical procedures and make inquiries of management to provide limited assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements for them to be in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.\n\nOption A: Make inquiries of management about actions taken at board of directors' meetings.\n\nThis seems plausible. During a review, accountants do make inquiries of management to understand the entity's operations, significant transactions, and any changes that might affect the financial statements. Inquiries about board meetings could be relevant if significant decisions were made that have financial implications. So, this is something an accountant might do during a review engagement.\n\nOption B: Study the relationships of financial statement elements expected to conform to predictable patterns.\n\nThis sounds like analytical procedures, which are a key part of a review engagement. Accountants compare financial data internally over time and externally with industry trends to identify any unusual fluctuations or relationships that might indicate potential misstatements. So, this is definitely something they would do during a review.\n\nOption C: Identify internal control activities that are likely to prevent or detect material misstatements.\n\nNow, this is interesting. In an audit, accountants evaluate internal controls because audits provide a high level of assurance. However, in a review engagement, which provides only limited assurance, the standards do not require the accountant to assess internal controls. The review is primarily based on analytical procedures and inquiries. So, identifying internal control activities might not be a standard part of a review engagement.\n\nOption D: Compare the financial statements with anticipated results in budgets and forecasts.\n\nAgain, this falls under analytical procedures. Comparing actual financial results with budgets and forecasts helps accountants identify any significant variances that may require further investigation. This is a common procedure in review engagements.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C seems like the procedure an accountant is least likely to perform during a review engagement of a nonissuer's financial statements. While understanding internal controls can be informative, the standards for a review engagement do not require an in-depth evaluation of internal controls as they do in an audit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
