                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario involving a subdivision and a school tract. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, in 1995, an investor bought a 100-acre tract in a rural county. He then prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential lots and set aside 10 acres for a public school building. In his sales brochure, he mentioned that the school would be close to the subdivision and that the county wouldn't need to spend tax money to acquire the property for the school.\n\nIn 1996, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. Over the next few years, the investor sold 50 residential lots. In 2002, he sold the remaining 40 lots and the 10-acre tract to a builder, with deeds that matched the previous 50 deeds. By 2007, the builder had sold all 40 lots, and each deed specified that the lot was part of the subdivision.\n\nThen, on January 9, 2008, the builder sold the 10-acre tract to another buyer. This deed didn't mention the subdivision. Five days later, the county school board decided to build a new school on that 10-acre tract. Two weeks after that, the buyer started building a pizzeria there.\n\nNow, the school board is suing the buyer to stop the pizzeria construction, and we need to decide who the court would likely rule in favor of.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The buyer, because his own deed made no mention of the subdivision.\n\nB. The buyer, because the dedication was not made to the public in general.\n\nC. The school district, because the 10-acre tract was designated for public use.\n\nD. The school district, because the 10-acre tract constituted an equitable servitude.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a subdivision dedication is and how it affects the property.\n\nA subdivision is typically planned and developed by dividing a large tract of land into smaller parcels, often for residential use. When a developer creates a subdivision, they may dedicate certain lands for public use, like parks or schools, as part of the development plan.\n\nIn this case, the investor initially set aside 10 acres for a public school building in the subdivision plan, which was recorded in 1996.\n\nNow, the buyer purchased the 10-acre tract in 2008, and the school board wants to build a school there, but the buyer is building a pizzeria instead.\n\nOption A suggests that the buyer should win because his deed didn't mention the subdivision. But, even if the deed doesn't mention the subdivision, the tract was part of the recorded subdivision plan, which could still bind the property.\n\nOption B says the buyer should win because the dedication wasn't made to the public in general. However, the subdivision plan was recorded, and dedications in such plans are typically enforceable against subsequent purchasers.\n\nOption C argues for the school district because the tract was designated for public use. This seems plausible because the original plan designated the land for a public school.\n\nOption D suggests the school district should win because the tract constitutes an equitable servitude. An equitable servitude is a restriction on the use of land that runs with the land and binds subsequent owners.\n\nLet's dive deeper into these concepts.\n\nFirst, the recording of the subdivision plan in 1996 is crucial. Recorded documents can affect the rights of subsequent purchasers.\n\nThe investor's sales brochure stated that the school would be built on the 10-acre tract, and that the county wouldn't need to spend tax money to acquire it. This suggests that there was an intention to dedicate this land for public school use.\n\nWhen the investor sold the remaining 40 lots and the 10-acre tract to the builder in 2002, the deeds included language identical to the previous deeds. This implies that the subdivision restrictions were passed on to the builder.\n\nThen, the builder sold all 40 lots by 2007, and each deed specified that the lot was part of the subdivision.\n\nFinally, on January 9, 2008, the builder sold the 10-acre tract to the buyer, with a deed that didn't mention the subdivision.\n\nNow, six days later, the school board votes to build a school on that tract, and the buyer starts building a pizzeria.\n\nSo, the question is whether the original dedication of the 10-acre tract for a public school binds the current buyer.\n\nIn real estate law, a dedication is a formal offer by a landowner to donate a portion of their land for public use, such as for streets, parks, or schools. For a dedication to be effective, it generally must be accepted by the appropriate public authority.\n\nIn this case, the investor included the 10-acre tract for a public school in the subdivision plan, which was recorded in 1996. This suggests that there was an intent to dedicate the land for public use.\n\nHowever, we don't know if the county school board officially accepted this dedication. If they did accept it, then the land would be reserved for school use, and subsequent purchasers would be bound by that dedication.\n\nIf the dedication was accepted, then even though the buyer's deed didn't mention the subdivision, the land is still subject to the original dedication because it's a matter of public record.\n\nAlternatively, if the dedication wasn't accepted by the school board, then the land might not be reserved for school use, and the buyer could use it for other purposes, like building a pizzeria.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The buyer, because his own deed made no mention of the subdivision.\n\nBut, the subdivision plan was recorded, and recorded documents can affect the rights of subsequent purchasers, even if their deeds don't mention them.\n\nB. The buyer, because the dedication was not made to the public in general.\n\nThis is unclear. Dedications in subdivision plans are typically made to the public for specific uses.\n\nC. The school district, because the 10-acre tract was designated for public use.\n\nThis seems strong, assuming the dedication was accepted by the school board.\n\nD. The school district, because the 10-acre tract constituted an equitable servitude.\n\nEquitable servitudes are typically used to enforce restrictive covenants in subdivisions, but in this case, it's a dedication for public use.\n\nI think the key here is whether the dedication was accepted by the school board.\n\nGiven that in 2008, the school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract, this could be seen as acceptance of the dedication.\n\nAdditionally, the investor's sales brochure suggested that the county wouldn't need to expend tax money to acquire the property, implying that the county already had rights to the land for the school.\n\nFurthermore, all the deeds for the subdivision lots identified them as part of the subdivision, suggesting that the subdivision restrictions, including the dedication, bind all lot owners.\n\nTherefore, even though the buyer's deed didn't mention the subdivision, the recorded subdivision plan and the school board's acceptance of the dedication would likely bind the buyer to the original purpose of the land.\n\nThus, the court would likely grant judgment for the school district, making option C the correct answer.\n\nOption D, regarding equitable servitude, might also have some merit, but it's not as directly applicable as the dedication itself.\n\nSo, the answer is C. The school district, because the 10-acre tract was designated for public use.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
