                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Hursthouse's view on moral theories providing clear guidance. The question is:\n\n\"What does Hursthouse say about the claim that any adequate action-guiding (i.e., moral) theory must provide clear guidance about what ought and ought not to be done that any intelligent person could follow?\n\nA. She says the claim is very plausible.\n\nB. She says the claim is implausible.\n\nC. She says the claim is self-evident.\n\nD. She says the claim is true.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what Hursthouse says about this. I think she is discussing the requirements for a moral theory to be action-guiding. I remember that she emphasizes the importance of a moral theory being able to guide people's actions in a clear way.\n\nLet me think about this. Is she agreeing with the claim or not? I think she might be agreeing that an adequate moral theory should provide clear guidance that any intelligent person can follow. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact wording she uses.\n\nOption A says she finds the claim very plausible. Option B says she finds it implausible. Option C says she thinks it's self-evident, and Option D says she says it's true.\n\nI think she probably agrees with the claim, so options A and D seem more likely. But I need to remember if she describes it as \"very plausible\" or just \"true.\"\n\nI recall that Hursthouse is a proponent of virtue ethics, and she argues that a good moral theory should help us live a virtuous life by providing clear guidance on how to act. So, she would likely support the idea that a moral theory ought to provide clear guidance.\n\nMaybe I should look back at the text to confirm, but since I don't have the text right now, I need to rely on my memory.\n\nI think she might say that it's a plausible claim, perhaps even obvious, that a good moral theory should be able to guide actions clearly. So, option A, \"She says the claim is very plausible,\" might be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if she outright states that it's true, then option D would be correct. But I think she might qualify it as plausible rather than absolutely true.\n\nWait, maybe she considers it a necessary condition for a moral theory to be adequate, which would align with it being true.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit unsure now. Let me think differently. If she says it's self-evident, that would be option C, but I don't recall her using that term.\n\nI think she probably agrees with the claim and considers it a fundamental requirement for any moral theory to be action-guiding. So, she might say it's true.\n\nBut perhaps she also acknowledges some complexities or challenges in achieving this, which might lead her to say it's very plausible without fully committing to its truth.\n\nI need to decide between A and D. If I had to choose, I would go with D, \"She says the claim is true,\" because I think she directly endorses the idea that an adequate moral theory must provide clear action guidance.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely confident, so I might be wrong.\n\nAnother approach: If she says it's very plausible, that's close to saying it's true, but with a bit more caution. Maybe she stops short of asserting it as absolutely true.\n\nAlternatively, if she says it's self-evident, that would suggest she thinks it's obviously true without needing further justification.\n\nI don't recall her using the term \"self-evident\" in this context, so option C seems less likely.\n\nBetween A and D, I'm still leaning towards D, thinking that she asserts the claim as true.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm a bit uncertain. Maybe I should consider the context in which she discusses this.\n\nHursthouse is known for her work on virtue ethics, and she often contrasts it with other theories like deontology and consequentialism. Maybe in this discussion, she is setting up the criteria for what makes a good moral theory, and in doing so, she asserts that clear action guidance is essential.\n\nGiven that, it seems likely that she would say the claim is true: that any adequate moral theory must provide clear guidance that any intelligent person could follow.\n\nSo, I'll go with option D: \"She says the claim is true.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
