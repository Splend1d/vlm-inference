                    "text": "So I've got this question here about absolutism, and I need to choose the correct statement that absolutism endorses regarding murder. The options are:\n\nA. prevent murder at all costs\n\nB. avoid murder at all costs\n\nC. only sometimes prevent murder\n\nD. only sometimes avoid murder\n\nFirst, I need to understand what absolutism means in this context. Absolutism, as I recall, is a moral viewpoint that holds certain actions are absolutely right or wrong, regardless of the circumstances. So, for example, some absolutists might believe that murder is always wrong, no matter what the situation is.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA says \"prevent murder at all costs.\" This seems to suggest that whatever it takes, we should stop murder from happening. So, if there's a possibility of murder, we should do everything in our power to prevent it.\n\nB says \"avoid murder at all costs.\" This appears to be more about not committing murder ourselves, no matter what. So, even if it means sacrificing other values, we shouldn't commit murder.\n\nC says \"only sometimes prevent murder.\" This suggests that preventing murder is not always necessary or desirable, perhaps depending on the situation.\n\nD says \"only sometimes avoid murder.\" This implies that avoiding murder is not always required; there are circumstances where murder might be acceptable.\n\nGiven that absolutism is about moral rules that are universal and without exception, I think options C and D don't align with absolutism because they allow for exceptions.\n\nBetween A and B, I need to see which one better fits the absolutist perspective on murder. If absolutism holds that murder is always wrong, then avoiding murder at all costs (option B) seems more directly in line with that principle. It's about not committing murder oneself, under any circumstances.\n\nOption A is about preventing murder by others, which is also important, but it's more about intervening to stop others from committing murder. While an absolutist might agree with that, it seems slightly different from the core principle of not committing murder oneself.\n\nMoreover, preventing murder at all costs might involve actions that are themselves morally questionable. For example, violating someone's rights or using excessive force to prevent a murder. An absolutist might have issues with such methods if they involve other moral wrongs.\n\nOn the other hand, avoiding murder at all costs means that no matter what, one should not commit murder. This seems more in line with an absolutist's commitment to a universal moral rule.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B: avoid murder at all costs.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider the context in which this question is presented. The statement is \"Nagel clarifies that absolutism is the view that we should...\" So, it's about what absolutism entails, according to Nagel.\n\nMaybe I should look back at Nagel's arguments or the text where this is mentioned to confirm. However, since I don't have the specific text here, I'll have to rely on my understanding of absolutism.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the alternatives. If absolutism is about unconditional moral rules, then options C and D, which allow for exceptions, can be ruled out.\n\nBetween A and B, A is about preventing murder, which could involve active intervention, whereas B is about avoiding murder, which is more about one's own actions.\n\nPerhaps both could be considered absolutist positions, but they focus on different aspects: one on preventing others from murdering, and the other on not murdering oneself.\n\nBut in terms of personal moral obligations, avoiding murder at all costs seems more fundamental. Preventing murder might be a separate obligation, but it's not directly about one's own actions regarding murder.\n\nTherefore, I still think B is the most appropriate choice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe absolutism requires both preventing and avoiding murder at all costs. But since I have to choose one option, I'll go with B.\n\nAnother angle to consider: if absolutism is about the inviolability of certain moral rules, like the sanctity of life, then avoiding murder at all costs aligns with preserving life and not taking it, under any circumstances.\n\nIn contrast, preventing murder at all costs might sometimes require actions that conflict with other moral rules, which an absolutist might not endorse.\n\nFor example, if preventing a murder requires violating someone's privacy or rights in a severe way, an absolutist might say that's not justifiable, even to prevent murder.\n\nTherefore, preventing murder at all costs might not be consistent with absolutism, whereas avoiding murder at all costs is a clearer absolutist position.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
