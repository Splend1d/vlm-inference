The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage.

He mentions that slaveholders have an advantage because the state governments, churches, and even the federal government are all organized to support slavery. He also notes that the pen, the purse, and the sword are all against those who oppose slavery.\n\nThe question is asking which group would most likely support Douglass's perspective. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Southern Democrats in the 1880s\n\nWell, Southern Democrats in the 1880s were probably still supportive of white supremacy and may have held onto some of the old slaveholding ideals, but by then, slavery had been abolished after the Civil War. So, they wouldn't be supporting slavery per se, but maybe some of their attitudes would align with the old slaveholders' views.\n\nB. Western ranchers in the 1850s\n\nWestern ranchers in the 1850s might have had various opinions about slavery, but generally, ranching interests weren't directly tied to slavery like plantation agriculture was. Some might have supported slavery, others might have been opposed, but it's not clear that they would align with Douglass's perspective.\n\nC. Southern farmers in the 1830s\n\nIn the 1830s, southern farmers might include both slaveholders and non-slaveholders. However, even non-slaveholding farmers often supported the slave system because it kept wages higher for white workers and maintained a social hierarchy that placed them above enslaved Africans. So, it's likely that many southern farmers in the 1830s would not support Douglass's anti-slavery perspective.\n\nD. Northern Republicans in the 1860s\n\nNorthern Republicans in the 1860s were generally opposed to the expansion of slavery and many were abolitionists or at least sympathetic to the cause of ending slavery. This aligns closely with Douglass's views as expressed in his 1857 speech.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that Northern Republicans in the 1860s would be the group most likely to support Frederick Douglass's perspective on slavery.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
