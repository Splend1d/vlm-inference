Now, violence is generally considered a serious issue, and seeking help from authorities like the police is often the appropriate response to handle such situations safely. So, in this case, calling the police on someone who is being violent seems like a responsible action, not a morally wrong one.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character sings a romantic song for their wife at their wedding. Weddings are celebrations of love and commitment, and singing a romantic song to one's spouse in such a setting is typically seen as a thoughtful and affectionate gesture. There's nothing morally wrong with expressing love and appreciation in this way.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them involves the main character doing something that would be considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
