They first appeared in the 1937 cartoon \"Donald's Nephews\" and have been a part of the Disney universe ever since. The trio is often depicted wearing distinct colored hats\u2014Huey in red, Dewey in blue, and Louie in green\u2014to help distinguish them.\n\nOption A, \"Quick Quack Quack,\" doesn't correspond to any known names of Donald Duck's nephews. It might be a playful attempt to create names based on their quacking sounds.\n\nOption B, \"Alvin, Simon, Theodore,\" are actually the names of the Chipmunks from the Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise, not related to Donald Duck's nephews.\n\nOption C, \"Robbie, Chip, Ernie,\" also doesn't match the names of Donald's nephews. \"Chip\" might be confused with Chip Dale, who is a chipmunk character in the Disney universe, but he is separate from Donald's nephews.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Huey, Dewey, and Louie."
