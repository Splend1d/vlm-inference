Waking up early and going shopping isn't generally considered morally wrong. People do this all the time for various reasons, like getting groceries before work or running errands early in the day. There's nothing inherently unethical about this behavior. So, I would say this is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I brought my deceased dog in to the taxidermist so I can remember her forever.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. Taxidermy involves preserving an animal's body, often for display. In the case of a deceased pet, some people choose to have their pets taxidermized as a way to memorialize them. This practice is not illegal in the US, and some people find it comforting.\n\nHowever, morally, it's a subjective matter. Some people might find it creepy or distasteful, while others see it as a way to honor their pet's memory. There isn't a universal consensus that this is morally wrong. Therefore, I would classify this as \"Not wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
