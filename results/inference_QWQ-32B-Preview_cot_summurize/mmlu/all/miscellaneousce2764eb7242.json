Philadelphia.\n\nTo provide some additional context, Philadelphia is not only the largest city in Pennsylvania but also one of the oldest and most historically significant cities in the United States. It was founded in 1682 by William Penn and served as the capital of the United States from 1790 to 1800. Philadelphia is known for its rich history, including being the site of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nHarrisburg, option C, is the capital of Pennsylvania, but it is not the largest city in terms of population. Pittsburgh, option D, is another major city in Pennsylvania, known for its steel industry and sports teams, but it is smaller in population compared to Philadelphia. Stewartsville, option B, is a very small borough in Warren County, Pennsylvania, and is not a major city.\n\nSo, if you're asked about the largest city in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia is the answer."
