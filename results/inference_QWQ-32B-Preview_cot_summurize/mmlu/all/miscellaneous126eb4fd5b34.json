                    "text": "Let's see... I need to figure out which of these famous people was buried in the Valley of the Kings. The options are Louis XIV, Elvis Presley, Julius Caesar, and King Tut. I think the Valley of the Kings is in Egypt, right? So maybe King Tut is the one buried there.\n\nI remember that King Tut is short for Tutankhamun, who was an Egyptian pharaoh. The Valley of the Kings is famous for being the burial place of many pharaohs, so that makes sense. Louis XIV was the Sun King of France, Elvis Presley was an American singer, and Julius Caesar was a Roman emperor. None of them were Egyptian pharaohs, so they wouldn't be buried in the Valley of the Kings.\n\nWait, actually, Julius Caesar was Roman, not Egyptian, and he was assassinated in Rome. Elvis Presley is buried in Memphis, Tennessee, at his Graceland estate. Louis XIV is buried in the Basilica of Saint Denis in France. So, yeah, King Tut is the only one who was an Egyptian pharaoh and would have been buried in the Valley of the Kings.\n\nI also recall that King Tut's tomb was discovered relatively intact by Howard Carter in 1922, which was a major archaeological find. So, it's definitely him.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
