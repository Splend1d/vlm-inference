                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out whether a state court should hear this case where both the plaintiff and defendant live in the same state, and the plaintiff is suing based on a federal statute. The federal statute says claims under it can be brought in any court that has the power to hear the case, and the statute hasn't been interpreted by any federal court yet.\n\nOption A says no, because federal law cases must be in federal court. But the federal statute says claims can be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. So, does that include state courts? I think state courts can hear federal claims if they have the authority, especially when the federal statute allows it.\n\nOption B says no, because state courts must abstain from hearing federal law cases until a federal court has decided the federal issue. But again, the federal statute says claims can be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. Maybe abstention isn't required here, especially since there's no indication that a federal court has already taken up the issue.\n\nOption C says yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law. That sounds right. If state courts can hear federal claims, they shouldn't refuse to hear them just because they're federal.\n\nOption D says yes, because the parties can't proceed in federal court since there's no diversity of citizenship. Well, diversity jurisdiction requires that the parties be from different states, which isn't the case here since both reside in the same state. So, federal court isn't an option based on diversity. But there's also federal question jurisdiction, which allows federal courts to hear cases arising under federal law. However, since both parties are from the same state, and assuming the amount in controversy meets the requirement, maybe federal court could still hear it under federal question jurisdiction. But the problem says they reside in the same state, and the suit is in the state court of that state.\n\nWait, federal question jurisdiction doesn't require diversity of citizenship. It's a separate basis for federal jurisdiction. So, even if both parties are from the same state, if the claim arises under federal law, federal court can hear it. So, perhaps federal court is an option here.\n\nBut the plaintiff has chosen to sue in state court, and the federal statute says claims can be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. So, it seems like state court can hear the case.\n\nAlso, the federal statute hasn't been interpreted by any federal court yet, but does that matter? I don't think so. State courts can interpret federal law, especially when there's no existing federal court interpretation.\n\nI think the key point is that the federal statute allows claims to be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction, which should include state courts. State courts are required to apply federal law when it applies, and they shouldn't discriminate against federal law cases.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law.\n\nBut let me double-check. Option D says yes, because the parties can't proceed in federal court since there's no diversity. But actually, they can proceed in federal court under federal question jurisdiction, even without diversity. So, that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, federal question jurisdiction exists independently of diversity jurisdiction. So, if the claim arises under federal law, federal court can hear it, regardless of the parties' citizenship. So, in this case, federal court could hear the case under federal question jurisdiction.\n\nBut the plaintiff chose to file in state court, and the federal statute says claims can be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. So, it seems permissive, allowing the claim to be brought in state court.\n\nI recall that sometimes federal statutes provide for concurrent jurisdiction, meaning both federal and state courts can hear the case. So, in this scenario, state court can hear the case.\n\nAlso, there's no mention of removal by the defendant to federal court. If the defendant wants to move the case to federal court, they might be able to, but since the question is about whether the state court should hear the case, and assuming the defendant hasn't removed it, then the state court can proceed.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
