Shining rings is probably a nice thing to do; it shows care and respect for their parents and their marriage. There's nothing wrong with that. It's considerate and probably appreciated by the parents.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character sees a thief running from the police and decides to stick out their cane to trip the police. This is a different situation altogether. Here, the main character is interfering with the police pursuing a thief. Tripping the police officers could hinder their ability to catch the thief and possibly put the officers at risk of injury. This action seems dangerous and potentially illegal. It's not clear why the main character would do this, but it doesn't seem like a morally acceptable thing to do.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, shining your parents' wedding rings is not wrong, but trying to trip police officers is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
