In other words, the way we think is influenced by the language we speak. This idea is often summarized by the notion that language shapes thought.\n\nLet's briefly look at why the other options are not correct in this context:\n\nA. We have an innate language acquisition device - This is more associated with Noam Chomsky's theory, which proposes that humans are born with an innate ability to learn language, characterized by a specific module in the brain dedicated to language acquisition.\n\nB. Apes do not have language because they don't use proper syntax - While this might be a perspective held by some researchers in the field of animal communication, it's not directly related to Whorf's hypothesis, which focuses on how language affects human thought and perception.\n\nC. We tend to observe and imitate models - This is more aligned with social learning theories, such as Albert Bandura's social learning theory, which emphasizes the role of observation, imitation, and modeling in learning.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Language determines the way we think, reflecting Whorf's linguistic relativity hypothesis.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nWhorf, B. L.
