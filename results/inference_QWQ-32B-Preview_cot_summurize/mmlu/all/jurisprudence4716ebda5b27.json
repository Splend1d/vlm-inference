                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement doesn't logically follow from Dworkin's idea of law as integrity. I'm a bit rusty on Dworkin's theory, but I remember that he argues for a concept where law is seen as a coherent system, almost like a chain novel, where each decision is part of a larger narrative. The judge's role is to make decisions that fit best with the existing legal landscape, considering principles and rights as integral parts of the law.\n\nOption A says that law as integrity is likely to generate more individual rights and greater liberty. From what I recall, Dworkin emphasizes the importance of individual rights and the moral constraints that should guide legal decisions. So, it makes sense that his approach would lead to a greater recognition of individual rights and liberties. That seems logically consistent.\n\nOption B talks about rendering a community more genuine. If law as integrity helps create a more coherent and just legal system, it could indeed contribute to a more genuine community by providing a shared set of values and principles that people can believe in. So, this also seems plausible.\n\nOption C says that it opens the door to authoritarianism. Hmm, this seems contradictory. If law as integrity is about coherence and moral principles, isn't it more about\u7ea6\u675f power rather than enabling authoritarianism? Authoritarian regimes often disregard individual rights and moral principles in favor of maintaining control. So, this seems less likely to follow from Dworkin's notion.\n\nOption D mentions improving the moral justification for the exercise of political power. Dworkin's emphasis on morality and principles in law directly ties into providing a stronger moral foundation for legal decisions and the exercise of political power. So, this aligns well with his theory.\n\nComparing all these options, C seems to be the least likely to follow from Dworkin's law as integrity. In fact, it seems to contradict the core ideas of his theory. So, I think C is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
