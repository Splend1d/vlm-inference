The options are Martha Stewart, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Ann Landers, and Miss Manners. I don't remember the exact answer, but I think it might be Ann Landers. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I know that \"Dear Abby\" and \"Ann Landers\" were both advice columnists in newspapers. I think they were actually twins. Let me recall some facts. Abigail VanBuren, who wrote \"Dear Abby,\" and her twin sister Eppie Lederer wrote \"Ann Landers.\" So, that would make Ann Landers her twin sister.\n\nWait, but the options include Ann Landers, so maybe that's the correct answer. But just to be sure, let's think about the other options.\n\nMartha Stewart is famous for her lifestyle brand and TV show, not for being an advice columnist. Dr. Ruth Westheimer is known for her sex advice column and public speaking, and Miss Manners is Judith Martin, who writes about etiquette. None of them seem related to Abigail VanBuren as a twin sister.\n\nSo, it must be Ann Landers. Yes, I think that's right. Abigail VanBuren and Ann Landers were twin sisters who both became famous advice columnists. It's interesting how they both chose similar career paths.\n\nI once read that they had a bit of a rivalry, but I'm not sure about that. Anyway, for this question, the answer should be C. Ann Landers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
