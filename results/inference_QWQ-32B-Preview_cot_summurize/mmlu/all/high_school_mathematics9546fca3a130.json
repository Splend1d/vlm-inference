                    "text": "So I've got this equation to solve: |x - 4| - 10 = 2. I need to find all possible values of x and then find their product. The options are -8, 128, -128, and 16.\n\nFirst, I should isolate the absolute value expression. So, I'll add 10 to both sides of the equation to get |x - 4| by itself.\n\n| x - 4 | - 10 + 10 = 2 + 10\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n| x - 4 | = 12\n\nNow, I know that if |a| = b, then a can be b or -b. So, applying that here:\n\nx - 4 = 12 or x - 4 = -12\n\nI'll solve each equation separately.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nx - 4 = 12\n\nAdd 4 to both sides:\n\nx = 12 + 4\n\nx = 16\n\nSecond equation:\n\nx - 4 = -12\n\nAdd 4 to both sides:\n\nx = -12 + 4\n\nx = -8\n\nSo, the possible values of x are 16 and -8.\n\nNow, I need to find the product of these values:\n\n16 * (-8) = -128\n\nLooking back at the options, -128 is one of them.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with |x - 4| - 10 = 2.\n\nAdding 10 to both sides:\n\n| x - 4 | = 12\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, solving for x - 4 = 12 and x - 4 = -12.\n\nSolutions: x = 16 and x = -8.\n\nProduct: 16 * (-8) = -128.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently. The equation |x - 4| = 12 means that the distance between x and 4 is 12. So, x could be 12 units to the right of 4, which is 16, or 12 units to the left of 4, which is -8. Same as what I got earlier.\n\nNow, to confirm, I can plug these values back into the original equation.\n\nFirst, x = 16:\n\n|16 - 4| - 10 = |12| - 10 = 12 - 10 = 2\n\nThat checks out.\n\nSecond, x = -8:\n\n|-8 - 4| - 10 = |-12| - 10 = 12 - 10 = 2\n\nThat also checks out.\n\nSo, both solutions are valid.\n\nThe product is -128, which is option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nMaybe I can square both sides or something, but that seems unnecessary since the absolute value can be handled directly as I did.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the definition of absolute value.\n\nThe definition is:\n\n|x| = x if x >= 0, and -x if x < 0.\n\nSo, applying that to |x - 4|:\n\nIf x - 4 >= 0, then |x - 4| = x - 4\n\nIf x - 4 < 0, then |x - 4| = -(x - 4) = -x + 4\n\nSo, I can split the equation into two cases.\n\nCase 1: x - 4 >= 0\n\nThen, |x - 4| = x - 4\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx - 4 - 10 = 2\n\nSimplify:\n\nx - 14 = 2\n\nAdd 14 to both sides:\n\nx = 16\n\nAnd since x - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12 >= 0, this solution is valid.\n\nCase 2: x - 4 < 0\n\nThen, |x - 4| = -x + 4\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-x + 4 - 10 = 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n-x - 6 = 2\n\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n\n-x = 8\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nx = -8\n\nAnd since x - 4 = -8 - 4 = -12 < 0, this solution is also valid.\n\nSo, again, x = 16 and x = -8.\n\nProduct is -128.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. -128.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the general property of absolute value equations, |a| = b implies a = b or a = -b, provided b >= 0.\n\nIn this case, |x - 4| = 12, which is positive, so two solutions: x - 4 = 12 and x - 4 = -12.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, I'm confident with the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-128} \\]"
