                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"The theory of _______ is used by sociobiologists specifically to explain the evolution of gender differences.\" And the options are A. natural selection, B. the new synthesis, C. sexual selection, D. the gender schema.\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what sociobiology is. Sociobiology is a field that looks at how social behaviors have evolved and are influenced by genetics and evolution. So, it's about linking biological processes to social structures and behaviors.\n\nNow, the question is asking specifically about the evolution of gender differences. So, it's not just about general evolution, but about how males and females differ in their traits and behaviors over time due to evolutionary pressures.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A is natural selection. Natural selection is the process where organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. It's a fundamental concept in evolution. But is it specifically used to explain gender differences?\n\nWell, natural selection can explain gender differences, but it's a broad theory that applies to all kinds of evolutionary changes, not just those related to gender.\n\nOption B is the new synthesis. I think this might be referring to the modern evolutionary synthesis, which is a 20th-century synthesis of ideas from Darwinian evolution, genetics, and other fields to explain how evolution works. Again, it's a broad framework for understanding evolution, not specifically focused on gender differences.\n\nOption C is sexual selection. Hmm, sexual selection is a concept within evolution that explains how certain traits become more common because they give an advantage in mating, even if they don't necessarily help with survival. For example, bright plumage in birds or antlers in deer.\n\nSexual selection can lead to differences between males and females because often, one sex is more competitive for mates than the other. In many species, males compete with each other for access to females, leading to the evolution of traits that help in these competitions, like strength or impressive displays. Females, on the other hand, may be more selective in choosing mates, leading to the evolution of traits that make males more attractive to females.\n\nSo, sexual selection is specifically about how mating behaviors and traits evolve, and it often results in gender differences.\n\nOption D is the gender schema. I'm not familiar with this term in the context of sociobiology. Maybe it's related to how people categorize gender roles or something like that, but it doesn't sound like an evolutionary theory.\n\nGiven this, it seems like sexual selection is the most specific theory used to explain the evolution of gender differences. Natural selection and the new synthesis are more general evolutionary theories, while gender schema doesn't seem relevant in this context.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. sexual selection.\n\nBut to make sure, let's think about it again. Sociobiologists are interested in how social behaviors have evolved, and gender differences are a type of social behavior or trait that differs between males and females.\n\nSexual selection directly addresses how mating behaviors and traits evolve, which would include differences between genders.\n\nNatural selection could encompass sexual selection, but since the question is asking for the specific theory used to explain gender differences, sexual selection seems more appropriate.\n\nAlso, the other options don't really fit. The new synthesis is too broad, and gender schema doesn't seem related to evolutionary theory.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is C. sexual selection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
