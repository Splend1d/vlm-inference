                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this probability problem. We're rolling a fair 6-sided die 5 times and need to find the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of those rolls. The options are a bit confusing, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at most 2\" means. It means that we can have 0, 1, or 2 rolls resulting in a 6. So, I need to calculate the probability for each of these cases and then add them up.\n\nSince the die is fair, the probability of rolling a 6 on any single roll is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a 6 is 5/6. Because each roll is independent, I can use the binomial probability formula for this situation.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials.\n\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\n- n is the number of trials.\n\n- k is the number of successes.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- n = 5 (since we're rolling the die 5 times).\n\n- p = 1/6 (probability of rolling a 6).\n\n- k can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nSo, I need to calculate P(0) + P(1) + P(2).\n\nLet's calculate each one separately.\n\nFirst, P(0):\n\nP(0) = C(5, 0) * (1/6)^0 * (5/6)^5\n\nWe know that C(5, 0) = 1, and any number to the power of 0 is 1.\n\nSo, P(0) = 1 * 1 * (5/6)^5 = (5/6)^5\n\nNow, P(1):\n\nP(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4\n\nC(5, 1) = 5, (1/6)^1 = 1/6, and (5/6)^4 is (5/6)^4.\n\nSo, P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4 = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296) = 5 * (625) / (6 * 1296) = 3125 / 7776\n\nWait, but 6 * 1296 is 7776, right? Let me confirm: 6 * 1200 = 7200, 6 * 96 = 576, total 7776. Yes.\n\nNow, P(2):\n\nP(2) = C(5, 2) * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^3\n\nC(5, 2) = 10, (1/6)^2 = 1/36, (5/6)^3 = 125/216\n\nSo, P(2) = 10 * (1/36) * (125/216) = 10 * (125) / (36 * 216) = 1250 / 7776\n\nWait, but 36 * 216: 36 * 200 = 7200, 36 * 16 = 576, total 7776. So, P(2) = 1250 / 7776\n\nNow, I need to add P(0) + P(1) + P(2):\n\nP(0) = (5/6)^5 = 3125 / 7776\n\nP(1) = 3125 / 7776\n\nP(2) = 1250 / 7776\n\nWait a minute, P(0) is (5/6)^5, which is 5^5 / 6^5 = 3125 / 7776. That matches.\n\nP(1) is 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4 = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296) = 5 * 625 / 7776 = 3125 / 7776. That also matches.\n\nP(2) is 10 * (1/36) * (125/216) = 10 * 125 / 7776 = 1250 / 7776. That matches as well.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n3125 / 7776 + 3125 / 7776 + 1250 / 7776 = (3125 + 3125 + 1250) / 7776 = 7500 / 7776\n\nNow, I need to simplify 7500 / 7776.\n\nLet's see if we can reduce this fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 100.\n\n7500 \u00f7 100 = 75\n\n7776 \u00f7 100 = 77.76, which is not an integer. So, that's not helpful.\n\nMaybe divide by 8? 7500 \u00f7 8 = 937.5, not an integer. How about divide by 4?\n\n7500 \u00f7 4 = 1875\n\n7776 \u00f7 4 = 1944\n\nSo, 7500 / 7776 = 1875 / 1944\n\nCan we simplify further? Let's check if 1875 and 1944 have any common factors.\n\n1875 is 15^3 * 5, and 1944 is 18^3. Wait, let's factor them properly.\n\n1875: 1875 \u00f7 5 = 375, 375 \u00f7 5 = 75, 75 \u00f7 5 = 15, 15 \u00f7 3 = 5, 5 \u00f7 5 = 1. So, 1875 = 5^4 * 3\n\n1944: 1944 \u00f7 2 = 972, 972 \u00f7 2 = 486, 486 \u00f7 2 = 243, 243 \u00f7 3 = 81, 81 \u00f7 3 = 27, 27 \u00f7 3 = 9, 9 \u00f7 3 = 3, 3 \u00f7 3 = 1. So, 1944 = 2^3 * 3^5\n\nCommon factors: only 3.\n\nSo, divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n1875 \u00f7 3 = 625\n\n1944 \u00f7 3 = 648\n\nSo, 7500 / 7776 = 625 / 648\n\nNow, 625 and 648 don't have any common factors. 625 is 5^4, and 648 is 2^3 * 3^4. So, the fraction is simplified.\n\nBut looking at the options, one of them is 625 / 648, which is option C.\n\nWait, but probability can't be greater than 1, and 625 / 648 is approximately 0.964, which is less than 1, so that's fine.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the addition:\n\nP(0) = 3125 / 7776\n\nP(1) = 3125 / 7776\n\nP(2) = 1250 / 7776\n\nTotal: 3125 + 3125 = 6250, plus 1250 = 7500\n\n7500 / 7776 = 625 / 648, as I had.\n\nSo, the answer should be 625 / 648.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. 125 / 648\n\nB. 25 / 648\n\nC. 625 / 648\n\nD. 1 / 648\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability of getting at most 2 sixes by subtracting the probability of getting 3, 4, or 5 sixes from 1.\n\nSo, P(at most 2) = 1 - P(3) - P(4) - P(5)\n\nLet's calculate P(3), P(4), and P(5).\n\nP(3) = C(5, 3) * (1/6)^3 * (5/6)^2 = 10 * (1/216) * (25/36) = 10 * 25 / (216 * 36) = 250 / 7776\n\nWait, 10 * 25 = 250, and 216 * 36 = 7776.\n\nSimilarly, P(4) = C(5, 4) * (1/6)^4 * (5/6)^1 = 5 * (1/1296) * (5/6) = 5 * 5 / (1296 * 6) = 25 / 7776\n\nAnd P(5) = C(5, 5) * (1/6)^5 * (5/6)^0 = 1 * (1/7776) * 1 = 1 / 7776\n\nSo, P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = 250 / 7776 + 25 / 7776 + 1 / 7776 = 276 / 7776\n\nTherefore, P(at most 2) = 1 - 276 / 7776 = (7776 - 276) / 7776 = 7500 / 7776 = 625 / 648\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 625 / 648, which is option C.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of binomial coefficients.\n\nThe total number of outcomes is 6^5, since each roll has 6 possibilities and there are 5 rolls.\n\nBut that's 7776, which matches the denominator.\n\nNow, the number of ways to get exactly k sixes is C(5, k) * (5)^(5 - k)\n\nBecause for the k rolls that are sixes, there's only 1 outcome each, and for the remaining (5 - k) rolls, each can be any of the 5 other numbers.\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes = C(5, 0) * 5^5 + C(5, 1) * 5^4 + C(5, 2) * 5^3\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nC(5, 0) = 1, 5^5 = 3125\n\nC(5, 1) = 5, 5^4 = 625, so 5 * 625 = 3125\n\nC(5, 2) = 10, 5^3 = 125, so 10 * 125 = 1250\n\nTotal favorable outcomes = 3125 + 3125 + 1250 = 7500\n\nTotal possible outcomes = 6^5 = 7776\n\nSo, probability = 7500 / 7776 = 625 / 648\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 625 / 648, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{625}{648}} \\]"
