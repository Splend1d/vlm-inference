                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about finches on the island of Daphne Major during droughts. It's asking which statement is true about the beak size of these finches. There are four options, and I need to figure out which one is correct based on what I know about evolution and natural selection.\n\nFirst, I remember that Daphne Major is one of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands where Peter and Rosemary Grant have done a lot of research on finches, particularly the Grants' long-term study on Darwin's finches. Their work has shown how natural selection can act rapidly in response to environmental changes, like droughts.\n\nDuring prolonged droughts, the environment changes, and certain traits become more advantageous for survival. In the case of finches, their beak size and shape can affect their ability to access different food sources. So, if the drought makes certain types of seeds more available or harder to crack, finches with beaks better suited to handle those seeds might have a higher chance of survival.\n\nOption A says: \"Each bird evolved a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted.\" This sounds like it's suggesting that individual birds are evolving during their lifetime, which isn't how evolution works. Evolution is a change in the genetic traits of a population over generations, not a change in an individual's traits during its lifetime. So, I think this one is incorrect.\n\nOption B says: \"Each bird developed a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted.\" This is similar to option A, implying that individual birds are changing their beak size in response to the drought. Again, this doesn't align with our understanding of evolution. Individuals don't evolve; populations do over time. So, I don't think this is correct either.\n\nOption C states: \"Each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak as the drought persisted.\" This makes sense because during a drought, the availability and type of food change, and finches with beaks better suited to the available food would have a higher chance of survival. So, their beak characteristics would influence their survival rates. This seems plausible.\n\nOption D says: \"Each bird that survived the drought produced only offspring with deeper, stronger beaks than seen in the previous generation.\" This is interesting. It's suggesting that all surviving finches had offspring with improved beak traits compared to the previous generation. However, this might not be entirely accurate because natural selection favors certain traits, but it doesn't mean that all offspring will have those traits. There's always variation in offspring due to genetic recombination and mutations.\n\nMoreover, the Grants' research showed that there was a shift in the average beak size in the population over generations in response to drought, but it doesn't mean that every single surviving bird had offspring with deeper, stronger beaks. So, this might be an overgeneralization.\n\nComparing all the options, option C seems to be the most accurate. It correctly states that the survival of each bird was influenced by its beak characteristics during the drought, which aligns with the principles of natural selection. It doesn't make the mistake of suggesting that individual birds evolve or that all surviving birds produce offspring with specific traits.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
