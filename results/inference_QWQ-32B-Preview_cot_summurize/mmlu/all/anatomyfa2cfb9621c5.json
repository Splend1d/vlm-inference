                    "text": "A 'blow out' fracture typically refers to a fracture of the orbital floor or, less commonly, the medial wall, in which soft tissue and sometimes bone fragments are forced into the adjacent sinus cavity. This type of injury often occurs due to blunt trauma to the eye or orbit, causing a sudden increase in intraorbital pressure that leads to fracture and herniation of orbital contents.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. The roof - The orbital roof is formed by the frontal bone and is relatively thick and strong. It is less likely to sustain a 'blow out' fracture compared to the floor or medial wall.\n\nB. The floor - The orbital floor is composed of the maxillary bone and is thinner and more fragile than the roof. It is the most common site for 'blow out' fractures because it can't withstand high intraorbital pressure as well as the stronger roofs.\n\nC. The lateral wall - The lateral wall of the orbit is formed by the greater wing of the sphenoid, zygomatic bone, and frontal process of the zygomatic bone. It is thicker and stronger than the floor and is less prone to 'blow out' fractures.\n\nD. The medial wall - The medial wall is formed by the maxillary process of the frontal bone, the lacrimal bone, and the body of the ethmoid bone. It is thin and can be fractured in 'blow out' injuries, leading to herniation of orbital contents into the ethmoid sinuses or the nasal cavity.\n\nWhile both the floor and the medial wall can be involved in 'blow out' fractures, the floor is more commonly affected due to its thinner bone structure and its position relative to the direction of force in typical orbital trauma.\n\nTherefore, the most likely orbital wall to collapse in a 'blow out' fracture is the floor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
