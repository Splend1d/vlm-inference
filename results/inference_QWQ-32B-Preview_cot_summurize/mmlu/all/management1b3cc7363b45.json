The question is: \"What is the term for organizational development through a formally designed organizational structure?\" and then it gives options: A. Organic, B. Mechanistic, C. Formal, D. Structured.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of organizational development.\n\nStarting with option A, \"Organic.\" I think organic organizational development refers to a more flexible and adaptive approach, where the structure emerges naturally based on the needs and interactions within the organization. It's like the opposite of a rigid, predefined structure.\n\nOption B is \"Mechanistic.\" I believe mechanistic organizations are characterized by a rigid hierarchy, clear rules and procedures, and a focus on efficiency and control. This seems like a formally designed structure, but I need to confirm.\n\nOption C is \"Formal.\" This might refer to a structured and official approach to organizing, with defined roles and responsibilities.\n\nOption D is \"Structured.\" This is similar to formal, suggesting that the organization has a clear and organized framework.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the term that describes organizational development through a formally designed organizational structure. So, it's about a predefined, perhaps hierarchical, setup with clear roles and processes.\n\nComparing the options, mechanistic seems to fit this description. It's associated with a formal, hierarchical structure, rigid rules, and a focus on efficiency. Organic, on the other hand, is more about flexibility and adaptability, which isn't aligned with a formally designed structure.\n\nFormal and structured are also relevant, but they are more general terms. Mechanistic seems more specific to a formally designed organizational structure.\n\nLet me double-check the definitions to be sure.\n\nOrganic organizations are indeed more flexible, with less formal structure, and they adapt to changes more easily.\n\nMechanistic organizations are characterized by centralization, rigid departmentalization, high formalization, and a clear chain of command. This aligns well with a formally designed structure.\n\nFormal organizational development could refer to any structured approach, but it's not a specific type like mechanistic or organic.\n\nStructured is similar, just indicating that there is a organized framework, but again, not a specific organizational type.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be B. Mechanistic.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's another term that might fit better.\n\nPerhaps \"bureaucratic\" comes to mind, which is similar to mechanistic, characterized by a hierarchical structure, rules, and formal procedures.\n\nHowever, bureaucratic is not one of the options.\n\nGiven the choices provided, mechanistic is the best fit for organizational development through a formally designed organizational structure.\n\nSo, my answer is B. Mechanistic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
