                    "text": "Let's see what the placenta does. I know that it's really important for the developing baby, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nOption A says the placenta supplies oxygen to the fetus. I think that's right. The mother breathes, and the oxygen from her blood is passed through the placenta to the baby's blood. So, that seems correct.\n\nOption B says it supplies nutrients to the fetus. Yeah, that makes sense too. The mother eats, and the nutrients from her food go into her blood, then through the placenta to the baby. So, that's probably correct.\n\nOption C says it supplies blood to the fetus. Hmm, this one is tricky. I know that the placenta connects the mother's blood vessels to the baby's, but the blood doesn't mix directly. Instead, there's a barrier where nutrients and gases are exchanged. So, maybe it's not accurate to say the placenta supplies blood to the fetus because the baby has its own circulatory system that's separate from the mother's, connected only through the placenta for exchange purposes.\n\nOption D says the placenta secretes hormones. I recall that the placenta produces hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is important in early pregnancy, and others like estrogen and progesterone that help maintain the pregnancy. So, that seems correct.\n\nGiven that, option C might be the exception because the placenta facilitates the exchange of blood components but doesn't supply the baby's blood itself. The baby's blood is circulated within the baby's own system, and the mother's blood is circulated within the mother's system, with exchange happening across the placental barrier.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Supplies blood to the fetus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
