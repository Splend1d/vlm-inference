It's invading their personal space and could be seen as a breach of privacy. Lockers are private spaces, and interfering with someone's private property without their permission is generally considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, gripping the woman's hand because she was falling seems like a reflex to help prevent her from getting hurt. In this situation, it's likely an act of kindness and quick thinking to avoid her getting injured. So, it's not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
