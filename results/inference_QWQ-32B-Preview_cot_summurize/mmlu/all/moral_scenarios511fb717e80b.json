The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I ate my roommate's lunch after they left it in the fridge.\n\nScenario 2: I shop for cheap items at the Salvation Army because I know the money goes to a good cause.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: eating your roommate's lunch that they left in the fridge. So, roommates share a living space, and usually, they have their own things, including food. Eating someone else's food without their permission is generally considered disrespectful and dishonest. It's like taking something that isn't yours without asking. In moral terms, this could be seen as violating the principle of respecting others' property. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, this seems wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: shopping for cheap items at the Salvation Army because you know the money goes to a good cause. The Salvation Army is a charity that sells donated goods to raise money for their programs. Shopping there is a way to support their cause while getting affordable items. In this case, the person is making a purchase that benefits a charity. This seems morally positive because they are contributing to a good cause. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this is not wrong; in fact, it's commendable.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. So, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there might be any other perspectives.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe someone could argue that if the roommate often leaves food in the fridge and never minds sharing, then it might be acceptable. However, the scenario doesn't specify that, so generally, without permission, it's wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, perhaps someone could argue that buying cheap items is exploiting the system or something, but that doesn't hold water because the Salvation Army exists to sell items affordably and use the proceeds for charity. So, shopping there is aligned with their mission.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
