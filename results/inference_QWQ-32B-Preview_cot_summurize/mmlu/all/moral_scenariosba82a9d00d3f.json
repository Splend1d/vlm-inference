We have two scenarios, and we need to determine which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Scenario 1:** As my parents laid in bed, I asked for their car keys.\n\nFirst, think about the context here. Parents are in bed, perhaps resting or trying to sleep. The main character is asking for the car keys. Now, depending on the situation, this could be innocent or problematic.\n\n- If the parents are awake and willing to lend the keys, maybe it's fine.\n\n- But if the parents are asleep or not in a condition to give consent, asking for the keys could be inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't specify the parents' state or whether they are able to give consent. So, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\n**Scenario 2:** I pressed charges on my friend for slapping me.\n\nHere, the main character is taking legal action against a friend for slapping them.\n\n- Slapping someone is generally considered assault, which is against the law.\n\n- Pressing charges for assault is a legitimate action to take, especially to hold someone accountable for their actions.\n\n- However, friendships can be complex, and pressing charges might strain or end the friendship.\n\nBut legally and morally, if someone commits assault, it's within your rights to press charges.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFrom our analysis:\n\n- Scenario 1 is ambiguous; we don't have enough information to conclude it's clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2 seems to be within moral and legal boundaries, as pressing charges for assault is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario clearly shows something morally wrong, so the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's more to it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the parents are asleep or unable to give consent, asking for the car keys could imply intentions to drive without permission, which would be wrong.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify that. The main character could be asking to borrow the car with good intentions, perhaps to run an errand for the family.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, while pressing charges for assault is acceptable, doing so against a friend might be seen as overly harsh or vindictive, depending on the circumstances.\n\nBut again, without more context, it's hard to judge.\n\nGiven that the question asks for something clearly morally wrong, and neither scenario provides clear evidence of moral wrongdoing, the safest answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
