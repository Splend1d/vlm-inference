                    "text": "I think the answer is A. self-efficacy. Let me see why.\n\nSo, self-efficacy is about believing in your own ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task. Tony got accepted to the college he wants to attend, which means he probably worked hard and believed he could get in. He's going to the prom with a girl he really admires, which suggests that he had the confidence to ask her out and that she said yes, maybe because he comes across as confident. Also, he was hired for the summer job he sought, which again shows that he believed he could get the job and put in the effort to achieve that.\n\nSelf-doubt, which is option B, is the opposite of self-efficacy. It's about lacking confidence in one's own abilities. Since Tony seems confident and successful in these areas, self-doubt doesn't fit.\n\nSelf-handicapping, option C, is when someone creates obstacles to their own success so that if they fail, they can blame the obstacles rather than their own abilities. There's no indication that Tony is doing that. He's achieving his goals, which is the opposite of self-handicapping.\n\nIntroversion, option D, is a personality trait related to how someone recharges their energy, either through being alone or with others. It doesn't directly relate to confidence or belief in one's abilities, so it doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nTherefore, I think A. self-efficacy is the correct answer because Tony demonstrates confidence and success in pursuing his goals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
