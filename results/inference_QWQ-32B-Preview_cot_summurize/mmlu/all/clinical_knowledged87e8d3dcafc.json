They play a crucial role in regulating blood pressure by sending signals to the brain when they detect changes in pressure.\n\nLet me think about the other options to make sure. Option B is chemoreceptors. I know that chemoreceptors detect chemical changes in the blood, like oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, but not specifically blood pressure. So, that seems less likely.\n\nOption C is the vasomotor center. I believe that's part of the brain that helps regulate blood vessel diameter and blood pressure, but it's not the detector itself. It's more of a controller based on the inputs it receives.\n\nOption D is the cardiovascular center, which is also in the brain and regulates heart rate and blood pressure. Again, it's more of a control center rather than a direct detector of blood pressure changes.\n\nSo, baroreceptors seem to be the correct answer because they are the sensors that directly detect changes in blood pressure and relay that information to the brain, which then adjusts the cardiovascular system accordingly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
