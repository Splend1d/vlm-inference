                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which drug this 17-year-old boy likely ingested based on his symptoms. Let's see, he was found with a blank stare and flat facial expression at a party. His pulse is 72, which seems normal, and blood pressure is 104/68, also within normal range. He's sitting upright but appears catatonic, and during the exam, he becomes hostile and attempts to assault the physician. Interesting, so from the options given: diazepam, methamphetamine, oxycodone, or PCP.\n\nFirst, let's consider diazepam. That's a benzodiazepine, which is a sedative. Typically, it causes drowsiness, relaxation, and can slow down the central nervous system. So, someone under the influence of diazepam might be sleepy, uncoordinated, and less responsive, but I don't recall it causing catatonia or sudden aggression. Maybe not the best fit here.\n\nNext, methamphetamine. That's a stimulant known for causing increased energy, euphoria, psychosis, and aggression. It can lead to paranoid behavior and violent outbursts. However, the initial presentation of a blank stare and flat expression doesn't seem typical for methamphetamine, which usually causes hyperactivity and talkativeness. But maybe in some cases, it can present differently.\n\nOxycodone is an opioid pain reliever. It causes drowsiness, confusion, slowed breathing, and can lead to overdose if taken in high quantities. Catatonia could be a possibility in an opioid overdose, but the sudden shift to hostility and aggression doesn't sound typical for opioids. Usually, opioids make people drowsy and less responsive, not aggressive.\n\nThen there's PCP, or phencyclidine. I've heard that PCP can cause a range of symptoms, including catatonia, hostility, and violence. It's known for dissociative effects, where people might have a blank stare, be unresponsive, and then suddenly become aggressive. PCP can also cause muscle rigidity, which matches the physical examination finding of rigidity.\n\nLet me think about this. The patient was found with a blank stare and flat facial expression, which could indicate dissociation or altered mental status. Then, during the examination, he becomes hostile and attempts to assault the physician. This sudden shift from a calm, unresponsive state to aggressive behavior sounds consistent with PCP intoxication.\n\nAlso, PCP can cause catatonia, which is characterized by muscle rigidity, immobility, and unresponsiveness, matching the patient's appearance and physical exam findings. Moreover, PCP can lower inhibitions and trigger violent behavior, which aligns with his attempt to assault the physician.\n\nIn comparison, diazepam would typically not cause aggression; methamphetamine might cause aggression but the initial catatonic state seems less likely; and oxycodone would usually cause sedation rather than aggression.\n\nTherefore, based on the symptoms described, PCP seems the most likely substance ingested by this patient.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
