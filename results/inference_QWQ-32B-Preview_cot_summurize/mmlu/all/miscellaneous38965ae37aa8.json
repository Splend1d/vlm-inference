Judicial - that's one of them.\n\nB. Executive - yeah, that's another one.\n\nC. Parliamentary - hmm, I'm not sure about this one. I think the US has a presidential system, not a parliamentary one.\n\nD. Legislative - yes, that's the third branch.\n\nSo, it seems like \"Parliamentary\" isn't one of the three branches. But just to make sure, let me think about it again.\n\nThe three branches are:\n\n1. Judicial - that's the courts, headed by the Supreme Court.\n\n2. Executive - that's the President and the executive departments.\n\n3. Legislative - that's Congress, which is made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nThere's no mention of a parliamentary branch in the US government. In fact, \"parliamentary\" is a term associated with certain types of governments, like in the UK, where the legislature and the executive are linked through the parliament.\n\nSo, in the context of the US government, \"parliamentary\" isn't one of the three branches. It must be option C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if \"parliamentary\" could refer to something else in the US government. Maybe it's a type of committee or something. No, that doesn't seem right. The US has a congressional system, not a parliamentary one.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Parliamentary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
