                    "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that Avalon had a tough experience during spring break. It must be stressful for her right now. Let's try to understand more about genital herpes to see which statement is correct.\n\nFirst off, genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by herpes simplex viruses, typically HSV-1 or HSV-2. It's important to know how it's transmitted and managed.\n\nOption A says that Avalon could not contract genital herpes from performing fellatio on the guy. Is that true? Well, herpes can be transmitted through oral-genital contact, so performing fellatio on someone who has genital herpes could indeed put her at risk of contracting the virus. So, this statement seems false.\n\nOption B claims that if Avalon contracted genital herpes, she can be cured with antibiotics if administered immediately after the first occurrence. Herpes is caused by a virus, not bacteria, so antibiotics aren't effective against it. There are antiviral medications that can manage symptoms and reduce the frequency and severity of outbreaks, but there's no cure for herpes. So, this statement is also false.\n\nOption C says that if Avalon contracted genital herpes, she will only be contagious when she has a breakout. Herpes can be transmitted even when there are no visible symptoms or outbreaks, through a process called asymptomatic shedding. This means people can spread the virus without realizing it. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate.\n\nGiven that all the previous options seem to have inaccuracies, option D, \"none of the above,\" might be the correct choice.\n\nIt's crucial for Avalon to get tested and speak with a healthcare provider about her situation. They can provide accurate information and appropriate treatment options. STIs are common, and with proper management, people can lead healthy lives.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish Avalon the best in handling this situation.\n\n**Note:** This response is for informational purposes and should not be considered medical advice.
