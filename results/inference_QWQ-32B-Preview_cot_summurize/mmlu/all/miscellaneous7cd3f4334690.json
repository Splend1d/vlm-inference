                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which pro wrestler fought with Sylvester Stallone in \"Rocky III.\" The options are Dolph Lundgren, Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, and The Iron Sheik.\n\nFirst, I remember that \"Rocky III\" is a movie about boxing, and Sylvester Stallone plays Rocky Balboa, a boxer. So, it makes sense that he would have a fight scene with another wrestler or boxer in the movie.\n\nLet me think about Dolph Lundgren. I know he's an actor and a bodybuilder, and he's been in a lot of action movies. In \"Rocky III,\" I think he plays a character named Mr. Tidbit, but I'm not sure if he has a wrestling scene with Stallone.\n\nNext, Hulk Hogan. He's a famous wrestler, and he's been in movies too. I think he was in \"Rocky III.\" Wait, wasn't there a scene where Hulk Hogan, as Hulk Hogan, appears in the movie? I think so. But was there a wrestling match between him and Stallone?\n\nThen there's Andre the Giant. He's another famous wrestler who appeared in movies, like \"The Princess Bride.\" I think he was in \"Rocky III\" as well. In fact, I recall that Andre the Giant had a fight with Rocky Balboa in the movie.\n\nWait, maybe it was Andre the Giant who grappled with Stallone in \"Rocky III.\" I seem to remember a scene where Rocky fights Andre the Giant.\n\nAnd then there's The Iron Sheik. He's also a wrestler, known for his villainous character. I think he was in \"Rocky III\" too, but I don't recall a specific wrestling scene between him and Stallone.\n\nLet me try to recall the plot of \"Rocky III.\" In that movie, Rocky Balboa is still a boxer, and he's facing new challenges. I think he has a match against a new opponent who's very large and strong, maybe Andre the Giant.\n\nAlso, I remember that Hulk Hogan makes an appearance in the movie, perhaps as himself, and there might be some interaction between him and Rocky.\n\nBut specifically, who does Stallone grapple with in the movie? Grappling suggests some form of wrestling moves, not just boxing.\n\nI think in \"Rocky III,\" there's a scene where Rocky trains with a wrestler, maybe to prepare for his fight against the wrestler. Could that wrestler be Andre the Giant?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a scene where Rocky faces off against Hulk Hogan in a wrestling match.\n\nWait, maybe it's Hulk Hogan who grapples with Stallone in the movie.\n\nBut let's consider that \"Rocky III\" is primarily a boxing movie, so a wrestling match might not be the main event.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"grapples with,\" which suggests wrestling moves, not just boxing.\n\nPerhaps there's a training scene where Rocky learns some wrestling moves from Hulk Hogan.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a scene where Rocky faces off against Andre the Giant in a wrestling match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Dolph Lundgren has a wrestling match with Stallone in the movie.\n\nWait, I think Dolph Lundgren plays a wrestler in \"Rocky III.\" Isn't his character a wrestler who challenges Rocky?\n\nI think Dolph Lundgren's character, Mr. Tidbit, is a wrestler who has a grudge against Rocky or something like that.\n\nSo, maybe it's Dolph Lundgren who grapples with Stallone in the movie.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused now.\n\nLet me try to recall the sequence of events in \"Rocky III.\"\n\nRocky is the champion, and he's facing a new opponent. I think the main fight in \"Rocky III\" is against Mr. Tidbit, played by Dolph Lundgren.\n\nBut Mr. Tidbit is a wrestler, not a boxer. So, there might be a wrestling match between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Rocky has to learn wrestling to prepare for the fight.\n\nWait, perhaps Rocky has a match against Mr. Tidbit, and they engage in wrestling.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Hulk Hogan has a scene where he grapples with Stallone.\n\nBut I think it's more likely to be Dolph Lundgren, given that his character is a wrestler in the movie.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Andre the Giant has a wrestling match with Stallone.\n\nBut I think Dolph Lundgren is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let's consider the release year. \"Rocky III\" came out in 1982, and Dolph Lundgren was already acting in movies by then.\n\nAlso, Hulk Hogan was popular in the wrestling world around that time, so it makes sense that he would appear in the movie.\n\nBut who exactly grapples with Stallone?\n\nMaybe I should look up the plot of \"Rocky III\" to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a scene where Rocky trains with Hulk Hogan, and they have some wrestling moves together.\n\nBut the question is asking specifically who Stallone grapples with in the movie.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe there is a wrestling scene between Rocky and another character, and that character is played by one of these wrestlers.\n\nGiven that, I think it's most likely Dolph Lundgren, since his character is a wrestler in the movie.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Dolph Lundgren.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
