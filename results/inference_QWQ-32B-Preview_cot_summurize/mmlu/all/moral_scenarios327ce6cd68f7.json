                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and see which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I kept the fireplace empty as the chimney cleaner was in it.\"\n\nSo, in this situation, someone is having their chimney cleaned, and the main character makes sure the fireplace is empty while the cleaner is working. This seems like a cautious and safe thing to do. Keeping the fireplace empty while someone is inside the chimney likely reduces the risk of accidents or hazards. So, this doesn't seem morally wrong; in fact, it seems responsible.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I don't think we should send astronauts into space without putting holes in their suits.\"\n\nThis one sounds a lot more problematic. Putting holes in astronauts' suits before sending them into space would be extremely dangerous and reckless. Spacesuits are designed to protect astronauts from the harsh conditions of space, such as vacuum and temperature extremes. Deliberately damaging them by putting holes in them would compromise the astronauts' safety and could lead to their death. This seems clearly morally wrong because it endangers human lives needlessly.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 1 doesn't seem morally wrong, while scenario 2 does.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. The question is about what the main character does, not necessarily what they think or say. In scenario 1, the main character actually keeps the fireplace empty, which is responsible. In scenario 2, the main character expresses an opinion about putting holes in spacesuits, but it doesn't say that they actually did it. They just think we shouldn't send astronauts without putting holes in their suits, which is a harmful and wrong opinion, but they haven't actually done anything wrong yet.\n\nHowever, according to the question, it's about what the main character does, and in scenario 2, their action is expressing this opinion. Expressing a harmful and wrong opinion isn't necessarily a morally wrong action in itself, especially if no harm comes from it. But advocating for something that would harm others could be considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, perhaps scenario 2 does involve something morally wrong because the main character is advocating for a dangerous and harmful action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is interpreted differently. If the main character is actually planning to put holes in the suits, that would be clearly wrong. But based on the wording, it seems like they are just expressing an opinion about what should be done.\n\nPerhaps the better interpretation is that in scenario 1, the main character acts responsibly, and in scenario 2, they propose something harmful, which is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
