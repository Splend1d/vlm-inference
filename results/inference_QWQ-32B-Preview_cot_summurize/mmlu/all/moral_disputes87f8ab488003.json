The options are rights, freely made commitments, special relations, and all of the above. I need to figure out which one Cohen would consider as possible sources of obligations.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Cohen's perspective is on obligations. I think Cohen is a philosopher who discusses moral obligations and their foundations. From what I remember, he might be associated with discussing different grounds for moral obligations.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A is \"rights.\" I know that rights and obligations are often connected in moral philosophy. If someone has a right, it often corresponds to someone else having an obligation to respect that right. So, rights can be a source of obligations in that sense. Maybe Cohen includes this in his view.\n\nOption B is \"freely made commitments.\" This sounds like promises or agreements that people make voluntarily. If I promise to do something, I create an obligation for myself to follow through. I think Cohen would agree that freely made commitments can generate obligations.\n\nOption C is \"special relations.\" This could refer to relationships like family, friendship, or professional roles, where specific obligations arise because of the nature of the relationship. For example, as a parent, I have obligations towards my children. I believe Cohen would consider special relations as a source of obligations.\n\nOption D is \"all of the above.\" If Cohen accepts that rights, freely made commitments, and special relations can all be sources of obligations, then this would be the correct answer.\n\nTo make sure, I should think about whether there might be any reason to exclude any of these options based on Cohen's views. But since I don't have specific memories of Cohen excluding any of these, and they all seem plausible as sources of obligations in moral philosophy, I'm inclined to go with D, all of the above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Cohen emphasizes one source over the others, but the question is about possible sources, not necessarily the primary or most important ones. So, even if he gives more weight to one, he might still\u8ba4\u53ef all of them as possible sources.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether Cohen might reject any of these options. For example, maybe he doesn't think that rights are a source of obligations, or perhaps he has some critique of relying on special relations to generate obligations. But without specific recall of such positions, I'll assume that he accepts all three as possible sources.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D, all of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
