We need to choose the best behavioral intervention strategy to increase the likelihood that she'll complete her seat work in the long term.\n\nOption A is about letting Mary read from a teacher-selected book for a specific time before starting her seat work. Hmm, maybe this could help settle her down and focus before starting her work, but it doesn't directly address the issue of her leaving her seat to play with blocks.\n\nOption B suggests allowing Mary to play with the blocks after she's finished her seat work if she stays in her seat during the assigned time. This sounds like a reward for staying in her seat and completing her work. It might motivate her to stay put knowing that she can play with the blocks afterward.\n\nOption C is about explaining to Mary the value of completing her seat work in terms of the lesson's objectives. While it's important for her to understand the purpose of her work, simply explaining might not be enough to change her behavior, especially since she's tempted by the blocks.\n\nOption D is about removing the blocks from the classroom during seat-work time. This would eliminate the temptation altogether, but it might not teach her self-control or the importance of completing her work before engaging in play.\n\nComparing these options, Option B seems the most effective because it provides a positive reinforcement for the behavior we want\u2014staying in her seat and completing her work. By allowing her to play with the blocks afterward, we're giving her an incentive to behave appropriately during work time. This approach aligns with principles of behavior modification, where desired behaviors are reinforced with rewards.\n\nOption A might help with settling into work, but it doesn't directly address the issue of leaving her seat. Option C is about understanding, which is good, but may not be sufficient to change behavior. Option D removes the temptation, which could work, but it doesn't teach her to resist the temptation when it's present.\n\nTherefore, I think Option B is the best choice for increasing the long-term likelihood that Mary will complete her seat work.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
