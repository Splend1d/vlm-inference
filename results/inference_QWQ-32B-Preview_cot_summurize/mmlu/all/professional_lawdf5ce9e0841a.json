                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got Loretta Landlord who owns a commercial building in a commercial strip surrounded by a residential community. One of her spaces was being used by a dance troop on a month-to-month basis for $500 per month. The dance troop folded because their director moved to New York, and they couldn't find another one, so they vacated the space.\n\nThen, Sally Sleazy comes along and rents the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month. The key point here is that Sally didn't disclose her intended use of the space, which was to open a topless strip joint. One month after Sally's strip joint opens, the county commissioners pass a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood. Sally tells Loretta that the new law makes it impossible to operate the business, so she's leaving. Now, Loretta sues Sally for breach of the lease contract, and we need to figure out the likely outcome.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Sally, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible.\n\nB. Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.\n\nC. Loretta, only if she did not know of the use Sally intended for the space.\n\nD. Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of impossibility of performance in contract law. Impossibility of performance is a doctrine that excuses a party from performing their contractual obligations when performance becomes objectively impossible due to an event that occurs after the contract is formed, and that was not due to the party's own actions.\n\nIn this case, Sally is arguing that the new law making topless strip joints illegal in that neighborhood makes it impossible for her to operate her business, hence she can't perform her obligations under the lease.\n\nBut wait, was the performance impossible? Well, she could still use the space for other purposes, right? The law only prohibits topless strip joints, but maybe she could run a different kind of business there. So, is it really impossible to perform the lease, or just that her specific use is prohibited?\n\nAlso, I need to consider whether Loretta knew or should have known about Sally's intended use. The problem says that Sally rented the space without disclosing her intended use. So, Loretta might not have been aware that Sally planned to open a topless strip joint.\n\nNow, thinking about the options:\n\nOption A says Sally wins because the law made performance impossible. But, as I thought earlier, maybe it's not impossible; just that Sally can't use it for her intended purpose.\n\nOption B says Loretta wins because the law was passed after the lease was executed. Hmm, that might be relevant because the law came after the contract was signed. In contract law, sometimes changes in law after the contract is signed don't excuse performance.\n\nOption C says Loretta wins only if she didn't know about Sally's intended use. So, if Loretta was unaware of the intended use, then Loretta can sue for breach, but if she knew, maybe not.\n\nOption D is similar to Option A, saying Sally wins because of impossibility of performance.\n\nI need to think about this carefully. First, was Sally's use illegal at the time she signed the lease? No, because the law prohibiting topless strip joints was passed after she opened her business.\n\nIn contract law, if performance becomes illegal after the contract is formed, the party is generally excused from performance. This is different from something being illegal at the time of contract formation.\n\nSo, in this case, since the law was passed after the lease was executed, Sally's performance became illegal, which might excuse her from further performance under the lease.\n\nBut, I also need to consider if Loretta knew or had reason to know about Sally's intended use. If Loretta knew or should have known that Sally planned to operate a topless strip joint, then maybe she can't claim ignorance and Sally can't use the change in law as an excuse.\n\nWait, but the problem says Sally rented the space without disclosing her intended use. So, Loretta might not have known about the specific use.\n\nIn that case, perhaps Loretta can't rely on Sally's intended use being illegal now because she didn't know about it beforehand.\n\nBut, generally, in lease agreements, the landlord has the right to know how the property is being used, especially if it's for a specific type of business that might affect the neighborhood or the value of the property.\n\nMoreover, zoning laws and land use regulations can affect the permitted uses of property. If the new law prohibits topless strip joints in that area, and Sally's use was illegal after the law passed, then perhaps she is excused from further performance under the lease.\n\nBut, at the same time, if the lease doesn't specify the use, and Loretta was unaware, maybe Loretta can still sue for breach.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, was there a meeting of the minds regarding the use of the property? It seems not, since Sally didn't disclose her intended use.\n\nSecond, did Sally breach the lease by vacating the premises before the two-year term was up? Yes, she did, unless there's a valid excuse.\n\nThird, is the new law a valid excuse for Sally to terminate the lease?\n\nIn contract law, a change in law that makes performance illegal typically excuses performance. This is known as \"subsequent illegality.\"\n\nSo, if performance became illegal due to a new law passed after the contract was signed, the party whose performance would be illegal is excused from further performance.\n\nIn this case, the new law prohibits topless strip joints in that neighborhood, which is Sally's intended use. Therefore, Sally might be excused from further performance under the lease.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if Loretta knew or should have known about Sally's intended use. If Loretta was aware or should have been aware that Sally planned to operate a topless strip joint, then perhaps she can't claim that Sally should continue to perform under the lease.\n\nBut according to the problem, Sally rented the space without disclosing her intended use. So, Loretta might not have known about it.\n\nIn that case, perhaps Sally can argue that since her intended use is now illegal, she can't perform her obligations under the lease, and therefore, the lease should be terminated.\n\nOn the other hand, Loretta might argue that Sally could use the space for other legitimate purposes, and therefore, performance is not impossible.\n\nBut, in contract law, the standard for impossibility is whether performance is objectively impossible, not just difficult or less profitable.\n\nIn this case, Sally can still use the space for other types of businesses that are allowed in that neighborhood. So, perhaps it's not objectively impossible for her to perform under the lease; it's just that her specific use is prohibited.\n\nTherefore, maybe Sally can't rely on impossibility of performance as an excuse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Sally can argue that the new law has destroyed the fundamental purpose of the lease, which was to operate a topless strip joint. This might be an argument based on frustration of purpose, another doctrine in contract law.\n\nFrustration of purpose occurs when an event occurs after the contract is formed that destroys the fundamental purpose of the contract without fault of either party, and the non-occurrence of that event was a basic assumption on which the contract was made.\n\nIn this case, if Sally leased the space specifically to operate a topless strip joint, and the new law prohibits that use, then her fundamental purpose for entering into the lease has been destroyed.\n\nTherefore, she might be able to argue that the lease should be discharged based on frustration of purpose.\n\nHowever, for frustration of purpose to apply, the destruction of the purpose must be due to an event that was not anticipated by the parties and was beyond their control.\n\nIn this case, the new law was passed after the lease was signed, so it might qualify.\n\nBut, again, if Loretta knew or should have known about Sally's intended use, then perhaps she can't claim frustration of purpose.\n\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions may require that the frustrating event be unforeseeable. If the possibility of such a law being passed was foreseeable, then perhaps frustration of purpose doesn't apply.\n\nIn this problem, there's no indication that such a law was foreseeable, so perhaps it is an unforeseeable event.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that Sally might have a valid defense based on frustration of purpose or impossibility of performance, depending on how the court interprets the circumstances.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Sally, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible.\n\nD. Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.\n\nThese both seem similar and relate to the impossibility doctrine.\n\nHowever, as I thought earlier, performance might not be impossible since Sally could use the space for other purposes.\n\nOption B: Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.\n\nThis suggests that since the law came after the lease, it doesn't affect the enforceability of the lease.\n\nBut, in contract law, a change in law that makes performance illegal can excuse performance, even if the law was passed after the contract was executed.\n\nOption C: Loretta, only if she did not know of the use Sally intended for the space.\n\nThis seems a bit ambiguous. If Loretta didn't know about Sally's intended use, perhaps she can't claim that Sally should continue to perform under the lease, especially if the new law makes that use illegal.\n\nBut, if Loretta knew or should have known about the intended use, then maybe she can't argue ignorance.\n\nHowever, in this case, Sally didn't disclose her intended use, so Loretta might not have known about it.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most likely outcome is that Sally can rely on the new law to excuse her performance under the lease, either based on impossibility of performance or frustration of purpose.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A or D.\n\nBut since A and D are similar, perhaps A is the better choice.\n\nSo, my answer is A. Sally, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
