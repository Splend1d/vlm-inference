                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which statement is correct about a shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"Is absolute.\" Hmm, that sounds too broad. In most corporate laws, shareholders do have rights to inspect certain records, but there are usually conditions attached to that right. So, I doubt it's absolute.\n\nOption B mentions, \"Is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder owning at least $5000 worth of stock.\" Now, I recall that in some jurisdictions, there are ownership requirements for shareholders to request inspections. But $5,000 seems like a specific number, and I'm not sure if that's universally applicable or if it varies by state or country. Maybe this is correct, but I need to verify.\n\nOption C says, \"Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.\" This rings a bell. I think in many legal systems, shareholders can demand to inspect records, but they need to have a legitimate reason related to their interest as a shareholder. So, the purpose has to be proper. This sounds plausible.\n\nOption D states, \"Exists only when fraud or illegality is alleged.\" That seems too narrow. While alleging fraud or illegality might be a proper purpose, I don't think it's the only reason shareholders can inspect records. There are probably other legitimate reasons, like evaluating the company's financial health or preparing for a shareholders' meeting.\n\nLet me try to recall some general principles. In the United States, for example, under Delaware law, which is influential in corporate law, shareholders have the right to inspect certain books and records, but they must have a proper purpose related to their interest as a shareholder. So, option C seems consistent with that.\n\nAlso, there are often ownership requirements. For instance, a shareholder might need to own a certain percentage of shares or have held them for a specific period. But option B specifies $5,000, which seems like a particular amount that might not be universal.\n\nMaybe I should look up the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA) or the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), as many states base their corporate laws on these models.\n\nAccording to the RMBCA, shareholders have the right to inspect certain records, but they must make a demand in good faith and for a proper purpose. The RMBCA also sets some ownership requirements, like owning at least 5% of the outstanding shares or a minimum number of shares.\n\nSo, if I refer to the RMBCA, option C seems correct because it emphasizes the need for a proper purpose. However, option B specifies a $5,000 stock ownership, which might not align with the RMBCA's percentage requirements.\n\nMoreover, option D is too restrictive because the right to inspect isn't limited to cases of alleged fraud or illegality.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors. Perhaps some states have different thresholds or requirements. For example, in California, the Corporate Securities Law might have different provisions.\n\nTo get more precise, I should look up the specific jurisdiction's corporate law. But since the question doesn't specify a jurisdiction, I'll assume it's referring to general principles in the United States, possibly based on the RMBCA.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is the most accurate: the demand to inspect requires a proper purpose.\n\nWait a minute, option A says the right is absolute. But based on my research, there are always conditions attached to the right to inspect. So, absolute doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B's $5,000 threshold isn't something I recall from the RMBCA, which focuses more on percentages of ownership rather than specific dollar amounts.\n\nOption D is too narrow, as the right to inspect isn't limited to cases of fraud or illegality.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should check a specific statute or a court case.\n\nFor instance, in Delaware, which is a major corporate law jurisdiction, the General Corporation Law (DGCL) Section 220 outlines the rights of shareholders to inspect records. It requires that the demand be made for a proper purpose related to the shareholder's interest.\n\nSo, in Delaware, at least, option C is correct.\n\nAdditionally, the shareholder must hold the stock for a certain period and own a certain number of shares, but again, it's about the number of shares or percentage ownership, not necessarily a dollar amount like $5,000.\n\nTherefore, option B might not be accurate in all jurisdictions.\n\nIn conclusion, based on general corporate law principles and specific statutes like the DGCL, the correct statement is that the right to inspect corporate books and records requires that the demand be for a proper purpose.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
