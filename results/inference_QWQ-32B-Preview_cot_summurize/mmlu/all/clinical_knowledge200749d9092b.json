                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on CPR procedures, but I remember that the rate of chest compressions is pretty important. Let me think this through.\n\nOption A says 80 per minute. That seems a bit slow, doesn't it? I feel like medical guidelines have changed over the years, and 80 might be too slow to maintain adequate blood flow.\n\nOption B says as fast as possible. But that can't be right because compressions need to be effective and allow time for the chest to recoil between compressions. If you go too fast, you might not let the heart fill properly, which could decrease the effectiveness of circulation.\n\nOption C says 100 per minute. That sounds familiar. I think I've heard that number before. Maybe it's the standard rate recommended for adult CPR.\n\nOption D says it varies with each patient. Hmm, that could be possible because different patients might have different needs based on their age, size, or specific medical conditions. But in general, is there a standard rate that applies to most adults?\n\nLet me recall the latest CPR guidelines. I think the American Heart Association has updated their recommendations. In the past, it was 80 to 100 compressions per minute, but I believe they've adjusted that.\n\nWait, I think the current recommendation is to perform compressions at a rate of at least 100 to 120 per minute for adults. So, 100 per minute is at the lower end of that range.\n\nBut looking at the options, 100 per minute is listed in option C. Option A is 80, which is below that range, and option B is too vague and probably not practical.\n\nOption D suggests that the rate varies with each patient, but in standard CPR protocol, there's a general guideline for adults.\n\nI think the best answer here is C, 100 per minute. It's a widely accepted rate for adult CPR, and it's within the recommended range.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider special cases. For instance, are there situations where the compression rate might change for certain patients?\n\nI know that for infants and children, the compression rate is the same as for adults, at least 100 to 120 per minute. So, age doesn't change the rate in that regard.\n\nWhat about medical conditions? I can't think of any specific conditions where the compression rate would be different, as long as you're performing CPR, the rate remains consistent.\n\nPerhaps option D is trying to trick me into thinking that the rate varies, but in reality, for standard adult CPR, the rate is consistent.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C, 100 per minute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
