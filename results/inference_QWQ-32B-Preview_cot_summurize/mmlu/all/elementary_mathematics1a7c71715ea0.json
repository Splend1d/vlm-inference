I need to check each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The product of 5 x 2 is even because both of the factors are even.\"\n\nFirst, let's calculate 5 x 2. That's 10. Now, 10 is even, that's correct. But, wait, is 5 even? No, 5 is odd. So, the statement says \"both factors are even,\" but that's not true because 5 is odd. So, this statement is false.\n\nOption B says: \"The product of 4 x 4 is odd because both of the factors are even.\"\n\nLet's calculate 4 x 4, which is 16. Is 16 odd? No, 16 is even. So, the statement says it's odd, but it's actually even. Plus, it says \"because both factors are even,\" which is true, but the conclusion is wrong because the product is even, not odd. So, this statement is false.\n\nOption C says: \"The product of 2 x 7 is even because both of the factors are odd.\"\n\nFirst, 2 x 7 is 14, which is even. That's correct. But, are both factors odd? 2 is even, and 7 is odd. So, the statement says \"both factors are odd,\" but that's not true because 2 is even. So, this statement is false.\n\nOption D says: \"The product of 5 x 3 is odd because both of the factors are odd.\"\n\nLet's calculate 5 x 3, which is 15. Is 15 odd? Yes, it is. And both factors, 5 and 3, are odd. So, the statement is correct in its calculation and reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
