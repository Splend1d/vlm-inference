This is because, without a governing authority, there are no laws or constraints to limit an individual's actions. Each person must rely on their own strength and wits to survive, and thus has the right to do whatever is necessary for self-preservation, including taking resources from others if needed.\n\nHowever, this leads to conflict and instability, as everyone is pursuing their own interests without any overarching rules or protections. To escape this condition, Hobbes argues that individuals must enter into a social contract, agreeing to surrender some of their rights to a sovereign authority in exchange for peace and security.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. everything."
