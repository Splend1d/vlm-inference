The options are:\n\nA. to which we need to give a precise answer.\n\nB. to which we need give no precise answer.\n\nC. that cannot be answered, vaguely or precisely.\n\nD. that is ethically unimportant.\n\nI need to pick one of these that best represents Singer's perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Singer says about killing animals painlessly. I remember that Peter Singer is a utilitarian philosopher who focuses on animal rights and the ethics of our treatment of animals.\n\nIn his book \"Animal Liberation,\" Singer argues that the capacity to suffer is what gives an entity the right to equal consideration. So, if an animal can suffer, we have moral obligations towards it.\n\nNow, regarding killing animals painlessly, Singer might say that since the animal isn't suffering during the killing process, that aspect is not a direct moral issue. However, he would still consider the loss of the animal's life as a moral concern because the animal has an interest in continuing to live.\n\nSinger believes that the interest an individual has in continuing to live should be considered, regardless of whether the individual is human or non-human. So, even if an animal is killed painlessly, taking its life is still a moral issue because it deprives the animal of its future experiences and potential for a life worth living.\n\nGiven that, I think option A, \"to which we need to give a precise answer,\" might be the best choice. Singer is someone who tries to provide clear ethical guidelines based on his utilitarian principles. He would likely argue that we need to have a precise understanding of when it's wrong to kill an animal painlessly, based on considerations of the animal's interests and the consequences of our actions.\n\nOption B, \"to which we need give no precise answer,\" seems contrary to Singer's approach, as he is known for providing detailed ethical analyses.\n\nOption C, \"that cannot be answered, vaguely or precisely,\" doesn't align with Singer's views because he generally believes that ethical questions can be addressed through rational analysis.\n\nOption D, \"that is ethically unimportant,\" is also not consistent with Singer's stance, as he considers the treatment of animals, including their lives, to be of significant ethical importance.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. Singer would argue that we need to give a precise answer to the question of when it's wrong to painlessly kill an animal, based on ethical principles and the consideration of the animal's interests.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
