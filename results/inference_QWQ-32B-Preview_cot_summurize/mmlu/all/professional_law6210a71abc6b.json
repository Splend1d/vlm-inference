The next week, Ann was planning to go on vacation and asked Bea if she could borrow her golf clubs. Bea agreed and loaned her golf clubs to Ann, who promised to return them after her vacation. When Ann returned home, she kept the golf clubs and continued to use them. A few weeks later, Bea was having dinner with Carla and learned that Carla owed Ann $4,000. Carla had just been laid off from her job and did not have the money to repay Ann. Bea told Carla that she would contact Ann and make arrangements to repay the loan on her behalf. Thereupon, Ann and Bea entered into a written agreement wherein Bea promised to pay Ann, at a rate of $400 a month, the matured $4,000 debt that Carla owed Ann. In the same written instrument, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still had in her possession. Ann, however, made no written or oral. commitment to forbear to sue Carla to collect the $4,000 debt; and Bea made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. After this agreement between Ann and Bea was signed and executed, Ann promptly returned the golf clubs to Bea. For the next six months, Bea made and Ann accepted the $400 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, Ann, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against Carla. However, Bea then repudiated her agreement with Ann, and 30 days later Ann filed a contract action against Bea. Assume that the applicable statute of limitations on Ann's antecedent claim against Carla expired the day before Ann filed her contract action against Bea. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement?\n\nA. Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise.\nB. Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it.\nC. Since Carla, when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 debt to Ann, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.\nD. Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario and see what's going on here. So, Ann, Bea, and Carla are friends, and there's a series of events involving golf clubs and money that lead to a legal question about contracts and consideration.\n\nFirst, Ann's golf clubs were stolen, so she borrows Bea's clubs. Ann is supposed to return them after her vacation, but she doesn't and keeps using them. Then, Bea finds out that Carla owes Ann $4,000 and offers to help by paying Ann the debt in installments of $400 a month. In return, Ann promises to give back Bea's golf clubs. They write this agreement down, and Ann returns the clubs right away. Bea makes payments for six months, but then she stops and says she doesn't have to pay anymore. Ann sues Bea for breaking the agreement, and meanwhile, the time limit for Ann to sue Carla for the debt has run out.\n\nNow, the question is, which argument is the most persuasive for why Bea shouldn't have to pay Ann according to their agreement?\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says that since Ann didn't explicitly promise not to sue Carla, her six months of not suing doesn't count as consideration for Bea's promise. Consideration is something of value that each party gives to the other in a contract. Here, Ann's promise to return the golf clubs is clear, and Bea's promise to pay $400 a month is also clear. The fact that Ann didn't write down that she wouldn't sue Carla might not necessarily mean that her forbearance isn't consideration. In contract law, forbearance to sue can be valid consideration if it's a real detriment to the party forbearing. So, even without an express promise, Ann's act of not suing Carla for six months could be considered valuable consideration. Therefore, this argument might not be the strongest.\n\nOption B talks about a gross imbalance in the values of the promises exchanged, meaning that the consideration is legally insufficient. This is about the adequacy of consideration. In contract law, the courts generally don't interfere with the adequacy of consideration as long as there is some consideration. So, even if Bea is paying more or less than the golf clubs are worth, that might not invalidate the contract. Therefore, this argument might not be very persuasive.\n\nOption C brings up the point that Carla had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 to Ann, so there's no new consideration for Bea's promise. This touches on the doctrine that you can't get consideration by someone doing what they're already supposed to do. However, in this case, Bea is offering to pay Ann the $4,000 that Carla owes, which is a new promise. Bea is stepping in to pay someone else's debt, which is called a \"de novocompromise.\" This can be valid consideration if Bea gets some benefit or avoids some duty. Here, Bea gets the golf clubs back, which is a benefit. So, this argument might not hold water because Bea is getting something in return.\n\nOption D says that Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs, so there's no consideration for Bea's promise. This is similar to option C but from the other side. Ann was already supposed to return the clubs, so some might argue that her promise to do something she was already obligated to do isn't additional consideration. However, in contract law, a promise to do something you're already supposed to do can still be consideration if it's part of a new contract. Additionally, Ann returned the clubs immediately after the agreement was signed, which suggests that the exchange was simultaneous.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Maybe the key is that Ann's promise to return the clubs was already her legal duty, so it shouldn't count as new consideration for Bea's promise to pay $4,000. In some jurisdictions, a promise to perform a pre-existing duty isn't sufficient consideration unless there's some additional benefit or detriment. This is known as the \"pre-existing duty rule.\"\n\nGiven that, perhaps option D is the most persuasive argument that Bea isn't liable to Ann under their agreement. Because Ann was already supposed to return the clubs, her promise to do so might not be sufficient consideration for Bea's new promise to pay $4,000.\n\nWait, but Ann did return the clubs right after signing the agreement. So, perhaps the act of returning the clubs was performed as part of the agreement, and since it was performed promptly, it might be considered adequate consideration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that the statute of limitations on Ann's claim against Carla has expired affects the situation. Since Ann can no longer sue Carla for the debt, Bea's promise to pay might be seen as a new obligation without adequate consideration from Ann.\n\nBut the question is about Bea's liability to Ann under their agreement, not about Ann's rights against Carla.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Perhaps the most persuasive argument is that Ann didn't provide any new consideration beyond what she was already obligated to do. She returned the clubs as she should have, and her forbearance to sue Carla might not be enough consideration if it wasn't explicitly promised.\n\nComparing options, A focuses on the forbearance issue, which might be a weaker argument because forbearance can be consideration. Option B talks about inadequate consideration, which courts are generally hands-off about. Option C deals with Carla's pre-existing duty, but Bea is a different party. Option D addresses Ann's pre-existing duty to return the clubs.\n\nUpon further reflection, perhaps option D is the most persuasive. Because Ann was already legally obligated to return Bea's clubs, her promise to do so might not constitute additional consideration for Bea's new promise to pay $4,000. Therefore, without adequate consideration from Ann, Bea's promise might not be enforceable.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that this can vary depending on the jurisdiction and specific contract law principles applied. Some courts might find that the immediate return of the clubs serves as sufficient consideration, while others might not.\n\nIn conclusion, among the given options, D seems to be the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement, based on the pre-existing duty rule in contract law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
