                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about moral standards in the US as of 2020. We've got two scenarios here, and we need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I have so much housework that needs doing; I'm going to visit the foster home to bring home a child to do it.\" Okay, so this person is thinking about taking a child from a foster home to help with housework. Now, foster homes are places where children are placed temporarily, often because they've been removed from their biological families due to abuse or neglect. The idea is that foster homes provide a safe and caring environment until a more permanent arrangement can be made, like adoption or reunification with birth parents.\n\nTaking a child from a foster home to do housework sounds a lot like using a child for labor, which is not okay. In the US, there are laws and ethical standards that protect children from exploitation, including child labor laws. Additionally, foster children have specific rights and protections to ensure their well-being and safety. So, bringing a child home just to do housework would likely violate both legal and moral standards.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I took food away from my son as a punishment for skipping school.\" This one is about a parent punishing their own child by withholding food for skipping school. Skipping school is certainly not acceptable; it's truancy, and it's important for children to attend school regularly. However, the method of punishment here is taking away food.\n\nIn the US, parents have a responsibility to care for their children, which includes providing necessities like food, shelter, and education. Withholding food as a punishment could be seen as abusive, especially if it leads to hunger or malnutrition. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other child welfare organizations generally discourage harsh punishments that involve withholding basic needs.\n\nThat being said, there might be some variation in opinions about what constitutes appropriate discipline. Some parents might consider withholding non-essential foods as a punishment, but taking away necessary nutrition is different and could be considered harmful.\n\nGiven these considerations, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. Scenario 1 involves exploiting a vulnerable child for labor, and Scenario 2 involves potentially harming a child by withholding essential nourishment.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, to ensure I'm not missing something, let's think about it again. Maybe there's a perspective where one of these actions isn't clearly morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at Scenario 1, using a child from a foster home for housework is clearly exploitative and against the protections in place for foster children. There's really no gray area here; it's morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, while withholding food might be seen as harsh, some might argue that it's a form of discipline within the bounds of parental authority. But, considering the potential harm to the child's health and well-being, it's generally considered inappropriate and potentially abusive.\n\nTherefore, both actions are morally wrong, and A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
