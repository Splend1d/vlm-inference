                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 1-year-old boy who got burned when he turned on the hot water in the bathtub. His mom says she was answering the phone in the bedroom when it happened. The burns are on his hands and feet, and they're described as blistered and fresh, with a stocking and glove distribution. So, besides taking care of the burns, managing pain, doing a history and physical, and some baseline lab tests, the next best thing to do is one of these options: give him a 5% albumin infusion, administer IV steroids, contact child protective services, or just send him home with his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The child has burns on his hands and feet, specifically in a stocking and glove pattern. That means the burns are on the extremities, like covering the hands and feet like you'd wear gloves and socks. The fact that it's a fresh burn from hot water suggests it's a thermal burn.\n\nNow, in terms of managing burns, especially in a young child, there are several important steps. Debridement is removing dead tissue, which is important for preventing infection and promoting healing. Pain management is crucial because burns can be very painful. A thorough history and physical examination help determine the extent and depth of the burns, and baseline laboratory studies can check for things like electrolyte imbalances or signs of infection.\n\nOption A is to administer a 5% albumin infusion. Albumin is a protein in the blood that helps maintain blood pressure and transport substances. In some cases of burn injuries, especially large burns, albumin might be used to help manage fluid balance. However, in this case, the burns are on the hands and feet, which might not be a large percentage of the child's total body surface area. So, maybe not the top priority right now.\n\nOption B is to administer intravenous steroids. Steroids can have various uses, but in burns, they might be used to reduce inflammation. However, steroids aren't routinely given for burns, and in fact, their use in burns is controversial and generally not recommended unless there's a specific indication, like severe inhalation injury. So, this doesn't seem like the most appropriate next step.\n\nOption C is to contact child protective services. This is an important consideration in cases where there's a possibility of abuse or neglect. In this scenario, the mom says that the child accidentally burned himself while she was answering the phone in the bedroom. So, it was an accident, and she seems to have a plausible explanation. However, given the age of the child and the fact that he was able to turn on the hot water by himself, it might raise some questions about supervision and safety measures in the home.\n\nOption D is to discharge the patient home with his parents. This could be an option if the burns are minor and properly managed, and there are no concerns about supervision or safety at home.\n\nGiven that, I need to decide which of these is the most appropriate next step. Let's consider the severity of the burns first. The burns are described as blistered and fresh, which suggests partial-thickness burns. The location is on the hands and feet, which are areas with thick skin, and burns to these areas can be painful and require careful management.\n\nBut more importantly, considering the child's age and the circumstances of the burn, there might be concerns about the safety and supervision in the home. A 1-year-old being able to turn on the hot water in the bathtub unsupervised could indicate that there are\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u5728\u5bb6\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u6ca1\u6709\u5b89\u88c5\u9632\u70eb\u4f24\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u6216\u8005\u6ca1\u6709\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u3002\n\nTherefore, while medical management of the burns is crucial, ensuring the child's safety going forward is also paramount. Contacting child protective services might be warranted to assess the home environment and ensure that such an incident doesn't happen again.\n\nSo, I think the most appropriate next step is option C: contact child protective services.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
