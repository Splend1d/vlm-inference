                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, there's a man who put an ad in the local newspaper for a public auction without reserve. The auction is for all the furnishings in his home, and it's on December 7 at 10:00 a.m. at his address, 110 Walnut St., City, State. The items include antiques, a piano, a pool table, appliances, tables, a stereo system, and more.\n\nOn the day of the auction, about 20 people showed up. The first item up for bid was an antique Baldwin grand piano. The man announced that the bidding would be \"without reserve\" and asked for the opening bid. A woman bid $100. Then, the man commented that the piano was worth at least $5,000 and asked if there were any other bids. Since no one else bid, he told the woman he wouldn't accept $100 and removed the piano from the sale.\n\nNow, the woman is considering suing the man for breach of contract. We need to figure out which option is most likely correct.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"without reserve\" means in an auction context. Typically, \"without reserve\" means that the item must be sold to the highest bidder, and the seller cannot set a minimum bid or withdraw the item once bidding has started.\n\nOption A says the woman will prevail because goods put up at an auction \"without reserve\" may not be withdrawn. This seems plausible because if it's a without reserve auction, the seller shouldn't be able to pull the item once bidding has commenced.\n\nOption B says she will prevail because, whether or not the auction is \"without reserve,\" goods cannot be withdrawn after the auctioneer calls for bids. This is similar to option A but doesn't rely solely on the \"without reserve\" aspect.\n\nOption C says she won't prevail because, at an auction \"without reserve,\" the auctioneer may withdraw goods until he announces completion of the sale. This suggests that even in a without reserve auction, the auctioneer has some leeway to withdraw items before the sale is complete.\n\nOption D says she won't prevail because at an auction \"without reserve,\" the auctioneer invites offers, which he may accept or reject. This seems contradictory because in a without reserve auction, the seller is supposed to accept the highest bid, regardless of the amount.\n\nLet's think about this step by step.\n\nIn a without reserve auction, the seller is bound to sell the item to the highest bidder, regardless of the bid amount. The whole point of \"without reserve\" is that there's no minimum bid, and the seller can't withdraw the item once bidding starts.\n\nIn this case, the man announced that the auction was without reserve and called for bids on the piano. A woman bid $100, and no one else bid higher. Then, the man decided not to accept the $100 bid and removed the piano from the sale.\n\nThis seems like a clear breach of the without reserve condition because he's withdrawing the item after bidding has occurred.\n\nHowever, option C suggests that the auctioneer can withdraw goods until he announces completion of the sale. So, maybe the sale wasn't complete yet, and therefore, he could withdraw the item.\n\nBut in a without reserve auction, once bidding starts, the seller is generally obligated to sell to the highest bidder, as long as there are bids.\n\nOption D says that in a without reserve auction, the auctioneer invites offers, which he may accept or reject. But again, in a without reserve auction, the auctioneer shouldn't have the option to reject the highest bid; he must accept it.\n\nSo, between these options, it seems like options A and B are more aligned with the concept of a without reserve auction, where the seller can't withdraw the item once bidding has started.\n\nOption C suggests that the auctioneer can withdraw goods until completion of the sale, but in a without reserve auction, completion might be considered when the highest bid is accepted.\n\nOption D is incorrect because in a without reserve auction, the auctioneer must accept the highest bid, even if it's lower than expected.\n\nGiven this, I think the woman has a case for breach of contract because the seller withdrew the item after bidding had started in a without reserve auction.\n\nTherefore, the most likely correct answer is A: prevail, because goods put up at an auction \"without reserve\" may not be withdrawn.\n\nBut let's consider option B: prevail, because whether or not the auction is \"without reserve,\" goods cannot be withdrawn after the auctioneer calls for bids.\n\nThis is a bit different because it doesn't depend on the \"without reserve\" clause. In general auction practice, once bidding starts, the auctioneer can't withdraw the item, but this might vary based on whether it's with or without reserve.\n\nGiven that the auction was specified as without reserve, option A seems more directly applicable.\n\nOption C suggests that in a without reserve auction, the auctioneer can withdraw goods until completion of the sale. But in practice, in a without reserve auction, once bidding starts, the auctioneer is obligated to sell to the highest bidder.\n\nOption D is incorrect because in a without reserve auction, the auctioneer doesn't have the option to reject the highest bid.\n\nTherefore, the woman is likely to prevail because in a without reserve auction, the seller cannot withdraw the item once bidding has started.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
