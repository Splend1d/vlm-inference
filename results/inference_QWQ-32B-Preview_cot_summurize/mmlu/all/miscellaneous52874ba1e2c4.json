The options are:\n\nA. $120 million annual revenue\n\nB. $1.2 billion annual revenue\n\nC. $12 billion annual revenue\n\nD. $120 billion annual revenue\n\nHmm, this seems like a multiple-choice question from an economics or business class. I need to pick the most plausible option based on what I know about the television industry in Australia around that time.\n\nFirst, I should consider the popularity of flat-screen televisions in 2013. Flat-screen TVs, which include LCD and plasma models, had largely replaced older technologies like CRT by that point. So, the market should have been quite mature.\n\nAustralia has a population of around 23 million people in 2013. Assuming that many households would have at least one flat-screen TV, possibly more, the total number of units sold in a year could be significant.\n\nBut revenue is about the total sales value, not just the number of units. So, I need to think about the average price of a flat-screen TV in 2013.\n\nFrom what I recall, in the early 2010s, flat-screen TVs ranged from a few hundred dollars for smaller models to several thousand dollars for larger or higher-end models.\n\nLet's make an assumption that the average price per TV is around $1,000. That's probably a bit high, but it gives me a starting point.\n\nNow, if we assume that each household buys one TV per year, and there are about 10 million households in Australia, that would be $10 billion in revenue.\n\nBut that seems too high because households don't replace all their TVs every year. Maybe a more realistic assumption is that a certain percentage of households replace their TVs each year.\n\nLet's say 10% of households replace their TV each year. That would be 1 million TVs at $1,000 each, totaling $1 billion.\n\nBut that still seems low. Maybe the average price is higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total revenue is higher because people buy multiple TVs per household.\n\nI need to find a better way to estimate this.\n\nMaybe I can look at the total number of TVs sold in Australia in 2013 and then estimate the revenue based on average prices.\n\nAccording to some industry reports, global TV shipments in 2013 were around 220 million units. Australia's share would be a small fraction of that.\n\nAssuming Australia accounts for about 0.5% of global TV sales, that would be around 1.1 million units.\n\nAt an average price of $1,000, that would be $1.1 billion in revenue.\n\nBut that still doesn't align with any of the options provided.\n\nWait a minute, the options are:\n\nA. $120 million\n\nB. $1.2 billion\n\nC. $12 billion\n\nD. $120 billion\n\nMy estimate of $1.1 billion aligns closely with option B.\n\nBut maybe the average price is lower. If the average price is $500 per TV, then 1.1 million units would be $550 million, which is closer to option A.\n\nHowever, $500 seems a bit low for the average price in 2013.\n\nOn the other hand, if the average price is higher, say $1,500, then $1.65 billion, which is closer to option C.\n\nBut I need to think about whether the average price justifies moving up to $12 billion or $120 billion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the total value of the television market in Australia.\n\nI recall that in Australia, the consumer electronics market is significant, but $12 billion or $120 billion seems excessively high for just flat-screen TVs.\n\nLet's consider that $12 billion would be about 10% of Australia's GDP in 2013, which was around $1.5 trillion. That seems way too high for just TV sales.\n\nSimilarly, $120 billion would be about 10 times the GDP, which is implausibly high.\n\nSo, options C and D are probably not realistic.\n\nOption A, $120 million, seems too low because even if you consider only a small number of high-end TVs, the total revenue should be higher.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination, option B, $1.2 billion, seems the most reasonable.\n\nMoreover, industry reports from that time might confirm this estimate.\n\nFor instance, in 2013, the Australian television market was dominated by brands like Samsung, LG, and Sony, among others.\n\nA quick search online for television sales data in Australia for 2013 might provide more accurate figures, but since I'm recalling from memory, I'll go with $1.2 billion as the most plausible annual revenue for flat-screen TVs sold in Australia in 2013.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
