                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about protons used in cancer therapy. They're accelerated to about 0.6 times the speed of light, which is pretty fast! The question is asking how much work needs to be done on a particle of mass m to reach this speed, starting from rest. The options are in terms of mc^2, which makes me think about relativistic effects because we're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for relativistic kinetic energy because at high speeds, classical kinetic energy (which is 1/2 mv^2) doesn't hold up. The relativistic kinetic energy (K) is given by:\n\nK = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2\n\nWhere \u03b3 (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nHere, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nSo, the work done on the particle to accelerate it from rest to speed v would be equal to its kinetic energy at that speed, right? Because work equals change in kinetic energy, and it starts from rest with zero kinetic energy.\n\nGiven that, I need to calculate K = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2 for v = 0.6c.\n\nFirst, let's find \u03b3.\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)\n\nThe c^2 terms cancel out:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / 0.8\n\n\u03b3 = 1.25\n\nNow, plug \u03b3 back into the kinetic energy formula:\n\nK = (1.25 - 1)mc^2\n\nK = 0.25mc^2\n\nWait, that's option A. But I have a feeling that this might be too straightforward, and maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check the relativistic kinetic energy formula. Is there another way to approach this?\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total energy of the particle at speed v and subtract its rest energy.\n\nThe total energy (E) is:\n\nE = \u03b3mc^2\n\nRest energy (E0) is:\n\nE0 = mc^2\n\nSo, kinetic energy K = E - E0 = \u03b3mc^2 - mc^2 = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2\n\nYes, that matches what I did earlier.\n\nSo, according to this, the work done should be 0.25mc^2.\n\nBut let's see, maybe there's another perspective. Perhaps they expect me to consider the momentum or something else.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the work-energy theorem, which states that work done equals the change in kinetic energy. Since the particle starts from rest, its initial kinetic energy is zero, so the work done is equal to its final kinetic energy, which is relativistic kinetic energy.\n\nSo, again, K = 0.25mc^2.\n\nHmm, but why are there other options like 0.60mc^2, 0.67mc^2, and 1.25mc^2? Maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking about different aspects.\n\nWait, perhaps some people might mistakenly use the classical kinetic energy formula, K = 1/2 mv^2, and plug in v = 0.6c, which would give K = 1/2 m*(0.6c)^2 = 1/2 m*0.36c^2 = 0.18mc^2, but that's not even one of the options. So, it's definitely not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone confuses velocity with something else.\n\nWait, perhaps some might think that since v = 0.6c, and \u03b3 = 1.25, they might multiply \u03b3 and v, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nOr maybe they think that the work is equal to \u03b3mc^2, which is the total energy, but that includes the rest energy, which isn't correct because work equals change in kinetic energy.\n\nWait, if I take \u03b3mc^2 - mc^2 = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2, which is again 0.25mc^2.\n\nSo, I think 0.25mc^2 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose someone misremembers the formula for \u03b3 and squares the velocity incorrectly.\n\nWait, the velocity is 0.6c, so v/c = 0.6.\n\nThen, \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they think that the work is equal to \u03b3mc^2, which is 1.25mc^2, but that includes the rest energy, which isn't correct for the work done to accelerate from rest.\n\nSo, option D is 1.25mc^2, which is \u03b3mc^2, but that's not the kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, it's not correct.\n\nOption C is 0.67mc^2, which is roughly 2/3 mc^2. I don't see where that comes from.\n\nOption B is 0.60mc^2, which might be a mistake by considering K = mv^2, which would be m*(0.6c)^2 = 0.36mc^2, but that's not even one of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps they expect to use the momentum or something related to that.\n\nMomentum p in relativity is p = \u03b3mv.\n\nBut work is force times distance, and force is related to momentum by F = dp/dt.\n\nThis seems more complicated, and probably not the intended approach.\n\nI think sticking with the work-energy theorem and using relativistic kinetic energy is the way to go.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 0.25mc^2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
