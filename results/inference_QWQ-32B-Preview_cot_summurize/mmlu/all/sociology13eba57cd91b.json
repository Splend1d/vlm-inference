                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Which of the following best describes the practice of placing the blame for the problems of a society on one particular group?\" and then there are options: A. Ethnocentrism, B. Stereotyping, C. Scapegoating, D. Institutionalization. Hmm, I need to think about what each of these terms means and see which one fits best.\n\nFirst, ethnocentrism. I think ethnocentrism is when people believe their own culture is superior to others. They judge other cultures based on their own cultural norms. So, it's like looking down on other cultures because they're different. But in this question, it's about placing blame on one particular group for society's problems. So, ethnocentrism might be related, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit here.\n\nNext, stereotyping. Stereotyping is when people generalize characteristics about a group without considering individual differences. For example, thinking all teenagers are irresponsible or all engineers are bad at English. It's making assumptions based on group membership. While this can lead to unfair treatment, it's not specifically about placing blame for society's problems.\n\nThen, scapegoating. Scapegoating sounds familiar. I think it's when a group is blamed for everything that goes wrong in society, even if they're not actually responsible. It's like blaming a particular community for economic downturns, crime spikes, or other social issues, just to divert attention from the real causes. This seems pretty close to what the question is asking.\n\nLastly, institutionalization. I'm not sure exactly what this term means in this context. Institutionalization usually refers to the process of embedding something within an institution, like formalizing a practice or policy. It might not directly relate to placing blame on a particular group.\n\nComparing these options, scapegoating seems to be the most accurate description of placing blame for society's problems on one particular group. Ethnocentrism is about cultural superiority, stereotyping is about generalizing characteristics, and institutionalization is about embedding practices in institutions. None of these perfectly capture the act of blaming a group for societal problems like scapegoating does.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Scapegoating.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
