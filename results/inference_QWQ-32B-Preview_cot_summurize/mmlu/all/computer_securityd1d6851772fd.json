It was originally developed by Gordon Lyon in 1997 and has since become an essential utility for network administrators and security professionals alike. Nmap allows users to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.\n\nOption A is the correct answer. Nmap operates by injecting packets to a range of addresses and inferring what hosts and services might be at those addresses based on the responses it receives. This process is known as network mapping or port scanning. Nmap can determine various characteristics of the network, such as live hosts, open ports, and the services and operating systems running on those hosts.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Nmap is not primarily a network fuzz testing tool. Fuzz testing involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as input to a program to discover vulnerabilities. While Nmap can be used in security testing, its main function is network discovery and mapping, not fuzz testing.\n\nOption C is also incorrect. Nmap does not create a map of the entire Internet. Instead, it is used to scan specific networks or ranges of IP addresses to identify active hosts and their services. Mapping the entire Internet would require a much larger-scale effort and different tools.\n\nOption D is not accurate either. While Nmap does include features for probing and identifying services, it is not a comprehensive suite of tools for scripting attacks that includes constructing, encoding, injecting, and waiting for responses. Nmap is more focused on network discovery and security auditing rather than executing attacks.\n\nIn summary, Nmap is a scanner that works by injecting packets to a range of addresses and inferring information about hosts and services based on the responses received. It is an invaluable tool for network administrators and security professionals to understand and secure their networks.\n\n"
