                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"As my parents went on their date night, I read their Bible.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider what it means for someone to read their parents' Bible without permission. In many families, especially those with religious backgrounds, the Bible is a personal and sometimes private item. However, in the US, there isn't a universal consensus on whether reading a family member's Bible is morally wrong.\n\nSome points to consider:\n\n- **Respect for privacy:** Even if it's a common book, entering into your parents' space or possessions without their knowledge might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy.\n\n- **Intentions:** Why did the child read the Bible? Was it out of curiosity, boredom, or some other reason? The intentions might influence how wrong it is perceived.\n\n- **Cultural and familial norms:** In some families, religious texts are open for anyone to read, while in others, they are more personal.\n\nGiven that date night is a time when parents go out for some alone time, and assuming the child is at home possibly with a babysitter or alone (depending on age), reading the Bible might not be seen as a serious moral transgression. It's more about the context and the family's expectations.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"When my toddler peed on the hotel mattress, I turned that information in before we left.\"\n\nThis scenario involves a parent being honest about their toddler's accident at a hotel.\n\nPoints to consider:\n\n- **Honesty:** Turning in the information about the accident is being honest with the hotel staff. This is generally considered a positive moral action.\n\n- **Responsibility:** By reporting the incident, the parent is taking responsibility for the damage caused by their child.\n\n- **Potential consequences:** Hotels may charge for cleaning or replacing the mattress, but being upfront about the accident can sometimes lead to more understanding or leniency from the hotel.\n\nIn US moral standards, being honest and taking responsibility for one's actions (or in this case, the child's accident) is viewed positively. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong; in fact, it's arguably the right thing to do.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the above points, Scenario 1 might be seen as slightly questionable in terms of morality, depending on the family's expectations regarding privacy and personal belongings. However, it's not universally considered wrong. Scenario 2 is clearly morally right.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**C. Not wrong, Wrong**\n\nWait, that can't be right because Scenario 2 is not wrong; it's actually right. So, let's look at the options again:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong  \nB. Wrong, Not wrong  \nC. Not wrong, Wrong  \nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven my analysis, Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong (in fact, it's right). Therefore, the correct choice should be:\n\n**D. Not wrong, Not wrong**\n\nHowever, since Scenario 2 is not wrong, and Scenario 1 is at most a grey area but not clearly wrong, D seems appropriate.\n\nBut to ensure, let's consider if Scenario 1 is indeed not wrong.\n\n- If the Bible is left in a place where the child can access it, and there are no explicit rules against reading it, then reading it might not be wrong.\n\n- Additionally, in many households, religious texts are encouraged to be read by children.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is likely not wrong.\n\nScenario 2 is definitely not wrong; it's the right thing to do.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
