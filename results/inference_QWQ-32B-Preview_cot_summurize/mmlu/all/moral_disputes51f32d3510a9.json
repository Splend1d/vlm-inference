                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Ashford's argument regarding aid agencies and extreme poverty. The question is: \"Ashford argues that worries about causing dependency on aid agencies among those in extreme poverty does not mean that we should...\" and then it lists options A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Ashford is saying. It seems like there's a concern that providing aid to extremely poor people might make them dependent on aid agencies. And Ashford is arguing that even if that's a worry, it doesn't mean we should do certain things listed in the options.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. abandon the world's poor to their unjust predicament.\n\nThis suggests that even if there's a risk of dependency, we shouldn't just give up on helping the poor and let them stay in their unfair situation.\n\nB. legally abolish aid agencies.\n\nThis option proposes that worrying about dependency doesn't mean we should eliminate aid agencies through legal means.\n\nC. adopt a social contract approach to the problem of global economic justice.\n\nThis is a bit more complex. A social contract approach typically involves agreements within a society about how to structure relationships and distribute resources. Applying this to global economic justice might mean establishing international agreements or principles to address poverty.\n\nD. accept the view that we have no negative duties to the poor.\n\nNegative duties usually refer to duties to refrain from harming others. So, this option is saying that even if there's a dependency issue, we shouldn't conclude that we have no obligation to not harm the poor.\n\nGiven that Ashford is arguing that worries about dependency don't mean we should do certain things, I need to think about which of these options logically follows from the concern about dependency.\n\nOption A suggests that we shouldn't abandon the poor just because there's a dependency issue. That seems plausible\u2014maybe Ashford is saying that the risk of dependency isn't a good enough reason to stop helping altogether.\n\nOption B proposes not to legally abolish aid agencies. While dependency might be a concern, maybe Ashford thinks that aid agencies still serve an important purpose and shouldn't be abolished.\n\nOption C suggests adopting a social contract approach to global economic justice. This seems like a broader solution to address the root causes of poverty, possibly as an alternative to direct aid that could lead to dependency.\n\nOption D is about not accepting that we have no negative duties to the poor. In other words, even if there's a dependency issue, we still have obligations not to harm the poor.\n\nConsidering the context, it seems like Ashford is arguing against the idea that dependency should lead us to abandon the poor or abolish aid agencies. However, the question is asking for what Ashford argues we should not do because of the dependency worry.\n\nWait, actually, the phrasing is a bit tricky. It says \"worries about causing dependency on aid agencies among those in extreme poverty does not mean that we should...\" So, it's saying that just because we're worried about dependency, that doesn't mean we should do certain things.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. abandon the world's poor to their unjust predicament.\n\nThis makes sense\u2014just because there's a dependency issue, that doesn't mean we should give up on helping them.\n\nB. legally abolish aid agencies.\n\nAgain, dependency might be a problem, but that doesn't necessarily mean aid agencies should be abolished.\n\nC. adopt a social contract approach to global economic justice.\n\nThis seems different. It's suggesting a particular approach to address global economic justice, which might be a way to avoid dependency. So, maybe Ashford is arguing that dependency concerns don't mean we should adopt this approach.\n\nD. accept the view that we have no negative duties to the poor.\n\nThis seems like Ashford is saying that even if there's a dependency issue, we still have obligations not to harm the poor.\n\nI think the key here is to identify which option Ashford is arguing against as a consequence of dependency worries.\n\nOption C stands out because it's proposing a specific approach to global economic justice, whereas the other options are about either continuing or stopping certain actions.\n\nMaybe Ashford is saying that worrying about dependency doesn't mean we should adopt a social contract approach. In other words, dependency concerns aren't a reason to implement a social contract solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Ashford is arguing that dependency shouldn't lead us to abandon the poor or abolish aid agencies.\n\nGiven that, option C seems less directly related to the dependency issue compared to options A and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way to approach this is to consider which of these options is something that someone might argue for because of dependency concerns, and then Ashford is countering that argument.\n\nFor example, someone might say, \"Because of dependency, we should abandon the poor.\" Ashford is saying no, that's not the right conclusion.\n\nSimilarly, someone might say, \"Because of dependency, we should abolish aid agencies.\" Again, Ashford is likely to disagree.\n\nOption C is different because it's suggesting a particular approach to global economic justice, which might be seen as a way to address the root causes and reduce dependency.\n\nOption D is about not accepting that we have no negative duties to the poor, meaning that even with dependency concerns, we still have obligations not to harm them.\n\nConsidering all this, perhaps Ashford is arguing that dependency concerns don't justify abandoning the poor or abolishing aid agencies, and maybe also that they don't justify accepting that we have no negative duties to the poor.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking for what Ashford argues we should not do because of dependency worries.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that Ashford is arguing that dependency concerns do not justify certain actions, and we need to identify which action among the options Ashford is saying should not be adopted just because of dependency worries.\n\nGiven that, option C seems like the one that Ashford is arguing against, meaning that dependency concerns don't mean we should adopt a social contract approach.\n\nBut that doesn't feel entirely right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Ashford is saying that dependency concerns don't mean we should abandon the poor or abolish aid agencies, and perhaps also that they don't mean we should accept that we have no negative duties to the poor.\n\nBut the question is probably looking for one specific option.\n\nLooking back at the question: \"Ashford argues that worries about causing dependency on aid agencies among those in extreme poverty does not mean that we should...\"\n\nGiven that, it seems like Ashford is countering an argument that says because of dependency, we should do X. And Ashford is saying no, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAmong the options, option C stands out as a specific approach to global economic justice, which might be seen as a response to dependency concerns.\n\nSo, perhaps Ashford is arguing that just because we're worried about dependency, that doesn't mean we should adopt a social contract approach to global economic justice.\n\nIn other words, there might be better or more effective ways to address dependency and poverty beyond just adopting a social contract approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Ashford is saying that dependency concerns shouldn't lead us to abandon the poor or abolish aid agencies.\n\nBut the question seems to be phrased such that it's asking which of these options Ashford is arguing against as a consequence of dependency worries.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is C: adopt a social contract approach to the problem of global economic justice.\n\nSo, Ashford is arguing that just because there are dependency worries, that doesn't mean we should adopt a social contract approach to global economic justice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
