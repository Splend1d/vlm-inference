The larger the difference in electronegativity, the more polar the bond.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. S\u2013O\n\nSulfur (S) has an electronegativity of approximately 2.58, and oxygen (O) has an electronegativity of approximately 3.44. The difference is 3.44 - 2.58 = 0.86.\n\nB. P\u2013F\n\nPhosphorus (P) has an electronegativity of approximately 2.19, and fluorine (F) has an electronegativity of approximately 3.98. The difference is 3.98 - 2.19 = 1.79.\n\nC. C\u2013B\n\nCarbon (C) has an electronegativity of approximately 2.55, and boron (B) has an electronegativity of approximately 2.04. The difference is 2.55 - 2.04 = 0.51.\n\nD. C\u2013N\n\nCarbon (C) has an electronegativity of approximately 2.55, and nitrogen (N) has an electronegativity of approximately 3.04. The difference is 3.04 - 2.55 = 0.49.\n\nComparing the differences:\n\n- S\u2013O: 0.86\n\n- P\u2013F: 1.79\n\n- C\u2013B: 0.51\n\n- C\u2013N: 0.49\n\nThe largest difference is in P\u2013F with 1.79, which indicates the most polar bond among the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
