                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I remember that Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman who wrote a lot about ethics and politics. The question is asking about the most practical branch of philosophy according to him, and the options are logic, natural science, moral duties, and expedience.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in a philosophical context.\n\nLogic is the study of correct reasoning and argumentation. It's about how to think clearly and draw valid conclusions from premises.\n\nNatural science, in ancient times, would have encompassed the study of nature and the physical world, perhaps similar to what we now call physics or natural philosophy.\n\nMoral duties relate to ethics, which is about right and wrong conduct, virtues, and how one should live their life.\n\nExpedience seems to refer to what is practical or advantageous in a given situation, perhaps focusing on effectiveness or utility.\n\nNow, considering Cicero's works, he was known for his writings on ethics and politics, particularly in works like \"De Officiis\" (On Duties). In this work, he discusses moral duties and how to live a virtuous life. So, it's possible that he considered moral duties to be the most practical branch of philosophy.\n\nBut, I should also consider his views on other branches. For instance, in \"De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (On the Ends of Good and Evil), he explores different philosophical schools' views on happiness and ethics. Again, this points towards ethics being a central concern for him.\n\nLogic was important in ancient philosophy as it helped in constructing sound arguments and avoiding fallacies. However, while useful, it might not have been considered the most practical branch in terms of day-to-day living and decision-making.\n\nNatural science, although interesting, might have been seen as more theoretical or less directly applicable to everyday life compared to ethics.\n\nExpedience sounds appealing because it deals with what is practical or useful in a particular situation. However, Cicero was known for emphasizing virtue and moral principles over mere pragmatism or convenience.\n\nIn \"De Officiis,\" Cicero argues that moral duties should guide our actions, even if they don't always lead to the most expedient outcomes. So, he might have prioritized moral duties over expedience.\n\nMoreover, in Roman culture, virtue and duty were highly valued, especially in the context of public life and politics. Cicero, being an orator and statesman, would have seen moral duties as central to his role and to the functioning of society.\n\nTherefore, I think the most practical branch of philosophy according to Cicero would be moral duties.\n\nBut, to make sure, I should check some quotes or summaries from his works.\n\nIn \"De Officiis,\" Cicero writes: \"The chief thing in life is to set before one's mind a standard of conduct and to adhere to it unswervingly.\" This emphasizes the importance of moral duties and consistency in one's actions.\n\nHe also says, \"Virtue consists in a persistent intention of mind to accomplish those things which reason, with a view to the common interest, declares to be best.\" Again, this highlights the practical application of moral principles in daily life.\n\nIn contrast, while he acknowledges the importance of logic and natural science, his focus in many of his works is on ethics and politics.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is C. moral duties.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
