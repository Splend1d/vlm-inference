Let's see, the options are:\n\nA. 60 to 80 beats per minute (bpm).\n\nB. 60 to 100 bpm.\n\nC. 60 to 90 bpm.\n\nD. 60 to 110 bpm.\n\nI think the normal range is somewhere between 60 and 100 bpm, but I'm not entirely sure. I remember that athletes sometimes have lower heart rates because their hearts are stronger, but for the average person, it should be within a certain range.\n\nLet me think about this. I've heard that a resting heart rate below 60 might indicate bradycardia, which can be a sign of some heart conditions, and above a certain number might indicate tachycardia, which is also not normal.\n\nI think option B, 60 to 100 bpm, sounds right, but I'm not completely confident. Maybe I should look this up or recall where I might have seen this information before.\n\nWait a minute, I think in high school health class, we learned that the normal resting heart rate for adults is between 60 and 100 bpm. That was a while ago, though. Maybe the standards have changed.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that some fitness trackers and smartwatches display heart rate, and they usually consider 60 to 100 bpm as the normal range for resting heart rate.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm a bit unsure because I've also heard that the average heart rate can vary based on age and physical condition. For example, older adults might have slightly higher resting heart rates.\n\nMaybe I should consider that a normal resting heart rate can be a bit lower or higher depending on the individual's fitness level and overall health.\n\nOption D, 60 to 110 bpm, seems too broad. I don't think the normal range extends up to 110 bpm for resting heart rate.\n\nOption C, 60 to 90 bpm, is narrower, but I'm not sure if it's accurate.\n\nOption A, 60 to 80 bpm, seems too restrictive because some people might have higher heart rates that are still considered normal.\n\nI think the best answer is B, 60 to 100 bpm, but I'd like to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the normal range is broader than I think, especially considering individual variations.\n\nWait, I think the American Heart Association or the World Health Organization might have guidelines on this. If only I could recall their recommendations.\n\nGiven that I don't have access to external resources right now, I'll have to go with my best judgment.\n\nI think the answer is B. 60 to 100 bpm.\n\nBut I'll make a mental note to look this up later to confirm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
