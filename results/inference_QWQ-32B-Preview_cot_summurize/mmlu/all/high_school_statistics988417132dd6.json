                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability question. We have two events, E and F, with nonzero probabilities p and q, respectively. We need to determine which of the given options is impossible.\n\nOption A: p + q > 1\n\nWell, probabilities can add up to more than 1 if the events are not mutually exclusive. For example, if E and F overlap, their individual probabilities can sum to more than 1. So, this seems possible.\n\nOption B: p - q < 0\n\nThis just means that q is greater than p. Since probabilities are just numbers between 0 and 1, it's certainly possible for one to be larger than the other. So, this is possible.\n\nOption C: p / q > 1\n\nThis means that p is greater than q. Again, since probabilities are just numbers between 0 and 1, it's possible for one to be larger than the other. So, this is also possible.\n\nOption D: E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive.\n\nHmm, this one seems tricky. Let's think about what it means for two events to be independent and mutually exclusive.\n\nIndependent events are those where the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, this means P(E \u2229 F) = P(E) * P(F).\n\nMutually exclusive events, on the other hand, are those that cannot occur at the same time. So, P(E \u2229 F) = 0.\n\nNow, if E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive, then we have:\n\nP(E \u2229 F) = P(E) * P(F) (because they are independent)\n\nAnd\n\nP(E \u2229 F) = 0 (because they are mutually exclusive)\n\nTherefore, P(E) * P(F) = 0.\n\nBut we are given that both p and q are nonzero probabilities, meaning p > 0 and q > 0.\n\nSo, p * q = 0, but since both p and q are greater than 0, their product is also greater than 0. This contradicts the earlier equation p * q = 0.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible for two events with nonzero probabilities to be both independent and mutually exclusive.\n\nSo, the answer is Option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
