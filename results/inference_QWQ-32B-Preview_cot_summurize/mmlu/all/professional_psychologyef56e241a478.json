                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about a meta-analysis by Baltes and colleagues from 1999 on the effects of implementing flexitime in organizations. The options are absenteeism, self-rated performance, satisfaction with work schedule, and productivity. I need to figure out which of these is likely to benefit the most from flexitime based on their research.\n\nFirst, I should understand what flexitime is. Flexitime is a work arrangement that allows employees to vary their arrival and departure times within certain limits, as opposed to the traditional fixed schedule. The idea is to give employees more control over their work schedules, which can lead to better work-life balance.\n\nNow, let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: absenteeism. Absenteeism refers to instances where employees do not report to work when they are expected to. If flexitime allows employees to better manage their personal and work responsibilities, they might be less likely to miss work due to personal commitments. So, flexitime could potentially reduce absenteeism.\n\nOption B: self-rated performance. This is where employees evaluate their own performance at work. If flexitime helps employees manage their time better and reduces stress from juggling work and personal life, they might feel more satisfied and perform better, which could be reflected in their self-ratings.\n\nOption C: satisfaction with work schedule. This seems directly related to flexitime, as the whole point of flexitime is to allow employees to have more control over their work schedules. So, it's likely that employees would be more satisfied with their work schedules if they have flexitime.\n\nOption D: productivity. Productivity refers to the amount of work completed in a given time frame. Flexitime might affect productivity in various ways. On one hand, employees might be more productive if they can work during their most productive hours. On the other hand, flexitime could lead to coordination issues or difficulties in collaboration if team members are not all working at the same time.\n\nNow, considering that this is a meta-analysis by Baltes and colleagues from 1999, which combines data from multiple studies to find overall effects, it's likely that they looked at various outcomes of flexitime implementation across different organizations.\n\nI need to think about which of these outcomes would be most strongly affected by flexitime. While all of these could be influenced, I have to choose the one that is likely to have the greatest beneficial effect.\n\nLet me consider the direct relationship between flexitime and each option.\n\n- For absenteeism, flexitime might reduce it by allowing employees to arrange their schedules to avoid missing work.\n\n- For self-rated performance, flexitime could improve it by reducing stress and allowing employees to work during their peak hours.\n\n- For satisfaction with work schedule, it's pretty straightforward that flexitime should significantly increase satisfaction since it gives employees more control over when they work.\n\n- For productivity, the effect might be more nuanced and could vary depending on the specific implementation and the nature of the work.\n\nComparing these, satisfaction with work schedule seems to have the most direct and likely strongest connection to flexitime, as the primary feature of flexitime is the flexibility in work schedules.\n\nAdditionally, other options like absenteeism, self-rated performance, and productivity might be indirectly affected through improved schedule satisfaction.\n\nTherefore, I would guess that instituting flexitime is likely to have the greatest beneficial effects on satisfaction with work schedule.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any reason to think otherwise.\n\nIs there any scenario where flexitime might not improve satisfaction with work schedule? Perhaps if the implementation is poorly managed, or if there are constraints that limit the actual flexibility employees experience.\n\nHowever, assuming that flexitime is implemented effectively, it should lead to higher satisfaction with work schedules.\n\nComparatively, while absenteeism, self-rated performance, and productivity might improve, their improvements might be more dependent on other factors as well.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, I think the answer is C. satisfaction with work schedule.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
