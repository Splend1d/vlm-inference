                    "text": "So I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure out what the marginal propensity to save is, given some information about disposable income and consumption spending. Let me see if I can make sense of this.\n\nFirst, I know that disposable income is the amount of money people have left after paying taxes, and consumption spending is how much they spend on goods and services. In this case, disposable income is $10,000 and consumption spending is $8,000. That means that people are spending $8,000 out of their $10,000 income.\n\nNow, the problem says that for every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. Hmm, so if income goes up by $100, savings go up by $10. That seems like a direct relationship.\n\nI need to find the marginal propensity to save (MPS). Marginal propensity to save is the change in savings divided by the change in disposable income. So, MPS = \u0394Savings / \u0394Disposable Income.\n\nFrom the problem, \u0394Savings is $10 and \u0394Disposable Income is $100. So, MPS = 10 / 100 = 0.10.\n\nWait, but there's also marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which is the change in consumption spending divided by the change in disposable income. MPC = \u0394Consumption / \u0394Disposable Income.\n\nBut the problem gives me the relationship between changes in disposable income and savings, not consumption. However, I know that in economics, MPC + MPS = 1, because any change in income either goes to consumption or savings.\n\nGiven that, if MPS is 0.10, then MPC should be 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.\n\nBut let's double-check that with the initial numbers. Disposable income is $10,000 and consumption is $8,000. So, savings would be disposable income minus consumption, which is $10,000 - $8,000 = $2,000.\n\nNow, if disposable income increases by $100, savings increase by $10. So, the new disposable income is $10,100, and new savings are $2,010. Therefore, new consumption would be $10,100 - $2,010 = $8,090.\n\nSo, the change in consumption is $8,090 - $8,000 = $90, and the change in disposable income is $100.\n\nTherefore, MPC = $90 / $100 = 0.90, and MPS = $10 / $100 = 0.10.\n\nThat matches what I thought earlier.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. the marginal propensity to consume is .80.\n\nBut according to my calculation, MPC is 0.90, not 0.80.\n\nB. the marginal propensity to save is .20.\n\nBut I calculated MPS as 0.10.\n\nC. the marginal propensity to save is .10.\n\nThat matches my calculation.\n\nD. the marginal propensity to save is .90.\n\nThat would be MPC, not MPS.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. the marginal propensity to save is .10.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the initial levels of savings and consumption to see if there's a different way to calculate MPS.\n\nInitial disposable income: $10,000\n\nInitial consumption: $8,000\n\nInitial savings: $2,000\n\nThen, with a $100 increase in disposable income, savings increase by $10, to $2,010, and consumption increases by $90, to $8,090.\n\nSo, the changes are:\n\n\u0394Disposable Income = $100\n\n\u0394Consumption = $90\n\n\u0394Savings = $10\n\nTherefore, MPC = \u0394C / \u0394DI = 90 / 100 = 0.90\n\nMPS = \u0394S / \u0394DI = 10 / 100 = 0.10\n\nAnd again, MPC + MPS = 0.90 + 0.10 = 1, which makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes there's autonomous consumption, but the problem doesn't specify any intercepts or autonomous values, so I think this approach is fine.\n\nI think I'm confident with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
