                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\nEvery two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nWhich of the following factors, not mentioned in the second passage, would have been most likely to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?\n\nA. The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan\nB. The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers\nC. The general warming of the climate during this time period\nD. The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites\n"

                    "text": "Let's see. I have these two passages to compare. The first one is about mining in South America, specifically in places like Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, and it talks about how Indians are working in mines, some by obligation and some voluntarily, and their earnings. The second passage is about native people in Siberia who have to pay tribute in the form of furs or cash, and how their situation is getting worse because there are fewer animals to hunt and they've lost their horses.\n\nThe question is asking about factors that would create added difficulties for the native Siberians in fulfilling their tribute obligations, and it's specifying that the factor shouldn't be mentioned in the second passage. So, I need to look at the options and see which one isn't already discussed in the second passage but would likely make things harder for the Siberians.\n\nOption A is about the arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan. The passage doesn't mention any external hunters coming in, so this could be a possible answer. If hunters from China and Japan arrived, they would compete with the local natives for the same furbearing animals, making it harder for the natives to find enough animals to meet their tribute requirements.\n\nOption B is about the impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers. The passage doesn't mention diseases, but it's a common issue when different groups come into contact, especially if one group has immunity to diseases that the other doesn't. So, epidemic diseases could indeed make life harder for the natives, reducing their population and weakening those who survive.\n\nOption C is about the general warming of the climate during that time period. The passage mentions that the natives are hunting furbearing animals, which are typically adapted to cold climates. If the climate warms, it could affect the habitats and populations of these animals, making them scarcer and harder to find. So, this could also be a factor adding difficulty to fulfilling tribute obligations.\n\nOption D is about the reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites. At first glance, this might seem like it would help the natives because they wouldn't need to hunt as many animals. However, if the demand for furs decreases, it might lead to changes in the tribute system, perhaps making it more onerous or changing the requirements in ways that could be detrimental to the natives. But this seems less directly harmful compared to the other options.\n\nNow, I need to choose the option that is most likely to create added difficulties but isn't mentioned in the second passage.\n\nOption A: The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan isn't mentioned, and it would certainly increase competition for the same resources.\n\nOption B: Epidemic diseases aren't mentioned, and they could decimate the native population, making it harder for them to hunt and fulfill their tribute.\n\nOption C: Climate change isn't mentioned, and it could affect the animals they need to hunt.\n\nOption D: Reduced demand for furs isn't mentioned, but its impact on the natives isn't as directly harmful as the other options.\n\nConsidering this, options A, B, and C all seem like they would create significant added difficulties for the natives. Option D might have some indirect effects, but it's not as directly harmful.\n\nBetween A, B, and C, I need to pick the most likely one. Epidemic diseases could have a catastrophic impact on the population, reducing the number of hunters available. Climate change could alter the ecosystem, making it harder to find the animals they need. Rival hunters from China and Japan would increase competition for the same resources.\n\nAll of these are serious issues, but perhaps epidemic diseases would have the most widespread and devastating impact, affecting not just the ability to hunt but also the general health and survival of the community.\n\nHowever, the question specifies that the factor shouldn't be mentioned in the second passage. The passage doesn't mention diseases, climate change, or rival hunters, so all of these are eligible.\n\nPerhaps I should consider which one is most directly related to fulfilling tribute obligations. If diseases reduce the population, that would decrease the number of hunters available to fulfill the tribute. Climate change could make hunting more difficult or reduce the number of animals available. Rival hunters would compete for the same animals, also reducing the natives' ability to collect the required furs.\n\nIt's tough to choose, but maybe the arrival of rival hunters would be the most immediate and direct challenge to their ability to fulfill tribute, as they are directly competing for the same resources.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is A. The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
