                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says that education makes Chris a better worker, voter, parent, and citizen, and that the benefits go beyond what Chris enjoys himself. So, education provides something that affects others positively beyond the individual\u53d7\u76ca\u8005. That sounds like externalities to me.\n\nExternalities are when the actions of one person or entity affect another person or entity, and these effects are not reflected in the market price. In this case, the positive externalities of education might include things like a more informed electorate, better parenting leading to better future generations, and a more productive workforce, which can benefit society as a whole.\n\nNow, the question is, what should be done about these externalities? Should education be subsidized or taxed?\n\nWell, when there are positive externalities, it's often the case that the market underprovides the good or service because individuals don't account for the full social benefit when making their decisions. So, to encourage more education, it might make sense for the government to subsidize it, making it cheaper for individuals to get educated, and thereby increasing the overall level of education in society.\n\nOn the other hand, if there were negative externalities, then maybe education should be taxed to discourage some people from getting too much education, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. increasing marginal utility and should be subsidized\n\nB. externalities and should be taxed\n\nC. decreasing marginal utility and should be taxed\n\nD. externalities and should be subsidized\n\nOption A mentions increasing marginal utility, but I don't think that's directly related to the externalities caused by education. Marginal utility is about the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of a good, but here we're talking about the external effects on others.\n\nOption B says externalities and should be taxed. But if the externalities are positive, taxing education would discourage people from getting educated, which would be counterproductive.\n\nOption C says decreasing marginal utility and should be taxed. Again, marginal utility is about the individual's satisfaction, not about external effects on others.\n\nOption D says externalities and should be subsidized, which aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Subsidizing education can encourage more people to get educated, capturing those positive externalities for society.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about this a bit more. Is it possible that education has both positive and negative externalities? For example, highly educated individuals might earn higher incomes, which could lead to increased economic inequality, but that seems like a stretch in this context.\n\nGiven that the question emphasizes the positive aspects of education\u2014better worker, voter, parent, citizen\u2014it's safe to assume that the externalities are positive.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate government intervention would be to subsidize education to encourage more people to get educated, thereby increasing the overall positive externalities.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D: externalities and should be subsidized.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are less suitable.\n\nOption A: Increasing marginal utility and should be subsidized. While it's possible that education provides increasing marginal utility, meaning that each additional unit of education provides more satisfaction than the previous one, this isn't directly related to externalities. Subsidizing based on marginal utility would be more about ensuring that people can afford to consume more of a good that they derive greater satisfaction from, but it doesn't address the external benefits to society.\n\nOption B: Externalities and should be taxed. This would make sense if the externalities were negative, but in this case, they're positive. Taxing positive externalities would discourage education, which is contrary to what we want.\n\nOption C: Decreasing marginal utility and should be taxed. Decreasing marginal utility means that each additional unit of education provides less satisfaction than the previous one, which is a common assumption in economics. Taxing education because of decreasing marginal utility doesn't make much sense, as taxes are typically used to deal with external costs, not with changes in individual satisfaction.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate.\n\nJust to double-check, let's think about real-world examples. Many governments do subsidize education, especially at the primary and secondary levels, and even offer grants and loans for higher education. This is because they recognize the positive externalities that education brings to society, such as a more skilled workforce, lower unemployment, higher economic growth, and a more informed and engaged citizenry.\n\nIn conclusion, education provides externalities and should be subsidized.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
