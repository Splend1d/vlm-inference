                    "text": "So I have this question about norms and inner products. It asks for which value of p is the norm ||x||_p expressible as an inner product? The options are A. 1, B. 2, C. p >= 1, and D. infinity.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a norm is and what it means for a norm to be expressible as an inner product. A norm on a vector space is a function that assigns a strictly positive length or size to each vector in the space. An inner product is a generalization of the dot product in Euclidean space, which allows us to define angles and lengths.\n\nI think there's a specific relationship between norms and inner products. I believe that for a norm to come from an inner product, it must satisfy the parallelogram law. The parallelogram law states that for any two vectors x and y, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals of the parallelogram formed by x and y is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of x and y themselves. Mathematically, that's ||x + y||^2 + ||x - y||^2 = 2(||x||^2 + ||y||^2).\n\nSo, if a norm satisfies the parallelogram law, then it can be associated with an inner product via the polarization identity. The polarization identity allows us to recover the inner product from the norm.\n\nNow, the p-norm is defined as ||x||_p = (sum |x_i|^p)^{1/p} for finite p, and for p = infinity, it's the maximum absolute value of the components.\n\nI need to check for which p the p-norm satisfies the parallelogram law.\n\nLet me start with p = 2. The 2-norm is the Euclidean norm, and I know that it comes from the standard inner product, the dot product. So, for p = 2, the norm is expressible as an inner product.\n\nWhat about p = 1? Let's check the parallelogram law for p = 1.\n\nTake x = (1, 0) and y = (0, 1). Then ||x||_1 = 1, ||y||_1 = 1, ||x + y||_1 = ||(1,1)||_1 = 2, and ||x - y||_1 = ||(1,-1)||_1 = 2.\n\nSo, ||x + y||_1^2 + ||x - y||_1^2 = 4 + 4 = 8, and 2(||x||_1^2 + ||y||_1^2) = 2(1 + 1) = 4. They are not equal, so the parallelogram law fails for p = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for p = infinity, let's take x = (1, 0) and y = (0, 1). Then ||x||_\u221e = 1, ||y||_\u221e = 1, ||x + y||_\u221e = ||(1,1)||_\u221e = 1, and ||x - y||_\u221e = ||(1,-1)||_\u221e = 1.\n\nSo, ||x + y||_\u221e^2 + ||x - y||_\u221e^2 = 1 + 1 = 2, and 2(||x||_\u221e^2 + ||y||_\u221e^2) = 2(1 + 1) = 4. Again, not equal, so the parallelogram law fails for p = infinity.\n\nNow, what about general p >= 1, p \u2260 2? I think that only p = 2 satisfies the parallelogram law among all p-norms.\n\nI recall that in finite-dimensional spaces, the only norm that arises from an inner product is the one induced by the Euclidean norm, which is p = 2.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be B. 2.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any p other than 2 for which the p-norm satisfies the parallelogram law?\n\nI don't think so. In fact, it's a well-known result in functional analysis that in finite-dimensional spaces, the Euclidean norm is the only norm that satisfies the parallelogram law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
