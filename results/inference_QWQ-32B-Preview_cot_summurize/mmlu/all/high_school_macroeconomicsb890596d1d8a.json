                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question on disposable income, consumption, and saving. Let's see what it's asking. So, when disposable income increases by $X, we have to choose what happens next from these options:\n\nA. consumption increases by more than $X.\n\nB. saving increases by less than $X.\n\nC. saving increases by exactly $X.\n\nD. saving remains constant.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between disposable income, consumption, and saving. I remember that disposable income is what people have left after paying taxes, and it's what they can spend or save. So, disposable income (Yd) is equal to consumption (C) plus saving (S). That is:\n\nYd = C + S\n\nNow, if disposable income increases by $X, how do consumption and saving change? I think about the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and the marginal propensity to save (MPS). MPC is the fraction of additional income that is spent on consumption, and MPS is the fraction that is saved. And we know that MPC + MPS = 1.\n\nSo, if disposable income increases by $X, consumption increases by MPC * $X, and saving increases by MPS * $X.\n\nGiven that MPC is usually less than 1, consumption increases by less than $X. Similarly, since MPS is also less than 1, saving increases by less than $X.\n\nWait, but let's look at the options again.\n\nOption A says consumption increases by more than $X. But according to what I just thought, consumption increases by less than $X because MPC is less than 1. So, A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says saving increases by less than $X. That aligns with what I just said, since MPS is less than 1, saving increases by less than $X.\n\nOption C says saving increases by exactly $X. But that would only be true if MPS = 1, which means people save all additional income, which isn't usually the case.\n\nOption D says saving remains constant. But if disposable income increases, and assuming MPS is positive, saving should increase by some amount.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems correct: saving increases by less than $X.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there's a scenario where saving increases by exactly $X or remains constant.\n\nLet's consider if MPC is zero. If MPC = 0, then MPS = 1, meaning all additional income is saved. So, if MPC = 0, then consumption doesn't increase at all, and saving increases by exactly $X. But the question doesn't specify MPC is zero; it's a general case.\n\nIn most cases, MPC is between 0 and 1, so saving increases by less than $X.\n\nAlternatively, if MPC = 1, then MPS = 0, meaning all additional income is consumed, and saving doesn't change. But again, that's a specific case.\n\nGiven that the question is general, with no specific value for MPC or MPS, I think B is the correct answer: saving increases by less than $X.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the budget constraint. If disposable income increases by $X, the person can choose to consume more, save more, or a combination of both. But based on the marginal propensities, it's likely that both consumption and saving increase, but by less than $X each.\n\nWait, but the sum of the increases in consumption and saving should equal the increase in disposable income, right? Because Yd = C + S.\n\nSo, if Yd increases by $X, then C + S must increase by $X. Therefore, the increase in consumption plus the increase in saving equals $X.\n\nGiven that, neither consumption nor saving can increase by more than $X, because their combined increase is $X.\n\nSo, option A is definitely wrong because consumption can't increase by more than $X.\n\nOption C would only be correct if saving increases by exactly $X, which would require that consumption doesn't increase at all, meaning MPC = 0.\n\nOption D says saving remains constant, which would require that MPS = 0, meaning all additional income is consumed.\n\nSo, again, option B seems the most plausible, assuming typical values for MPC and MPS where both are positive and less than 1.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose disposable income increases by $X. People will divide this additional income between consumption and saving based on their marginal propensities.\n\nSo, \u0394C = MPC * \u0394Yd = MPC * X\n\n\u0394S = MPS * \u0394Yd = MPS * X\n\nAnd since MPC + MPS = 1, then \u0394C + \u0394S = X.\n\nTherefore, saving increases by MPS * X, which is less than X unless MPS = 1.\n\nSo, yes, saving increases by less than $X, assuming MPS < 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: saving increases by less than $X.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
