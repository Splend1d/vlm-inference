This seems like a malicious act, as they're intentionally making her dessert less enjoyable or even unpleasant by adding salt instead of sugar. According to ordinary moral standards, it's wrong to deliberately sabotage someone's enjoyment, especially when it's something as personal as their favorite dessert. So, in this case, the action appears to be morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character sells their baby brother's old toys to Germans. Selling used toys is generally acceptable, and there's nothing inherently wrong with selling items to people from a specific country. However, the way this is phrased might be intended to evoke some kind of bias or negativity towards Germans, which would be unethical. But assuming that's not the case and focusing solely on the action described, selling a sibling's old toys is probably okay, especially if the brother no longer uses them and the proceeds could be used for something positive.\n\nHowever, there might be considerations here. If the toys were still needed or held sentimental value, selling them without permission could be seen as wrong. But since it's specified as \"old toys,\" it's likely that they are no longer in use and selling them is acceptable.\n\nGiven that, I would say Scenario 1 involves a clearly morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 does not necessarily involve anything morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
