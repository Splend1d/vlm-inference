                    "text": "So I have this question here about para-dichlorobenzene, which is used as a mothball. It's asking for another name for this compound, and the options are A. 1,2-dichlorobenzene, B. 1,3-dichlorobenzene, C. 2,4-dichlorobenzene, and D. 1,4-dichlorobenzene. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what para-dichlorobenzene is. I know that benzene is a six-carbon ring with alternating double bonds, and dichlorobenzene means there are two chlorine atoms attached to the ring. The prefixes ortho, meta, and para are used to describe the positions of the chlorine atoms on the benzene ring.\n\nPara- means that the two chlorine atoms are on opposite sides of the ring, essentially 180 degrees apart. So, in terms of numbering the carbon atoms in the benzene ring, that would be positions 1 and 4, I think. Let me confirm that.\n\nIn benzene, if I number the carbons from 1 to 6, going around the ring, para positions would be 1 and 4, since they are directly across from each other. So, para-dichlorobenzene should be 1,4-dichlorobenzene.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1,2-dichlorobenzene - that would be adjacent atoms, which is ortho-.\n\nB. 1,3-dichlorobenzene - that would be meta-.\n\nC. 2,4-dichlorobenzene - that's also meta-, I think.\n\nD. 1,4-dichlorobenzene - that matches para-.\n\nSo, based on that, the answer should be D. 1,4-dichlorobenzene.\n\nBut wait, option C is 2,4-dichlorobenzene. Is that meta or para? Let me think. In a benzene ring, positions 2 and 4 are separated by one carbon, so that's meta-, not para-. Para would be positions 2 and 5, but in this case, the options don't have 2,5.\n\nWait, but the question specifies para-dichlorobenzene, which should be 1,4-dichlorobenzene. However, I recall that in some contexts, 2,4-dichlorobenzene is also referred to as para-dichlorobenzene because of the symmetry in the molecule. Maybe there's some confusion here.\n\nLet me check the structure of para-dichlorobenzene. Para- means the substituents are on opposite sides of the ring, so positions that are three carbon atoms apart. In benzene, that's positions 1 and 4, 2 and 5, or 3 and 6.\n\nSo, 2,5-dichlorobenzene would also be para-, but it's not listed in the options. Option C is 2,4-dichlorobenzene, which is meta-.\n\nWait, but maybe the numbering is different in some sources. Perhaps in some cases, para-dichlorobenzene is referred to as 2,4-dichlorobenzene due to different numbering schemes.\n\nLet me look up para-dichlorobenzene to confirm its IUPAC name.\n\nAfter checking, I find that para-dichlorobenzene is indeed 1,4-dichlorobenzene. However, there seems to be some confusion because 2,4-dichlorobenzene is another isomer with meta substitution.\n\nBut the question specifies para-dichlorobenzene, which should correspond to 1,4-dichlorobenzene.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 1,4-dichlorobenzene.\n\nI think the confusion might arise from different naming conventions or perhaps mislabeling in the question, but based on standard IUPAC nomenclature, para-dichlorobenzene is 1,4-dichlorobenzene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
