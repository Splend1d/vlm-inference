The city passed this law to keep things quiet and peaceful for residents and to prevent distractions for drivers. The statute says it's against the law to use amplification devices in public places that emit loud and raucous noises.\n\nThe student was driving by the high school with his car stereo cranked up really loud, using some big subwoofers. A police car pulled up beside him, heard the loud music, and arrested him for violating the anti-noise statute. But before his trial, the state's highest court decided that the statute was unconstitutional because it was too vague and overbroad. So, the charges against the student were dropped, and his case was dismissed.\n\nNow, the district attorney's office wants to prosecute the student for attempting to violate the anti-noise statute. The state has an attempt statute that says legal impossibility isn't a defense. So, the student is being charged with attempting to violate the now-unconstitutional statute. At his trial, he testified that he turned up the stereo to the highest level on purpose because his favorite song was playing.\n\nThe question is: Will the student be found guilty of violating the attempt statute? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nOption A says yes, because he possessed the requisite intent.\n\nOption B says yes, because the dismissal of the initial charge wasn't a final judgment, so double jeopardy doesn't apply.\n\nOption C says no, because double jeopardy prevents prosecution for attempt after the initial prosecution was dismissed.\n\nOption D says no, because a defendant can't be retried for attempting to commit a crime that's been ruled unconstitutional by the state's highest court.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what attempt means in criminal law. Attempt generally requires two things: intent to commit the crime and taking a substantial step towards its commission. In this case, the intended crime was violating the anti-noise statute by using an amplification device that emitted loud and raucous noises in a public place.\n\nThe student was arrested while driving with his stereo cranked up, which seems like he was in the process of committing the offense. However, the statute was later ruled unconstitutional, which means it wasn't a valid law to begin with.\n\nNow, the district attorney is trying to charge him with attempting to violate a statute that has been declared unconstitutional.\n\nThis brings up issues related to double jeopardy and the concept of legal impossibility.\n\nDouble jeopardy is a legal principle that prevents someone from being tried twice for the same offense. But in this case, the original charges were dismissed because the statute was unconstitutional, not because the student was acquitted of the charges.\n\nLegal impossibility is a defense to attempt charges when the intended act isn't a crime. For example, if someone tries to steal something that isn't actually owned by anyone, they couldn't be guilty of attempted theft because there's no actual theft to attempt.\n\nHowever, the state's attempt statute says that legal impossibility isn't a defense. So, even if the intended act isn't a crime, attempting to do it could still be punishable.\n\nBut here, the statute that defined the crime was ruled unconstitutional, which means it was never a valid law. So, is attempting to violate an unconstitutional statute equivalent to attempting to do something that's not a crime?\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nLet's look at the options again.\n\nOption A says yes, he'll be found guilty because he had the requisite intent. Well, intent is certainly part of it, but if the underlying statute is unconstitutional, is there really a crime to attempt?\n\nOption B says yes, because the dismissal wasn't a final judgment, so double jeopardy doesn't attach. Double jeopardy usually applies after there's been a final judgment of acquittal or conviction. Since the charges were dismissed due to the statute being unconstitutional, it's not clear if that constitutes a final judgment on the merits.\n\nOption C says no, because double jeopardy prevents prosecution for attempt after the initial prosecution was dismissed. But again, since the dismissal was due to the statute being unconstitutional, not because of the student's innocence or guilt, it's unclear if double jeopardy applies here.\n\nOption D says no, because you can't be retried for attempting to commit a crime that's been ruled unconstitutional. This seems plausible because, if the statute is unconstitutional, then the act isn't a crime, and attempting to do something that isn't a crime shouldn't be punishable.\n\nBut the attempt statute says legal impossibility isn't a defense. So, even if the intended act isn't a crime, attempting it could still be against the law.\n\nThis seems like a conflict: on one hand, the attempt statute says legal impossibility isn't a defense, but on the other hand, attempting to do something that's not a crime shouldn't be punishable.\n\nIn legal terms, attempting to commit an act that isn't a crime is often considered legal impossibility, which traditionally is a defense to attempt charges. However, the state's attempt statute overrides this by saying legal impossibility isn't a defense.\n\nBut in this specific case, the statute that defined the crime was ruled unconstitutional, meaning it was never a valid law to begin with. So, was the attempted act ever a crime?\n\nThis seems like a situation where the attempt statute's provision about legal impossibility might not apply, because the underlying statute was invalid.\n\nAlternatively, one could argue that at the time of the act, the statute was in place, and the student could have been charged under it. The unconstitutionality was determined after the fact, so perhaps he can still be punished for attempting to violate the statute, despite its invalidity.\n\nBut that seems problematic because it would allow prosecution for attempting to do something that was never actually illegal.\n\nMoreover, punishing someone for attempting to violate an unconstitutional statute could set a dangerous precedent, as it would allow prosecution for attempts to commit acts that are not crimes.\n\nAdditionally, there's the issue of double jeopardy. Although the original charges were dismissed due to the statute being unconstitutional, one might argue that prosecuting him now for attempting to violate that statute is essentially trying him again for the same act, which could violate double jeopardy principles.\n\nBut double jeopardy typically applies when there's been a final judgment on the merits, such as an acquittal or a conviction. In this case, the dismissal was due to the statute being unconstitutional, not because of the student's guilt or innocence.\n\nGiven all this, it's a complex legal question that likely requires interpretation by the courts.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because he possessed the requisite intent.\n\nWhile he did have the intent to play loud music, if the underlying act isn't illegal due to the unconstitutional statute, is there really an attempt to commit a crime?\n\nB. Yes, because dismissal of the initial charge was not a final judgment and, therefore, double jeopardy does not attach.\n\nThis might be a possible argument, but it's not clear-cut.\n\nC. No, because double jeopardy precludes prosecution for attempt after the initial prosecution was dismissed.\n\nDouble jeopardy might not apply here since the dismissal was due to the statute being unconstitutional, not because of a judgment on the student's guilt or innocence.\n\nD. No, because a defendant cannot be retried for attempted commission of a crime that has been ruled unconstitutional by a state's highest court.\n\nThis seems like the most plausible answer. If the statute is unconstitutional, the act isn't a crime, and attempting to do something that isn't a crime shouldn't be punishable.\n\nMoreover, allowing prosecution for attempt in such circumstances could indeed violate double jeopardy principles, as it would be punishing the same act under a different theory.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is probably D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
