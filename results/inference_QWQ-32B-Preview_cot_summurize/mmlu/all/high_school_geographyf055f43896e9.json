Information.\n\nPostindustrial economies are characterized by a shift from manufacturing and heavy industry to services, technology, and knowledge-based activities. In such economies, information plays a crucial role in driving innovation, improving efficiency, and enhancing decision-making processes.\n\nHere's why information is considered the most important resource in a postindustrial economy:\n\n1. **Knowledge Economy**: Postindustrial societies are often referred to as knowledge economies, where the creation, distribution, use, and management of knowledge are central to economic activity. Information is the raw material that fuels this knowledge economy.\n\n2. **Innovation and Technology**: Information is essential for\u7814\u53d1\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6d41\u52a8\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u3002\n\n3. **Decision Making**: Accurate and timely information is critical for making informed decisions in business and management. It helps in optimizing operations, identifying market trends, and responding to customer needs more effectively.\n\n4. **Efficiency and Automation**: Information technology enables automation and streamlining of processes, which can significantly increase productivity. For example, using data analytics to optimize supply chains or employing artificial intelligence to automate routine tasks.\n\n5. **Education and Skills**: In a postindustrial economy, human capital becomes more important, and information is key to education and skill development. Access to information allows workers to acquire new skills and adapt to changing job markets.\n\nWhile energy, labor, and specialization are still important resources, their relative importance shifts in a postindustrial economy. Energy remains crucial for powering industries and technologies, but its role is often complemented by information technologies that optimize energy use. Labor becomes more skilled and knowledge-based, with a greater emphasis on human capital. Specialization continues to be important, but it is often specialized in areas related to information and knowledge.\n\nTherefore, in the context of a postindustrial economy, information is the most critical resource for increasing productivity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
