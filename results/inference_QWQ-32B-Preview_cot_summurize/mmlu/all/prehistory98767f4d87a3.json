The options are:\n\nA. happened everywhere except in South America.\n\nB. took thousands of years.\n\nC. took hundreds of thousands of years.\n\nD. always required careful planning.\n\nOkay, so first I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about the shift from food gathering, which I guess is hunting and gathering, to completely relying on agriculture. So, it's about the Neolithic Revolution or the Agricultural Revolution, I think that's what it's called.\n\nLet me think about option A: happened everywhere except in South America. Is that accurate? I know that agriculture developed independently in several parts of the world, including the Fertile Crescent, China, Mesoamerica, and South America. So, South America actually did have its own development of agriculture, for example, in the Andes with crops like potatoes and quinoa. So, option A seems incorrect because agriculture did develop in South America.\n\nOption B: took thousands of years. That sounds plausible. The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture was a gradual process that occurred over a long period. In different parts of the world, this transition happened at different times and paces.\n\nOption C: took hundreds of thousands of years. Hmm, that seems like a very long time. The overall process of human evolution has taken millions of years, but the transition to agriculture is generally considered to have occurred between about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, give or take. So, thousands of years makes more sense than hundreds of thousands.\n\nOption D: always required careful planning. Well, agriculture does require planning compared to hunting and gathering, which is more about foraging for available food. But saying it \"always required careful planning\" might be a bit too absolute. There might have been trial and error involved initially, and different societies developed agricultural practices suited to their environments.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems the most accurate: the transition took thousands of years. It was a gradual process that varied in timing and pace across different regions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
