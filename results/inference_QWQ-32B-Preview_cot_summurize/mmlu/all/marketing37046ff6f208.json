The question is about a characteristic of services, and it mentions that services are produced and consumed simultaneously by people, which makes it hard to standardize their delivery using a blueprint model. It's asking which characteristic this refers to, and the options are Intangibility, Inseparability, Variability, and Perishability.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these characteristics means:\n\n1. **Intangibility**: This means that services are not physical objects; they can't be seen, touched, or stored like products. For example, consulting services or banking services don't have a physical form.\n\n2. **Inseparability**: This refers to the fact that services are produced and consumed at the same time. The customer is often involved in the service delivery process. For instance, when you go to a restaurant, the cooking and eating happen simultaneously.\n\n3. **Variability**: Also known as heterogeneity, this means that services can vary in quality and delivery depending on who provides them and when they are provided. For example, the same service from different employees or at different times might not be exactly the same.\n\n4. **Perishability**: This means that services cannot be stored for later use. They must be used when they are produced. For example, a hotel room not booked on a particular night cannot be saved for the next day.\n\nNow, the question mentions that services are produced and consumed simultaneously by people, which aligns with the definition of inseparability. It also says that this makes it difficult to standardize the delivery of services using a blueprint model. A blueprint model is a detailed plan or guide for how a service should be delivered to ensure consistency.\n\nSo, because of inseparability, there's direct interaction between the service provider and the customer, which can introduce variability in the service delivery. This variability makes standardization challenging because each service encounter can be unique.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic being referred to here is **Inseparability**.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's see if any of the other characteristics might also be relevant.\n\n- **Intangibility** might make standardization difficult because services can't be seen or touched, but the key point here is the simultaneous production and consumption.\n\n- **Variability** is a result of the service delivery process, but it's caused by inseparability and human involvement.\n\n- **Perishability** relates to the inability to store services, which is not directly related to the standardization issue mentioned in the question.\n\nSo, while all these characteristics are important aspects of services, the one that directly relates to the simultaneous production and consumption, leading to standardization difficulties, is **Inseparability**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
