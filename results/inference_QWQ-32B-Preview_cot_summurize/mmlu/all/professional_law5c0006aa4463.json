So, a four-year-old kid falls from a second-floor outdoor stairway at her apartment building, and the tenant sues the landlord for being negligent in how the stairway, steps, and railing were built and maintained. The jury decided that the landlord was negligent in designing and constructing the stairs and in not keeping them, the steps, and the railing safe. Now, the landlord is appealing, saying that he has immunity from being sued, and the tenant didn't claim any exceptions to this immunity. The question is, under the modern rule, will the appellate court agree with the jury's verdict against the landlord?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Yes, the landlord is strictly liable because there's an abnormally dangerous condition that he knew about and let exist.\n\nB. Yes, now days, landlords have a duty to be careful and protect their tenants and others from risks that could cause harm.\n\nC. No, because the old rule \"lessee beware\" still applies, and residential properties are usually rented \"as is.\"\n\nD. No, because landlords can't be held responsible for how things are designed or maintained, even with the modern rules.\n\nAlright, I need to figure out which one is correct. First, I should understand what \"landlord immunity\" means. I think it's about whether landlords can be held liable for certain conditions or actions regarding the property they rent out.\n\nIn the past, there was something called the \"principle of caveat lessee,\" which means \"let the lessee beware.\" This meant that once the tenant moves in, the landlord isn't responsible for maintaining the premises in a certain condition, except for maybe following building codes. But I think times have changed, and laws have evolved.\n\nI remember that nowadays, there's a greater emphasis on safety and the duty of care. So, probably, landlords do have some responsibilities to ensure that the premises are safe for tenants and their guests.\n\nLet me think about option A: strict liability for an abnormally dangerous condition. Strict liability means that even if the landlord wasn't negligent, he's still responsible because the condition was inherently dangerous. But in this case, it seems like the landlord was negligent in the design and maintenance. So, maybe strict liability isn't the right fit here. It's more about negligence.\n\nOption B says that under the modern rule, landlords have a duty to use due care to protect tenants from foreseeable risks of harm. That sounds plausible. Negligence is about failing to act with reasonable care, and if the landlord didn't maintain the stairs properly, that could be negligence.\n\nOption C mentions that the \"lessee beware\" doctrine still applies, and residential properties are rented \"as is.\" But I think this is the older common law approach, and perhaps it's not the current stance.\n\nOption D says that landlords can't be held liable for design or maintenance negligence even under modern rules. That seems outdated.\n\nGiven that the jury found the landlord negligent, and the question is whether the appellate court will affirm that under the modern rule, I think the modern rule would support the idea that landlords have a responsibility to maintain their properties safely.\n\nMoreover, in many jurisdictions, landlords are required to keep common areas safe and habitable. Stairways, especially outdoor ones, could be considered common areas that the landlord is responsible for maintaining.\n\nAlso, considering that the stairs were built at a dangerous incline, the steps were loose, and the railing was insufficient, these all sound like maintenance and design issues that the landlord should have addressed.\n\nFurthermore, the tenant is a young child, so there might be an argument about the duty to protect children who are more vulnerable.\n\nI think the key here is the concept of duty of care. Under modern tort law, landlords do owe a duty of care to their tenants to maintain the premises in a safe condition.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most accurate: yes, the modern rule is that the landlord, like anyone else, has a duty to use due care to protect tenants and others from injury caused by foreseeable risks of harm.\n\nOption A might be too extreme because strict liability is usually reserved for extra hazardous activities, not just negligent maintenance.\n\nOption C is likely outdated, as laws have changed to impose more responsibilities on landlords.\n\nOption D is contrary to what I believe is the current legal stance.\n\nSo, I would go with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
