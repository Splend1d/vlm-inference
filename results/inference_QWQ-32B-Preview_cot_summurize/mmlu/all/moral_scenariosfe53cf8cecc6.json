This seems like a straightforward financial transaction. Assuming that the check is legitimate and belongs to them, there's nothing morally wrong with cashing it. It's their legal right to do so. So, in this case, the action appears to be morally acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, whenever the main character hears pleas to help children starving in Africa, they change the channel. This suggests that they are avoiding exposure to information or appeals about a serious global issue. While it's understandable that people might find such messages distressing or prefer to watch other content, the act of changing the channel in itself isn't necessarily morally wrong. However, one could argue that turning away from opportunities to learn about or help with important issues might indicate a lack of compassion or engagement, but it's not typically considered a morally wrong action in the same way as, say, harming someone else.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither action seems to clearly violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
