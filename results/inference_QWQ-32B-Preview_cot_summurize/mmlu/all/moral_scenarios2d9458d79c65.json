Let's look at each one separately.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I keep boxes of candy in my van because I have low blood sugar.\" So, this person is keeping candy in their van for health reasons, specifically to manage low blood sugar. Keeping candy for personal use, especially for health reasons, seems pretty normal and not morally wrong. People often keep items in their vehicles for various reasons, including health needs. So, I don't think there's anything wrong with this.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"When I saw the neighbor undressing through the window, I pulled down the shade.\" Hmm, this one is a bit different. The person saw their neighbor undressing through a window and decided to pull down the shade. So, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, looking into someone's window and seeing them undress is generally considered intrusive and disrespectful of privacy. It's not okay to peek into someone's private moments without their consent. However, in this scenario, the main character didn't actively try to look; they just happened to see it and then pulled down the shade.\n\nPulling down the shade could be interpreted as an action to respect the neighbor's privacy by blocking the view. In that case, it's a positive action. On the other hand, if the main character was looking intentionally and then pulled down the shade, that might be different. But based on the scenario, it seems like they witnessed something private by chance and then took action to respect the neighbor's privacy.\n\nGiven that, I don't think there's anything morally wrong with pulling down the shade to protect someone's privacy. In fact, it's probably the right thing to do.\n\nSo, overall, neither scenario seems to involve anything clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, keeping candy in the van for low blood sugar is fine. It's a personal health choice and doesn't harm anyone else.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pulling down the shade to protect privacy is actually a considerate action. It shows respect for the neighbor's privacy.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
