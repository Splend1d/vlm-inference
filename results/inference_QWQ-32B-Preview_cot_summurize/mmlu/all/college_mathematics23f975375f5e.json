                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find the number of real solutions to the equation \\(e^x + x - 2 = 0\\) in the interval [0, 1], and also the number of real solutions that are not in [0, 1]. Then, I have to choose the correct option from A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. I need to find how many times the equation \\(e^x + x - 2 = 0\\) has real solutions within [0, 1], and how many are outside this interval.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider the function \\(f(x) = e^x + x - 2\\), and then find where it equals zero.\n\nSo, \\(f(x) = e^x + x - 2\\).\n\nI know that \\(e^x\\) is always positive and increases as x increases. The term \\(x\\) also increases as x increases. So, overall, \\(f(x)\\) seems to be an increasing function.\n\nLet me check if \\(f(x)\\) is indeed increasing. I can do this by finding its derivative.\n\nThe derivative of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f'(x) = e^x + 1\\).\n\nSince \\(e^x\\) is always positive, and adding 1 makes it even larger, \\(f'(x)\\) is always positive. Therefore, \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing for all real numbers.\n\nNow, since \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing, it can have at most one real root. Because if it were to cross the x-axis more than once, it would have to decrease somewhere, which contradicts that it's strictly increasing.\n\nSo, there is at most one real solution to the equation \\(e^x + x - 2 = 0\\).\n\nNext, I need to check if there is indeed a root in the interval [0, 1], and if there are any roots outside this interval.\n\nLet's evaluate \\(f(x)\\) at the endpoints of the interval [0, 1].\n\nFirst, \\(f(0) = e^0 + 0 - 2 = 1 + 0 - 2 = -1\\).\n\nThen, \\(f(1) = e^1 + 1 - 2 = e + 1 - 2 = e - 1\\).\n\nSince \\(e\\) is approximately 2.718, \\(e - 1\\) is approximately 1.718, which is positive.\n\nSo, \\(f(0) = -1\\) and \\(f(1) = e - 1 > 0\\).\n\nSince \\(f(x)\\) is continuous (as it's a sum of continuous functions), and it changes sign from negative to positive in the interval [0, 1], by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in [0, 1].\n\nCombining this with the fact that \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing and can have only one real root, I can conclude that there is exactly one real root in [0, 1], and no real roots outside [0, 1].\n\nWait a minute, but the question asks for the number of real solutions in [0, 1], which I've determined is 1, and the number of real solutions not in [0, 1], which I've determined is 0.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. k = 0 and n = 1\n\nB. k = 1 and n = 0\n\nC. k = n = 1\n\nD. k > 1\n\nIt seems that option B matches my conclusion: k = 1 and n = 0.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIs it possible for there to be a root outside [0, 1]? Let's consider the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) as x approaches positive and negative infinity.\n\nAs \\(x \\to \\infty\\), \\(e^x\\) grows exponentially, and \\(x\\) grows linearly, so \\(f(x) \\to \\infty\\).\n\nAs \\(x \\to -\\infty\\), \\(e^x \\to 0\\), and \\(x \\to -\\infty\\), so \\(f(x) \\to -\\infty\\).\n\nBut since \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing, and we've already established that there's only one root in [0, 1], there can't be any roots outside this interval.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider plotting the function or thinking about its graph.\n\nThe graph of \\(e^x\\) is always positive, starts from y=1 at x=0, and increases rapidly. Adding \\(x\\) shifts it up linearly, and subtracting 2 shifts it down by 2 units.\n\nSo, at x=0, \\(e^0 + 0 - 2 = -1\\), which is below the x-axis.\n\nAt x=1, \\(e^1 + 1 - 2 \\approx 1.718\\), which is above the x-axis.\n\nAnd since it's strictly increasing, it crosses the x-axis exactly once between 0 and 1, and doesn't cross again elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, k = 1 and n = 0.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
