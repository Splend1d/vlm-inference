                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about the capitalist world economy and what Wallerstein calls a 'world system.' So, I need to pick the best definition from these options.\n\nFirst, I should remember what Wallerstein's world-systems theory is about. I think he was a sociologist who looked at the global economy as a single system with different parts that are interconnected. He talked about core countries, periphery countries, and semi-periphery countries, all interacting in a way that benefits the core countries mostly.\n\nOption A says it's a means of transporting money between different areas of a country. Hmm, that sounds more like a national economic system or maybe a banking system, not really a world system in the way Wallerstein uses the term.\n\nOption B mentions an empire with a bureaucratic administration but no political center. That seems to be describing some kind of decentralized empire, but I don't recall Wallerstein describing the world system that way. His world system is more about economic relationships rather than political structures.\n\nOption C talks about an awareness of risks and dangers that affect the environment as a whole. This seems more related to environmental consciousness or global environmental issues, not directly to the economic system that Wallerstein is referring to.\n\nOption D says it's a unit with a division of labor that extends across ethnic and cultural groups. Okay, this sounds more like what Wallerstein might mean. In a world system, different regions have different roles in the global economy, and these roles are often based on their position in the system\u2014core, periphery, etc. So, there's a division of labor where some places specialize in certain types of production or services, and this division crosses national, ethnic, and cultural boundaries.\n\nLet me think about this some more. Wallerstein's world-systems theory emphasizes the global capitalist economy as a single system with interconnected parts that have developed over time. So, it's not just about transportation of money or political structures, but about how different societies are integrated into a global economic system with unequal relationships.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to capture part of that idea by mentioning a division of labor across ethnic and cultural groups. This suggests that the global economy involves different groups specializing in different economic activities, which aligns with Wallerstein's concept.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there's a better match among the options. Maybe none of them perfectly capture Wallerstein's definition, but I have to choose the best one.\n\nOption A is probably incorrect because it's too narrow and focuses only on money transportation, which is just one aspect of a much larger system.\n\nOption B seems to be describing a political structure, which isn't the main focus of Wallerstein's world system.\n\nOption C is more about environmental awareness, which, while important, isn't directly related to the economic system Wallerstein is discussing.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, option D seems to be the most appropriate choice. It acknowledges that the world system has a division of labor that crosses ethnic and cultural boundaries, which is consistent with the idea of a global economic system where different regions have different roles based on their position in the system.\n\nMoreover, Wallerstein's theory emphasizes that this division of labor is unequal, with some regions specializing in raw material production and others in manufacturing and high-value services. This inequality is a central aspect of his world-systems theory.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: a unit with a division of labour that extends across ethnic and cultural groups.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
