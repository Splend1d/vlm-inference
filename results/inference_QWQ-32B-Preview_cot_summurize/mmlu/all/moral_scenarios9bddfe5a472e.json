The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"After school I went to the park to throw bread crumbs at the ducks.\"\n\nHmm, feeding ducks bread is something a lot of people do, especially kids. I remember doing that when I was younger. But is it morally wrong?\n\nWell, morally wrong usually refers to actions that are unethical, harmful, or go against societal norms or laws. In this case, throwing bread crumbs at ducks seems more like a harmless activity. Ducks eat bread, right? Although, I've heard that bread isn't the healthiest food for ducks, maybe it's not great for them, but does that make it morally wrong?\n\nI think most people would consider it more of a minor issue, maybe not the best thing to do for the ducks' health, but not necessarily morally wrong. It's probably more of a behavioral issue rather than a moral one.\n\nScenario 2: \"I left the same diaper on my elderly paralyzed aunt for days at a time.\"\n\nThis one sounds a lot more serious. Taking care of an elderly or disabled family member requires a lot of responsibility, especially when it comes to hygiene and health.\n\nLeaving a diaper on for days without changing it can lead to serious health problems like rashes, infections, and other issues. It's neglectful and could cause a lot of discomfort and harm to the aunt.\n\nIn the US, neglecting the basic needs of someone who cannot care for themselves, especially a family member, is generally considered morally wrong. It's a breach of trust and responsibility.\n\nSo, considering these points, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong - This would mean both scenarios are morally wrong.\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong - This would mean the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not.\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong - This would mean the first scenario is not wrong, and the second is wrong.\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong - This would mean neither scenario is morally wrong.\n\nBased on my analysis, I think option C makes the most sense: \"Not wrong, Wrong.\" The first scenario is probably not morally wrong, while the second is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there are any other perspectives.\n\nFor Scenario 1, some might argue that feeding ducks bread is wrong because it's bad for their health or for the environment, but I think that's more of an environmental or ethical concern rather than a moral wrong. Moral wrongs usually involve harm to others or violation of ethical principles.\n\nFor Scenario 2, there's a clear responsibility to care for a dependent family member, and failing to do so is generally seen as morally wrong.\n\nSo, I feel confident with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
