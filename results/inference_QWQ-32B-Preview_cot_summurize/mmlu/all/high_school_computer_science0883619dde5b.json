I need to figure out what values are displayed at the end.\n\nFirst, the initial assignments:\n\nr \u2190 1\n\ns \u2190 2\n\nt \u2190 3\n\nSo, r is 1, s is 2, and t is 3.\n\nNext, r is assigned the value of s:\n\nr \u2190 s\n\nSince s is 2, now r is also 2.\n\nThen, s is assigned the value of t:\n\ns \u2190 t\n\nt is 3, so now s is 3.\n\nFinally, we display r and then s.\n\nSo, DISPLAY (r) should show 2, and DISPLAY (s) should show 3.\n\nTherefore, the output should be:\n\n2\n\n3\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1 1\n\nB. 1 2\n\nC. 2 3\n\nD. 3 2\n\nIt seems like option C matches our conclusion.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nInitial values:\n\nr = 1\n\ns = 2\n\nt = 3\n\nThen r \u2190 s, so r = 2\n\nThen s \u2190 t, so s = 3\n\nDISPLAY r, which is 2\n\nDISPLAY s, which is 3\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's some programming language-specific behavior I'm not considering, but since it's a general pseudocode, I think this is straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 2 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
