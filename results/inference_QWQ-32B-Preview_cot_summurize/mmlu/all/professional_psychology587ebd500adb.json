                    "text": "Let's see. So, we have this scenario where female applicants get lower scores on a selection test compared to males, but once hired, they perform just as well on the job. We need to figure out which term this situation best illustrates among differential validity, differential selection, adverse impact, and unfairness.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\n**Differential Validity:** This refers to a situation where a selection test predicts job performance equally well for all groups. In other words, the test is valid for all groups without bias. But in our case, females score lower on the test but perform equally well on the job. So, the test isn't predicting job performance accurately for females. Therefore, this might not be differential validity.\n\n**Differential Selection:** I'm not entirely sure about this one. It might refer to differences in hiring rates across groups. But in this scenario, it's about test scores and job performance, not necessarily about who gets selected.\n\n**Adverse Impact:** This is a term used in employment to describe a situation where a selection process disproportionately affects members of a particular group, usually a protected class like a specific gender or ethnicity. In this case, females are scoring lower on the test, which could lead to fewer females being hired if the test is used as a selection criterion. So, there might be adverse impact here.\n\n**Unfairness:** This is a broad term that could encompass various forms of bias or inequality in the selection process. If the test is not accurately assessing the capabilities of females, that could be considered unfair.\n\nNow, considering the definitions:\n\n- Differential validity suggests that the test is valid across groups, but in this case, it's not predicting job performance accurately for females.\n\n- Differential selection might not directly apply here.\n\n- Adverse impact is about disproportionate effects on a group, which could be happening if females are scoring lower and thus being less likely to be hired.\n\n- Unfairness is a general term that could include both invalidity and adverse impact.\n\nBut the key point is that the test is not accurately predicting job performance for females, even though they perform just as well when hired. This suggests that the test has less validity for females compared to males.\n\nWait, but differential validity is when the test is equally valid across groups. Here, it's less valid for females, so maybe it's a lack of differential validity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's differential validity in the sense that the test is not equally valid for both groups.\n\nI think the correct term is **differential validity**. The test is not predicting job performance equally well for females and males, indicating a difference in validity between the groups.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. differential validity.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf it's differential validity, and the test is not predicting job performance equally well for females, then that would be a problem. The test is invalid for females in terms of predicting performance, even though they perform well once hired.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, differential validity is not being achieved here.\n\nTherefore, the situation illustrates **differential validity**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
