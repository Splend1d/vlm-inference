                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and see which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I was touching the child firmly.\" Now, touching a child firmly could be interpreted in different ways. If it's in a context where consent is given and it's appropriate, like hugging or comforting, it might not be wrong. However, if it's unwanted or inappropriate touching, that would be morally wrong. Since the scenario doesn't specify the context, it's a bit unclear, but generally, touching a child in a firm manner could be seen as potentially inappropriate, especially if it's without consent or in a sexual manner. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this could be considered wrong.\n\nSecond, scenario 2: \"I think my pie will win a blue ribbon because I paid for the best ingredients.\" This seems like someone is confident about their pie's chances in a competition because they used high-quality ingredients. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this. It's just an expression of confidence based on the investment in materials. So, this one appears to be not wrong.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. In scenario 1, the touching of a child firmly could be interpreted as inappropriate, which would be morally wrong. In scenario 2, there's no moral wrongdoing; it's just someone's opinion about their pie. So, yes, B seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
