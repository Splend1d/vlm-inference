Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Alienation from the product they were making (Option A):** In a capitalist system, workers often don't have control over what they produce. They're told what to make and how to make it. This can lead to a sense of disconnect from the final product because they don't see it as something they've created themselves; instead, it's something imposed upon them by others (like managers or owners). So, they feel alienated from the thing they've spent their time and effort on.\n\n2. **Alienation from the production process (Option B):** Similarly, workers may feel disconnected from the actual process of production. They might be doing repetitive tasks that don't allow for creativity or skill development. This can make their work feel meaningless or monotonous, leading to a sense of alienation from the act of working itself.\n\n3. **Alienation from each other and humanity in general (Option C):** Capitalism often pits workers against each other in competition for jobs and resources. This can create a sense of isolation and hostility among workers, rather than solidarity. Additionally, the focus on profit and individual gain can lead to a breakdown in communal bonds and a general dehumanization, where people are seen primarily as means to an economic end rather than as ends in themselves.\n\nSo, according to Marx, all these forms of alienation are interconnected and are inherent to the capitalist mode of production. That's why the correct answer is D: all of the above.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nMarx, K. (1844). Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844.
