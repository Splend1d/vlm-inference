                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a Cu(II) metal ion with a ground state spin quantum number giso = 2.12, and it produces four lines with a separation of 500 MHz between each line. We need to express the hyperfine splitting in field units of mT and the hyperfine coupling in units of wavenumbers (cm\u207b\u00b9).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what hyperfine splitting is. Hyperfine splitting is the splitting of spectral lines due to the magnetic interaction between the nuclear spin and the electron spin in an atom or molecule. In this case, it's for a Cu(II) metal ion.\n\nThe formula that relates the hyperfine splitting in frequency (\u03bd) to the magnetic field (B) is:\n\n\u03bd = g * \u03bcB * B / h\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03bd is the hyperfine splitting frequency\n\n- g is the Land\u00e9 g-factor (in this case, giso = 2.12)\n\n- \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton (approximately 9.274 x 10\u207b\u00b2\u2074 J/T)\n\n- B is the magnetic field in Tesla (T)\n\n- h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10\u207b\u00b3\u2074 J\u00b7s)\n\nBut I need to relate this to the given frequency separation of 500 MHz. Since there are four lines with equal separations, the total hyperfine splitting would be 3 times 500 MHz, because there are three intervals between four lines.\n\nSo, total hyperfine splitting \u0394\u03bd = 3 * 500 MHz = 1500 MHz = 1.5 GHz.\n\nNow, I can use the formula to find the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (h * \u0394\u03bd) / (g * \u03bcB)\n\nBut actually, rearranging the original formula:\n\nB = (h * \u03bd) / (g * \u03bcB)\n\nWait, but \u03bd is the frequency, and in hyperfine splitting, it's often related to the Zeeman effect, where the energy difference between magnetic sublevels is given by:\n\n\u0394E = g * \u03bcB * B\n\nAnd since E = h * \u03bd, then:\n\nh * \u03bd = g * \u03bcB * B\n\nSo, B = (h * \u03bd) / (g * \u03bcB)\n\nBut I need to make sure about the units. Let's plug in the values with units to ensure correctness.\n\nFirst, convert \u03bd from MHz to Hz:\n\n500 MHz = 500 x 10^6 Hz\n\nBut since there are three intervals for four lines, total splitting is 3 x 500 MHz = 1500 MHz = 1.5 x 10^9 Hz\n\nNow, Planck's constant h = 6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s\n\nBohr magneton \u03bcB = 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T\n\ngiso = 2.12\n\nSo,\n\nB = (6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s * 1.5 x 10^9 Hz) / (2.12 * 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T)\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n6.626 x 10^-34 * 1.5 x 10^9 = 9.939 x 10^-25 J\n\nDenominator:\n\n2.12 * 9.274 x 10^-24 = 19.65688 x 10^-24 J/T = 1.965688 x 10^-23 J/T\n\nSo,\n\nB = 9.939 x 10^-25 J / 1.965688 x 10^-23 J/T \u2248 0.05056 T\n\nNow, convert Tesla to millitesla (mT):\n\n1 T = 1000 mT\n\nSo, B \u2248 0.05056 T * 1000 = 50.56 mT\n\nWait, but none of the options have 50.56 mT. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the number of lines. If there are four lines with equal separations of 500 MHz, then the total splitting is indeed 3 times 500 MHz, which is 1500 MHz.\n\nBut perhaps for hyperfine splitting, it's different. Maybe the separation between adjacent lines is the hyperfine splitting frequency, which is 500 MHz.\n\nLet me check that approach.\n\nIf \u03bd = 500 MHz = 5 x 10^8 Hz\n\nThen,\n\nB = (h * \u03bd) / (g * \u03bcB) = (6.626 x 10^-34 * 5 x 10^8) / (2.12 * 9.274 x 10^-24)\n\nNumerator: 6.626 x 10^-34 * 5 x 10^8 = 3.313 x 10^-25 J\n\nDenominator: 2.12 * 9.274 x 10^-24 = 19.65688 x 10^-24 J/T = 1.965688 x 10^-23 J/T\n\nSo,\n\nB = 3.313 x 10^-25 / 1.965688 x 10^-23 \u2248 0.01685 T\n\nConvert to mT: 0.01685 T * 1000 = 16.85 mT\n\nNow, this matches option B.\n\nBut wait, the total splitting would be 3 times 500 MHz, which is 1500 MHz, and if I use that:\n\nB = (6.626 x 10^-34 * 1.5 x 10^9) / (2.12 * 9.274 x 10^-24) = (9.939 x 10^-25) / (1.965688 x 10^-23) \u2248 0.5056 T = 50.56 mT\n\nBut 50.56 mT is not among the options, so perhaps the question intends for us to use the separation between adjacent lines, which is 500 MHz, corresponding to B = 16.85 mT.\n\nNow, for the hyperfine coupling constant in units of wavenumbers (cm\u207b\u00b9), we need to relate the hyperfine splitting energy to wavenumbers.\n\nThe energy corresponding to the hyperfine splitting is:\n\n\u0394E = h * \u03bd\n\nAnd since energy in wavenumbers is given by:\n\n\u0394E = h * c * \u03bd\u0304\n\nWhere \u03bd\u0304 is the wavenumber (in cm\u207b\u00b9), and c is the speed of light in cm/s.\n\nWait, actually, wavenumber \u03bd\u0304 is defined as \u03bd\u0304 = \u03bd / c, where \u03bd is frequency and c is the speed of light in cm/s.\n\nBut energy is related to wavenumber by:\n\n\u0394E = h * c * \u03bd\u0304\n\nSo, \u03bd\u0304 = \u0394E / (h * c)\n\nBut since \u0394E = h * \u03bd, then \u03bd\u0304 = \u03bd / c\n\nBut need to ensure units are consistent.\n\nGiven \u03bd in Hz (s\u207b\u00b9), and c in cm/s, then \u03bd\u0304 = \u03bd / c in cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo, \u03bd\u0304 = \u03bd / c\n\nGiven \u03bd = 500 MHz = 5 x 10^8 Hz\n\nSpeed of light c = 2.998 x 10^10 cm/s\n\nThus,\n\n\u03bd\u0304 = (5 x 10^8 Hz) / (2.998 x 10^10 cm/s) \u2248 0.01667 cm\u207b\u00b9\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nAlternatively, if we considered the total splitting of 1500 MHz, then:\n\n\u03bd\u0304 = 1500 x 10^6 Hz / (2.998 x 10^10 cm/s) \u2248 0.0500 cm\u207b\u00b9\n\nBut 0.0500 cm\u207b\u00b9 does not match any option.\n\nTherefore, it seems the correct approach is to use the separation between adjacent lines, which is 500 MHz, corresponding to B = 16.85 mT and \u03bd\u0304 = 0.01667 cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nThus, the answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
