                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about comprehensive schools in the 1960s. The question is: \"In the 1960s, comprehensive schools did not eradicate class inequalities in education because...\" and then it gives four options. I need to pick the one that best explains why comprehensive schools didn't eliminate class inequalities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what comprehensive schools are. From what I know, comprehensive schools were introduced to provide a non-selective education for all children, regardless of their academic ability. The idea was to do away with the selective system, where only the most academically able children went to grammar schools, and others went to different types of schools. The goal was to create a more equal educational system.\n\nOption A says: \"they tended to recruit pupils from the inner cities and traditionally working-class areas.\" Hmm, that seems plausible. If comprehensive schools were mainly in inner cities and working-class areas, maybe they ended up educating mostly working-class children, which might not have addressed the inequalities because the system was still segregating students based on their background.\n\nOption B says: \"selective schools could still 'cream off' the most able pupils, while the comprehensives put children into ability streams.\" This suggests that even with comprehensive schools, some selective schools still existed and took the top students, leaving the comprehensives to deal with students who might be less academically inclined. Also, putting students into ability streams within comprehensives might have perpetuated inequalities, as some streams could be seen as more desirable or prestigious than others.\n\nOption C says: \"teachers in comprehensive schools used the restricted code in the classroom, whereas working-class pupils used elaborated codes of speech.\" This one seems a bit confusing. I think it's referring to sociolinguistic concepts where \"restricted code\" is a way of speaking that is context-dependent and often used by working-class people, while \"elaborated code\" is context-independent and more associated with middle-class speech. If teachers are using elaborated code and students are using restricted code, there might be a communication gap, which could affect education. But I'm not entirely sure if this was a major factor in perpetuating class inequalities in the 1960s.\n\nOption D says: \"national testing and league tables made the new schools highly competitive and selective.\" This suggests that even though comprehensive schools were meant to be non-selective, the introduction of national testing and league tables created competition among schools, which might have led to a de facto selection process. Schools might have tried to boost their rankings by attracting higher-achieving students or pushing lower-achieving ones out, which could reinforce class inequalities.\n\nNow, I need to decide which of these options best explains why comprehensive schools didn't eradicate class inequalities.\n\nOption A seems plausible, but it might not fully explain the persistence of inequalities. It's more about where the schools were located rather than how they operated.\n\nOption B points to the continued existence of selective schools and the practice of streaming within comprehensives. This seems like a significant factor because it means that even within a comprehensive system, there are ways to separate students based on ability, which can lead to different educational experiences and opportunities.\n\nOption C is interesting but perhaps more related to educational practices rather than the structural issues that underpin class inequalities. While communication styles between teachers and students are important, I'm not sure if this was the primary reason comprehensive schools didn't eliminate class inequalities.\n\nOption D highlights the impact of national testing and league tables, which introduced competition into the system. This competition could lead schools to focus on raising test scores, possibly at the expense of a more inclusive education. However, in the 1960s, national testing and league tables might not have been as prominent as they are today, so this option might not fit the time period accurately.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Option B is the best answer. The continued existence of selective schools that could take the most able pupils, combined with the practice of streaming within comprehensives, likely contributed significantly to the persistence of class inequalities in education during the 1960s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
