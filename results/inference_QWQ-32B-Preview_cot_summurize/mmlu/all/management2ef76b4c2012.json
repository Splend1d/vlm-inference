These alliances can take many forms, but they generally involve a formal agreement between the parties involved.\n\nLet's look at each option to determine which best defines a strategic alliance:\n\nA. Any form of partnership between one firm and another\n\nThis option is quite broad. While it's true that a strategic alliance is a type of partnership, not all partnerships are strategic alliances. For example, a joint venture is a type of partnership, but it's often considered a more extensive form of collaboration than a strategic alliance. So, this definition is too general.\n\nB. Formal agreement committing two or more firms to exchange resources to produce products or services\n\nThis option seems more precise. It mentions a formal agreement, which is a key characteristic of a strategic alliance. It also specifies that the agreement involves exchanging resources to produce products or services. This aligns well with the typical goals of a strategic alliance, which often aim to combine the strengths of different companies to create new offerings or improve existing ones.\n\nC. Formal agreement to share profits from a shared investment\n\nWhile profit sharing can be a component of some strategic alliances, it's not the defining characteristic. Strategic alliances can involve various forms of collaboration beyond just sharing profits. Additionally, shared investments might be part of a joint venture rather than a strategic alliance. Therefore, this option is too narrow.\n\nD. Formal agreement to share knowledge\n\nSharing knowledge is indeed a common aspect of strategic alliances, as companies often partner to access each other's expertise or technology. However, again, this is just one aspect of a strategic alliance, not the entire definition. Strategic alliances can involve more than just knowledge sharing; they can include resource exchange, joint marketing efforts, and other collaborative activities.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems to be the most comprehensive and accurate definition of a strategic alliance. It captures the formal nature of the agreement and the exchange of resources for the purpose of producing products or services, which are key elements of such alliances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
