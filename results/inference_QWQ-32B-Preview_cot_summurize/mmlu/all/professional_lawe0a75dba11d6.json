He has to make an emergency landing and chooses to land in a farmer's orange grove, being careful not to damage any trees. Now, the farmer is suing the rancher for trespassing. We need to figure out what's likely to happen in court.\n\nFirst off, trespassing generally means entering someone's property without permission. In this case, the rancher didn't have permission to land in the farmer's orange grove, so it seems like trespassing at first glance. But there are exceptions to every rule, right?\n\nOption A says the farmer will recover because the property belonged to a private person. Well, yeah, it's private property, but that's kind of the point. People can sue for trespass on their private land, but again, there are circumstances where trespass might be excusable or privileged.\n\nOption B says the farmer will recover because the rancher had reasonable grounds to believe the orange grove belonged to a private person. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. The rancher knew it was private property; that's why he was trying to land there carefully. So, this option seems a bit off.\n\nOption C says the farmer won't recover because the rancher was privileged to enter the land under the circumstances. Privilege in law means there's a justified reason to do something that would otherwise be illegal. In this case, the rancher had to make an emergency landing for his safety and the safety of his airplane. That sounds like a pretty strong justification.\n\nOption D says the farmer won't recover because the rancher was carefully and skillfully operating his airplane when the engine went out. Well, being careful doesn't really excuse the trespass; it's more about how the situation occurred. The engine failure was unexpected, and the rancher had to react quickly.\n\nLooking back, the key here is the emergency landing. When someone is forced to enter another's property due to an emergency situation where there's danger to life or property, the law often recognizes this as a justified trespass, or a privileged act.\n\nThere's a legal concept called \"necessity,\" which allows someone to trespass if it's necessary to prevent a greater harm. In this case, the rancher believed it was necessary to land in the orange grove to protect himself and his airplane. He also took care to avoid damaging the trees, which shows he was considerate of the farmer's property.\n\nSo, considering this, it seems like the rancher had a valid reason to land in the orange grove, and the farmer probably wouldn't win the lawsuit.\n\nTherefore, the most likely result is that the farmer will not recover, because the rancher was privileged to enter the land under the circumstances. That corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
