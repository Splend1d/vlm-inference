It translates to \"seated meditation\" and is considered the heart of Zen practice. Practitioners sit in a specific posture, often cross-legged, with an upright spine, and focus their attention on their breath or a specific object, thought, or idea, in order to develop mindfulness and achieve a state of mental clarity and tranquility. This practice is essential for understanding one's true nature and realizing enlightenment in Zen Buddhism."
