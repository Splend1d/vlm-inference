Asteroids emit a lot of their own radiation\n\nC. They reflect enough of the sun's light to make them brighter than most background stars\n\nD. Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars\n\nLet me think about this. First, I know that asteroids are small rocky bodies that orbit the sun, mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. They don't produce their own light; they reflect sunlight. So, option B says they emit a lot of their own radiation, but that doesn't sound right because they don't generate their own light; they reflect it.\n\nOption A mentions pulsed radiation. I'm not sure what that means exactly, but I don't think asteroids emit pulses of radiation. Maybe some astronomical objects do, like pulsars, but not asteroids.\n\nOption C says they reflect enough sunlight to appear brighter than most background stars. Hmm, stars emit their own light, and asteroids reflect sunlight. Some stars are very bright, especially closer ones, so I'm not sure if asteroids are generally brighter than background stars. Maybe it depends on the size and reflectivity of the asteroid.\n\nOption D mentions substantial motion relative to background stars. I recall that in astronomical images, stars appear stationary over short periods, but asteroids, moving relatively quickly in their orbits, would show movement over time. This movement could make them stand out in surveys that take multiple images over time.\n\nLet me consider this further. If a survey takes images of the same patch of sky at different times, asteroids would have moved noticeably between exposures, while stars would appear in the same positions. This motion could be used to identify asteroids.\n\nAlso, regarding brightness, some asteroids might be brighter than faint stars, but I don't think that's their primary distinguishing feature in surveys. It's more about their movement.\n\nOption A, pulsed radiation, seems unrelated to asteroids. They don't emit pulses of radiation like some celestial objects do.\n\nOption B, emitting a lot of their own radiation, is incorrect because asteroids reflect sunlight; they don't emit their own.\n\nOption C, being brighter than most background stars, might be true for some asteroids, but I don't think brightness is the key factor in distinguishing them in surveys. Stars can be much brighter, and faint stars can be dimmer than asteroids, so it's not a reliable indicator.\n\nOption D, substantial motion relative to background stars, makes sense because asteroids move due to their orbits, while stars are distant and appear fixed over short timescales.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is D. Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars, which makes them stand out in sky surveys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
