I need to think about which one doesn't fit with the general characteristics often associated with these cultures.\n\nFirst, I know that in many Asian cultures, shame is a significant concept. It's often used to maintain social harmony and to encourage people to behave in ways that are acceptable to the group. So, shame seems like it's pretty characteristic.\n\nNext, self-control is also something that's highly valued in many Asian cultures. There's a emphasis on discipline, hard work, and maintaining composure, especially in difficult situations. So, self-control seems to be another important value.\n\nEgalitarianism is about equality and equal treatment of all people. I'm not sure if this is as strongly emphasized in Asian cultures as the others. In some Asian societies, there's a strong hierarchy and respect for authority, which might contrast with egalitarian principles. So, maybe egalitarianism isn't as characteristic.\n\nThen there's fatalism, which is the belief that events are predetermined and that individual action cannot change the outcome. Some Asian philosophies and religions do incorporate elements of fatalism, so it might be a characteristic value.\n\nComparing all these, it seems like egalitarianism might be the least characteristic of Asians and Asian Americans, given the importance of hierarchy and respect for authority in many Asian cultures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. egalitarianism}} \\]"
