At the beginning of the lease term, the tenant installed numerous appliances in the building as well as a large air-conditioning system. The tenant alone paid for these items; they were installed with the landlord's permission and were used for the tenant's commercial enterprise. At the end of the lease term, the tenant failed to vacate the premises in a timely manner and continued to pay rent while remaining in possession for another four months. Before vacating the building at the end of the fourth month, the tenant removed the appliances and the air-conditioning system that he had installed, causing no damage to the building. Was the removal by the tenant proper?\n\nA. No, because he was a holdover tenant.\nB. No, because the lease was oral.\nC. Yes, because they were accessions.\nD.

Yes, because they were trade fixtures.\n\nIn this scenario, the tenant installed numerous appliances and a large air-conditioning system in the commercial building with the landlord's permission. These items were paid for by the tenant and were used for their commercial enterprise. At the end of the lease term, the tenant continued to pay rent and remained in possession for an additional four months before vacating and removing these items without causing any damage to the building.\n\nThe key legal concept here is that of \"trade fixtures.\" Trade fixtures are personal property items installed by a tenant in a leased commercial property for the purpose of carrying on their trade or business. Unlike other types of improvements or fixtures, trade fixtures are generally removable by the tenant at the end of the lease term, provided that their removal does not damage the premises.\n\nGiven that the tenant in this case removed the appliances and air-conditioning system without causing any damage to the building, their action was proper under the law regarding trade fixtures. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, although the tenant was a holdover tenant (remaining beyond the original lease term), holdover tenants generally retain the same rights as they had during the original lease term, including the right to remove trade fixtures without causing damage.\n\nOption B is irrelevant because the oral nature of the lease does not affect the status of the installed items as trade fixtures. The lease's form (oral or written) does not change the legal treatment of trade fixtures.\n\nOption C is incorrect because \"accessions\" typically refer to items that become part of the real property and are not removable by the tenant. Trade fixtures, on the other hand, remain the personal property of the tenant and are removable under certain conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
