                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** Suppose \\( f : [a, b] \\) is a function and suppose \\( f \\) has a local maximum. \\( f'(x) \\) must exist and equal 0?\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for a function to have a local maximum. A function \\( f \\) has a local maximum at a point \\( c \\) in its domain if there exists some neighborhood around \\( c \\) such that for all \\( x \\) in that neighborhood, \\( f(x) \\leq f(c) \\).\n\nNow, the question is whether the derivative \\( f'(c) \\) must exist and be equal to zero at this point \\( c \\).\n\nI know that for differentiable functions, if \\( f \\) has a local maximum at \\( c \\), then \\( f'(c) = 0 \\). This is one of the critical point conditions in differential calculus.\n\nHowever, the statement doesn't specify that \\( f \\) is differentiable. So, I need to consider the possibility that \\( f \\) might not be differentiable at \\( c \\).\n\nLet me think of an example where \\( f \\) has a local maximum but is not differentiable at that point.\n\nOne classic example is the absolute value function \\( f(x) = |x| \\). At \\( x = 0 \\), it has a local minimum, and the derivative doesn't exist there because the left-hand derivative is -1 and the right-hand derivative is 1.\n\nSimilarly, consider \\( f(x) = -|x| \\). This function has a local maximum at \\( x = 0 \\), but again, the derivative doesn't exist at that point.\n\nSo, in this case, \\( f'(0) \\) does not exist, even though there is a local maximum at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the statement is false because the derivative doesn't have to exist at a point where there is a local maximum.\n\n**Statement 2:** There exist non-constant continuous maps from \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\nThis statement is about the existence of continuous functions from the real numbers \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to the rational numbers \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), specifically non-constant ones.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of continuous functions and the sets involved.\n\n\\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is the set of real numbers, which is uncountable and connected.\n\n\\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is the set of rational numbers, which is countable and totally disconnected.\n\nA continuous function maps connected sets to connected sets. Since \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is connected, the image of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) under a continuous function must be a connected subset of \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\nBut \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is totally disconnected, meaning the only connected subsets of \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) are single points.\n\nTherefore, any continuous function from \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) must be constant.\n\nSo, there do not exist non-constant continuous maps from \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\nThus, statement 2 is false.\n\nPutting it all together, statement 1 is false and statement 2 is false, so the correct choice is D. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
