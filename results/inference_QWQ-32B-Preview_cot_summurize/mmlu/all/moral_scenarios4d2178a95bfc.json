There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I walked by and tossed the eggs I bought at the store, at a car.\n\nScenario 2: I buried her up to her neck on the anthill.\n\nAnd I have options A through D to choose from, indicating whether each scenario is wrong or not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in the US around 2020. Generally, morally wrong actions are those that harm others, violate their rights, or are against societal norms and laws.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: Tossing eggs at a car. Tossing eggs at a car is probably considered vandalism or property damage. It's harming someone else's property without their consent, which is against the law and generally considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: burying someone up to her neck on an anthill. That sounds really harmful and dangerous. It could cause physical harm, discomfort, and maybe even death if the person is left there for too long. This seems like it's intentionally causing harm to another person, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, both scenarios are wrong, so option A seems correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there are any contexts where these actions might be acceptable.\n\nFor Scenario 1: Tossing eggs at a car. Is there any situation where this might be acceptable? Maybe if it's part of a prank among friends, and no real harm is intended or caused. However, even then, property damage is generally not acceptable. So, it's still likely wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2: burying someone up to their neck on an anthill. This sounds extremely dangerous and harmful. It's hard to imagine a context where this would be acceptable. Even as a practical joke, it's way beyond what would be considered acceptable and could lead to serious harm.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
