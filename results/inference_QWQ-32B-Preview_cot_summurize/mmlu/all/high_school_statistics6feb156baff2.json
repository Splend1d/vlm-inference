                    "text": "So I've got this question here about how tripling the sample size affects the confidence interval size. The options are:\n\nA. It triples the interval size.\n\nB. It divides the interval size by 3.\n\nC. It multiplies the interval size by 1.732.\n\nD. It divides the interval size by 1.732.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall how sample size affects confidence intervals. I remember that confidence intervals are related to the standard error of the estimate, and that standard error decreases as the sample size increases. But let's be precise here.\n\nThe formula for a confidence interval for a mean, assuming a large sample size or normal population, is roughly:\n\nsample mean \u00b1 (critical value) * (standard error)\n\nWhere the standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nSo, standard error = \u03c3 / \u221an\n\nWhere \u03c3 is the standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nNow, if we triple the sample size, n becomes 3n. So the new standard error would be:\n\n\u03c3 / \u221a(3n) = \u03c3 / (\u221a3 * \u221an) = (\u03c3 / \u221an) / \u221a3\n\nSo the new standard error is the original standard error divided by the square root of 3.\n\nSince the confidence interval is proportional to the standard error, tripling the sample size should decrease the confidence interval by a factor of \u221a3.\n\nNow, \u221a3 is approximately 1.732.\n\nSo, dividing the interval size by 1.732 makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this logic.\n\nIf standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of n, then increasing n should decrease the standard error, which in turn decreases the confidence interval.\n\nSo, tripling n should divide the interval size by \u221a3, which is about 1.732.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. It divides the interval size by 1.732.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.\n\nSuppose original sample size is n, and new sample size is 3n.\n\nOriginal standard error: \u03c3 / \u221an\n\nNew standard error: \u03c3 / \u221a(3n) = \u03c3 / (\u221a3 * \u221an) = (\u03c3 / \u221an) / \u221a3\n\nSo, new standard error is original standard error divided by \u221a3.\n\nSince the confidence interval is roughly the critical value times the standard error, the interval should also be divided by \u221a3.\n\nWhich is option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider what happens if we multiply the sample size by 3.\n\nIf n increases, the denominator of the standard error increases, making standard error smaller, which in turn makes the confidence interval narrower.\n\nSo, it makes sense that the interval size decreases.\n\nOptions A and C suggest the interval gets larger, which contradicts this logic, so they're probably wrong.\n\nOption B says it divides the interval size by 3, but it's actually divided by \u221a3, which is approximately 1.732, as in option D.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
