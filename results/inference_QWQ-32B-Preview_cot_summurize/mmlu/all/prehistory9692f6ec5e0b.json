                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the Incan empire. It's asking about the required labor service that people had to perform for the king in exchange for using the empire's property. The options are A. Khipu, B. Mit'a, C. Split inheritance, and D. Capacocha.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about the Incan society and their systems. The Incas were known for their sophisticated administrative systems, and they managed their empire through a combination of taxation and labor contributions from their subjects.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is Khipu. I remember that Khipu was a system of knotted strings used by the Incas for record-keeping and communication. It's like a kind of ancient data storage device, but it doesn't relate to labor service. So, probably not the answer.\n\nOption B is Mit'a. I think Mit'a was a form of mandatory public service or labor that the Inca subjects were required to perform for the state. It could involve working on public projects like road building, agriculture, or serving in the military. This sounds a lot like what the question is asking for\u2014a required labor service in exchange for using the empire's property.\n\nOption C is Split inheritance. I'm not sure what this refers to in the context of the Incan empire. Maybe it's related to how wealth or land was passed down within families, but it doesn't seem directly related to labor service owed to the king.\n\nOption D is Capacocha. I believe Capacocha was a religious ritual in Incan culture, possibly involving human sacrifice, where children were chosen to represent deities and were then sacrificed. This doesn't relate to labor service, so it's likely not the answer.\n\nBased on this, it seems like Mit'a is the most appropriate answer. It was a system of required labor that supported the Inca state and its projects, and it was a key part of the empire's economic and social structure.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check what \"property owned by the Incan empire\" means here. The Incas had a system where land was divided into three parts: one for the emperor, one for the state (which supported religious and administrative functions), and one for the people. The people worked on the emperor's and state's lands as a form of tax and service.\n\nSo, the Mit'a system would fit into this framework, as it was the way the state mobilized labor for its needs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a specific term for the labor required in exchange for using the empire's property, but Mit'a seems to be the broad term for mandatory labor service in the Incan empire.\n\nI don't recall any specific subsystem within Mit'a that pertains only to using the empire's property, so I think Mit'a is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if Khipu could be involved in some way. Since Khipu was used for record-keeping, it might have been used to track labor contributions, but the labor itself was Mit'a. So, Khipu is more of an administrative tool rather than the labor service itself.\n\nSplit inheritance doesn't seem relevant here, as it doesn't relate to labor service.\n\nCapacocha is a religious practice, unrelated to labor services.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Mit'a.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
