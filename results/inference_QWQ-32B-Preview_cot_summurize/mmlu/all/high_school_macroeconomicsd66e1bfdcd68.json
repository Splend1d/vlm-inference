                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for real GDP per capita to double given a constant growth rate of 10 percent per year. This is a classic problem involving exponential growth, and we can use the Rule of 70 to estimate the doubling time.\n\nThe Rule of 70 is a simple formula that allows us to calculate the approximate number of years required for a quantity growing at a constant annual rate to double. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Doubling time} = \\frac{70}{\\text{growth rate} (\\%)}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the growth rate is 10 percent per year. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Doubling time} = \\frac{70}{10} = 7 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nSo, according to the Rule of 70, it would take approximately 7 years for real GDP per capita to double at a 10 percent annual growth rate.\n\nHowever, to ensure the accuracy of this approximation, let's verify it using the actual formula for exponential growth. The formula for the future value of a quantity growing exponentially is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Future value} = \\text{present value} \\times (1 + \\text{growth rate})^{\\text{number of periods}}\n\\]\n\nWe want to find the number of years (\\(n\\)) it takes for the real GDP per capita to double, meaning that the future value is twice the present value. So, we can set up the equation as:\n\n\\[\n2 = (1 + 0.10)^n\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(n\\), we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\ln(2) = \\ln((1 + 0.10)^n)\n\\]\n\nUsing the logarithmic identity \\(\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\ln(2) = n \\ln(1.10)\n\\]\n\nNow, solving for \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(1.10)}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the natural logarithms:\n\n\\[\n\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\ln(1.10) \\approx 0.095310\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nn \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.095310} \\approx 7.27 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nThis calculation shows that the exact doubling time is approximately 7.27 years, which is very close to the approximation of 7 years obtained using the Rule of 70.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 10 years.\n\nB. 9 years.\n\nC. 8 years.\n\nD. 7 years.\n\nThe closest answer to our calculation is D. 7 years.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Rule of 70 is a useful approximation for growth rates between 4% and 15%. For growth rates outside this range, the rule may not be as accurate. However, for a 10% growth rate, it provides a sufficiently precise estimate.\n\nIn conclusion, if real GDP per capita grows at a rate of 10 percent a year, we can expect the standard of living to double in approximately 7 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
