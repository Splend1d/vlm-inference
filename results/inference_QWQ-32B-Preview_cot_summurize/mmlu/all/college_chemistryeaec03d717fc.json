                    "text": "To determine which normal modes of a carbon dioxide molecule are infrared-active, we need to consider the selection rules for infrared spectroscopy. Infrared spectroscopy involves transitions between vibrational energy levels, and a vibrational mode is infrared-active if it results in a change in the molecular dipole moment.\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is a linear molecule with the structure O=C=O. It has three normal modes of vibration: symmetric stretching, asymmetric stretching, and bending.\n\n1. **Symmetric Stretching**: In this mode, both oxygen atoms move away from or towards the carbon atom simultaneously, keeping the molecule symmetric. This mode does not result in a change in the molecular dipole moment because the molecule remains symmetric, and thus, the positive and negative charges remain balanced. Therefore, symmetric stretching is **not** infrared-active.\n\n2. **Asymmetric Stretching**: In this mode, one oxygen atom moves away from the carbon atom while the other moves towards it. This asymmetry causes a change in the molecular dipole moment, making this mode **infrared-active**.\n\n3. **Bending**: In the bending mode, the oxygen atoms move perpendicular to the molecular axis, causing the molecule to bend. This also results in a change in the molecular dipole moment, making this mode **infrared-active**.\n\nTherefore, the infrared-active normal modes of a carbon dioxide molecule are bending and asymmetric stretching.\n\nThe correct answer is D. I and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
