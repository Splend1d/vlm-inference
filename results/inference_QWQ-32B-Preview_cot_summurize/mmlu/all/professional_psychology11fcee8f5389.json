The cervical spine consists of the first seven vertebrae (C1-C7) in the neck area. Injuries at this level can affect the nerves that control the arms, legs, and sometimes even the breathing muscles, leading to paralysis in all four limbs, which is known as quadriplegia.\n\n- **Lumbar:** The lumbar spine includes the lower back (L1-L5). Injuries here typically affect the lower body, leading to paraplegia.\n\n- **Sacral:** The sacral spine includes the sacrum, which is the base of the spine. Injuries here can affect the hips and lower legs but generally do not lead to quadriplegia.\n\n- **Thoracic:** The thoracic spine includes the mid-back (T1-T12). Injuries here can lead to paralysis of the lower body (paraplegia) but not quadriplegia, as the arms are usually unaffected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. cervical."
