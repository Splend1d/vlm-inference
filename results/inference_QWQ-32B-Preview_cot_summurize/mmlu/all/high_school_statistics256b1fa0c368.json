                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, Semir rolls a six-sided die every morning to decide what to have for breakfast. Depending on what he rolls, he either has a big breakfast or a lighter one, and each type of breakfast affects his chances of being late for school. We need to find out the probability that he's on time on any given day.\n\nFirst, let's understand the breakfast choices based on the die roll:\n\n- If he rolls a 1 or 2, he has a big breakfast.\n\n- If he rolls a 3, 4, 5, or 6, he has a lighter breakfast.\n\nSince it's a six-sided die, each side has a probability of 1/6.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 1 or 2 (big breakfast) is 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of rolling a 3 or higher (lighter breakfast) is 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\nNext, we need to consider the probabilities of being late for school based on the type of breakfast:\n\n- If he has a big breakfast, there's a 15% chance he's late.\n\n- If he has a lighter breakfast, there's a 6% chance he's late.\n\nWe can express these percentages as decimals for easier calculation:\n\n- 15% = 0.15\n\n- 6% = 0.06\n\nNow, we need to find the overall probability that Semir is on time for school. To do this, it might be easier to first find the probability that he is late and then subtract that from 1, since the probabilities of being on time and being late must add up to 1.\n\nSo, the probability of being late (P(Late)) is the sum of the probabilities of being late given each type of breakfast, weighted by the probability of having that type of breakfast.\n\nIn formula terms:\n\nP(Late) = P(Big Breakfast) * P(Late | Big Breakfast) + P(Lighter Breakfast) * P(Late | Lighter Breakfast)\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nP(Late) = (1/3) * 0.15 + (2/3) * 0.06\n\nLet's calculate each part:\n\n(1/3) * 0.15 = 0.05\n\n(2/3) * 0.06 = 0.04\n\nAdding them up:\n\nP(Late) = 0.05 + 0.04 = 0.09\n\nTherefore, the probability that Semir is on time is:\n\nP(On Time) = 1 - P(Late) = 1 - 0.09 = 0.91\n\nSo, the probability that Semir will be on time for school on any given day is 0.91, which corresponds to option D.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. The options provided are:\n\nA. 0.09\n\nB. 0.21\n\nC. 0.8\n\nD. 0.91\n\nOur calculation gives us 0.91, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet's go through it again.\n\nFirst, probabilities of breakfast types:\n\nP(Big Breakfast) = 2/6 = 1/3 \u2248 0.3333\n\nP(Lighter Breakfast) = 4/6 = 2/3 \u2248 0.6667\n\nThen, conditional probabilities of being late:\n\nP(Late | Big Breakfast) = 0.15\n\nP(Late | Lighter Breakfast) = 0.06\n\nSo, P(Late) = (1/3)*0.15 + (2/3)*0.06 = 0.05 + 0.04 = 0.09\n\nTherefore, P(On Time) = 1 - 0.09 = 0.91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it in terms of the law of total probability, which is essentially what we did.\n\nAnother way to approach it is to calculate the probability of being on time directly:\n\nP(On Time) = P(Big Breakfast) * P(On Time | Big Breakfast) + P(Lighter Breakfast) * P(On Time | Lighter Breakfast)\n\nWe know that:\n\nP(On Time | Big Breakfast) = 1 - P(Late | Big Breakfast) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85\n\nP(On Time | Lighter Breakfast) = 1 - P(Late | Lighter Breakfast) = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94\n\nSo,\n\nP(On Time) = (1/3)*0.85 + (2/3)*0.94\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n(1/3)*0.85 \u2248 0.2833\n\n(2/3)*0.94 \u2248 0.6267\n\nAdding them up:\n\n0.2833 + 0.6267 = 0.91\n\nAgain, we get 0.91, which confirms our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 0.91.\n\nIt's interesting to see that even though there are chances of being late with both types of breakfast, the overall probability of being on time is quite high, mainly because the probability of having a lighter breakfast is higher, and the probability of being late with a lighter breakfast is lower.\n\nThis problem is a good example of how to use conditional probabilities and the law of total probability to find the overall probability of an event.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.91} \\]"
