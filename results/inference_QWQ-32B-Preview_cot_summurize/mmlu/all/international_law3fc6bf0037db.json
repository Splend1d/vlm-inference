                    "text": "I'm trying to understand the rationale behind the exhaustion of local remedies in international human rights law. There are four options here, and I need to figure out which one best explains why this rule exists.\n\nOption A says that the local remedies rule aims to free up international tribunals to deal with the most serious cases. That makes sense because if people have to try their cases in local courts first, only the cases that aren't resolved there will go to international tribunals. So, it filters out less serious or already resolved cases, allowing international courts to focus on the most important ones.\n\nOption B suggests that the rule aims to dissuade applicants from abusing the system by filing unnecessary petitions. That also seems plausible. If people know they have to go through their own country's courts first, they might think twice before filing a case internationally without good reason.\n\nOption C combines elements of A and B. It says the rule restricts the volume of petitions to international tribunals while building up the capacity of local courts. This seems comprehensive because not only does it control the number of cases going international, but it also encourages the development of national judicial systems, which is a good thing for the rule of law in those countries.\n\nOption D states that the local remedies rule helps demonstrate that national courts are always better placed than international ones to deal with cases. Hmm, this seems a bit absolute. Saying \"always better placed\" might not be accurate because there are cases where international tribunals have a clearer perspective or more impartial judges. So, this option might not be the best explanation.\n\nConsidering all these, option C seems the most balanced and inclusive. It acknowledges the need to manage the workload of international tribunals while also promoting the strengthening of national judicial systems. This dual purpose likely reflects the true rationale behind the exhaustion of local remedies rule in international human rights law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
