                    "text": "So I've got this question about Verity Co.'s investments and I need to figure out how much they should report as net cash used in investing activities. Let me see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, Verity bought $200,000 worth of Otra Co. bonds at par. Par means they paid the face value, right? And these are classified as available-for-sale securities. Then, they also bought $50,000 of U.S. Treasury bills, which are classified as cash equivalents.\n\nNow, I need to understand what goes into investing activities in the cash flow statement. Investing activities typically include things like buying and selling long-term assets, investments in other companies, and purchases of investments like bonds and stocks.\n\nAvailable-for-sale securities are usually considered investments in securities that are not intended to be held to maturity, but they're not trading securities either. So, I think purchasing these Otra Co. bonds would be considered an investing activity.\n\nOn the other hand, cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Treasury bills are typically considered cash equivalents because they mature within a short period, usually less than three months.\n\nSo, in the cash flow statement, cash equivalents are generally included in the cash and cash equivalents line, not in investing activities.\n\nTherefore, the $50,000 spent on Treasury bills should not be reported as an investing activity, but rather as an increase in cash equivalents.\n\nThat leaves the $200,000 spent on Otra Co. bonds. Since these are available-for-sale securities, their purchase would be classified as an investing activity.\n\nSo, the net cash used in investing activities should be $200,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any other consideration here? Maybe the classification of securities affects how they're reported in the cash flow statement.\n\nI recall that in the cash flow statement, investments in securities are typically reported under investing activities, unless they are considered cash equivalents, in which case they are reported in the operating activities section or directly in the cash and cash equivalents balance.\n\nGiven that, the $50,000 for Treasury bills should not be reported in investing activities, but the $200,000 for Otra Co. bonds should be.\n\nSo, the net cash used in investing activities should be $200,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $0\n\nB. $150,000\n\nC. $200,000\n\nD. $250,000\n\nIt seems like C. $200,000 is the correct answer.\n\nBut why is there an option for $150,000? Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there's a difference in how these securities are classified or some other factor.\n\nLet me think again. If the Treasury bills are cash equivalents, and they were purchased, would that affect the cash flow from operating activities?\n\nActually, cash equivalents are included in the cash and cash equivalents line in the statement of cash flows. So, any purchase or sale of cash equivalents would be reflected in the net change in cash, but not specifically in investing activities.\n\nTherefore, only the purchase of Otra Co. bonds, classified as available-for-sale securities, should be reported in investing activities.\n\nSo, yes, $200,000 is the amount of cash used in investing activities.\n\nI don't see any other transactions mentioned that would affect investing activities, so I think C. $200,000 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\nc. $200,000"
