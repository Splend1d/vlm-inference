                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of these is a government agency established to protect investors? A. AAA, B. NBA, C. SEC, D. MADD.\" Hmm, let's see what each of these stands for and what they do.\n\nFirst up, AAA. I know AAA stands for the American Automobile Association. They're like a membership organization that helps with things related to cars, like roadside assistance, insurance, and travel services. So, they don't really deal with investing or investor protection. That probably rules out option A.\n\nNext, NBA. That's the National Basketball Association. It's a professional basketball league in the U.S. and Canada. Obviously, that's not a government agency involved in investor protection. So, B is not the answer.\n\nNow, SEC. SEC stands for the Securities and Exchange Commission. From what I recall, the SEC is a government agency that oversees the securities markets and works to protect investors from fraud and market manipulation. That sounds pretty relevant to the question. I think C might be the correct answer.\n\nLastly, MADD. MADD is Mothers Against Drunk Driving. They're a nonprofit organization focused on preventing drunk driving and helping victims of drunk driving crashes. Again, not related to investor protection.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the SEC is the government agency established to protect investors. Therefore, the answer should be C. SEC.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me make sure I don't confuse SEC with any other agencies. For example, there's also the FDA, which deals with food and drug safety, or the FCC, which regulates communications. Neither of those is related to investor protection.\n\nAlternatively, there's the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, which works to protect consumers from fraud and deception in trading and marketing. While similar in that they protect consumers, their focus is broader and not specifically on investors.\n\nSo, yeah, SEC seems to be the correct answer here. It's a federal government agency created specifically to oversee the securities markets and protect investors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
