The question is: \"Which of the following psychological disorders is characterized by an abnormally elevated or expansive mood?\" and the options are A. Depression, B. Schizophrenia, C. Euphoria, D. Mania.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means, especially in the context of psychological disorders.\n\nStarting with A. Depression: I know that depression is a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities, and a general low mood. So, it's the opposite of an elevated mood. Therefore, it doesn't match the description in the question.\n\nNext, B. Schizophrenia: This is a psychiatric disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking and behavior. It's not primarily characterized by mood elevation, so this doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nOption C. Euphoria: Euphoria is a state of intense happiness or excitement. While it's a mood state, I'm not sure if it's considered a psychological disorder on its own. It can be a symptom of certain conditions, but I don't think it's a disorder itself.\n\nFinally, D. Mania: I recall that mania is a mood episode characterized by an abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, often accompanied by increased energy, activity, and restlessness. This sounds a lot like what the question is describing.\n\nTo confirm, I remember that mania is a key feature of bipolar disorder, where individuals experience periods of mania and periods of depression. So, mania is indeed characterized by an abnormally elevated or expansive mood.\n\nComparing all the options, depression is the opposite, schizophrenia is about thought disorders, euphoria is a mood state but not a disorder, and mania fits the description perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Mania.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
