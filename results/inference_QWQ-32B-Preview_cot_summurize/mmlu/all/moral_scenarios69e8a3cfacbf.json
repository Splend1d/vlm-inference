                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I watched from outside while she took her shower.\"\n\nOkay, so this seems pretty straightforward. Watching someone shower without their consent is generally considered invasion of privacy and is morally wrong. It's voyeurism, which is not acceptable in ordinary moral standards. So, I would say this is wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I explained to her her house was on fire, despite the fact that I couldn't stand her drama.\"\n\nHmm, this one is a bit more complex. So, the main character is telling someone that their house is on fire, but it's unclear whether the house is actually on fire or not. The phrase \"despite the fact that I couldn't stand her drama\" suggests that the main character maybe didn't like the person's dramatic behavior and perhaps lied to her about the fire to avoid dealing with her drama.\n\nIf the house is actually on fire, then telling her that would be responsible and not wrong. However, if the house is not on fire and the main character is lying to her, that would be deceptive and could be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, the scenario doesn't specify whether the house is actually on fire or not. It just says \"her house was on fire,\" but the \"despite\" clause makes it seem like the main character is acting against their dislike for her drama, which might imply that they're telling the truth about the fire despite their feelings.\n\nAlternatively, it could be interpreted that the main character is lying about the fire to get rid of her because they can't stand her drama.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I need to consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, if the house is actually on fire, then telling her is the right thing to do, and it's not morally wrong, even if the motive is to avoid her drama.\n\nSecond, if the house is not on fire and the main character is lying to her, that would be deceptive and morally wrong.\n\nBut the scenario says \"her house was on fire,\" which seems to indicate that the house is actually on fire, and the main character is telling her that, despite not liking her drama.\n\nIn that case, telling her the truth about the fire is the right thing to do, and it's not morally wrong, even if the motive isn't entirely altruistic.\n\nAlternatively, if the house isn't on fire and the main character is lying, that would be wrong.\n\nBut based on the wording, it seems like the house is on fire, and the main character is informing her of that fact despite their feelings about her drama.\n\nTherefore, I would say that Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nScenario 1: Wrong\n\nScenario 2: Not wrong\n\nThat corresponds to option B.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret Scenario 2?\n\nSuppose the main character is lying about the fire to get rid of her. In that case, it would be deceptive and harmful, which would be morally wrong.\n\nHowever, based on the wording, \"explained to her her house was on fire,\" it seems like the main character is telling her that her house is on fire, implying that it actually is on fire.\n\nAdditionally, the \"despite the fact that I couldn't stand her drama\" suggests that the main character is doing the right thing despite their personal feelings.\n\nTherefore, it's more likely that Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.\n\nHence, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
