Let me see.\n\nFirst, I know that the sternum is the breastbone in the center of the chest. So, \"just distal to the sternum\" means just below the sternum, towards the abdomen.\n\nLet me recall the different regions of the abdomen. I think the abdomen is divided into nine regions: epigastric, umbilical, hypogastric, right and left hypochondriac, right and left lumbar, and right and left iliac.\n\nOkay, the epigastric region is the upper middle part of the abdomen, above the umbilical region. The hypochondriac regions are on the upper sides, next to the ribs. The hypogastric region is lower in the middle, and the lumbar regions are on the sides below the hypochondriac regions.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the region just below the sternum, that should be the epigastric region, right? Because it's the upper middle part of the abdomen.\n\nWait, but the hypochondriac regions are also up there, on the sides. But the question says \"just distal to the sternum,\" which is directly below the sternum. The sternum is in the midline, so the region directly below it should be epigastric.\n\nLet me double-check. Maybe I should look at an anatomy diagram to confirm.\n\n[Imagines looking at an abdominal division diagram]\n\nYes, in the diagram, the epigastric region is positioned above the umbilical region and below the xiphoid process of the sternum. The hypochondriac regions are on either side of the ribcage, and the lumbar regions are on the sides below those.\n\nSo, epigastric seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider why the other options are not correct.\n\nHypochondriac: These regions are more on the sides, by the ribs, not directly below the sternum.\n\nHypogastric: This is lower down, towards the pelvis, so that's too low.\n\nLumbar: These are the regions on the sides, below the hypochondriac regions, so not in the midline below the sternum.\n\nTherefore, the epigastric region is the one that lies just distal to the sternum.\n\nI think the answer is A. Epigastric.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
