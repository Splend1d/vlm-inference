Patients admitted to hospital.\" I need to figure out who the intended audience is for this guide.\n\nFirst, I should think about what the NHS is. NHS stands for National Health Service, which is the publicly funded healthcare system in the UK. It provides medical services to all UK residents, regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nNow, considering that, a guide to the NHS would likely be aimed at people who use the services, which would be the general public. So, option C seems plausible.\n\nBut let's consider the other options. Option A is GPs, which are General Practitioners, the primary care doctors. Maybe the guide is for them to better understand the NHS system. But wouldn't they already know about it since they work within it?\n\nOption B is patient lobby groups. These are groups that advocate for patients' rights and interests. Maybe the guide is for them to understand the NHS better so they can advocate more effectively. That could be a possibility.\n\nOption D is patients admitted to hospital. So, perhaps it's for people who are already in the hospital to understand what's going on.\n\nBut thinking about it, if it's called \"Your guide to the NHS,\" it seems like it's meant for anyone who might need to use the NHS, which would be the general public. It's likely an introductory guide to help people understand how the NHS works, what services are available, how to access them, and perhaps their rights as patients.\n\nGPs, being medical professionals, probably don't need a guide to understand the NHS, as they are already deeply involved in it. Patient lobby groups might have their own more detailed resources. And patients already in hospital might have been given information once they're admitted.\n\nTherefore, the most logical audience would be the general public, who need to know how to navigate the NHS system.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. The general public.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
