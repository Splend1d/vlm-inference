Then, he goes around telling everyone that the sky is falling, and some of the other characters believe him and join him on his journey to tell the king.\n\nI don't think it's B. Curious George because he's just a curious monkey who gets into lots of adventures, but I don't remember him believing the sky is falling.\n\nC. Jack Sprat is from the nursery rhyme where \"Jack Sprat could eat no fat. His wife could eat no lean. And so betwixt them both, they licked the platter clean.\" That doesn't have anything to do with the sky falling.\n\nAnd D. Tom Thumb is the little tiny guy, the smallest person in the land, but again, I don't recall him believing the sky is falling.\n\nSo, I'm pretty sure it's A. Chicken Little.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
