                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about disease testing, and I need to find the posterior probability that someone has the disease given that they tested positive. The disease has an incidence of 5 cases per 100 people, so P(D) = 0.05. The test is pretty accurate: if you have the disease, there's a 99% chance you'll test positive, and if you don't have the disease, there's a 97% chance you'll test negative.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand all the probabilities involved here. Let's define the variables clearly:\n\n- D: the patient has disease D (Boolean: true or false)\n\n- TP: the patient tests positive for disease D (Boolean: true or false)\n\nGiven:\n\n- P(D) = 0.05\n\n- P(TP | D) = 0.99 (probability of testing positive given that you have the disease)\n\n- P(not TP | not D) = 0.97 (probability of testing negative given that you don't have the disease)\n\nI need to find P(D | TP), which is the probability that the patient has the disease given that they tested positive.\n\nThis sounds like a job for Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events and is particularly useful in situations like this where we want to update our beliefs based on new evidence.\n\nBayes' theorem states:\n\nP(D | TP) = [P(TP | D) * P(D)] / P(TP)\n\nI already know P(TP | D) and P(D), but I need to find P(TP), the total probability of testing positive. To find P(TP), I can use the law of total probability, which in this case means considering both the cases where the patient has the disease and where they don't.\n\nSo,\n\nP(TP) = P(TP | D) * P(D) + P(TP | not D) * P(not D)\n\nI know P(TP | D) = 0.99 and P(D) = 0.05. I also know P(not TP | not D) = 0.97, but I need P(TP | not D). Since P(not TP | not D) is the probability of testing negative given no disease, P(TP | not D) should be the probability of testing positive given no disease, which is 1 - P(not TP | not D).\n\nSo,\n\nP(TP | not D) = 1 - P(not TP | not D) = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03\n\nAnd P(not D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\n\nNow I can calculate P(TP):\n\nP(TP) = (0.99 * 0.05) + (0.03 * 0.95) = (0.0495) + (0.0285) = 0.078\n\nNow, plugging back into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(D | TP) = (0.99 * 0.05) / 0.078 = 0.0495 / 0.078 \u2248 0.6346\n\nRounding to three decimal places, that's approximately 0.635.\n\nSo, the posterior probability that you have disease D given that the test is positive is about 0.635, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, P(TP) calculation:\n\nP(TP | D) * P(D) = 0.99 * 0.05 = 0.0495\n\nP(TP | not D) * P(not D) = 0.03 * 0.95 = 0.0285\n\nAdding them up: 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, P(D | TP) = 0.0495 / 0.078\n\nLet me do that division again: 0.0495 divided by 0.078.\n\n0.0495 \u00f7 0.078 = 0.634615... which is approximately 0.635.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 0.635.\n\nIt's interesting that even with a pretty accurate test, the posterior probability isn't 99%. This is because the disease is relatively rare, so there are more false positives than one might initially think.\n\nThis is a classic example of Bayes' theorem in action, showing how prior probabilities affect posterior probabilities even with accurate tests.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
