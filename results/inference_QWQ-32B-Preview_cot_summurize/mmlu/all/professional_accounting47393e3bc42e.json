                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got Dean Co. that issued bonds at a premium on July 1, year 7, with a maturity date of July 1, year 12. They were supposed to use the effective interest method to amortize the premium, but they mistakenly used the straight-line method instead. Now, we need to figure out how this error affected two things at June 30, year 12: the bond carrying amount and retained earnings.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what's going on here. When a company issues bonds at a premium, it means that investors are paying more than the face value of the bonds. This premium needs to be amortized over the life of the bond, which means it's gradually written off against interest expense.\n\nThe two methods mentioned are the straight-line method and the effective interest method. The straight-line method is simpler; it amortizes the premium equally over the life of the bond. On the other hand, the effective interest method is more complex; it amortizes the premium in a way that results in a constant effective interest rate over the life of the bond.\n\nNow, the problem is that Dean Co. used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method. We need to see how this affects the bond carrying amount and retained earnings at the end of the bond's life, which is June 30, year 12.\n\nLet's start with the bond carrying amount.\n\n**Bond Carrying Amount:**\n\nAt the maturity date, the carrying amount of the bond should be equal to its face value because all the premium has been amortized away. If Dean Co. used the correct method, the carrying amount would be face value.\n\nBut since they used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method, there might be a difference in the amortization amounts each period, leading to a possible misstatement in the carrying amount at maturity.\n\nHowever, at the maturity date, regardless of the method used, the carrying amount should still be equal to the face value because all premiums should have been fully amortized by that point. So, even if they used the wrong method, by the end of the bond's life, the carrying amount should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the bond carrying amount should not be affected by the error at June 30, year 12.\n\n**Retained Earnings:**\n\nNow, let's look at retained earnings. Retained earnings are affected by net income, which in turn is affected by interest expense. The way the premium is amortized affects the interest expense recognized each period.\n\nUnder the straight-line method, the amortization of the premium is constant each period, which means that interest expense is also constant each period.\n\nUnder the effective interest method, the amortization of the premium decreases each period, which means that interest expense increases each period.\n\nSo, if Dean Co. used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method, their interest expense each period would have been lower than it should have been, because they were amortizing more premium (since straight-line amortization is higher in the early periods compared to effective interest method).\n\nThis means that over the life of the bond, the total interest expense recognized would be lower than it should have been, leading to higher net income and, consequently, higher retained earnings.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that at the maturity date, all premiums should have been amortized away, so any difference in amortization methods should have been caught by then.\n\nBut in reality, the total interest expense over the life of the bond should be the same regardless of the method used; only the allocation of expense over time differs. Therefore, at the end of the bond's life, retained earnings should not be affected by the choice of amortization method.\n\nWait a minute, but in practice, due to the difference in methods, there might be a slight difference in the total interest expense recognized, leading to a difference in retained earnings.\n\nLet me think about this again.\n\nThe effective interest method is the required method under GAAP because it provides a constant effective interest rate over the life of the bond. The straight-line method is an approximation and is only acceptable if the results are not materially different from the effective interest method.\n\nIf Dean Co. used the straight-line method and it led to a material difference in interest expense, then their financial statements would be misstated.\n\nIn this case, since they used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method, it's possible that the interest expense was incorrectly stated each period, leading to an incorrect retained earnings balance.\n\nBut at the maturity date, when the bond is retired, any remaining premium should be amortized fully, adjusting the carrying amount to face value. This should theoretically correct any accumulated error in retained earnings.\n\nHowever, in practice, if the straight-line method was used throughout and not corrected at maturity, there might still be an error in retained earnings.\n\nTo get a better understanding, perhaps we can look at an example.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the following:\n\n- Face value of bonds: $100,000\n\n- Premium: $10,000\n\n- Term: 5 years\n\n- Straight-line amortization: $10,000 / 5 years = $2,000 per year\n\n- Effective interest method: Amortization increases each year\n\nAt the end of 5 years, total amortization should be $10,000 in both methods.\n\nBut the interest expense each year would differ:\n\n- Straight-line: Interest expense = cash interest payment - amortization of premium\n\n- Effective interest: Interest expense = carrying amount * effective interest rate\n\nAssuming a constant cash interest payment, the interest expense under straight-line would be lower each year because more premium is being amortized compared to the effective interest method.\n\nTherefore, over the life of the bond, the total interest expense would be the same, but the pattern would differ.\n\nAt maturity, the carrying amount should be face value in both methods.\n\nTherefore, at June 30, year 12, the bond carrying amount should be correct, i.e., equal to face value.\n\nAs for retained earnings, since the total interest expense over the life of the bond should be the same, retained earnings should also not be affected by the choice of amortization method.\n\nHowever, if there was an error in the amortization method that led to incorrect interest expense in prior periods, and it was not corrected, then retained earnings would be misstated.\n\nBut according to GAAP, companies are required to use the effective interest method for amortizing bond premiums and discounts.\n\nTherefore, by using the straight-line method, Dean Co. has been reporting incorrect interest expense in their income statements over the years, leading to incorrect retained earnings.\n\nAt the maturity date, when the bond is retired, any accumulated error should be corrected.\n\nBut the question is asking about the effect of the error at June 30, year 12.\n\nGiven that the bonds mature on July 1, year 12, and the financial statements are as of June 30, year 12, which is just before maturity.\n\nIf Dean Co. has been using the straight-line method, their interest expense in each of the preceding years would have been lower than it should have been under the effective interest method, leading to higher retained earnings.\n\nAt maturity, when the bond is retired, any remaining premium should be amortized, which would adjust the carrying amount to face value.\n\nHowever, if the straight-line method was used throughout, and it led to less total amortization over the life of the bond, then at maturity, there might be an adjustment to amortize the remaining premium, which would decrease retained earnings.\n\nBut theoretically, the total amortization over the life of the bond should be the same in both methods, so retained earnings should not be affected.\n\nI think the key here is to understand that although the methods differ in the pattern of amortization, the total amortization over the life of the bond should be the same.\n\nTherefore, at the maturity date, the bond carrying amount should be correctly stated as face value, and retained earnings should not be affected by the choice of amortization method.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. No effect No effect.\n\nBut let's check the options again:\n\nA. Overstated Understated\n\nB. Understated Overstated\n\nC. Overstated No effect\n\nD. No effect No effect\n\nGiven my analysis, D seems correct.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider that if Dean Co. has been using the straight-line method, which is less accurate, their interest expense has been misstated in each period, leading to misstated retained earnings.\n\nAt the maturity date, when they retire the bond, they might need to make an adjusting entry to correct any accumulated error.\n\nIf they have been amortizing more premium using the straight-line method, their interest expense would have been lower, leading to higher retained earnings.\n\nAt maturity, they might need to amortize less premium to adjust to the correct carrying amount, which would increase interest expense and decrease retained earnings.\n\nAlternatively, if they have been amortizing less premium using the straight-line method, the opposite would be true.\n\nBut this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to recall that under the straight-line method, the amortization of premium is constant, while under the effective interest method, it increases over time.\n\nTherefore, in the early years, the straight-line method would amortize more premium, leading to lower interest expense and higher retained earnings.\n\nIn the later years, the straight-line method would still amortize the same amount, while the effective interest method would be amortizing more premium, leading to higher interest expense.\n\nAt maturity, the total amortization should be equal, but the pattern differs.\n\nTherefore, if Dean Co. used the straight-line method, their retained earnings would have been higher in the early years and lower in the later years compared to using the effective interest method.\n\nAt the maturity date, after all adjustments, retained earnings should be correctly stated.\n\nTherefore, at June 30, year 12, retained earnings should not be affected by the choice of amortization method.\n\nSimilarly, the bond carrying amount should be correctly stated as face value.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. No effect No effect.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions that the bonds were issued on July 1, year 7, and mature on July 1, year 12.\n\nSo, the maturity date is July 1, year 12, and the financial statements are as of June 30, year 12, which is just before maturity.\n\nTherefore, at June 30, year 12, the bond has not yet matured, and there might still be a carrying amount that includes a small portion of unamortized premium.\n\nIf Dean Co. used the straight-line method, their amortization might be slightly off compared to the effective interest method.\n\nHowever, given that the bonds mature soon after, any remaining unamortized premium would be amortized in the final interest period.\n\nTherefore, at June 30, year 12, the bond carrying amount might be slightly overstated if the straight-line method resulted in less amortization in the final period.\n\nSimilarly, retained earnings might be slightly understated because the final interest expense might be higher than it should have been under the effective interest method.\n\nBut this is getting too nuanced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps at June 30, year 12, the bond carrying amount is correctly stated because the final amortization entry will be made in the period ending June 30, year 12, to adjust the carrying amount to face value.\n\nTherefore, there should be no effect on the bond carrying amount or retained earnings.\n\nI think the safest answer is D. No effect No effect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nd. No effect No effect"
