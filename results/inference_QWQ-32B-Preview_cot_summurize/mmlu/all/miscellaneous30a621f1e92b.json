The company started by selling books online, which was a revolutionary concept at the time since the internet was still in its early stages of development for e-commerce. Bezos chose books because they were a high-demand product with a vast selection, making it easier to compete with traditional brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nOver time, Amazon expanded its product offerings beyond books to include a wide variety of items such as compact discs (music), electronics, clothing, and even groceries. The company's growth was rapid, and it quickly became one of the largest online retailers in the world. Today, Amazon not only sells physical products but also offers various services like cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS), digital streaming with Amazon Prime, and more.\n\nHowever, despite its vast expansion into different sectors, Amazon's roots are firmly planted in the book-selling business, which remains an important part of their operations. The company has also made significant investments in digital publishing and e-books, further solidifying its position in the literary world.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, when Amazon.com first appeared on the Internet, it sold only books.\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u662fA.
