                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to understand what's being asked. We have a reaction where ethane (C2H4) reacts with oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). We're given 84 grams of ethane and unlimited oxygen, and we need to find out how many grams of carbon dioxide will be produced.\n\nBut wait a minute, the chemical formula for ethane is C2H6, not C2H4. Ethane has six hydrogen atoms, not four. So, the correct balanced equation should be:\n\nC2H6 + O2 \u2192 CO2 + H2O\n\nHmm, but the problem says C2H4 + O2 \u2192 CO2 + H2O. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps it's a different compound. C2H4 is actually ethene, not ethane. Let me check the question again.\n\n\"Using this formula, if a reaction was provided with 84g of ethane and unlimited oxygen, how many grams of carbon dioxide would result...\"\n\nAh, the problem mentions ethane, but the formula is for C2H4, which is ethene. This is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Ethane is C2H6, and ethene is C2H4.\n\nLet me assume that it's a typo and proceed with C2H6 (ethane). If it's ethane, the balanced equation should be:\n\nC2H6 + O2 \u2192 CO2 + H2O\n\nBut I need to balance this equation first.\n\nStarting with C2H6, I have 2 carbon atoms, which should each end up in CO2, so 2 CO2 molecules. I have 6 hydrogen atoms, which should form 3 H2O molecules. So, the balanced equation is:\n\nC2H6 + O2 \u2192 2 CO2 + 3 H2O\n\nNow, I need to balance the oxygen atoms. On the right side, I have 2 CO2 molecules, each with 2 oxygen atoms, totaling 4 oxygen atoms, and 3 H2O molecules, each with 1 oxygen atom, totaling 3 oxygen atoms. So, that's 7 oxygen atoms on the right side. Therefore, I need 7/2 O2 molecules on the left side, but since we can't have fractional coefficients in a balanced equation, I'll multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2 C2H6 + 7 O2 \u2192 4 CO2 + 6 H2O\n\nOkay, now the equation is balanced.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many grams of CO2 are produced from 84 grams of C2H6.\n\nFirst, I need to find the molar mass of C2H6.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Carbon atomic weight: 12 amu\n\n- Hydrogen atomic weight: 1 amu\n\nSo, molar mass of C2H6 = (2 \u00d7 12) + (6 \u00d7 1) = 24 + 6 = 30 g/mol\n\nNow, I have 84 grams of C2H6. To find the number of moles:\n\nmoles of C2H6 = mass / molar mass = 84 g / 30 g/mol = 2.8 moles\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 2 moles of C2H6 produce 4 moles of CO2.\n\nSo, 1 mole of C2H6 produces 2 moles of CO2.\n\nTherefore, 2.8 moles of C2H6 will produce 2.8 \u00d7 2 = 5.6 moles of CO2.\n\nNow, I need to find the mass of 5.6 moles of CO2.\n\nFirst, find the molar mass of CO2.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Carbon atomic weight: 12 amu\n\n- Oxygen atomic weight: 16 amu\n\nSo, molar mass of CO2 = 12 + (2 \u00d7 16) = 12 + 32 = 44 g/mol\n\nTherefore, mass of CO2 = moles \u00d7 molar mass = 5.6 moles \u00d7 44 g/mol = 246.4 grams\n\nWait a minute, but the options provided are:\n\nA. 78g\n\nB. 528g\n\nC. 264g\n\nD. 156g\n\nAnd my calculation gives 246.4 grams, which isn't listed. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, molar mass of C2H6: 2 \u00d7 12 + 6 \u00d7 1 = 24 + 6 = 30 g/mol. That seems correct.\n\nmoles of C2H6: 84 g / 30 g/mol = 2.8 moles. That seems correct.\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 2 moles of C2H6 produce 4 moles of CO2, so 1 mole produces 2 moles, hence 2.8 moles produce 5.6 moles of CO2. That seems correct.\n\nMolar mass of CO2: 12 + 2 \u00d7 16 = 44 g/mol. Correct.\n\nMass of CO2: 5.6 moles \u00d7 44 g/mol = 246.4 grams.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a mistake in the balanced equation.\n\nLet me re-examine the balancing.\n\nStarting with C2H6 + O2 \u2192 2 CO2 + 3 H2O\n\nOxygen atoms on the right: 2 \u00d7 2 + 3 \u00d7 1 = 7 oxygen atoms.\n\nSo, O2 on the left should be 7/2 O2, but to avoid fractions, multiply everything by 2:\n\n2 C2H6 + 7 O2 \u2192 4 CO2 + 6 H2O\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is with the molecular formula.\n\nThe problem mentions ethane, which is C2H6, but the formula provided is C2H4, which is ethene.\n\nMaybe it's actually ethene reacting.\n\nLet me try balancing the equation for ethene: C2H4 + O2 \u2192 2 CO2 + 2 H2O\n\nOxygen atoms on the right: 2 \u00d7 2 + 2 \u00d7 1 = 6 oxygen atoms.\n\nSo, O2 on the left is 3 O2.\n\nTherefore, balanced equation is C2H4 + 3 O2 \u2192 2 CO2 + 2 H2O\n\nNow, if it's ethene, C2H4, with molar mass:\n\n2 \u00d7 12 + 4 \u00d7 1 = 24 + 4 = 28 g/mol\n\nGiven 84 grams of C2H4:\n\nmoles of C2H4 = 84 g / 28 g/mol = 3 moles\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 1 mole of C2H4 produces 2 moles of CO2.\n\nTherefore, 3 moles of C2H4 produce 6 moles of CO2.\n\nMolar mass of CO2 is 44 g/mol.\n\nMass of CO2 = 6 moles \u00d7 44 g/mol = 264 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 264 grams.\n\nSo, if the problem intended to use ethene (C2H4), then the answer is 264 grams.\n\nBut the problem says ethane, which is C2H6, but the formula provided is C2H4.\n\nPerhaps it's a mistake in the problem statement, and it's supposed to be ethene.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's ethane, but the molecular formula is wrong.\n\nIn any case, based on the molecular formula provided (C2H4), which is ethene, the correct answer is 264 grams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{264\\ \\text{g}} \\]"
