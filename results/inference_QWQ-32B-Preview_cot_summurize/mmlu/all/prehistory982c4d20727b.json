The options are 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, or tens of millions. I know that Columbus discovered the Americas in 1492, but I don't recall exactly how many people were living there at that time.\n\nI remember that before Columbus arrived, the Americas were inhabited by indigenous peoples, and their populations varied across different regions. There were large empires like the Aztecs in Mexico and the Incas in South America, but also many smaller tribes and communities.\n\nI think the population was probably larger than what Europeans initially thought. Some estimates suggest that there were millions of people living in the Americas before European contact. Diseases brought by Europeans later decimated these populations, so it's possible that the number was significantly higher before 1492.\n\nLet me see what I can recall about population estimates. I think I've read that some historians estimate the pre-Columbian population of the Americas to be in the tens of millions. For example, in North America alone, there were millions of native people spread across various tribes.\n\nSimilarly, in South America, the Inca Empire had a large population, and the same goes for Mesoamerica with the Aztecs and Maya. So, considering all these populations together, it seems plausible that the total population was in the tens of millions.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure, and I don't want to guess without some basis. Maybe I should think about the options provided. Option A is 100,000, which seems too low, considering the size of the continents and the diversity of cultures.\n\nOption B is 500,000, which is slightly better but still seems low. Option C is 1,000,000, which is one million. That still appears insufficient when you consider the extensive civilizations that existed.\n\nOption D is tens of millions, which aligns with what I vaguely remember about pre-Columbian populations.\n\nI think the key here is to recall that the Americas had well-developed societies with large populations before European arrival. The impact of European diseases led to a catastrophic decline in these populations, which is why some people might think the initial numbers were lower.\n\nBut based on what I know, I'm going to go with option D, tens of millions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
