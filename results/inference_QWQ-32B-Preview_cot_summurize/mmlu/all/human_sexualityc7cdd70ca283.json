So, the Kinsey scale is a way to describe a person's sexual orientation on a spectrum from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual. I remember that Alfred Kinsey developed this scale back in the 1940s as part of his research on human sexuality.\n\nThe scale goes from 0 to 6, where 0 is exclusively heterosexual, and 6 is exclusively homosexual. The numbers in between represent different degrees of bisexuality. Specifically:\n\n- 0: Exclusively heterosexual\n\n- 1: Predominantly heterosexual, only incidentally homosexual\n\n- 2: Predominantly heterosexual, but more than incidentally homosexual\n\n- 3: Equally heterosexual and homosexual\n\n- 4: Predominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosexual\n\n- 5: Predominantly homosexual, only incidentally heterosexual\n\n- 6: Exclusively homosexual\n\nSo, the question is about a person with a rating of 4 on the Kinsey scale. According to this, 4 is \"predominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosexual.\" Now, I need to match this with the given options.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. mostly heterosexual with incidental homosexual experience\n\nB. heterosexual with substantial homosexual experience\n\nC. homosexual with substantial heterosexual experience\n\nD. mostly homosexual with incidental heterosexual experience\n\nHmm. Option A says \"mostly heterosexual with incidental homosexual experience,\" which sounds like Kinsey rating 1.\n\nOption B says \"heterosexual with substantial homosexual experience,\" which might be closer to Kinsey rating 2.\n\nOption C is \"homosexual with substantial heterosexual experience,\" which seems to match Kinsey rating 4.\n\nOption D is \"mostly homosexual with incidental heterosexual experience,\" which might correspond to Kinsey rating 5.\n\nSo, based on this, it looks like option C is the correct answer for a Kinsey rating of 4.\n\nBut let me double-check. Kinsey 4 is \"predominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosexual.\" So, predominantly homosexual means that homosexuality is the primary orientation, but there is more than incidental heterosexual experience. \"Incidental\" suggests occasional or not the main focus.\n\nTherefore, \"homosexual with substantial heterosexual experience\" seems accurate because \"substantial\" indicates more than just incidental or occasional experiences.\n\nI think I've got it right. It's option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
