                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Kanji Company. They had total sales of $265 million last year, with $25 million of that being cash sales. The average collection period was 36 days, and I need to find the ending accounts receivable balance. The assumption is that there are 365 days in a year. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what accounts receivable is. It's the money that customers owe to the company for goods or services delivered on credit. So, it's like the company has given something to the customer and is waiting to be paid.\n\nNow, the average collection period is the average number of days it takes for a company to receive payment after a sale has been made on credit. In this case, it's 36 days. So, the company takes, on average, 36 days to collect its receivables.\n\nThe formula that relates accounts receivable to the average collection period is:\n\nAverage Collection Period (ACP) = (Average Accounts Receivable / Credit Sales) * Number of Days\n\nBut wait, in this problem, they're asking for the ending accounts receivable balance, not the average. However, often in these kinds of problems, we assume that the average accounts receivable is close to the ending balance, especially if we don't have information about the beginning balance. So, for simplicity, I'll assume that the ending accounts receivable is the same as the average accounts receivable.\n\nAlright, so I have:\n\nACP = (Accounts Receivable / Credit Sales) * 365 days\n\nI need to solve for Accounts Receivable.\n\nGiven:\n\nACP = 36 days\n\nCredit Sales = Total Sales - Cash Sales = $265 million - $25 million = $240 million\n\nNumber of Days = 365\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n36 = (Accounts Receivable / 240) * 365\n\nNow, solve for Accounts Receivable:\n\nAccounts Receivable = (36 / 365) * 240\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the formula again.\n\nActually, rearranging the formula to solve for Accounts Receivable:\n\nAccounts Receivable = (ACP * Credit Sales) / 365\n\nSo,\n\nAccounts Receivable = (36 * 240) / 365\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 36 multiplied by 240 is 8640.\n\nThen, divide that by 365.\n\n365 divided into 8640.\n\nLet's see, 365 times 23 is 8395.\n\nSubtract that from 8640: 8640 - 8395 = 245.\n\n365 goes into 245 zero times, so it's 23 with a remainder of 245.\n\nSo, 23 plus 245/365.\n\nSimplify 245/365 by dividing numerator and denominator by 5: 49/73.\n\nSo, Accounts Receivable is approximately 23.49 million dollars.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $26.1 million\n\nB. $23.7 million\n\nC. $7.4 million\n\nD. $18.7 million\n\nOption B is $23.7 million, which is close to my calculation of $23.49 million.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nTotal sales: $265 million\n\nCash sales: $25 million\n\nTherefore, credit sales: $265 million - $25 million = $240 million\n\nACP: 36 days\n\nFormula: ACP = (Accounts Receivable / Credit Sales) * 365\n\nRearranged: Accounts Receivable = (ACP * Credit Sales) / 365\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (36 * 240,000,000) / 365\n\nCalculate numerator: 36 * 240,000,000 = 8,640,000,000\n\nNow divide by 365: 8,640,000,000 / 365\n\nLet me do this division step by step.\n\n365 * 23,668,644.06779661 = 8,640,000,000\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe I can use a simpler approach.\n\nAlternatively, 365 goes into 8,640,000,000 how many times?\n\nWell, 365 * 23,668,644.06779661 = 8,640,000,000\n\nBut that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator for this step.\n\nUsing a calculator: 8,640,000,000 / 365 = 23,668,644.06779661\n\nWait, that can't be right. That would be approximately $23.7 million, which matches option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation.\n\nLet me try to divide 8,640,000,000 by 365.\n\nFirst, 365 * 23,668,644 = 8,640,000,000\n\nWait, that seems exact.\n\nSo, Accounts Receivable = $23,668,644.06779661, which rounds to approximately $23.7 million.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is option B, $23.7 million.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the average collection period can be related to the accounts receivable turnover ratio.\n\nThe accounts receivable turnover ratio is Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable.\n\nAnd ACP is 365 days divided by the turnover ratio.\n\nSo, ACP = 365 / (Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nACP = (365 * Average Accounts Receivable) / Credit Sales\n\nWhich is the same formula I used earlier.\n\nSo, I don't think I made any mistakes.\n\nTherefore, the ending accounts receivable balance is closest to $23.7 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
