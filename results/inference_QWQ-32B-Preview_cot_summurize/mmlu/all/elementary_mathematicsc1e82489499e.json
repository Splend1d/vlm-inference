I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how multiplication works with positive and negative numbers. I know that when you multiply a positive number by a negative number, the result is negative. So, 5 is positive, and -9 is negative, so their product should be negative.\n\nLet me check the options again. Options A and C are positive numbers, and B and D are negative. Since I expect a negative result, I can probably rule out A and C.\n\nNow, between B and D, I need to figure out which one is the correct product. I know that 5 times 9 is 45. Since one of the numbers is negative, the product should be -45.\n\nWait a minute, but option B is -4, which doesn't make sense because 5 times -9 shouldn't be -4. That seems wrong. So, D. -45 should be the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check. If I multiply 5 by -9, it's like adding -9 five times: -9 + -9 + -9 + -9 + -9. That's the same as -45.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 5 groups of -9, which totals -45.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. -45.\n\nI think that makes sense. I won't second-guess myself too much; my initial reasoning seems solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
