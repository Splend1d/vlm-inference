So, the question is: West argues that feminist legal theory has inadvertently led to the under-acknowledgement of the harms of consensual sex because... and then there are four options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what West is saying about feminist legal theory. It seems like West is critiquing how feminist legal theory approaches the concept of consent in sex and how it might be missing some harms associated with consensual sex.\n\nOption A says that feminist legal theory posits that all sex is rape. Hmm, that seems extreme. I don't recall feminist legal theory taking that position. Most feminist theories I've encountered argue that consent is important and that nonconsensual sex is rape, but they don't claim that all sex is rape. So, maybe option A isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B says that by suggesting that the harm of rape is that it is nonconsensual, it implies that all consensual sex is good. That sounds plausible. If feminist legal theory emphasizes that the harm in rape is the lack of consent, then it might lead people to think that as long as there is consent, sex is harmless and positive. But in reality, there can be harms in consensual sex, such as emotional distress, power imbalances, or other issues. So, maybe West is pointing out that this focus on consent overlooks other potential harms in consensual sexual relationships.\n\nOption C says that by suggesting that the harm of rape has nothing to do with the victim's gender, it implies that women are not especially harmed by nonconsensual sex. Wait, actually, feminist legal theory has traditionally emphasized that rape is a gendered crime, often targeting women, and that it's about power and control. So, I think this might be a mischaracterization of feminist legal theory. Feminist theorists have argued that rape is gendered and that women are disproportionately affected by sexual violence. Therefore, option C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says all of the above, but since I think option C is incorrect, D can't be the right answer.\n\nSo, based on my analysis, option B seems to be the most accurate reflection of West's argument. Feminist legal theory's emphasis on consent as the defining factor of rape might lead to the assumption that all consensual sex is benign, overlooking other potential harms.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider whether there's any merit to option A. Is there a strand of feminist legal theory that argues all sex is rape? I don't recall any prominent feminist legal scholars taking that position. It sounds more like a misinterpretation or a straw man argument against feminism. So, I'll stick with option B.\n\nAlso, regarding option C, feminist legal theory actually highlights the gendered nature of rape, so it's unlikely that West would argue that feminist legal theory suggests the harm of rape has nothing to do with the victim's gender.\n\nTherefore, my answer is B. By suggesting that the harm of rape is that it is nonconsensual, it implies that all consensual sex is good.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
