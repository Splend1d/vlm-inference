                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about Mayan city-states is NOT true. So, I have options A through D, and I need to determine which one is incorrect.\n\nFirst, option A says that Mayan city-states were ruled by autonomous dynasties. I know that the Maya had a political system where city-states were independent and often ruled by their own royal families. So, it makes sense that they were autonomous dynasties. That seems correct.\n\nOption B compares Mayan political organization to that of Egyptian communities. Now, I recall that ancient Egypt was more centralized, with a pharaoh ruling over a unified state, whereas the Maya had multiple city-states that were often in competition with each other. So, their political structures were quite different. Therefore, saying that Mayan city-states were similar to Egyptian communities in political organization might not be accurate.\n\nOption C mentions that Mayan city-states were supported by large agricultural hinterlands. I know that the Maya practiced advanced agriculture, including techniques like terracing and raised fields, to support their populations. So, it's likely that they had extensive agricultural areas surrounding their city-states. This seems correct.\n\nOption D states that Mayan city-states were much smaller in population than Mohenjo-daro. Mohenjo-daro was a major city in the Indus Valley Civilization, and it was one of the largest cities of its time, with an estimated population in the range of 40,000 to 80,000 people. Comparatively, Mayan city-states like Tikal had populations that could reach between 40,000 to 100,000 people at their peaks. So, it's not necessarily true that Mayan city-states were much smaller in population than Mohenjo-daro.\n\nWait a minute, if Tikal could have a population similar to or even larger than Mohenjo-daro, then option D might be incorrect.\n\nLet me double-check the population estimates. Mohenjo-daro is estimated to have had up to 80,000 people, and Tikal is thought to have had up to 100,000 people at its height. So, in that case, Tikal was not smaller in population than Mohenjo-daro.\n\nBut perhaps other Mayan city-states were smaller. However, the question refers to \"Mayan city-states\" in general, so it's not accurate to say they were all much smaller than Mohenjo-daro.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be incorrect.\n\nNow, going back to option B, I think that's also incorrect because Mayan and Egyptian political organizations were quite different. But since I have to choose only one, I need to decide which one is NOT true.\n\nOption A seems correct, option C seems correct, option D seems incorrect, and option B also seems incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe the question is designed so that only one option is incorrect, but in this case, both B and D seem to be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is to identify the statement that is NOT true, meaning that the correct answer is the one that is false.\n\nGiven that, if both B and D are false, but I can only choose one, I need to decide which one is more clearly false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misremembering some facts.\n\nLet me consider again:\n\nOption A: ruled by autonomous dynasties. Yes, that's accurate for Mayan city-states.\n\nOption B: similar in political organization to Egyptian communities. No, that's not accurate because Maya had city-states, while Egypt was a centralized kingdom.\n\nOption C: supported by large agricultural hinterlands. Yes, that's correct.\n\nOption D: much smaller in population than Mohenjo-daro. As per population estimates, this isn't necessarily true.\n\nSo, both B and D are incorrect statements.\n\nBut if I have to choose only one, perhaps the most clearly incorrect statement is B, because the political structures of Maya and Egyptians were fundamentally different.\n\nOption D might be slightly nuanced because while some Mayan city-states were comparable in population to Mohenjo-daro, others might have been smaller.\n\nHowever, the statement says \"much smaller in population than Mohenjo-daro,\" and given that at least some Mayan city-states were of similar size, the statement is not entirely accurate.\n\nBut compared to option B, which is more clearly incorrect, I think option D is less inaccurate.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true, or least false, would be option D.\n\nWait, no. I need to find the statement that is NOT true, meaning the false one.\n\nIf both B and D are false, but I have to choose one, perhaps the question expects me to choose D because the population sizes were comparable, whereas the political structures were clearly different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B because the Maya and Egyptians had different political systems.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking back at the question: \"Mayan city-states were NOT:\"\n\nSo, we're looking for the statement that is false, meaning that Mayan city-states did not have that particular characteristic.\n\nOption A: ruled by autonomous dynasties. They did have autonomous dynasties, so this is true.\n\nOption B: similar in their political organization to Egyptian communities. They were not similar, so this statement is false.\n\nOption C: supported by large agricultural hinterlands. They were supported by large agricultural areas, so this is true.\n\nOption D: much smaller in population than Mohenjo-daro. This was not the case, as some Mayan city-states were similar in size, so this statement is false.\n\nTherefore, both B and D are false statements.\n\nBut since I can only choose one, perhaps the question expects me to choose D because the population sizes were comparable, whereas the political structures were clearly different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B because the political structures were fundamentally different.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is B, as it clearly does not accurately describe the Mayan political organization in comparison to Egypt.\n\nSo, I will go with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
