                    "text": "Let's see. Nathan is saying that even though plants and animals that can't feel don't have moral rights directly, we should still care about the environment for its own sake. He thinks that not caring about the environment shows a flaw in a person's character. So, he's focusing on the kind of person we should be, not just on the consequences of our actions or following rules.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Virtue ethics: This is about being a good person and having good character traits. So, if Nathan is saying that caring for the environment is part of being a good person, that sounds like virtue ethics.\n\nB. Consequentialism: This is about doing what has the best outcomes. But Nathan isn't talking about the results of caring for the environment; he's talking about the character of the person.\n\nC. Kantian theory: This is about duties and rules. Kant said to treat people as ends, not means, but Nathan is talking about the environment, which doesn't have direct moral standing in Kantian terms.\n\nD. An ethics of prima facie duty: This is about duties that seem binding at first glance, but can be overridden by stronger duties. It's a bit more about duties than about character.\n\nSo, Nathan is emphasizing that caring for the environment is part of being a morally good person, regardless of the consequences or duties. That sounds most like virtue ethics.\n\nWait, but Kantian theory does talk about duties to ourselves and others, but Nathan is focusing on character defects, not duties.\n\nMaybe consequentialism could argue that caring for the environment leads to better outcomes, but Nathan is not making that case.\n\nAn ethics of prima facie duty might say that there are duties to the environment, but again, Nathan is talking about character.\n\nSo, I think virtue ethics is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A}} \\]"
