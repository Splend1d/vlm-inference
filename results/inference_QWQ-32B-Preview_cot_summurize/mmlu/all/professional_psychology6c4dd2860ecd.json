The question is: \"What is pertinent in the effort to promote and enhance health?\" And we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"pertinent\" means. Pertinent means relevant or applicable to the matter at hand. So, in this context, it's about identifying which options are most relevant or important for promoting and enhancing health.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"Encouraging healthy behavior and educating the public on problems in society.\" This seems relevant because encouraging healthy behaviors is a key aspect of public health. Educating the public on problems in society could also be important, but it's a bit vague. Maybe some problems in society are directly related to health, like poverty or inequality, which can impact health outcomes. So, this option has some relevance.\n\nOption B: \"Job satisfaction, building resilience, building self-esteem and social skills, addressing risk factors, and encouraging healthy behavior.\" This option seems comprehensive. Job satisfaction can affect mental health, which in turn can influence overall health. Building resilience and self-esteem are important for mental well-being. Social skills can help in building supportive relationships, which are beneficial for health. Addressing risk factors is crucial in preventing diseases, and encouraging healthy behavior is a fundamental aspect of health promotion. So, this option covers a wide range of important areas.\n\nOption C: \"Implementing advocacy groups for health, only targeting problem groups, and encouraging healthy eating.\" This option mentions advocacy groups, which can be important for health initiatives. However, it specifies \"only targeting problem groups,\" which might not be the best approach. A more inclusive approach that targets the general population could be more effective in promoting health. Also, encouraging healthy eating is important, but it's only one aspect of health promotion.\n\nOption D: \"Advocating and educating the public on obesity.\" This option focuses specifically on obesity, which is indeed a significant health issue. However, health promotion is broader than just one condition. It encompasses various aspects of physical, mental, and social well-being.\n\nComparing all the options, option B seems to cover the most ground in terms of what's pertinent for promoting and enhancing health. It includes elements related to mental health, social well-being, risk factor mitigation, and healthy behaviors, which are all crucial aspects of overall health.\n\nTherefore, I would say that option B is the most pertinent in the effort to promote and enhance health.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
