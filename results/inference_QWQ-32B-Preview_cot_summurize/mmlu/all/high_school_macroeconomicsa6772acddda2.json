                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says, \"A difference between M1 and M2 is that\" and gives four options. So, I need to figure out what sets M1 and M2 apart.\n\nFirst, I should recall what M1 and M2 are. I think they are measures of the money supply in an economy. M1 is a narrower measure, and M2 is broader. That means M2 includes M1 plus some other components.\n\nOption A says, \"M1 is a first mortgage and M2 is a second mortgage.\" That doesn't make sense because M1 and M2 are related to money supply, not to mortgages. Mortgages are types of loans, I think. So, I can eliminate option A.\n\nOption B says, \"M2 is M1 plus assets that are more liquid.\" Hmm, actually, I think it's the other way around. M1 includes the most liquid assets, like cash and checking deposits, and M2 includes M1 plus less liquid assets, like savings deposits and money market funds. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says, \"M2 includes savings deposits.\" Yeah, that sounds right. M1 typically includes physical currency, demand deposits, and other liquid assets that can be easily converted to cash. M2 adds in savings deposits, money market accounts, and other near-money assets.\n\nOption D says, \"M1 is larger than M2.\" But since M2 includes M1 plus additional components, M2 should be larger than M1. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on this, option C seems to be the correct answer. M2 does include savings deposits, which are not part of M1.\n\nBut let me double-check. M1 usually consists of:\n\n- Physical currency (coins and paper money)\n\n- Demand deposits (checking accounts)\n\n- Other liquid assets like traveler's checks\n\nM2 includes all of M1 plus:\n\n- Savings deposits\n\n- Money market funds\n\n- Certificates of deposit (CDs)\n\n- Money market deposit accounts\n\nSo, indeed, M2 includes savings deposits, which are not included in M1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. M2 includes savings deposits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
