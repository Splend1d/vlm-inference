                    "text": "Let's see. Cushing's Syndrome, I think it has something to do with cortisol levels in the body. So, first things first, I need to recall what cortisol is and what happens when there's too much of it.\n\nCortisol is often called the \"stress hormone\" because it's produced by the adrenal glands in response to stress, but it also has other important functions like regulating metabolism and blood pressure. So, Cushing's Syndrome is when there's an excess of cortisol in the body over a long period of time.\n\nOption A says it's due to a deficiency of cortisol hormone. Wait, that doesn't sound right. If it's an excess, then a deficiency would be the opposite. So, A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B mentions enlarged extremities. Hmm, I don't recall enlarged extremities being a common feature of Cushing's Syndrome. I think acromegaly is the condition where extremities enlarge, which is due to excess growth hormone, not cortisol. So, B probably isn't the right answer.\n\nOption C says osteoporosis is not a feature. But I know that high cortisol levels can lead to bone loss, which can result in osteoporosis. So, if there's an excess of cortisol, osteoporosis could be a complication. Therefore, C seems incorrect because osteoporosis is actually a feature of Cushing's Syndrome.\n\nOption D talks about a moon face and a buffalo hump, and says these are characteristic of the disease. I think I've heard of those terms in relation to Cushing's Syndrome. Moon face refers to a rounded, full face, and a buffalo hump is a buildup of fat between the shoulders. These are indeed classic signs of Cushing's Syndrome.\n\nSo, based on my recall, it seems that option D is the correct statement about Cushing's Syndrome.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check each option:\n\nA. Deficiency of cortisol: No, that's actually Addison's disease, which is the opposite of Cushing's Syndrome.\n\nB. Enlarged extremities: As I thought, more related to acromegaly.\n\nC. Osteoporosis not a feature: Actually, osteoporosis is a feature due to cortisol's effect on bone density.\n\nD. Moon face and buffalo hump are characteristic: Yes, these are classic physical signs of Cushing's Syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
