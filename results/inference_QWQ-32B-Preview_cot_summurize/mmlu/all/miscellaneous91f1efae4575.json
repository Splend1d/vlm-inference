                    "text": "I'm trying to remember what toy was in that movie 'The Hudsucker Proxy.' I think it was from the '90s, right? I recall it was a big hit, and there was this toy that everyone was crazy about in the film. Let's see, the options are Beanie Babies, Hula Hoop, Lincoln Logs, and Lite Brite.\n\nFirst, Beanie Babies were huge in the '90s, but I don't recall them being the central toy in that movie. Maybe they were, but I think it was something else.\n\nThen there's the Hula Hoop. Now, that's an interesting one. I know the Hula Hoop has been around for a long time, but I think it was popular in the '50s and then again in later decades. Could that be the toy in the movie?\n\nLincoln Logs are classic, but they've been around forever, and I don't think they were the focus of 'The Hudsucker Proxy.'\n\nLastly, Lite Brite\u2014 that's a fun toy, but again, not sure if that's the one.\n\nLet me think about the plot of 'The Hudsucker Proxy.' It's a comedy, right? With Danny DeVito, Steve Martin, and Dustin Hoffman. It's about a guy who's supposedly hired to fail at running a company, but then he introduces this toy that becomes a huge success.\n\nI think the toy was something simple and fun, maybe something that people could play with and get addicted to. Hula Hoop sounds plausible because it's something you can do individually, and it was a fad in the past.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up the movie's plot to be sure. But since this is a quiz question, I should try to answer based on my knowledge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the toy isn't explicitly named in the movie, and it's open to interpretation. But given the options, I need to pick one.\n\nLet me eliminate some choices. Lincoln Logs seem less likely because they are building toys, whereas the movie seems to be about a toy that creates a craze, maybe something more passive or individual.\n\nBetween Beanie Babies and Hula Hoop, Beanie Babies were a big deal in the '90s, but I think the Hula Hoop has a longer history and could fit better with the period the movie is set in.\n\nWait, but 'The Hudsucker Proxy' is set in the 1950s, if I remember correctly. The Hula Hoop was indeed a huge fad in the late '50s, introduced by Wham-O in 1958.\n\nThat could be it. The movie might be referencing that time when the Hula Hoop craze happened.\n\nOn the other hand, Beanie Babies were created by Ty in the 1990s, so they wouldn't fit with a 1950s setting.\n\nLincoln Logs were invented in 1916, so they are possible, but again, not likely to be the central toy in a 1950s setting.\n\nLite Brite was invented by Hasbro in 1967, so that's a bit later than the 1950s.\n\nTherefore, considering the time period, the Hula Hoop seems to be the most plausible answer.\n\nAdditionally, the Hula Hoop had a massive impact on popular culture in the late '50s, so it makes sense that a movie set around that time would feature it as the central toy that drives the plot.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Hula Hoop.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
