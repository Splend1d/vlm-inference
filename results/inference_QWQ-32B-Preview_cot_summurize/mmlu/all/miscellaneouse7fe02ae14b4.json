It's asking what this practice is an example of, and it gives four options: primary economic activity, global division of labor, intervening opportunity, and global-local continuum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nPrimary economic activity is usually about extracting raw materials, like farming or mining. So, that doesn't seem to fit here because we're talking about manufacturing footwear, which is more processing than extracting raw materials.\n\nGlobal division of labor sounds relevant. It's when different parts of the production process are done in different countries based on factors like cost, skills, and resources. So, if US and European companies are using cheap labor in Asia, that fits with dividing the labor globally to take advantage of lower costs.\n\nIntervening opportunity is a term I've heard in the context of migration, where people might choose a job over another based on what's available at the time. But I'm not sure how that applies here.\n\nGlobal-local continuum refers to how global processes interact with local contexts. It's a bit broad, but maybe related to how global companies operate in local markets.\n\nGiven these definitions, it seems like \"global division of labor\" is the most direct answer. The companies are dividing their production process by sending labor-intensive parts to countries where labor is cheaper.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that \"primary economic activity\" could apply? Well, perhaps if the footwear companies are sourcing materials from Asia, but the question specifically mentions \"inexpensive labor,\" which suggests it's about manufacturing rather than raw material extraction.\n\n\"Intervening opportunity\" doesn't seem to fit because it's more about individual decisions in migration, not about corporate strategies.\n\n\"Global-local continuum\" is probably too broad and doesn't specifically address the issue of using cheap labor in another country.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B, global division of labor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
