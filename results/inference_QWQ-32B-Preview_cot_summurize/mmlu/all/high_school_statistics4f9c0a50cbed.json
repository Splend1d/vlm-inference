The local newspaper conducted a survey of county residents to assess their support for this increase. Therefore, the population of interest is all county residents, as they are the ones being surveyed to gauge their opinions on the matter.\n\nOption A, \"All school-aged children,\" is not the correct choice because children may not be the ones being surveyed or making decisions about the tax increase. Surveys typically target adults who are eligible to vote or have a say in such matters.\n\nOption C, \"All county residents with school-aged children,\" and option D, \"All county residents with children in the county school system,\" are more specific subsets of the overall county residents. While these groups may have a particular interest in the school system, the survey was conducted among all county residents, not just those with school-aged children or children in the county school system.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is option B, \"All county residents,\" as they constitute the population of interest for the survey conducted by the local newspaper.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
