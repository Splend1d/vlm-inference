So, heterosexual fantasies are those of people who are attracted to the opposite gender, and homosexual fantasies are those of people who are attracted to the same gender.\n\nThe question says: \"Heterosexual fantasies about sexual activity never involve someone _________, and gay and lesbian fantasies never involve persons of __________\"\n\nSo, it's asking what genders are not involved in these types of fantasies.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Both heterosexual and homosexual fantasies may involve persons of the same or other gender\n\nB. of the other gender; of the same gender\n\nC. of the same gender; of the same gender\n\nD. of the same gender; of the other gender\n\nHmm. Let's think about heterosexual fantasies first. Heterosexual people are attracted to the opposite gender, so their fantasies would typically involve the opposite gender, right? So, never involve someone of the same gender.\n\nAnd for gay and lesbian fantasies, since they are attracted to the same gender, their fantasies would typically involve the same gender, so never involve persons of the other gender.\n\nSo, for heterosexual fantasies, they never involve someone of the same gender, and for gay and lesbian fantasies, they never involve persons of the other gender.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA says both may involve persons of the same or other gender. But the question is saying that there are certain genders that are never involved in these fantasies.\n\nB says of the other gender; of the same gender. So, heterosexual fantasies never involve the other gender, and gay/lesbian fantasies never involve the same gender. But that doesn't make sense because heterosexuals are attracted to the other gender, so their fantasies would involve the other gender, not exclude them.\n\nC says of the same gender; of the same gender. So, heterosexual fantasies never involve someone of the same gender, and gay/lesbian fantasies never involve persons of the same gender. Wait, but gay and lesbian fantasies do involve persons of the same gender.\n\nD says of the same gender; of the other gender. So, heterosexual fantasies never involve someone of the same gender, and gay/lesbian fantasies never involve persons of the other gender. That seems to align with what I was thinking.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nHeterosexual fantasies: involve the other gender, so never involve the same gender.\n\nGay and lesbian fantasies: involve the same gender, so never involve the other gender.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut option A says both may involve persons of the same or other gender. That might be true in some cases, but the question is saying \"never involve someone _________\", implying that there are exclusions.\n\nMaybe in some cases, people have fantasies that include both genders, but generally, heterosexuals have fantasies about the other gender, and homosexuals about the same gender.\n\nI think D is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
