                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Aquinas's view on acts of prudence. The question is: \"In Aquinas\u2019s view, acts of prudence are solely about matters of:\n\nA. pleasure.\n\nB. desire.\n\nC. moral virtue.\n\nD. piety.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what Aquinas said about prudence. I remember that prudence is one of the cardinal virtues in Aristotelian and Scholastic thought, and Aquinas elaborated on it in his works, particularly in the \"Summa Theologica.\"\n\nPrudence is often defined as the virtue that allows us to make good judgments about how to act in various situations. It's like the ability to discern the right means to achieve a good end. So, it's not just about doing what feels good or what we desire, but about choosing the best course of action based on reason and moral knowledge.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. pleasure - This seems more related to hedonism or the virtue of temperance, which deals with controlling pleasures, not necessarily prudence.\n\nB. desire - Desire can be a factor in decision-making, but prudence is about regulating desires and choosing wisely, not just following desires.\n\nC. moral virtue - This seems promising. Prudence is considered a moral virtue itself, and it's involved in directing other moral virtues by helping to determine the right way to act in particular situations.\n\nD. piety - Piety is another virtue, specifically related to religious duties and respect for God and parents. While important, it's not the sole focus of prudence.\n\nGiven this, it seems that acts of prudence are about matters of moral virtue, because prudence is the virtue that helps us make good moral decisions.\n\nBut let me double-check. In Aquinas's \"Summa Theologica,\" he discusses the cardinal virtues, and prudence is listed as one of them, along with justice, fortitude, and temperance. He describes prudence as right reason in action, which guides the other virtues by providing the necessary discernment for moral conduct.\n\nSo, prudence is indeed closely tied to moral virtue. It's not solely about pleasure or desire, and while piety is a virtue, it's not the primary focus of prudence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. moral virtue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
