So, they've bought or acquired lots of\u7eaa\u5ff5\u54c1, and now they're trying to pack them all in their suitcase. Is there anything morally wrong about that? Well, acquiring souvenirs is a common practice when traveling; people buy things to remember their trip. Packing them in your suitcase seems normal. Maybe the suitcase is too full, but that's more of a practical issue rather than a moral one. So, I don't think there's anything morally wrong here.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I cut and divvied up the baby.\" This sounds really disturbing. To \"cut and divvy up\" something means to divide it into parts, possibly to distribute those parts among others. Applying this to a baby is horrific; it suggests inflicting serious harm or even killing the baby. That's clearly morally wrong by any standard.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 doesn't seem morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is definitely morally wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 1. Could taking too many souvenirs be considered wrong in some way? For example, if the souvenirs were stolen, that would be wrong. But in the scenario, it says \"overflowing with souvenirs,\" which implies they purchased them or acquired them legitimately. So, no, I think it's not wrong.\n\nScenario 2 is clearly wrong. Hurting a baby in any way is against moral standards.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
