                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about what Wolf says a moral saint can't have. The options are: A. can't read Victorian novels, B. can't have a sarcastic wit, C. can't have an interest in gourmet cooking, and D. all of the above. I'm a bit confused because I remember Wolf talking about moral saints in her essay, but I don't recall specifics about these particular activities.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a moral saint is according to Susan Wolf. From what I recall, a moral saint is someone who is perfectly morally good, meaning they prioritize moral considerations above all else in their life. Wolf argues that being a moral saint might not be the most fulfilling way to live because they might miss out on other important aspects of life that aren't strictly moral.\n\nNow, looking at option A: can't read Victorian novels. I don't think Wolf specifically mentions Victorian novels. Maybe she uses literature as an example of something that might not be directly morally relevant, but that people find valuable and enriching. So, perhaps she suggests that moral saints might not engage in such activities because they don't see them as morally necessary or important.\n\nOption B: can't have a sarcastic wit. Hmm, sarcasm is a form of humor, and humor is generally considered a non-moral aspect of life. Wolf might argue that moral saints could be missing out on certain forms of human expression and enjoyment, like sarcasm, because they are so focused on moral duties.\n\nOption C: can't have an interest in gourmet cooking. Again, this seems like a non-moral activity that people might enjoy for the pleasure and craftsmanship involved. Wolf might suggest that moral saints wouldn't pursue such interests because they don't contribute directly to moral goodness.\n\nOption D: all of the above. This would mean that moral saints can't engage in any of these activities because they are not directly morally beneficial.\n\nI think Wolf's point is that moral saints are so dedicated to moral perfection that they may overlook other valuable aspects of life that aren't strictly moral. Therefore, it's possible that they wouldn't engage in activities like reading Victorian novels, being sarcastic, or enjoying gourmet cooking because these don't contribute to moral goodness.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. Maybe Wolf doesn't say that moral saints can't do these things; maybe she says they wouldn't find value in them or wouldn't prioritize them. There might be a difference between not being able to do something and not valuing it enough to pursue it.\n\nLooking back at the question, it says \"cannot\" have these things, which suggests an inability rather than a lack of interest. Maybe moral saints aren't incapable of these activities; they just choose not to engage in them because they see no moral value in them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Wolf argues that being a moral saint makes one incapable of certain kinds of activities because their entire being is focused on morality. I'm not sure.\n\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to recall the specifics of Wolf's argument. I think she presents the concept of a moral saint to show that moral perfection might not be desirable because it requires sacrificing other important aspects of life.\n\nGiven that, I would lean towards D. all of the above, because it seems that moral saints would likely not engage in any of these activities if they don't align with their moral priorities.\n\nBut I should double-check. Maybe I'm misremembering Wolf's position. Perhaps she allows that moral saints could engage in some non-moral activities as long as they don't conflict with moral duties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she says that moral saints could have interests in these areas, but they wouldn't prioritize them over moral concerns.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the question is testing whether moral saints can have any non-moral interests or pursuits. If that's the case, then D. all of the above might be the correct answer, assuming that all these options are examples of non-moral activities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only some of these activities are considered non-moral, and others might have moral dimensions.\n\nFor example, reading Victorian novels could be seen as culturally enriching and perhaps even morally beneficial if they contain moral lessons. Similarly, gourmet cooking could be about nurturing others or appreciating the art of cooking, which might have some moral value.\n\nOn the other hand, sarcasm is generally a form of humor and communication that doesn't have direct moral implications.\n\nSo, maybe not all of these activities are purely non-moral, which could complicate the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Wolf argues that even activities that have some moral value might be neglected by moral saints if they are not maximally moral.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider each option separately.\n\nOption A: can't read Victorian novels. If reading Victorian novels is seen as a non-moral activity, then perhaps moral saints wouldn't engage in it because it doesn't contribute to moral goodness.\n\nOption B: can't have a sarcastic wit. Sarcasm is a form of humor; it's neutral in moral terms. Moral saints might avoid it if they see it as frivolous or not contributing to moral goals.\n\nOption C: can't have an interest in gourmet cooking. Gourmet cooking could be seen as a luxurious pursuit that doesn't contribute to moral goodness, so moral saints might not have interest in it.\n\nGiven that, it seems plausible that moral saints would not engage in any of these activities, making D. all of the above the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether Wolf actually says that moral saints cannot do these things, or if she just suggests that they wouldn't find value in them.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the distinction between ability and choice. If moral saints choose not to engage in these activities because they prioritize morality, that doesn't necessarily mean they cannot do them.\n\nBut the question uses \"cannot,\" which suggests inability rather than choice. Maybe it's worded that way to test whether being a moral saint imposes constraints that make certain activities impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Wolf argues that being a moral saint changes one's character so much that they lose the capacity for certain kinds of activities.\n\nI'm not sure about that. Perhaps I need to recall specific passages from Wolf's essay.\n\nIn \"Moral Saints,\" Wolf discusses the concept of a moral saint and argues that such a person would be single-mindedly focused on moral duties, to the exclusion of other life aspects that are valuable but not moral.\n\nShe suggests that moral saints might not find value in non-moral goods, such as aesthetic pleasures, personal relationships (beyond their moral dimensions), and self-interested pursuits.\n\nGiven that, it's likely that she would say that moral saints don't value or engage in activities like reading Victorian novels, having a sarcastic wit, or being interested in gourmet cooking, as these are not directly morally relevant.\n\nBut again, the question uses \"cannot,\" which might be a bit strong. Maybe \"would not\" is more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Wolf does argue that moral saints cannot have these interests because their entire being is oriented towards morality.\n\nI seem to recall that she suggests that moral saints would find no value in non-moral activities, which might imply that they cannot engage in them in the same way as someone who values them.\n\nGiven that, I think D. all of the above is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
