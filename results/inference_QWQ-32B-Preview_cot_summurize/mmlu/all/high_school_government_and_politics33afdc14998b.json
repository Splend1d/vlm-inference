                    "text": "Let's see which statement about the Electoral College is correct. I need to think carefully about each option.\n\nOption A says: \"Each state must split its electoral votes among all the candidates that receive votes.\" I don't think that's accurate. From what I remember, most states have a winner-takes-all system, meaning the candidate who gets the most votes in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. There are only a few states that split their electoral votes differently. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says: \"Each state is equally represented in the Electoral College.\" That doesn't sound right either. I know that each state gets a number of electoral votes based on its representation in Congress, which includes both Senate seats and House seats. Since every state has two Senate seats but the number of House seats varies based on population, states have different numbers of electoral votes. So, they're not equally represented.\n\nOption C says: \"The Electoral College was created by an amendment to the Constitution.\" Hmm, I think the Electoral College is actually established in the original Constitution, specifically in Article II, Section 1. It wasn't added later through an amendment. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says: \"The results of Electoral College voting tend to distort the winner's margin of victory, when compared with the popular vote for president.\" This one is interesting. Sometimes, a candidate can win the Electoral College but not the popular vote, like what happened in the 2000 and 2016 elections. But more commonly, the Electoral College reflects the popular vote, just with a larger margin because of the winner-takes-all system in most states. So, it might exaggerate the winner's margin in some cases.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's not always a distortion. In some cases, it accurately reflects the popular vote, and in others, it doesn't. But the question says \"tend to distort.\" Maybe that's a fair statement overall.\n\nLet me consider again. The Electoral College system can lead to situations where the candidate with the most electoral votes doesn't have the most popular votes. That's a form of distortion, right? Also, because of the winner-takes-all approach, a candidate can win a state by a narrow margin but get all of that state's electoral votes, which might not reflect the overall popularity in that state.\n\nMoreover, the way electoral votes are distributed can give more weight to votes in some states compared to others. For example, smaller states have disproportionately more electoral votes per capita because of the two Senate seats per state. So, in that sense, it does distort the weight of individual votes.\n\nConsidering all that, it seems like statement D is correct: the Electoral College can distort the winner's margin of victory compared to the popular vote.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is incorrect because most states don't split their electoral votes; they use a winner-takes-all system.\n\nOption B is wrong because states are not equally represented; it's based on population and number of representatives.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Electoral College is part of the original Constitution, not an amendment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
