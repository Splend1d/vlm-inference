But I'm not sure about the complementary color of blue. Let's see, the options are magenta, yellow, cyan, and white.\n\nFirst, I recall that in the RGB color model, which is additive, red, green, and blue are the primary colors, and when you combine them in different ways, you can get other colors. The complementary color in RGB would be the color that, when added to blue, makes white.\n\nSo, in RGB, if I have blue (B), what color do I need to add to it to get white (R+G+B)? I think I need red and green. But that would mean the complementary color of blue is yellow, because yellow is made up of red and green in RGB.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. In RGB, yellow is indeed red plus green. So, if I have blue and I add yellow (which is red plus green), I should get white, because white is red plus green plus blue. So, blue plus yellow equals white.\n\nLet me check that: blue is B, yellow is R+G, so B + R + G = white. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nBut let's consider the other options. Magenta is red plus blue. So, if I add magenta to blue, that would be red plus blue plus blue, which is still red plus blue. That's magenta, not white. So, magenta can't be the complementary color of blue.\n\nCyan is green plus blue. If I add cyan to blue, that's green plus blue plus blue, which is still green plus blue. That's cyan, not white. So, cyan isn't the complementary color of blue.\n\nAnd white is already white. Adding white to blue would make a lighter blue, not white.\n\nSo, based on this, the complementary color of blue should be yellow, because blue plus yellow gives white.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about the CMYK color model, which is subtractive. In CMYK, cyan, magenta, and yellow are the primary colors, and they absorb certain colors to produce others.\n\nIn CMYK, the complementary color would be the one that, when combined with blue, produces black. Wait, but in CMYK, black is added separately. Maybe I should stick with the RGB model for this question since it's about additive colors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the complementary color in the context of the color wheel, where complementary colors are opposite each other.\n\nIn the traditional color wheel, the primary colors are red, yellow, and blue, and their complements are green, purple, and orange, respectively.\n\nWait, but that seems different from what I thought earlier. According to that, the complementary color of blue would be orange.\n\nBut orange in RGB is a combination of red and green, but in the traditional color wheel, it's different.\n\nI think there might be some confusion here because there are different color models and different ways of defining complementary colors.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the RGB color model more carefully.\n\nIn RGB:\n\n- Red (R) plus Green (G) makes Yellow\n\n- Red (R) plus Blue (B) makes Magenta\n\n- Green (G) plus Blue (B) makes Cyan\n\n- Red (R) plus Green (G) plus Blue (B) makes White\n\nSo, to get white from blue, I need to add red and green, which is yellow.\n\nTherefore, the complementary color of blue in RGB is yellow.\n\nBut according to the traditional color wheel, the complementary color of blue is orange.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the answer depends on the color model being used.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. magenta\n\nB. yellow\n\nC. cyan\n\nD. white\n\nIf we're considering the RGB color model, then blue plus yellow should make white, so yellow would be the complementary color.\n\nBut if we're considering the RYB color model (traditional color wheel), the complementary color of blue is orange.\n\nHowever, orange isn't one of the options. Magenta is closest to purple, which might be considered a version of purple.\n\nWait, perhaps in the RYB model, the complementary color of blue is orange, but orange isn't listed, so maybe magenta is the closest.\n\nBut the question seems to be geared towards the RGB color model, given the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's referring to the CMYK model.\n\nIn CMYK:\n\n- Cyan (C) plus Magenta (M) makes Blue\n\n- Magenta (M) plus Yellow (Y) makes Red\n\n- Cyan (C) plus Yellow (Y) makes Green\n\n- Cyan (C) plus Magenta (M) plus Yellow (Y) makes Black\n\nIn CMYK, to get white, you actually subtract all colors, but in practice, it's more about absorption.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that the options include magenta, yellow, cyan, and white, and considering the RGB model, blue plus yellow makes white, so yellow is the complementary color of blue.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. yellow.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the question might be expecting something different based on a different color model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's referring to the concept of complementary colors in the context of color theory, where complementary colors are those that are opposite each other on the color wheel.\n\nIn that case, the traditional color wheel places blue opposite orange, but orange isn't an option.\n\nMagenta could be considered similar to purple, which might be considered a complementary color to green, but that doesn't help here.\n\nAlternatively, in the RGB color wheel, blue is opposite yellow, which aligns with what I thought earlier.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I think the answer is B. yellow.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, perhaps I should check a reliable source or recall the exact definition of complementary colors in the context this question is presented.\n\nAssuming it's an RGB context, blue plus yellow makes white, so yellow is the complementary color of blue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. yellow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
