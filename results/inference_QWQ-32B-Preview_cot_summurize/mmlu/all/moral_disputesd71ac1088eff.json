                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Audi's proposal regarding Ross's list of prima facie duties. So, first, I need to recall who Ross is and what his list consists of.\n\nI remember that W.D. Ross was a British ethicist who proposed a set of prima facie duties in his ethical theory known as intuitionism. Prima facie duties are those that seem obligatory at first glance, but they can be overridden by more pressing moral considerations. Ross's original list includes duties like fidelity (keeping promises), reparation (making amends), gratitude, justice, beneficence, self-improvement, and non-maleficence (not harming others).\n\nNow, Audi is suggesting that we expand this list. The options are A. veracity, B. enhancement and preservation of freedom, C. respectfulness, and D. all of the above. I need to figure out which of these Audi proposed to add to Ross's list.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. Veracity: This refers to truth-telling or being honest. I think this is closely related to fidelity, which is already on Ross's list. Fidelity includes keeping promises and being honest. So, maybe veracity is already covered under fidelity. But perhaps Audi thinks it deserves its own separate category.\n\nB. Enhancement and preservation of freedom: This seems to be about promoting and protecting individual freedom. Ross's list includes justice, which is about giving people their due, but enhancement and preservation of freedom might be a more specific duty related to liberty and autonomy. So, it could be a separate duty.\n\nC. Respectfulness: This likely pertains to treating others with respect and dignity. Respectfulness could be related to several of Ross's duties, such as justice and non-maleficence, but it might also be a distinct duty.\n\nGiven that Audi is proposing to expand the list, it suggests that he thinks there are important duties that Ross didn't include. So, perhaps Audi is suggesting adding veracity, enhancement and preservation of freedom, and respectfulness as separate duties.\n\nLooking back at the options, D says \"all of the above,\" which would include all three proposed duties. If Audi is indeed proposing to add all three, then D would be the correct answer.\n\nBut to confirm, I should think about whether these three duties are already encompassed in Ross's original list. For example:\n\n- Veracity: As I mentioned, it's similar to fidelity, but perhaps Audi thinks it's significant enough to be listed separately.\n\n- Enhancement and preservation of freedom: This seems distinct from Ross's duties, so it's likely a new addition.\n\n- Respectfulness: Again, while related to justice and non-maleficence, it might be a separate duty.\n\nTherefore, it's plausible that Audi is proposing to add all three duties to Ross's list, making D the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD. all of the above"
