I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?\u2026Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny.\"\nAlbert J.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this speech by Albert J. Beveridge from 1898. He's arguing about whether the U.S. should govern certain peoples, specifically mentioning the Philippines, without their consent. It's an interesting historical perspective, especially in the context of the time when colonialism was prevalent.\n\nFirst, he says that the opposition argues that governing without consent is wrong, but he counters that the principle of government by consent only applies to those capable of self-government. He gives examples like governing Indians, territories, and children without their consent, implying that some groups need to be governed for their own good because they can't govern themselves.\n\nHe then asks rhetorical questions about whether the Philippines would prefer U.S. rule to what they had before, suggesting that U.S. governance is beneficial and civilizing compared to what came before. He also mentions the responsibility of powerful nations to govern less developed nations, hinting at a sense of duty or mission.\n\nFinally, he talks about the U.S. having a mission and destiny, which seems to align with the idea of Manifest Destiny, a belief that the U.S. was destined to expand across North America.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The closing of the western frontier impels the United States to expand its territory overseas.\n\nThis seems related to Manifest Destiny, which did evolve to include overseas expansion, especially after the settlement of the continental U.S. The closing of the western frontier might have indeed pushed the U.S. to look outward for further expansion.\n\nB. Governing territories confers economic benefits to both European and nonwhite nations.\n\nBeveridge does mention economic aspects indirectly when he talks about the U.S. having to compete with other powers like Germany, England, and Japan, who are \"hungering\" for these territories. So, there might be an underlying economic motive, but it's not explicitly stated in this excerpt.\n\nC. Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations.\n\nThis seems directly aligned with Beveridge's argument. He suggests that powerful nations have a responsibility to govern those who are not yet capable of self-government, for their own good and for the greater good.\n\nD. Racial superiority confers responsibility to the United States and Europe over the affairs of developing nations.\n\nBeveridge mentions \"enlightened, self-governing people\" and contrasts them with those who need to be governed, which could imply a racial hierarchy, but he doesn't explicitly state racial superiority. However, during this time period, such ideas were prevalent, so it's possible that this was an underlying assumption.\n\nConsidering these points, the rationale that Beveridge most clearly employs is that powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
