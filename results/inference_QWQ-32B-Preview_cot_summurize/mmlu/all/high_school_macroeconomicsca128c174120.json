                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which policy supply-side economists would support. Let's see what supply-side economics is all about first. I know that supply-side economics is an economic theory that suggests that productive capacity or supply is the primary path to economic growth and that reducing barriers to production and supply will result in economic growth.\n\nOkay, so it's all about increasing supply and production. That probably means they'd support policies that encourage businesses to produce more, invest more, and maybe even hire more workers. Maybe they'd be in favor of lower taxes because that would leave more money in the hands of businesses and individuals, which they could then use to invest or save, right?\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: Higher taxes on corporate profits. Hmm, if supply-side economists believe that lower taxes encourage more investment and production, then higher taxes would probably discourage that. So, they probably wouldn't support higher taxes on corporate profits.\n\nOption B: Lower tax rates on interest earned from savings. Well, if people have lower taxes on their savings, they might be more inclined to save money. Saving is important because it provides funds that can be invested in businesses and projects that grow the economy. So, this seems like something supply-side economists would support.\n\nOption C: Removal of investment tax credits. Investment tax credits are designed to encourage businesses to invest in certain areas, like technology or infrastructure. If supply-side economists are all about encouraging investment and production, then removing these credits might not be something they'd support. In fact, they might want to keep or even increase these credits to encourage more investment.\n\nOption D: A longer duration of unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are meant to support people who are out of work, but from a supply-side perspective, maybe they're more focused on getting people back to work and encouraging employment. Longer unemployment benefits might discourage people from accepting jobs immediately, which could affect the supply of labor. So, perhaps they wouldn't support extending unemployment benefits.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should look up what supply-side economists actually think about unemployment benefits.\n\nFrom what I've read, supply-side economists often focus more on incentives for work and investment. They might argue that extending unemployment benefits could reduce the incentive for people to look for work, which could slow down economic growth. So, probably, they wouldn't support longer durations of unemployment benefits.\n\nOkay, going back to the options, it seems like option B, lower tax rates on interest earned from savings, aligns best with supply-side economics. It encourages saving, which can lead to more investment, which in turn increases productive capacity and economic growth.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider option C again. Removal of investment tax credits\u2014since supply-side economists favor incentives for investment, removing these credits would likely not be supported by them.\n\nSimilarly, option A, higher taxes on corporate profits, would likely discourage corporate investment and production, which is counter to supply-side economics.\n\nAnd option D, longer unemployment benefits, might not align with their focus on encouraging work and production.\n\nTherefore, the policy that supply-side economists would most likely support is option B: lower tax rates on interest earned from savings.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
