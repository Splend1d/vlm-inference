                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal question about personal jurisdiction. So, there's a plaintiff from State A who's suing a parent company from State B and its foreign subsidiary in a federal court in State A. The claim is that a tire made by the subsidiary in Europe caused his wife's death in an accident in Europe.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what personal jurisdiction is. It's the court's authority to require a defendant to participate in the case. For a court to have personal jurisdiction over a defendant, the defendant must have sufficient contacts with the jurisdiction where the court is located.\n\nIn this case, the parent corporation does significant business throughout the U.S., including in State A, but the subsidiary doesn't do much business there. It only has 2% of its tires distributed in State A by the parent corporation, and it has no employees or bank accounts in State A.\n\nThe subsidiary is moving to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction. So, the question is whether the court in State A has personal jurisdiction over this foreign subsidiary.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. No, because 2% of the subsidiary's tires entered State A through the stream of commerce.\n\nB. No, because of the general personal jurisdiction established over the parent corporation.\n\nC. Yes, because the accident did not occur in the United States.\n\nD. Yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A.\n\nOption A says no, meaning the court should not grant the motion to dismiss, implying that there is personal jurisdiction. It mentions that 2% of the subsidiary's tires entered State A through the stream of commerce.\n\nI've heard of the \"stream of commerce\" theory, which suggests that a defendant who places a product into the stream of commerce can be subject to jurisdiction in places where the product is distributed. However, this theory has been criticized and is not universally accepted.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, particularly in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of California, the court was skeptical of the stream of commerce theory, especially when applied to foreign defendants.\n\nGiven that the subsidiary is foreign and only 2% of its tires are distributed in State A, it seems tenuous to base personal jurisdiction solely on that grounds. So, I'm not sure about option A.\n\nOption B says no, again meaning the court should not grant the motion to dismiss, suggesting personal jurisdiction exists because of general personal jurisdiction over the parent corporation.\n\nGeneral personal jurisdiction allows a court to hear any case against a defendant, even if the cause of action didn't arise from activities in the forum state. It's typically based on the defendant's continuous and systematic contacts with the state.\n\nHowever, in this case, the parent corporation has significant business in State A, but the subsidiary is a separate legal entity. Generally, the activities of a parent company aren't imputed to its subsidiary for jurisdictional purposes. They are separate entities.\n\nSo, it seems unlikely that the parent's contacts would establish personal jurisdiction over the subsidiary. Therefore, option B might not be correct.\n\nOption C says yes, meaning the court should grant the motion to dismiss because the accident didn't occur in the United States.\n\nWhile it's true that the accident was in Europe, and the tire was manufactured in Europe, the lawsuit is being filed in the U.S., and the plaintiff is seeking to hold the U.S.-based parent corporation and its subsidiary liable.\n\nThe fact that the accident occurred outside the U.S. doesn't necessarily mean that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the subsidiary. Many courts can assert personal jurisdiction if the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state, even if the cause of action arose from events outside the state.\n\nSo, I don't think option C is the right answer.\n\nOption D says yes, meaning the court should grant the motion to dismiss because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A.\n\nThis seems plausible. For specific personal jurisdiction, the defendant's contacts with the state must be such that it's reasonable to bring the lawsuit there, and the cause of action arises from those contacts.\n\nIn this case, the subsidiary has minimal contacts with State A: only 2% of its tires are distributed there by the parent corporation, and it has no employees or bank accounts in State A.\n\nGiven the minimal nature of these contacts, it might be difficult for the plaintiff to establish specific personal jurisdiction over the subsidiary in State A.\n\nMoreover, since the accident occurred in Europe, it's not clear how the subsidiary's limited connections to State A relate to the cause of action.\n\nTherefore, option D seems like the most appropriate answer.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A relies on the stream of commerce theory, which is questionable, especially for a foreign defendant with minimal contacts.\n\n- Option B suggests that the parent corporation's jurisdiction can be imputed to the subsidiary, but generally, separate legal entities have their own jurisdictional analysis.\n\n- Option C bases the decision on the location of the accident, but the relevance of the accident location to jurisdiction is less direct than the subsidiary's contacts with the forum state.\n\n- Option D directly addresses the subsidiary's contacts with State A, which appear to be insufficient for establishing personal jurisdiction.\n\nTherefore, the court should grant the subsidiary's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
