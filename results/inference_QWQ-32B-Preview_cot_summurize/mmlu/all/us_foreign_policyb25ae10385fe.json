It democratizes countries\n\nB. It has no real effect\n\nC. It encourages stability of the regime\n\nD. It changes the nature of the investor\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that many developing countries have abundant natural resources, like oil, minerals, and timber. When these resources are traded, it can have significant impacts on the country's economy and politics.\n\nOption A says it democratizes countries. Is that true? Well, democracy is a form of government where power is vested in the people and exercised directly or through elected representatives. Does trading natural resources lead to more democratic governments in developing states?\n\nI'm not so sure about that. In fact, some studies suggest that resource-rich countries, especially those\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u77f3\u6cb9\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0 autocratic regimes\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6c11\u4e3b\u5236\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u8d44\u6e90\u8bc5\u5492\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u9009\u9879A\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u3002\n\nOption B says it has no real effect. That seems unlikely. Trading natural resources is often a major part of a developing country's economy. It can bring in a lot of revenue, which can be used for development projects, but it can also lead to corruption and inequality if not managed properly. So, it probably does have a significant effect.\n\nOption C says it encourages stability of the regime. Stability can mean different things, but in this context, it might refer to the longevity and security of the current government. Does trading natural resources encourage regime stability?\n\nWell, in some cases, regimes that control valuable resources can become more stable because they have access to plenty of money, which they can use to maintain power, fund their supporters, and suppress opposition. This is sometimes called the \"rentier state\" phenomenon, where the government doesn't need to rely on taxes from its citizens, so it doesn't have to be accountable to them.\n\nOn the other hand, resource wealth can also lead to conflicts and instability, especially if different groups are competing for control over the resources. So, it's a bit complicated.\n\nOption D says it changes the nature of the investor. I'm not sure what this means exactly. Does it mean that when investors trade natural resources in developing states, their behavior or characteristics change?\n\nMaybe it refers to the fact that investors in resource sectors might have different motivations and strategies compared to investors in other sectors. For example, resource extraction often requires large upfront investments and has long-term implications, so investors might be more involved in the political and social aspects of the host country.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the main effect on developing states. It seems more like a characteristic of the investors rather than an effect on the country.\n\nLet me consider this again. The question is about the effects on developing states, so the focus should be on how these states are affected by the trade of oil and other natural resources.\n\nOption A: Democratizes countries. As I thought earlier, there's evidence suggesting that resource-rich countries may be less likely to democratize, so this seems unlikely.\n\nOption B: Has no real effect. That doesn't make sense because natural resource trade is often a major part of these economies and can influence politics and society in various ways.\n\nOption C: Encourages stability of the regime. This could be possible, as resource revenues can help regimes stay in power, but it's also possible that resource wealth leads to instability due to conflicts over control.\n\nOption D: Changes the nature of the investor. This seems more related to the investors themselves rather than the effects on the developing states.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think option C is the most plausible answer, but with the caveat that it can cut both ways\u2014promoting stability in some cases and instability in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another effect that isn't listed here, but since I have to choose from these options, I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
