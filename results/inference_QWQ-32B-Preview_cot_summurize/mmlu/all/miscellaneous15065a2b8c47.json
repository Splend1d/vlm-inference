So, they're basically representing numbers like 245 or 361 with blocks that stand for hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each option means:\n\nA. Comparing quantities: This would be about looking at two or more numbers and seeing which is bigger or smaller, maybe using symbols like >, <, or =.\n\nB. Describing quantities: This could be about explaining what a number represents, like saying \"245 means 2 hundreds, 4 tens, and 5 ones.\"\n\nC. Ordering quantities: This might involve arranging numbers in sequence from least to greatest or vice versa.\n\nD. Decomposing quantities: This is breaking down a number into its component parts, like seeing 245 as 200 + 40 + 5.\n\nNow, in this activity, students are taking a three-digit number and modeling it with base ten blocks on a place value mat. A place value mat has sections for hundreds, tens, and ones, so students are physically separating the number into its hundreds, tens, and ones components using the blocks.\n\nSo, when they're doing this, they're essentially breaking down the number into its place value parts. For example, for the number 245, they'd put two hundred blocks in the hundreds section, four ten blocks in the tens section, and five one blocks in the ones section.\n\nThis sounds a lot like decomposing the number into its hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\nOption A, comparing quantities, doesn't seem directly related because they're not comparing different numbers, they're just modeling one number each.\n\nOption B, describing quantities, might be somewhat related, but it seems more about explaining what the number means rather than physically modeling it with blocks.\n\nOption C, ordering quantities, isn't relevant here because they're not arranging numbers in order.\n\nOption D, decomposing quantities, seems to fit best because they're breaking down the number into its place value parts.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any element of comparing, describing, or ordering in this activity?\n\nWell, perhaps after modeling their numbers, students might be asked to compare their numbers or order them, but according to the description, the main activity is selecting a card and modeling the number with blocks.\n\nSo, the core concept being reinforced is understanding the place value of each digit in a three-digit number by decomposing it into hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. Decomposing quantities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
