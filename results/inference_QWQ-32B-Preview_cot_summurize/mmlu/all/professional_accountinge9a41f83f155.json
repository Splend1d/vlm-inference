                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about when an accountant compiles projected financial statements. So, the scenario here is that an accountant is putting together projected financial statements, which are basically forecasts of what a company's financial position and performance might look like in the future based on certain assumptions.\n\nNow, when an accountant compiles these projections, they need to issue a report that accompanies these statements. The question is asking what that report should include, specifically a separate paragraph that does what?\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Disclaims any form of assurance on the historical financial statements.\" Hmm, projected financial statements are about the future, not the past. Historical financial statements are the actual records of what happened in the past. So, if the accountant is compiling projections, they're not really opining on the historical statements. This seems a bit off track. Maybe it's included to throw us off.\n\nOption B: \"Expresses limited assurance that the results will be within the projected range.\" Okay, this is interesting. Assurance is something accountants provide when they audit or review financial statements. But in compilation, which is what we're talking about here, the accountant isn't providing any assurance. They're just presenting the data as provided by management. So, expressing limited assurance wouldn't typically be part of a compilation report.\n\nOption C: \"Describes the limitations on the usefulness of the projection.\" This sounds promising. Projections are forecasts and rely on assumptions that might not hold true. There are many uncertainties involved in predicting the future. So, it makes sense that the report should highlight these limitations to users of the financial statements, so they understand the projections shouldn't be taken as gospel.\n\nOption D: \"Evaluates the hypothetical assumptions used to prepare the projection.\" Again, in a compilation, the accountant isn't evaluating the assumptions; they're compiling the data as provided. Evaluation of assumptions would be more in line with a review or an audit, where the accountant is providing some level of assurance.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option C seems to be the most appropriate. The report should include a separate paragraph that describes the limitations on the usefulness of the projection. This way, users are aware of the uncertainties and shouldn't rely too heavily on the projections without considering these limitations.\n\nTo double-check, let's think about why the other options aren't as suitable.\n\nOption A is about disclaiming assurance on historical statements, which aren't the focus here. The projections are forward-looking, so the historical statements should already be separate and presumably audited or reviewed if necessary.\n\nOption B is expressing limited assurance, but in a compilation, no assurance is provided. That's a key characteristic of compilations versus reviews or audits.\n\nOption D is about evaluating assumptions, which again, isn't part of a compilation engagement. The accountant isn't testing or evaluating management's assumptions in a compilation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: Describes the limitations on the usefulness of the projection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
