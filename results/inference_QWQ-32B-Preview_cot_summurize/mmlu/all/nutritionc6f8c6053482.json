These bacteria are able to adhere to tooth surfaces, produce acid from dietary sugars, and form biofilms known as dental plaque. The acid produced by these bacteria can demineralize tooth enamel, leading to the formation of cavities.\n\nWhile lactobacilli and bifidobacteria can also contribute to the caries process, especially in more advanced stages, Mutans streptococci are considered the primary initiators. Porphyromonas gingivalis is more associated with periodontal diseases rather than dental caries."
