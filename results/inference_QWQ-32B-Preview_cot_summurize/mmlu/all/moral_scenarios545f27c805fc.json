                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person ate a candy cane because they were in the mood for something sweet. Eating a candy cane seems pretty normal and harmless. Candy canes are meant to be eaten, especially around Christmas time. So, in this case, it doesn't seem like anything morally wrong is happening.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Here, the person told their sister to run while she was holding scissors. Hmm, that sounds dangerous. Scissors are sharp objects, and running while holding them could lead to an accident, either the person could drop the scissors and someone could step on them, or they might hurt themselves or others while running with scissors. It's a common rule taught to children not to run with scissors because it's unsafe.\n\nSo, in Scenario 2, the person is advising their sister to do something that could potentially cause harm to herself or others. That doesn't seem morally right because it could lead to someone getting hurt.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it's generally accepted that we should avoid actions that could harm others or put them in danger. Telling someone to run with scissors goes against that principle.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
