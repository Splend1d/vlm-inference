I need to figure out how many shipping boxes are needed for all the shirts ordered. The options are A. 8, B. 9, C. 72, and D. 90.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I have 81 shirts, and each box can hold 9 shirts. So, to find out how many boxes are needed, I should divide the total number of shirts by the number of shirts each box can hold. That makes sense.\n\nSo, 81 divided by 9. Let's see, 9 times 9 is 81, right? So, 9 boxes should be enough to hold all 81 shirts.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If each box holds 9 shirts, and I have 9 boxes, that's 9 times 9, which is 81 shirts. Perfect, that matches the total number of shirts ordered.\n\nNow, looking at the options, B. 9 is one of them, so that seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options. A. 8 boxes would hold 8 times 9, which is 72 shirts. But the store ordered 81 shirts, so 72 is not enough; they'd be short by 9 shirts. So, A. 8 is too few.\n\nC. 72 is not even a number of boxes; it's the total number of shirts that 8 boxes can hold, but we need boxes, not shirts. So, that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nD. 90 boxes would hold 90 times 9, which is 810 shirts. But the store only ordered 81 shirts, so that's way more than needed. It's excessive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 9 boxes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider if there's any remainder when dividing 81 by 9. 81 divided by 9 is 9 with no remainder, so exactly 9 boxes are needed.\n\nIf the number of shirts weren't divisible by 9, say if it was 82 shirts, then 9 boxes would hold 81 shirts, and there would be 1 shirt left over, requiring an additional box. But since it's exactly 81 shirts, 9 boxes are sufficient.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
