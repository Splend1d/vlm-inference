It asks, \"An allele that is masked is referred to as:\" and gives options A. recessive, B. redundant, C. repressed, D. reclusive. I think I remember something about dominant and recessive alleles, but I need to make sure.\n\nSo, first things first, what does it mean for an allele to be masked? I believe that means it's not expressed in the organism's phenotype because there's another allele that's dominant over it. So, if you have one dominant allele and one recessive allele, the dominant one will be expressed, and the recessive one will be masked or hidden.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n\nA. recessive: That seems like the right answer because recessive alleles are masked by dominant alleles.\n\nB. redundant: That means something is unnecessary or duplicate. I don't think that applies to alleles being masked.\n\nC. repressed: Repressed might sound similar to masked, but in genetics, gene repression is about regulating gene expression, not about alleles being hidden.\n\nD. reclusive: That's more like shy or withdrawn, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, the correct answer should be A. recessive.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should double-check what dominant and recessive alleles really mean.\n\nIn genetics, alleles are different versions of the same gene. When an organism has two different alleles for a particular gene, the allele that gets expressed is the dominant one, while the other allele, which doesn't get expressed, is the recessive one.\n\nFor example, in pea plants, the allele for tallness is dominant over the allele for shortness. So, if a pea plant has one tall allele and one short allele, it will be tall, and the short allele is masked.\n\nTherefore, the term for an allele that is masked is indeed \"recessive.\"\n\nI think option A is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
