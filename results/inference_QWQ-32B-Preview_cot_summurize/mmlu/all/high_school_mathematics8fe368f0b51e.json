So, \\(x \\times y = k\\), where \\(k\\) is some constant.\n\nThe problem also gives me some conditions: when the sum of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is 42, \\(x\\) is twice \\(y\\). I need to find the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = -8\\).\n\nFirst, I should find the constant \\(k\\). To do that, I need to find the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy both the sum and the proportion given.\n\nSo, it's given that \\(x + y = 42\\) and \\(x = 2y\\).\n\nI can substitute \\(x\\) in the sum equation:\n\n\\(2y + y = 42\\)\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n\\(3y = 42\\)\n\nSo, \\(y = 14\\)\n\nThen, since \\(x = 2y\\), \\(x = 28\\)\n\nNow, their product is \\(x \\times y = 28 \\times 14 = 392\\). So, \\(k = 392\\).\n\nNow, I need to find \\(y\\) when \\(x = -8\\). Since \\(x \\times y = k\\), plugging in the values:\n\n\\(-8 \\times y = 392\\)\n\nSolving for \\(y\\):\n\n\\(y = 392 / (-8) = -49\\)\n\nSo, the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = -8\\) is \\(-49\\).\n\nLooking back at the options, A is \\(-49\\), which matches my answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check everything to be sure.\n\nFirst, inversely proportional means \\(x \\times y = k\\), that's correct.\n\nGiven \\(x + y = 42\\) and \\(x = 2y\\), I substituted and found \\(y = 14\\) and \\(x = 28\\), and their product is indeed 392.\n\nThen, when \\(x = -8\\), \\(y = 392 / (-8) = -49\\), that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem, but I think this is straightforward.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is A, \\(-49\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-49} \\]"
