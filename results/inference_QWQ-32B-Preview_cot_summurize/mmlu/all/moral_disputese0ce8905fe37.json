                    "text": "I'm trying to understand Metz's view on what kind of punishment is justified for wrongdoers. The options are:\n\nA. Harmful punishment that is proportionate to the harm done by the wrongdoing.\n\nB. Unfriendly action that is proportionate to the unfriendly wrongdoing, aimed at correcting the wrongdoing.\n\nC. Degradation proportionate to the degrading impacts of the wrongdoing.\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Metz's perspective is on punishment. I remember that he discusses the moral justifications for punishment and emphasizes certain principles.\n\nOption A mentions harmful punishment proportional to the harm caused. This sounds like retributive justice, where the punishment should fit the crime in terms of the harm inflicted. Metz might support this idea, but I need to confirm.\n\nOption B talks about unfriendly action proportional to unfriendly wrongdoing, with the aim of correcting the wrongdoing. This seems to combine elements of retribution and rehabilitation. The focus on proportionality suggests retributive aspects, while the aim of correcting the wrongdoing points towards rehabilitative goals.\n\nOption C refers to degradation proportional to the degrading impacts of the wrongdoing. This might be related to restoring dignity or addressing the dehumanizing effects of the crime.\n\nOption D says all of the above, which would mean Metz endorses a comprehensive approach incorporating harm, unfriendliness, and degradation in punishment.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, I should look back at Metz's writings on punishment. In his work, Metz argues for a theory of punishment that emphasizes the moral importance of proportionality and the aim of correcting moral wrongdoing.\n\nHe contends that punishment should be proportional to the moral wrongdoing, meaning that the severity of the punishment should correspond to the seriousness of the offense. Additionally, he stresses that punishment should be aimed at correcting the wrongdoing, which could involve rehabilitation or other forms of moral correction.\n\nMetz also considers the nature of punishment and argues that it should not be purely harmful for its own sake but should serve a moral purpose. This suggests that while harm may be involved, it should be justified by the aim of correction.\n\nGiven this, option B seems most aligned with Metz's view: unfriendly action proportional to the unfriendly wrongdoing, aimed at correcting the wrongdoing. This captures both the proportional aspect and the aim of correction.\n\nOption A focuses solely on harm and proportionality, which is part of Metz's view but misses the corrective aim. Option C's focus on degradation seems more specific and perhaps not the main thrust of Metz's argument. Option D is too broad, as it includes all the above, which may encompass aspects Metz does not fully endorse.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is B. Unfriendly action that is proportionate to the unfriendly wrongdoing, aimed at correcting the wrongdoing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
