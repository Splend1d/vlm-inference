                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this scenario about the husband and wife shopping at a department store. The wife sees a dress she likes but can't find her size. She asks a clerk if the store has it in her size, and the clerk makes a really hurtful comment, calling her a hippopotamus and saying they don't have hippo sizes. Another customer laughs, and the wife gets upset and leaves. Now, if the wife decides to take legal action against the department store based on the clerk's behavior, I need to figure out what would happen.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. She wins because the statement was overheard by another customer.\n\nB. She wins because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n\nC. She loses because the clerk was merely stating an opinion.\n\nD. She loses because the wife only suffered hurt feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what kind of legal action she's considering. It says \"tort action,\" which means she's looking to sue for some kind of civil wrong that isn't a breach of contract. Torts can include things like negligence, assault, defamation, and more. In this case, it seems like the issue is with the clerk's verbal comment, which was hurtful and possibly humiliating.\n\nOption A suggests she wins because the statement was overheard by another customer. I'm not sure about this. Maybe the fact that someone else heard it makes it more public, but I don't know if that's enough to win a lawsuit. It seems a bit weak.\n\nOption B says she wins because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous. This sounds promising. In tort law, there's a cause of action called \"intentional infliction of emotional distress,\" which requires that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous, and that it caused severe emotional distress to the plaintiff.\n\nLooking back at the clerk's comment, calling someone a hippopotamus and saying they don't carry hippo sizes is pretty harsh and disrespectful. It seems like it could be considered extreme and outrageous, especially in a public setting where another customer laughed.\n\nOption C says she loses because the clerk was merely stating an opinion. But was the clerk really stating an opinion, or was it a hurtful comment? Opinions are generally protected, but if the opinion is presented in a way that is intended to harm or is excessively cruel, it might cross the line into tortious conduct.\n\nOption D says she loses because the wife only suffered hurt feelings. This might be relevant because not all hurt feelings rise to the level of legal action. However, if the emotional distress is severe enough, it could constitute a tort.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option B is the most likely correct answer. The clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous, and it caused the wife to become very upset and leave the store. This could meet the standards for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nBut I should think about this more. Maybe the store could argue that it's just a comment, and people should have thicker skin. However, the comment was publicly humiliating, and another customer laughed, which suggests it was offensive and hurtful.\n\nAlso, perhaps there's a element of defamation here, but that usually requires that a false statement is made about someone and published to a third party, causing damage to the person's reputation. In this case, the comment was made in the presence of another customer, so it was published, but it's more about the emotional harm than reputational damage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a breach of duty of care, but that seems more related to negligence, which typically requires a different set of elements.\n\nI think sticking with intentional infliction of emotional distress makes the most sense here. The clerk intentionally made a hurtful comment, knowing it would cause distress, and it did.\n\nTherefore, the wife would likely win the tort action because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
