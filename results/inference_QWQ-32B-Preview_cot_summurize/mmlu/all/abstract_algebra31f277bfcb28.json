                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to understand what each statement is saying and then determine whether they are true or false.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"The image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a homomorphism is. A homomorphism between two groups is a function that preserves the group operation. So, if I have a group G with 6 elements and a group H, and a homomorphism \u03c6 from G to H, then the image of G under \u03c6, which is \u03c6(G), is a subgroup of H.\n\nNow, the key point here is that the image of G under \u03c6 is a subgroup of H. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. So, if H has 12 elements, any subgroup of H must have an order that divides 12. The possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nGiven that G has 6 elements, the image \u03c6(G) could have orders that are divisors of 6, because the order of \u03c6(G) divides the order of G (another application of Lagrange's theorem in the context of homomorphisms).\n\nWait, actually, more precisely, the order of \u03c6(G) divides the order of G, and \u03c6(G) is a subgroup of H, so its order must divide both |G| and |H|. So, in this case, |\u03c6(G)| divides 6 and also divides 12. The common divisors of 6 and 12 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nTherefore, the possible orders of \u03c6(G) are 1, 2, 3, or 6. But Statement 1 says that the image may have 12 elements. However, 12 does not divide 6, so it's impossible for \u03c6(G) to have 12 elements because its order must divide 6.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"There is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.\"\n\nThis statement is asking whether there exists any group G with 6 elements and any group H with 12 elements such that there is a homomorphism from G to H.\n\nWell, homomorphisms can always exist between any two groups, even if they are trivial homomorphisms. A trivial homomorphism is one that maps every element of G to the identity element of H.\n\nSo, in this case, there is always at least one homomorphism from G to H, which is the trivial homomorphism.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nPutting it all together, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true. So, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
