But let me double-check.\n\nFirst, I know that the American Revolution was much earlier, in the late 1700s, so that probably isn't right. The Civil War was in the 1860s, and the Mexican War was in the 1840s. The War of 1812, obviously, was in 1812. So, timing-wise, the War of 1812 makes the most sense.\n\nAlso, I recall that the Battle of New Orleans was a significant victory for the United States, and it happened after the peace treaty had already been signed, but before the news reached the troops. That's why it's often noted that it was a battle fought after the war was officially over.\n\nLet me see if I can confirm this. I'll look up the dates of the War of 1812. It started in 1812 and lasted until 1815, I think. The Battle of New Orleans took place on January 8, 1815, which was after the Treaty of Ghent was signed on December 24, 1814, but before the treaty was ratified by the U.S. government.\n\nSo, yes, it was during the War of 1812. And it was a major victory for Andrew Jackson and the American forces, helping to secure the southern frontier and establish American military prowess.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check if there was a battle of New Orleans in any other wars. During the Civil War, New Orleans was captured by Union forces in 1862, but that's a different battle. In the Mexican War, the main battles were in Mexico, like the Battle of Mexico City and the Battle of Chapultepec.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the Battle of New Orleans was definitely during the War of 1812.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
