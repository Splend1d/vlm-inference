                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to find the smallest prime number whose digits add up to 19. We have some options given: 5, 11, 17, and 199. But wait, let's first understand what the question is asking.\n\nSo, we need a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Okay, that's clear.\n\nNext, the sum of its digits should be 19. So, if we take the number apart into its individual digits and add them up, the total should be 19.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 5: The digits sum is 5, which is not 19.\n\nB. 11: The digits are 1 and 1, so 1+1=2, which is not 19.\n\nC. 17: The digits are 1 and 7, so 1+7=8, which is not 19.\n\nD. 199: The digits are 1, 9, and 9, so 1+9+9=19. Okay, this one matches.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the smallest prime whose digits sum to 19. The options given seem to be just a few primes, but maybe there are smaller primes than 199 that satisfy the condition. Let's check.\n\nFirst, is 199 a prime? Well, I know that 199 is a prime number. Okay, good.\n\nBut is there a smaller prime number than 199 whose digits sum to 19?\n\nLet's think about two-digit primes first. The largest two-digit number is 99, which is not prime, but let's consider primes less than 199.\n\nTwo-digit primes: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\n\nLet's check their digit sums:\n\n- 11: 1+1=2\n\n- 13: 1+3=4\n\n- 17: 1+7=8\n\n- 19: 1+9=10\n\n- 23: 2+3=5\n\n- 29: 2+9=11\n\n- 31: 3+1=4\n\n- 37: 3+7=10\n\n- 41: 4+1=5\n\n- 43: 4+3=7\n\n- 47: 4+7=11\n\n- 53: 5+3=8\n\n- 59: 5+9=14\n\n- 61: 6+1=7\n\n- 67: 6+7=13\n\n- 71: 7+1=8\n\n- 73: 7+3=10\n\n- 79: 7+9=16\n\n- 83: 8+3=11\n\n- 89: 8+9=17\n\n- 97: 9+7=16\n\nNone of these two-digit primes have a digit sum of 19. So, we need to look at three-digit primes.\n\nLet's consider three-digit primes starting from the smallest.\n\n101: 1+0+1=2\n\n103: 1+0+3=4\n\n107: 1+0+7=8\n\n109: 1+0+9=10\n\n113: 1+1+3=5\n\n127: 1+2+7=10\n\n131: 1+3+1=5\n\n137: 1+3+7=11\n\n139: 1+3+9=13\n\n149: 1+4+9=14\n\n151: 1+5+1=7\n\n157: 1+5+7=13\n\n163: 1+6+3=10\n\n167: 1+6+7=14\n\n173: 1+7+3=11\n\n179: 1+7+9=17\n\n181: 1+8+1=10\n\n191: 1+9+1=11\n\n193: 1+9+3=13\n\n197: 1+9+7=17\n\n199: 1+9+9=19\n\nOkay, so 199 is the first three-digit prime we've encountered with a digit sum of 19.\n\nBut is there a smaller prime than 199 that satisfies the condition? Let's check if there are any smaller three-digit primes beyond 199 that might have a digit sum of 19.\n\nWait, 199 is 199, and the next prime is 211.\n\n211: 2+1+1=4, which is not 19.\n\nThen 223: 2+2+3=7\n\n227: 2+2+7=11\n\n229: 2+2+9=13\n\n233: 2+3+3=8\n\n239: 2+3+9=14\n\n241: 2+4+1=7\n\n251: 2+5+1=8\n\n257: 2+5+7=14\n\n263: 2+6+3=11\n\n269: 2+6+9=17\n\n271: 2+7+1=10\n\n277: 2+7+7=16\n\n281: 2+8+1=11\n\n283: 2+8+3=13\n\n293: 2+9+3=14\n\n307: 3+0+7=10\n\n311: 3+1+1=5\n\n313: 3+1+3=7\n\n317: 3+1+7=11\n\n331: 3+3+1=7\n\n347: 3+4+7=14\n\n349: 3+4+9=16\n\n353: 3+5+3=11\n\n359: 3+5+9=17\n\n367: 3+6+7=16\n\n373: 3+7+3=13\n\n379: 3+7+9=19\n\nAh, 379 has a digit sum of 19. But 379 is larger than 199, so 199 is still smaller.\n\nWait, is there a smaller prime than 199 with digit sum 19? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are smaller primes in the three-digit range that I missed.\n\nLet me double-check the three-digit primes before 199.\n\nWe have:\n\n101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.\n\nFrom above, only 199 has a digit sum of 19.\n\nSo, 199 is the smallest prime whose digits sum to 19 among the options given and in the three-digit primes.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any smaller primes in the three-digit range that I might have missed.\n\nWait, perhaps there are primes below 100 that I haven't checked, but earlier I checked all two-digit primes, and none had a digit sum of 19.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are primes in the three-digit range before 199 that I didn't list.\n\nLet me list the primes again up to 199:\n\n101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.\n\nCalculating their digit sums:\n\n- 101: 1+0+1=2\n\n- 103: 1+0+3=4\n\n- 107: 1+0+7=8\n\n- 109: 1+0+9=10\n\n- 113: 1+1+3=5\n\n- 127: 1+2+7=10\n\n- 131: 1+3+1=5\n\n- 137: 1+3+7=11\n\n- 139: 1+3+9=13\n\n- 149: 1+4+9=14\n\n- 151: 1+5+1=7\n\n- 157: 1+5+7=13\n\n- 163: 1+6+3=10\n\n- 167: 1+6+7=14\n\n- 173: 1+7+3=11\n\n- 179: 1+7+9=17\n\n- 181: 1+8+1=10\n\n- 191: 1+9+1=11\n\n- 193: 1+9+3=13\n\n- 197: 1+9+7=17\n\n- 199: 1+9+9=19\n\nIndeed, 199 is the only one with a digit sum of 19.\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime whose digits sum to 19 is 199.\n\nBut wait, the options include 5, 11, 17, and 199. But 5, 11, and 17 don't have digit sums of 19, as we've checked. So, the correct answer should be 199.\n\nHowever, perhaps there is a prime smaller than 199 that I haven't considered, maybe a three-digit prime that I missed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering digit sums in a different base or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a prime number with more digits that has a digit sum of 19 and is smaller than 199, but that doesn't make sense because smaller primes would have fewer digits and thus smaller digit sums.\n\nWait, but 199 is a three-digit prime, and any prime with fewer digits would have a smaller digit sum, as we've seen.\n\nTherefore, 199 is indeed the smallest prime whose digits sum to 19.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 199.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{199} \\]"
