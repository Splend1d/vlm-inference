                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Stanley Milgram's study on obedience. So, Milgram was a social psychologist who conducted some pretty famous experiments in the 1960s to understand how people react when they're told to do something by an authority figure, especially if that something is harmful to others.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what his study was about. I remember that he set up a scenario where participants thought they were teaching students by giving them electric shocks when they answered questions wrong. The shocks were fake, but the participants didn't know that. There was an authority figure, probably in a lab coat, telling them to continue giving shocks even when the learner started complaining or screaming in pain.\n\nThe purpose was to see how far people would go in obeying authority figures, even if it meant harming others. The results were startling; a large proportion of participants continued to administer what they thought were painful shocks because the authority figure told them to.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. This seems to be about conformity, where people go along with the crowd's opinions. While related to obedience, it's not specifically about obeying authority figures, which was the focus of Milgram's study.\n\nB. This option mentions committing a crime and the influence of coercion by an authority figure. Milgram's study did involve participants being coerced by an authority figure to carry out actions that could be considered harmful or unethical. So, this seems relevant.\n\nC. This suggests that people are likely to inflict mild pain without remorse. Milgram's study actually showed that people were willing to inflict what they believed to be severe pain, not just mild, when urged by an authority figure. So, this option understates the findings.\n\nD. This option states that people are more likely to obey orders when an authority figure is present, rather than questioning those orders. This aligns closely with Milgram's findings.\n\nBetween options B and D, I need to decide which best captures the conclusion of Milgram's study. Option B mentions committing a crime, which might be a bit of an overstatement. Milgram's participants were administering what they thought were painful electric shocks, which could be considered unethical or harmful, but not necessarily criminal. Option D seems more accurate, as it directly relates to obedience to authority figures and not questioning their orders.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: When an authority figure is present, people are more likely to obey orders than to question the wisdom of the orders.\n\nHowever, to make sure, let me consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Conformity to crowd opinions is more about following the majority, not specifically obeying authority. So, it's not the best fit.\n\nOption B: While it touches on the influence of authority, the term \"crime\" might be too strong for Milgram's study. The actions were unethical, but not necessarily illegal.\n\nOption C: This doesn't capture the full extent of Milgram's findings, as participants were willing to inflict what they thought were very strong shocks, not just mild ones.\n\nOption D: This directly addresses the impact of authority on obedience, which was the central theme of Milgram's research.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
