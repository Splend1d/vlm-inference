The confidence level is related to \\(\\alpha\\) by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{confidence level} = 1 - \\alpha\n\\]\n\nSo, for a 94% confidence interval:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\alpha = 0.94 \\implies \\alpha = 0.06\n\\]\n\nSince the standard normal distribution is symmetric, the critical value \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) corresponds to the upper \\(\\alpha/2\\) percentile. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha/2 = 0.03\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the z-score that leaves an area of 0.03 in the right tail of the standard normal distribution. This can be found using a z-table or a statistical calculator.\n\nLooking up the z-score for an area of 0.97 (since the area to the left of \\(z_{0.03}\\) is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97), we find:\n\n\\[\nz_{0.03} \\approx 1.88\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the upper critical value of z to be used in constructing this 94% confidence interval is approximately 1.88.\n\nSo, the correct choice is:\n\nD. 1.88\n"
