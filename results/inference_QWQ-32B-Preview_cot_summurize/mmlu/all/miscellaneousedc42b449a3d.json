I know that one hertz means one cycle per second. It's the unit of frequency. So, if something happens once every second, it's at one hertz.\n\nNow, the question is about a megahertz. I recall that \"mega\" is a prefix in the International System of Units that stands for one million. So, a megahertz should be one million hertz.\n\nLet me confirm that. Prefix \"mega\" means 1,000,000. So, 1 megahertz (MHz) equals 1,000,000 hertz (Hz).\n\nSince one hertz is one cycle per second, then one megahertz should be one million cycles per second.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) -328716: That's negative, which doesn't make sense for frequency. Frequency can't be negative.\n\nB) 1000: That's one thousand, which is actually one kilohertz (kHz), since \"kilo\" means one thousand.\n\nC) 1000000: That's one million, which matches with what I think a megahertz is.\n\nD) 1000000000: That's one billion, which is one gigahertz (GHz), since \"giga\" means one billion.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C) 1000000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Sometimes, especially in computing, people might use different prefixes, but in standard SI units, mega indeed means one million.\n\nLet me think about another way. If I have a frequency of one megahertz, how many cycles happen in one second?\n\nSince one hertz is one cycle per second, then one megahertz is one million cycles per second.\n\nSo, option C makes sense.\n\nOption A is negative, which is impossible for frequency.\n\nOption B is only one thousand, which is too small.\n\nOption D is one billion, which is too big.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) 1000000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
