                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: x and y are directly proportional, and I know that x = 3 when y = 8. I need to find out what x is when y = 13. The options are A. 0.615, B. 4.875, C. 15, and D. 34.667. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that if two variables are directly proportional, it means that their ratio stays constant. So, x/y = k, where k is some constant. Alternatively, I've seen it expressed as x = ky, which might be easier to work with here.\n\nGiven that x = 3 when y = 8, I can plug these values into the equation to find k.\n\nSo, 3 = k * 8.\n\nTo solve for k, I'll divide both sides by 8.\n\nk = 3/8.\n\nOkay, so the constant of proportionality is 3/8.\n\nNow, I need to find x when y = 13. Using the same relationship, x = k * y.\n\nSo, x = (3/8) * 13.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 3/8 of 13.\n\nWell, 3/8 times 13.\n\nI can write 13 as 13/1, so it's (3/8) * (13/1) = (3*13)/(8*1) = 39/8.\n\nNow, 39 divided by 8.\n\nLet's see, 8 goes into 39 four times because 8*4 = 32, and 39 - 32 = 7, so it's 4 and 7/8, which is 4.875.\n\nSo, x = 4.875 when y = 13.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 4.875 matches this.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nStarting with x = ky, and given x=3 when y=8, so k=3/8.\n\nThen x = (3/8)*13 = 39/8 = 4.875.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, since x and y are directly proportional, I could set up a proportion:\n\nx1/y1 = x2/y2\n\nSo, 3/8 = x/13.\n\nThen, solve for x by cross-multiplying: x = (3*13)/8 = 39/8 = 4.875.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI could also think about it in terms of multiples. If y increases from 8 to 13, that's a multiplication by 13/8.\n\nSince x and y are directly proportional, x should also multiply by 13/8.\n\nSo, x = 3 * (13/8) = 39/8 = 4.875.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's clear that the correct answer is 4.875, which is option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there a possibility that x and y are related differently? Well, the problem specifically says they are directly proportional, so I don't think so.\n\nAlso, checking the options, they are all different values: 0.615 seems too small, 15 and 34.667 seem too large, so 4.875 is the most reasonable choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 4.875.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\, 4.875} \\]"
