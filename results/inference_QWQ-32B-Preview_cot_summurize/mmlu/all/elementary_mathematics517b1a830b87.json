                    "text": "Let's look at this number pattern: 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. I need to figure out which rule was used to create it. There are four options, and I have to decide which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should see how each number in the sequence relates to the previous one. Let's subtract each pair of consecutive numbers to find the difference.\n\n9 - 5 = 4\n\n13 - 9 = 4\n\n17 - 13 = 4\n\n21 - 17 = 4\n\n25 - 21 = 4\n\n29 - 25 = 4\n\nSo, each time, we're adding 4 to get to the next number. That's consistent throughout the sequence.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Start with 0. Add 4 each time to get the next number.\n\nB. Start with 0. Add 5 each time to get the next number.\n\nC. Start with 5. Add 4 each time to get the next number.\n\nD. Start with 5. Add 5 each time to get the next number.\n\nOption A suggests starting with 0 and adding 4 each time. Let's see what sequence that would generate:\n\n0 + 4 = 4\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n8 + 4 = 12\n\n12 + 4 = 16\n\n16 + 4 = 20\n\n20 + 4 = 24\n\n24 + 4 = 28\n\nSo, the sequence would be: 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28. That doesn't match our original sequence of 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29.\n\nOption B is to start with 0 and add 5 each time:\n\n0 + 5 = 5\n\n5 + 5 = 10\n\n10 + 5 = 15\n\n15 + 5 = 20\n\n20 + 5 = 25\n\n25 + 5 = 30\n\nSo, the sequence would be: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Again, this doesn't match our original sequence.\n\nOption C is to start with 5 and add 4 each time:\n\n5 + 4 = 9\n\n9 + 4 = 13\n\n13 + 4 = 17\n\n17 + 4 = 21\n\n21 + 4 = 25\n\n25 + 4 = 29\n\nSo, the sequence is: 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. That matches exactly with the original sequence.\n\nOption D is to start with 5 and add 5 each time:\n\n5 + 5 = 10\n\n10 + 5 = 15\n\n15 + 5 = 20\n\n20 + 5 = 25\n\n25 + 5 = 30\n\nSo, the sequence would be: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. This doesn't match the original sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is option C: Start with 5. Add 4 each time to get the next number.\n\nJust to double-check, let's see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe there's a pattern in the differences or something else I missed.\n\nLooking back, the differences between consecutive terms are all 4, as I calculated earlier. So, the common difference is 4, which rules out options B and D, since they suggest adding 5 each time.\n\nOption A starts with 0 and adds 4 each time, but our sequence starts with 5, not 0. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption C starts with 5 and adds 4 each time, which perfectly matches the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the nth term of the sequence. The general formula for an arithmetic sequence is:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nWhere:\n\n- a_n is the nth term\n\n- a_1 is the first term\n\n- d is the common difference\n\n- n is the term number\n\nIn this sequence, a_1 = 5 and d = 4.\n\nSo, for example, the second term (n=2):\n\na_2 = 5 + (2 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 4 = 9\n\nThird term (n=3):\n\na_3 = 5 + (3 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13\n\nAnd so on, which matches the sequence.\n\nIf we were to consider option A, starting with 0 and adding 4 each time, the formula would be:\n\na_n = 0 + (n - 1) * 4\n\nSo, first term (n=1): 0\n\nSecond term (n=2): 4\n\nThird term (n=3): 8\n\nAnd so on, which doesn't match.\n\nSimilarly, option B starts with 0 and adds 5 each time:\n\na_n = 0 + (n - 1) * 5\n\nFirst term: 0\n\nSecond term: 5\n\nThird term: 10\n\nEtc., which again doesn't match.\n\nOption D starts with 5 and adds 5 each time:\n\na_n = 5 + (n - 1) * 5\n\nFirst term: 5\n\nSecond term: 10\n\nThird term: 15\n\nEtc., which also doesn't match.\n\nOnly option C matches the given sequence.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the position of each term in the sequence and see if it aligns with the rule.\n\nLet's list the terms with their positions:\n\nPosition (n): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\nTerm (a_n): 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29\n\nAccording to option C, a_n = 5 + (n - 1) * 4\n\nLet's test this:\n\nFor n=1: 5 + (1 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 0 = 5\n\nn=2: 5 + (2 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 4 = 9\n\nn=3: 5 + (3 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13\n\nn=4: 5 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17\n\nn=5: 5 + (5 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 16 = 21\n\nn=6: 5 + (6 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 20 = 25\n\nn=7: 5 + (7 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 24 = 29\n\nPerfect match.\n\nIf I consider option A: a_n = 0 + (n - 1) * 4\n\nn=1: 0\n\nn=2: 4\n\nn=3: 8\n\nn=4: 12\n\nn=5: 16\n\nn=6: 20\n\nn=7: 24\n\nDoesn't match the sequence.\n\nSimilarly, option B: a_n = 0 + (n - 1) * 5\n\nn=1: 0\n\nn=2: 5\n\nn=3: 10\n\nn=4: 15\n\nn=5: 20\n\nn=6: 25\n\nn=7: 30\n\nNot a match.\n\nOption D: a_n = 5 + (n - 1) * 5\n\nn=1: 5\n\nn=2: 10\n\nn=3: 15\n\nn=4: 20\n\nn=5: 25\n\nn=6: 30\n\nn=7: 35\n\nAgain, no match.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: Start with 5. Add 4 each time to get the next number.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked multiple ways, and all of them point to option C being the correct rule for the sequence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
