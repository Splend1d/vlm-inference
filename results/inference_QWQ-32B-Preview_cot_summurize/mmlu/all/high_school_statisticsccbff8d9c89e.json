                    "text": "Let's see which statement about t-distributions isn't true. I know that t-distributions are used when working with small sample sizes or when the population standard deviation is unknown. They are similar to the normal distribution but have heavier tails, meaning they're more spread out.\n\nOption A says: \"There are different t-distributions for different values of df (degrees of freedom).\" That sounds right to me. The degrees of freedom affect the shape of the t-distribution, with smaller df leading to thicker tails and a wider spread.\n\nOption B: \"t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric.\" Yep, that matches what I know about t-distributions. They are symmetric around their mean, just like the normal distribution.\n\nOption C: \"t-distributions always have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\" Hmm, I think the mean is 0, but isn't the standard deviation different from 1, especially with smaller degrees of freedom? I might need to double-check that.\n\nOption D: \"t-distributions are more spread out than the normal distribution.\" That's consistent with what I recall. Because of the heavier tails, t-distributions have a larger spread compared to the standard normal distribution.\n\nWait a minute, let me think about option C more carefully. I believe that t-distributions do have a mean of 0, but their standard deviation isn't always 1. In fact, the standard deviation depends on the degrees of freedom. For larger df, it approaches 1, but for smaller df, it's greater than 1.\n\nTo confirm, I remember that the standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. T-distributions, especially with small df, have more variability, so their standard deviation should be greater than 1.\n\nLet me check a reference or recall the formula for the standard deviation of a t-distribution. I think the standard deviation of a t-distribution with df degrees of freedom is sqrt(df/(df-2)), provided df > 2. So, for df = 5, for example, the standard deviation would be sqrt(5/3) \u2248 1.29, which is greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, option C is not true because t-distributions do not always have a standard deviation of 1; it varies depending on the degrees of freedom.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's verify the other options again.\n\nOption A: Different df lead to different t-distributions. That's correct.\n\nOption B: Bell-shaped and symmetric. Correct.\n\nOption D: More spread out than the normal distribution. Correct.\n\nYes, option C is the one that's not true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
