                    "text": "Let's see. So, in this scenario, we have a plaintiff suing a defendant for false imprisonment. The plaintiff calls a witness to testify that the incident happened on a particular date. But in an affidavit the witness made for trial, he said it happened on a different date. The witness already testified on the stand but wasn't asked about this discrepancy. Now, after the witness has left the stand, the defendant's attorney wants to introduce the affidavit as evidence. The question is, how should the trial judge rule on this?\n\nFirst, I need to think about the rules of evidence here. Specifically, I need to consider whether this affidavit can be used as substantive evidence, for impeachment purposes, or if it's inadmissible for some reason.\n\nOption A says it's admissible as substantive evidence. Substantive evidence is evidence that's offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the affidavit is stating that the incident occurred on a different date. If the defendant wants to use this to prove that the incident actually happened on that different date, then it would be substantive evidence. But I need to check if affidavits can be used this way.\n\nGenerally, affidavits are written statements under oath, often used in pre-trial proceedings or in places where oral testimony isn't feasible. However, in a trial, the preferred method is to have witnesses testify orally so they can be cross-examined. Using an affidavit as substantive evidence might not align with this principle, especially if the witness is available to testify orally.\n\nOption B says it's admissible for impeachment purposes only. Impeachment is when you challenge the credibility of a witness. If there's a discrepancy between the witness's trial testimony and a prior statement like an affidavit, that can be used to impeach the witness's credibility. So, if the witness said one date in court and a different date in the affidavit, that inconsistency can be brought up to suggest that the witness isn't reliable.\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible because the defendant's attorney failed to question the witness about the affidavit while on the stand. This touches on the concept ofimpeachment at the time of testimony. Typically, if you have information that can impeach a witness, you need to bring it up when the witness is testifying so they can respond to it. If you don't do that, you might be seen as sandbagging or trying to ambush the other side.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The affidavit is a written statement made out of court, and if it's being offered to prove that the incident happened on a different date, that would be hearsay.\n\nBut there are exceptions to the hearsay rule, and one of them is for impeachment purposes. Prior inconsistent statements can be used to impeach a witness's credibility, even if they would otherwise be hearsay.\n\nGiven all this, let's evaluate the options.\n\nOption A: Admissible as substantive evidence. As I thought earlier, using an affidavit as substantive evidence might not be allowed because the preferred method is oral testimony with cross-examination. Affidavits don't allow for cross-examination at the time of the statement. So, this might not be the best choice.\n\nOption B: Admissible for impeachment purposes only. This seems plausible because the affidavit contains a statement that contradicts the witness's trial testimony. This inconsistency can be used to question the witness's reliability or truthfulness.\n\nOption C: Inadmissible because the defendant's attorney failed to question the witness about the affidavit while on the stand. This is an important point. Typically, if you have information that can impeach a witness, you should bring it up during cross-examination so that the witness has an opportunity to explain or reconcile the inconsistency. If you don't do that, it might be seen as unfair to introduce it later.\n\nOption D: Inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception. While the affidavit would be hearsay if used to prove the truth of the matter, there is an exception for prior inconsistent statements used for impeachment.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that option C is the most appropriate. The defendant's attorney should have questioned the witness about the affidavit while the witness was still on the stand. By failing to do so, they may have waived the right to use the affidavit for impeachment purposes. Allowing the affidavit in after the witness has left the stand could be seen as unfair because the witness doesn't have the opportunity to explain or clarify the discrepancy.\n\nAdditionally, even if the affidavit could be used for impeachment, using it as substantive evidence might not be allowed due to the hearsay rule, unless there's an exception that applies.\n\nTherefore, the trial judge should likely rule that the affidavit is inadmissible because the defendant's attorney failed to question the witness about it while the witness was still available to respond.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
