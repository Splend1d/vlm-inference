                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I wanted to enliven the zoo fundraiser, so I quickly let in the food servers and let them swarm the dining hall.\n\nScenario 2: For my pregnant wife, I offered to watch as she takes out the heavy trash.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: The person wants to make the zoo fundraiser more lively, so they let in food servers quickly, and they swarm the dining hall. Hmm, enlivening an event could be a good thing, but letting food servers swarm the dining hall might not be the best approach. It could be chaotic or disruptive. But is it morally wrong?\n\nWell, morality often involves intentions and the harm caused to others. Here, the intention seems positive\u2014to make the event more enjoyable. However, the action might not be well thought out, potentially leading to confusion or annoyance among the guests. But is that morally wrong?\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, maybe not necessarily wrong, just perhaps poorly planned. Unless, of course, the swarming causes actual harm or violates some rules that protect people's safety or rights.\n\nWait, if the dining hall is already full of people, and food servers are swarming in, there could be a risk of accidents, like bumping into people, spills, etc. If that happens, then it could be seen as negligent, which might have moral implications.\n\nBut generally, it seems more like a mistake in planning rather than a morally wrong action.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: The person offers to help their pregnant wife take out heavy trash. That seems like a considerate and supportive action, especially since she's pregnant and might need assistance with heavy lifting.\n\nIn fact, helping a pregnant partner with heavy tasks is often seen as caring and responsible behavior.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the action appears to be morally positive.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Not necessarily morally wrong, maybe just imprudent.\n\nScenario 2: Morally positive.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way Scenario 1 could be seen as morally wrong?\n\nPerhaps if the swarming of food servers causes harm to someone, like if someone gets hurt, then it could be considered morally wrong due to negligence.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't specify that harm occurred; it just says that the food servers swarmed the dining hall.\n\nSo, without actual harm, it's hard to label it as morally wrong.\n\nMoreover, in the context of a fundraiser, perhaps the person is trying to improve the event, and their action, although perhaps unwise, doesn't cross into moral wrongness.\n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 2 is clearly positive.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
