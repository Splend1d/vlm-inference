                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Keiko spent the day bird watching and counted birds in the morning and in the afternoon. It says she counted 34 more birds in the morning than in the afternoon, and the total number of birds she counted throughout the day was 76. We need to find out how many birds she counted in the afternoon.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being asked. We have two quantities here: the number of birds counted in the morning and the number counted in the afternoon. We're told that the morning count is 34 more than the afternoon count, and together, they add up to 76.\n\nI think it would help to define variables for these quantities. Let's let A represent the number of birds counted in the afternoon. Then, since the morning count is 34 more than the afternoon, we can express the morning count as A + 34.\n\nNow, the total number of birds counted is the sum of the morning and afternoon counts, which is A + (A + 34) = 76.\n\nSo, combining like terms, that's 2A + 34 = 76.\n\nTo find A, I'll subtract 34 from both sides of the equation: 2A = 76 - 34, which is 2A = 42.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2: A = 42 / 2 = 21.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check.\n\nIf A = 21, then the morning count is A + 34 = 21 + 34 = 55.\n\nTotal birds: 21 + 55 = 76, which matches the total given.\n\nSo, the afternoon count is 21 birds.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 21 birds\n\nB. 40 birds\n\nC. 42 birds\n\nD. 84 birds\n\nOption A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see what would happen if we chose another option.\n\nFor example, option B: 40 birds in the afternoon.\n\nThen, morning count would be 40 + 34 = 74 birds.\n\nTotal: 40 + 74 = 114, which is more than the total given (76), so that doesn't work.\n\nOption C: 42 birds in the afternoon.\n\nMorning count: 42 + 34 = 76.\n\nTotal: 42 + 76 = 118, which is again more than 76.\n\nOption D: 84 birds in the afternoon.\n\nMorning count: 84 + 34 = 118.\n\nTotal: 84 + 118 = 202, which is way more than 76.\n\nSo, indeed, only option A makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet's consider the difference between the morning and afternoon counts. The morning count is 34 more than the afternoon count. So, the difference is 34 birds.\n\nWe know that the total count is 76 birds.\n\nThis seems like a classic problem of dividing a total into two parts where one part is larger than the other by a given amount.\n\nThere's a formula for this: the smaller part is (total - difference)/2.\n\nIn this case, the smaller part is the afternoon count, which would be (76 - 34)/2 = 42/2 = 21.\n\nAgain, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, the larger part (morning count) would be (total + difference)/2.\n\nSo, (76 + 34)/2 = 110/2 = 55, which is indeed 34 more than 21.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nI think the answer is definitely 21 birds in the afternoon.\n\nIt's interesting to see how different approaches lead to the same conclusion.\n\nThis problem is a good example of how to set up and solve equations based on given conditions.\n\nIt also shows the importance of checking your work by plugging the values back into the original conditions to ensure they make sense.\n\nIn real-life situations, such as in bird watching or other data collection activities, being able to accurately count and analyze quantities is crucial.\n\nKeiko's bird watching not only helps her connect with nature but also provides an opportunity to apply mathematical concepts in a practical context.\n\nOverall, this problem demonstrates the relevance of mathematics in everyday activities and highlights the importance of developing problem-solving skills.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
