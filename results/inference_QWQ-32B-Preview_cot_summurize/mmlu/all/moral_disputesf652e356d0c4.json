                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these options isn't an example of a self-evident proposition according to Aquinas. First, I should probably understand what Aquinas meant by a self-evident proposition.\n\nFrom what I recall, Aquinas, in his work \"Summa Theologica,\" discusses self-evident truths. He distinguishes between propositions that are self-evident in themselves and those that are self-evident to us. Propositions that are self-evident in themselves are those where the predicate is contained in the subject. For example, \"a triangle has three sides\" is self-evident in itself because the concept of \"three sides\" is inherent in the definition of a \"triangle.\"\n\nHowever, some propositions may be self-evident in themselves but not self-evident to us because we may not understand the terms involved fully. For instance, complex mathematical truths might be self-evident in themselves but not immediately obvious to everyone.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. \"Every whole is greater than its part.\" This seems like a self-evident proposition. If something is a whole, it includes all its parts, so it must be greater than any single part. This aligns with Aquinas's idea of self-evident truths.\n\nB. \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.\" This phrase seems to be from a religious text, possibly the Bible. It's a statement of faith or a poetic expression of divine presence. It doesn't appear to be a self-evident proposition in the same way as a logical or mathematical truth. Aquinas, being a theologian, would certainly consider religious truths to be self-evident in a different sense, but in the context of his discussion on self-evident propositions in philosophy, this might not fit.\n\nC. \"Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another.\" This is a fundamental principle in mathematics and logic, often referred to as the transitive property of equality. It's self-evident because if A equals B and B equals C, then A equals C. Aquinas would likely consider this a self-evident proposition.\n\nD. \"Man is a rational being.\" This is a definition of man in classical philosophy, including in Aristotle and Aquinas's own works. It's self-evident in the sense that if something is a man, it possesses reason. However, it might require some understanding of the terms \"man\" and \"rational being.\"\n\nComparing these, option B stands out because it's a religious statement, whereas the others are more philosophical or logical propositions. Aquinas, in his philosophical works, would treat religious truths differently, often requiring faith or divine revelation rather than being self-evident in a purely rational sense.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.\" This is not an example of a self-evident proposition in the same way as the others.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
