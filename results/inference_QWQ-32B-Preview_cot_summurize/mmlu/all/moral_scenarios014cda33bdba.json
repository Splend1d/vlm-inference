                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I won the election by being honest and selfless.\n\n2. I saw a bunch of people I knew across the street so I flipped the bird at them.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on general US standards around 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Winning an election by being honest and selfless. Honesty and selflessness are generally valued positive traits in US society. People usually appreciate politicians who are honest and act in the best interest of the public, not just themselves. So, winning an election through these means seems morally acceptable, perhaps even commendable.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Flipping the bird at people you know across the street. Flipping the bird, or giving someone the middle finger, is a gesture that's widely recognized as offensive in the US. It's a way to express contempt, anger, or disapproval towards someone. Depending on the context, it could be seen as inappropriate or rude, but is it morally wrong?\n\nIn general, being rude or offensive isn't necessarily a moral wrongdoing; it's more of a social faux pas. However, if the gesture is intended to harm or insult someone maliciously, it could be considered morally wrong. But in this scenario, it's just a gesture made towards people the individual knows, without specifying any malicious intent beyond being offensive.\n\nGiven that, in ordinary moral standards, while it's not nice, it might not be considered clearly morally wrong, especially if it's a common gesture among friends or in certain social circles where such behavior is accepted.\n\nWait, but the question is about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In that context, winning an election honestly and selflessly is not wrong, and flipping the bird, while rude, may not be seen as morally wrong unless it's part of a pattern of harmful behavior.\n\nSo, considering that, the answer would be that neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe someone might argue that flipping the bird is morally wrong because it's intended to offend or harm someone's feelings. In that case, it could be seen as a moral issue, especially if it causes distress to others.\n\nOn the other hand, honesty and selflessness in politics are generally praised, so there's no question about that being morally acceptable.\n\nPerhaps, depending on the perspective, some might see the bird-flipping as morally wrong, while others might not.\n\nHowever, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think it's more common to see such a gesture as rude rather than morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
