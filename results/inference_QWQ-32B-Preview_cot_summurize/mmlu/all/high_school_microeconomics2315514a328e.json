                    "text": "So I've got this question about income elasticity for DVDs, and it's saying that the income elasticity is +1.5. I need to figure out what that means from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what income elasticity of demand is. It's a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumers' income. The formula is:\n\nIncome Elasticity (\u03b7) = (% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in income)\n\nIn this case, \u03b7 = +1.5\n\nSo, if income increases by 10%, the quantity demanded increases by 15% because 1.5 times 10% is 15%.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. a 10 percent increase in income produces a 15 percent increase in consumption of DVDs. DVDs are a normal luxury good.\n\nB. a 10 percent increase in income produces a 15 percent increase in consumption of DVDs. DVDs are an inferior good.\n\nC. a 10 percent increase in income produces a 15 percent decrease in consumption of DVDs. DVDs are an inferior good.\n\nD. a 10 percent increase in the price of DVDs produces a 15 percent decrease in consumption of DVDs. DVDs are a price elastic good.\n\nLet's evaluate each one:\n\nOption A says that a 10% increase in income leads to a 15% increase in consumption, and DVDs are a normal luxury good. That matches with our calculation since \u03b7 = +1.5, which is greater than 1, indicating that DVDs are a luxury good. Normal goods have positive income elasticity, and luxury goods have income elasticity greater than 1.\n\nOption B says the same percentage change but calls DVDs an inferior good. Inferior goods have negative income elasticity, meaning that as income increases, the quantity demanded decreases. But here, the quantity demanded increases with income, so this can't be correct.\n\nOption C says that a 10% increase in income leads to a 15% decrease in consumption, and DVDs are an inferior good. Well, inferior goods do have negative income elasticity, but here, the quantity demanded is decreasing as income increases, which matches the definition. However, our given elasticity is +1.5, which is positive, so this doesn't fit.\n\nOption D talks about price elasticity, not income elasticity. It's discussing how quantity demanded changes with price, not with income. The price elasticity of demand (\u03b5) is (% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in price). This is irrelevant to the income elasticity given in the question.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems correct because it matches both the percentage changes and the type of good associated with that income elasticity.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's recall:\n\n- Normal goods: positive income elasticity (+ve \u03b7)\n\n- Inferior goods: negative income elasticity (-ve \u03b7)\n\n- Necessities: income elasticity between 0 and 1\n\n- Luxuries: income elasticity greater than 1\n\nGiven that \u03b7 = +1.5, DVDs are normal luxury goods, which aligns with option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
