Let's go through the steps to find \\( x \\).\n\n1. **Start with the equation:**\n   \\[\n   x + 2.7 = 8.4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isolate \\( x \\):**\n   To isolate \\( x \\), we need to get rid of the 2.7 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2.7 from both sides of the equation. This keeps the equation balanced.\n\n   \\[\n   x + 2.7 - 2.7 = 8.4 - 2.7\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify both sides:**\n   On the left side, \\( 2.7 - 2.7 \\) cancels out, leaving us with \\( x \\). On the right side, we need to subtract 2.7 from 8.4.\n\n   \\[\n   x = 8.4 - 2.7\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the subtraction:**\n   To subtract 2.7 from 8.4, we can align the decimal points and subtract:\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{r}\n   8.4 \\\\\n  -2.7 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   5.7 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n   So, \\( 8.4 - 2.7 = 5.7 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the value of \\( x \\) is 5.7.\n\nNow, let's look at the given options to see which one matches our solution:\n\nA. 11.1\n\nB. 5.7\n\nC. 3.7\n\nD. 22.68\n\nOur solution is \\( x = 5.7 \\), which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
