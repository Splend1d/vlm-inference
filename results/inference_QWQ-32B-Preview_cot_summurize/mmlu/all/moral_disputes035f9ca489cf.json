                    "text": " I'm trying to figure out this question about Lukianoff and Haidt's views on disinviting speakers at colleges and universities. The options are:\n\nA. It's an example of mental filtering.\n\nB. It promotes intellectual homogeneity.\n\nC. It encourages students to disregard positive aspects of a person's history.\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Lukianoff and Haidt have said about this topic. I think they are discussing the phenomenon where certain speakers are disinvited from campuses because their views are considered offensive or harmful by some students or administrators.\n\nOption A mentions \"mental filtering,\" which sounds like a psychological term. I believe mental filtering is when people only pay attention to information that confirms their preexisting beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them. So, if disinviting speakers is an example of mental filtering, it might mean that students or administrators are only wanting to hear from speakers who agree with their views and filtering out those who don't.\n\nOption B talks about promoting \"intellectual homogeneity.\" That means creating an environment where everyone thinks alike, and there's little diversity of thought. If speakers are disinvited because their views are different, that could lead to a campus where only certain viewpoints are expressed, resulting in a homogeneous intellectual environment.\n\nOption C says that disinviting speakers encourages students to disregard positive aspects of a person's history. This might refer to the practice of some students focusing only on a speaker's controversial or offensive statements and ignoring their positive contributions or achievements.\n\nNow, considering all this, is the answer D, \"All of the above\"? Or is only some of these points accurate according to Lukianoff and Haidt?\n\nI remember that in their book \"The Coddling of the American Mind,\" Lukianoff and Haidt criticize the trend of disinviting speakers and argue that it hinders the development of critical thinking and exposure to diverse ideas. They likely see disinviting speakers as a way to create an echo chamber where only certain viewpoints are tolerated.\n\nSo, regarding option A, mental filtering, it makes sense that if students or administrators are disinviting speakers who hold differing opinions, they might be engaging in mental filtering by only wanting to hear views that align with their own.\n\nOption B, promoting intellectual homogeneity, directly follows from disinviting speakers with diverse viewpoints. If only certain types of speakers are allowed, the intellectual discourse on campus becomes uniform, lacking the richness that comes from diverse perspectives.\n\nOption C, encouraging students to disregard positive aspects of a person's history, might be a bit more nuanced. It's possible that in the zeal to disinvite speakers based on offensive views or actions, students might overlook the positive contributions those speakers have made in other areas. However, whether Lukianoff and Haidt specifically argue this point, I'm not entirely sure.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is D, \"All of the above,\" because all these points seem plausible and align with the general arguments Lukianoff and Haidt make about the harms of disinviting speakers. But to be thorough, I should consider if there's any reason to think they don't endorse one of these options.\n\nUpon reflection, I think they would agree with all three points. They likely see disinviting speakers as a form of mental filtering, leading to intellectual homogeneity, and possibly causing students to dismiss the positive aspects of a person's history solely based on controversial views or actions.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. All of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
