The host received more than 2500 emails, and 82% of them supported the death penalty for selling drugs to children. The question is asking what this shows, and it presents four options to choose from.\n\nLet's break down each option to understand them better:\n\n**Option A: The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.**\n\nVoluntary response bias occurs when the sample consists of people who choose themselves to participate, often because they have strong opinions about the topic. In this case, the host publicized an email address for responses, and only those who felt strongly enough to email did so. This can lead to overrepresentation of extreme views, as people with mild opinions might not bother to respond. Therefore, the results may not reflect the true opinions of the general population or even the host's entire audience.\n\n**Option B: No meaningful conclusion is possible without knowing something more about the characteristics of his listeners.**\n\nThis option suggests that to draw any meaningful conclusion, we need more information about the audience. For example, their demographics, their relationship to the topic, or how representative they are of the general population. Without this context, it's hard to generalize the findings beyond the respondents.\n\n**Option C: The survey would have been more meaningful if he had picked a random sample of the 2500 listeners who responded.**\n\nThis option proposes that selecting a random sample from the respondents could have improved the survey's meaning. However, this might not necessarily address the voluntary response bias issue because the sample is still drawn from a self-selected group. Random sampling from this group would make the sample representative of the respondents but not necessarily of the general population or the host's entire audience.\n\n**Option D: The survey would have been more meaningful if he had used a control group.**\n\nA control group is typically used in experiments to compare against the group that receives the treatment. In this survey context, it's unclear what a control group would be or how it would enhance the meaning of the results. The survey is about opinions, not about testing a treatment or intervention.\n\nConsidering these points, the most appropriate answer seems to be **Option A: The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.**\n\nVoluntary response bias is a significant issue here because the respondents are self-selected and likely have strong opinions, which may not be representative of the overall audience or the general public. While Option B also has merit, as knowing more about the listeners could provide context, the core problem remains the voluntary response bias.\n\nOption C doesn't resolve the bias issue, and Option D is not applicable in this survey context. Therefore, Option A is the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
