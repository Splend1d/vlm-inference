The question is about Valls' definition of terrorism, specifically what he includes in his definition of \"violence.\" The options are:\n\nA. Only bodily harm to persons.\n\nB. Bodily harm to persons and destruction of property.\n\nC. Only destruction of property.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Valls' stance on terrorism. I remember that Valls is a philosopher who has written about terrorism, and he provides a definition that distinguishes terrorism from other forms of violence. I think he emphasizes the intention behind the violence, that it's meant to spread fear and achieve political goals.\n\nBut the question is specifically about what he includes in his definition of \"violence.\" Does he consider only harm to people as violence, or does he also include destruction of property?\n\nI recall that in many definitions of terrorism, violence often includes both harm to individuals and damage to property. Destroying property can be a way to instill fear and disrupt society, which are key aspects of terrorism.\n\nLooking back at Valls' definition, I think he includes both bodily harm and property destruction under the umbrella of violence in the context of terrorism. He likely argues that terrorism involves violent acts aimed at civilians or property to create a climate of fear for political purposes.\n\nSo, if he includes both bodily harm and destruction of property in his definition of violence within terrorism, then option B would be the correct answer.\n\nBut I should double-check this. Maybe he only considers harm to persons as violence, or perhaps he has a different perspective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he has a more nuanced view where violence isn't just about the act itself but about the intent behind it. However, the question is specifically about how he defines \"violence\" in his definition of terrorism.\n\nI think it's safe to say that in the context of terrorism, violence typically encompasses both harm to individuals and destruction of property, as both can be used to instill fear and achieve political objectives.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the most comprehensive and likely correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if Valls might have a different perspective. Perhaps he only considers harm to persons as true violence, viewing property destruction as a separate issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he includes other elements beyond just these two, which could make option D, \"none of the above,\" possible.\n\nHowever, based on standard definitions of terrorism and my recall of Valls' work, I believe option B is the best choice.\n\nSo, my answer is B. Including bodily harm to persons and the destruction of property.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
