I remember that metalloids have properties in between metals and nonmetals. They're kind of like semiconductors.\n\nFirst, I should look at where these elements are located on the periodic table. Metalloids are usually found along the staircase line between metals and nonmetals. Let me recall the positions:\n\n- Cr is chromium, which is in group 6B (now often labeled as group 6) and period 4. That's in the transition metals area, which are typically metals.\n\n- Mn is manganese, also in group 7B (group 7) and period 4, another transition metal.\n\n- Si is silicon, in group 4A (group 14) and period 3. That's right between metals and nonmetals.\n\n- S is sulfur, in group 6A (group 16) and period 3, which is typically nonmetallic.\n\nSo, silicon is right on the staircase line, which suggests it's a metalloid. Sulfur is to the right of the staircase, making it a nonmetal. Chromium and manganese are transition metals, which are metals.\n\nBut just to be sure, I should remember some properties of metalloids. They typically have semiconductor properties, meaning they can conduct electricity better than nonmetals but not as well as metals. They also have intermediate electronegativities and melting points.\n\nLet me think about silicon. I know that silicon is used in semiconductors, like in computer chips. That sounds like metalloid behavior. Sulfur, on the other hand, is a nonmetal and is an insulator, not a semiconductor.\n\nChromium and manganese are metals, so they're good conductors of electricity and heat, which is different from metalloids.\n\nSo, based on their positions on the periodic table and their properties, silicon is the metalloid among these options.\n\nWait a minute, there are other elements that are considered metalloids, like boron, germanium, arsenic, antimony, tellurium, and polonium. But in this list, silicon is the only one that's a metalloid.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing about chromium or manganese. But no, they're both transition metals, which are definitely metals, not metalloids.\n\nSulfur is definitely a nonmetal; it's a yellow solid that forms compounds like sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid.\n\nSo, the answer should be silicon, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
