                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the role of non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, in the global defense trade. So, first off, what even is the global defense trade? It's basically the buying and selling of weapons and military technology between countries and companies around the world. It's a big deal because it can influence security, conflict, and even human rights in different parts of the globe.\n\nNow, NGOs are organizations that aren't part of government or profit-driven companies. They usually focus on specific issues they care about, like environmental protection, human rights, or, in this case, arms control. So, what role do they play in something as serious as the global defense trade?\n\nOption A says that NGOs are the primary actors in modern arms control measures. Hmm, that sounds a bit strong. Primary actors usually are governments because they're the ones making laws and treaties. NGOs might influence them, but they don't have the power to enforce arms control by themselves. So, maybe A is too bold.\n\nOption B claims that NGOs can't access the resources and information needed to develop effective policy or action on arms control. I don't think that's accurate. Many NGOs work hard to research and expose issues in the defense trade. They publish reports, conduct investigations, and even use technology like satellite imagery to monitor arms flows. So, they do have access to significant resources and information.\n\nOption C says that NGOs have played a significant and effective role in developing arms control measures recently. This sounds promising. There are examples where NGOs have brought attention to the negative impacts of arms sales, lobbied for stricter regulations, and even helped draft international agreements. So, this seems like a plausible answer.\n\nOption D suggests there's a serious lack of involvement by non-governmental actors in controlling the global defense trade. But considering that many NGOs are actively working on this issue, I think this is not accurate.\n\nLet me think about this some more. One notable example is the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which included numerous NGOs and eventually led to the Ottawa Treaty banning landmines. Similarly, the Control Arms campaign pushed for the Arms Trade Treaty, which sets global standards for the international transfer of weapons. These are clear instances where NGOs have had a significant impact on arms control.\n\nOn the other hand, while NGOs can influence policies and public opinion, they can't enforce laws or regulate the trade themselves. That power lies with governments and international bodies. So, perhaps their role is important but not primary.\n\nAlso, while some NGOs have extensive resources and access to information, others might struggle in this regard. The field is probably varied in terms of the capabilities of different organizations.\n\nGiven all this, I think option C is the best answer: Non-governmental groups have played a significant and effective role in developing arms control measures in recent years. They've been instrumental in raising awareness, advocating for change, and contributing to policy development, even if they're not the sole or primary actors in implementing those controls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
