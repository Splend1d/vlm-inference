The options are:\n\nA. Gab\n\nB. ~Gba\n\nC. aGb\n\nD. Gba\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what \"Alexis is greeted by Ben\" means in terms of who is greeting whom. Greeting is an action that one person does to another, so it's important to see who is doing the greeting and who is receiving it.\n\nIn the phrase \"Alexis is greeted by Ben,\" it sounds like Ben is the one doing the greeting, and Alexis is receiving it. So, Ben is greeting Alexis.\n\nNow, looking at the predicate Gxy, which means x greets y. So, if Ben is greeting Alexis, that would be Gba, where b is Ben and a is Alexis.\n\nLet me check the options:\n\nA. Gab \u2013 this would mean a greets b, so Alexis greets Ben. But according to the sentence, it's the other way around.\n\nB. ~Gba \u2013 this means not Gba, so not (Ben greets Alexis). But the sentence says that Alexis is greeted by Ben, which means Ben does greet Alexis, so this would be incorrect.\n\nC. aGb \u2013 I'm not sure about this notation. Usually, in predicate logic, we have Gxy, so Gab or Gba. Maybe this is a typo or an alternative notation where aGb means a greets b, which would be the same as Gab. If that's the case, then it would again mean Alexis greets Ben, which is not what the sentence says.\n\nD. Gba \u2013 this matches what I thought: Ben greets Alexis.\n\nSo, between these options, D seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure that aGb isn't a different notation. Sometimes, different texts use different notations for predicates. Maybe aGb is meant to represent a is greeted by b, which would fit the sentence.\n\nHmm.\n\nLooking back, in the problem, Gxy is defined as x greets y. So, Gba would be Ben greets Alexis, which matches the sentence.\n\nBut maybe aGb is intended to mean a is greeted by b, which would also match the sentence.\n\nIf that's the case, then both C and D could be correct, but that can't be right because there should be only one correct answer.\n\nWait, perhaps aGb is not standard notation, and the standard is Gxy, where x and y are placeholders for the subjects.\n\nGiven that, and considering the definition provided, Gba is the correct translation.\n\nTherefore, option D is the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
