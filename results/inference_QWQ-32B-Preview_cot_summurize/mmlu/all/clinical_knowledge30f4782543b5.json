                    "text": "So I've got this question about blood types and compatibility, specifically for someone with blood group B that's rhesus negative. I need to figure out which blood types can be safely transfused into this person. Let's see what options are given and think through this step by step.\n\nOption A says: Blood type AB rhesus negative, blood type B, and blood type O rhesus negative.\n\nOption B: Blood type B rhesus positive and blood type O rhesus positive.\n\nOption C: Blood type B rhesus negative and blood type O rhesus negative.\n\nOption D: Blood type B rhesus negative only.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic rules of blood type compatibility. I know that blood types are determined by antigens on the surface of red blood cells. For the ABO system, there are A, B, and O types, based on the presence of A and B antigens. Rhesus factor is another antigen, either positive or negative.\n\nFor transfusions, the general rule is that you can't give someone blood that their body will recognize as foreign and attack. So, their body should not have antibodies against the antigens in the donated blood.\n\nPeople with type B blood have B antigens on their red cells and anti-A antibodies in their plasma. So, they can receive blood from type B or type O, because O has no A or B antigens.\n\nBut here, it's type B negative. So, we also have to consider the rhesus factor. Rhesus negative individuals don't have D antigens, and they can receive rhesus negative blood without risking an immune reaction to the D antigen.\n\nSo, for someone who is B negative, they can receive:\n\n- B negative: same blood type, no issues.\n\n- O negative: universal donor, no A, B, or D antigens.\n\nBut wait, option A includes AB negative, which is not typically compatible. AB has A and B antigens, which a type B person shouldn't have trouble with, but I think AB blood has A and B antigens on the cells, so it might not be the best choice. Actually, AB is the universal recipient, but for donors, it's more complicated.\n\nOption B has B positive and O positive. But for rhesus negative recipients, giving rhesus positive blood can cause problems because the recipient's body may produce antibodies against the D antigen. So, generally, rhesus negative people should receive rhesus negative blood to avoid sensitization.\n\nOption C has B negative and O negative, which seems correct based on what I just said.\n\nOption D says only B negative, but I thought O negative is also safe.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up the specific compatibility chart for transfusions.\n\nOkay, looking at standard transfusion charts, for a recipient with type B negative blood, the compatible donor blood types are:\n\n- B negative\n\n- O negative\n\nSo, that matches option C.\n\nOption A includes AB negative, which isn't typically recommended for B negative recipients, although it might not cause an immediate reaction, it's not the best practice.\n\nOption B has B positive and O positive, which could cause rhesus incompatibility in the recipient.\n\nOption D is too restrictive because O negative is also safe.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option C: blood type B rhesus negative and blood type O rhesus negative.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
