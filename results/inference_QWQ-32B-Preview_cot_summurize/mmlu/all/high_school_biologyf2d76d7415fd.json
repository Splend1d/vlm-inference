I and III.\n\nTo explain a bit more, chemiosmosis is a key mechanism in both cellular respiration (which happens in mitochondria) and photosynthesis (which occurs in chloroplasts). In both processes, energy is harnessed by creating a proton gradient across a membrane, which is then used to produce ATP.\n\nIn mitochondria, during cellular respiration, electrons are passed through the electron transport chain, pumping protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. This creates a proton gradient, with a higher concentration of protons in the intermembrane space. ATP synthase then uses the energy from these protons flowing back into the matrix to produce ATP.\n\nSimilarly, in chloroplasts, during photosynthesis, light energy is used to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane, from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen. This creates a proton gradient, and when protons flow back into the stroma through ATP synthase, ATP is produced.\n\nSo, chemiosmosis is a fundamental process in both of these organelles, but it doesn't occur in the nucleus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
