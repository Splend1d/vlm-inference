                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which group of countries has high secondary school enrollment as of 2020, and all of them are less developed countries. So, first, I need to understand what \"less developed countries\" means. I think it refers to countries that are still developing, maybe with lower GDP or less industrialized compared to developed nations.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.\n\nB. Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, and Costa Rica.\n\nC. Uruguay, Costa Rica, Timor-Leste, and Pakistan.\n\nD. Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.\n\nI need to check which of these countries have high secondary school enrollment. But I don't have the exact numbers, so I need to make an educated guess based on what I know about these countries.\n\nLet's start with option A: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.\n\nI know that Uruguay is known for its strong education system, and Costa Rica also has a good reputation in education. Colombia and Peru are also making progress, but I'm not sure about their secondary enrollment rates.\n\nOption B: Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, and Costa Rica.\n\nBhutan is known for its unique development index, Gross National Happiness, but I'm not sure about its education statistics. Niger is a country in Africa that might have lower development indicators. Cambodia has been improving, but I'm not sure about its secondary enrollment.\n\nOption C: Uruguay, Costa Rica, Timor-Leste, and Pakistan.\n\nUruguay and Costa Rica again, which are likely to have higher enrollment. Timor-Leste is a newly independent country and might have lower enrollment. Pakistan is a developing country, but I'm not sure about its secondary enrollment rates.\n\nOption D: Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.\n\nAgain, Uruguay and Costa Rica are likely to have higher enrollment, but Bhutan and Cambodia might not.\n\nWait, the question says \"less developed countries,\" but it also mentions that they have different levels of secondary school enrollment. So, perhaps some of these countries are less developed but have higher enrollment in secondary schools.\n\nBut to make it clearer, maybe I should look for countries that, despite being less developed, have managed to achieve high secondary school enrollment.\n\nLet me consider Uruguay and Costa Rica first. I know that both of these countries have relatively stronger education systems compared to some other less developed countries.\n\nUruguay, for example, is known for its universal education system and high literacy rates. Costa Rica also prioritizes education and has a relatively strong education sector.\n\nNow, looking at the other countries:\n\nColombia: It's a developing country, and I think it has been making strides in education, but I'm not sure about its secondary enrollment rate.\n\nPeru: Similar to Colombia, it's a developing country with improving education indicators, but again, not sure about secondary enrollment.\n\nBhutan: It's a small country in South Asia, known for its unique development philosophy. I'm not sure about its secondary enrollment.\n\nNiger: It's one of the least developed countries in the world, and I doubt it has high secondary enrollment.\n\nCambodia: It's been improving, but I think its secondary enrollment is still lower compared to some other countries.\n\nTimor-Leste: A recently independent country, and its education system is still developing.\n\nPakistan: A large developing country with varying levels of development, and I don't think its secondary enrollment is particularly high.\n\nSo, considering all this, option A has Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica. Uruguay and Costa Rica are likely to have high secondary enrollment, but I'm not sure about Colombia and Peru.\n\nOption D has Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica. Uruguay and Costa Rica again, but Bhutan and Cambodia might not have high secondary enrollment.\n\nOption C has Uruguay, Costa Rica, Timor-Leste, and Pakistan. Again, Uruguay and Costa Rica, but the other two might not have high enrollment.\n\nOption B has Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, and Costa Rica. Costa Rica likely has high enrollment, but the others probably don't.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is to identify the group where all countries have high secondary enrollment, despite being less developed.\n\nIn that case, option A seems the most plausible, with Uruguay and Costa Rica definitely having high enrollment, and Colombia and Peru possibly having higher enrollment compared to the other countries listed.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to identify a group where some less developed countries have managed to achieve high secondary enrollment.\n\nIn that case, perhaps option D, which includes Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica, where Uruguay and Costa Rica have high enrollment, while Bhutan and Cambodia might be struggling more.\n\nBut the question specifies \"have different levels of secondary school enrollment,\" which might suggest that within the group, there are variations.\n\nWait, the question says \"different less developed countries have different levels of secondary school enrollment.\" Then, it asks which group of countries has high secondary-school enrollment as of 2020.\n\nSo, perhaps it's asking for the group where all countries, despite being less developed, have high secondary enrollment.\n\nIn that case, option A seems the most likely, with Uruguay and Costa Rica leading the way, and Colombia and Peru also having relatively higher enrollment compared to the other options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D, because it includes Bhutan, which might have surprising education statistics.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up some rough statistics.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nAs of 2020, secondary school enrollment rates:\n\n- Uruguay: Likely over 90%\n\n- Costa Rica: Probably around 90%\n\n- Colombia: Maybe around 80%\n\n- Peru: Perhaps around 70-80%\n\n- Bhutan: Maybe around 60-70%\n\n- Niger: Probably much lower, around 40-50%\n\n- Cambodia: Around 60-70%\n\n- Timor-Leste: Maybe around 50-60%\n\n- Pakistan: Varies, but perhaps around 60-70%\n\nThese are rough estimates based on general knowledge.\n\nSo, if I look at option A: Uruguay (90%), Costa Rica (90%), Colombia (80%), Peru (70-80%). All of these are relatively higher enrollment rates compared to the other countries listed.\n\nOption B: Bhutan (60-70%), Niger (40-50%), Cambodia (60-70%), Costa Rica (90%). Here, Niger has lower enrollment, so not all countries have high enrollment.\n\nOption C: Uruguay (90%), Costa Rica (90%), Timor-Leste (50-60%), Pakistan (60-70%). Timor-Leste and Pakistan have lower enrollment compared to Uruguay and Costa Rica.\n\nOption D: Bhutan (60-70%), Cambodia (60-70%), Uruguay (90%), Costa Rica (90%). Bhutan and Cambodia have lower enrollment compared to Uruguay and Costa Rica.\n\nTherefore, option A has all countries with relatively higher secondary enrollment rates, even though they are less developed countries.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
