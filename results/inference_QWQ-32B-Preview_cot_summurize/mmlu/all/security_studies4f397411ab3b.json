There are four options here, and I need to pick the one that best identifies an emerging issue. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says that the main disciplinary context for security studies theorizing moved away from political science domination towards multi-academe interaction involving sociology, mathematics, psychology, natural and political sciences, and economics. So, it's about diversifying the disciplines involved in security studies. That sounds like a positive development, bringing in different perspectives. But is this a problem for policy? Maybe not directly; it seems more like an evolution in academic approach.\n\nOption B mentions that policy-academe developments have led to think tanks modifying their role from policy towards politicization-resistant theory. So, think tanks are shifting focus from practical policy advice to more theoretical, less politicized work. Is this a problem for policy? Well, if think tanks are moving away from policy advice, that might leave a gap in the provision of practical recommendations for policymakers. So, this could be a potential issue.\n\nOption C talks about the \"IR-ification\" of security studies, meaning that security studies has become one of the two pillars of International Relations (IR), alongside International Political Economy. It says that IR became the main context for discussing security studies. Is this a problem for policy? Not necessarily. It might just be a reflection of how the field is evolving academically. Perhaps it could limit the interdisciplinary approach, but that's speculative.\n\nOption D mentions the increasing interrelation between think tanks and policymakers, with institutional blurring between universities, think tanks, and policy at every level. This sounds like a lot of overlap and merging of these different sectors. Could this be a problem? Maybe, if there's too much blurring, it could lead to conflicts of interest or a lack of independent academic research. On the other hand, closer collaboration could also be beneficial.\n\nNow, considering all these options, I need to pick the one that best identifies a potential problem for policy in this institutionalization process.\n\nOption A seems more like a positive development, so probably not the answer.\n\nOption B suggests that think tanks are moving away from policy advice towards more theoretical work. If that's the case, it might create a gap in the availability of policy recommendations, which could be a problem for policymakers.\n\nOption C is about the integration of security studies into IR, which doesn't necessarily pose a direct problem for policy.\n\nOption D mentions potential blurring between academia, think tanks, and policy, which could have both positive and negative aspects. However, it's not explicitly presented as a problem in the option.\n\nComparing these, Option B seems to directly point out a potential issue for policy,\u5373 think tanks shifting away from policy advice. So, I think B is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
