                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. We need to figure out which of these quantities decreases as the inverse square of the distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields. So, we're looking for something that follows an r^-2 relationship, where r is the distance from the source.\n\nFirst, let's recall Coulomb's law, which tells us that the electric field due to a point charge decreases as 1 over r squared. So, for point charges, the electric field falls off as r^-2. But here, we have different charge distributions, not just point charges, so we need to think about how each of these produces an electric or magnetic field.\n\nOption A is the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod. A finite-length charged rod isn't a point charge, so its electric field won't necessarily follow the r^-2 law everywhere. At close distances, the field will depend on your position relative to the rod, but for points far away from the rod, the rod will look like a point charge, so the field should approach the r^-2 behavior. So, maybe A is a candidate.\n\nOption B is the electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder. An infinitely long charged cylinder has a different symmetry. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside an infinitely long charged cylinder is like that of a long straight wire. It decreases as 1 over r, not r squared, where r is the radial distance from the cylinder. So, for option B, the electric field falls off as r^-1, not r^-2.\n\nOption C is the electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge. An infinite plane of charge has a constant electric field that doesn't depend on the distance from the plane. So, the electric field is uniform and doesn't decrease with distance. Therefore, option C is not decreasing as r^-2.\n\nOption D is the magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire. According to Amp\u00e8re's law, the magnetic field around an infinitely long straight wire decreases as 1 over r, where r is the radial distance from the wire. So, it's r^-1, not r^-2.\n\nSo, from the above analysis, it seems that only option A, the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod, would approach r^-2 behavior at large distances, because from far away, the rod looks like a point charge.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this. For a finite-length charged rod, the electric field at a distance r along the axis of the rod is different from the field perpendicular to the rod. However, for points that are far away from the rod, regardless of direction, the rod should appear as a point source, and thus the field should behave as r^-2.\n\nIn contrast, options B and D both have fields that fall off as r^-1 due to their cylindrical symmetry, and option C has a constant field.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A, the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
