                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a Pennsylvania law from 1826, and it's talking about preventing people from taking negroes or mulattos out of the state with the intention of selling or keeping them as slaves or servants for life. Then it says that debate and conflict over this law reflected the fact that the framers of the Constitution did something regarding slavery. The options are:\n\nA. They specifically declared that slavery would be protected forever in the original 13 states.\n\nB. They allowed states to ignore federal laws that went against their own state constitutions.\n\nC. They put off finding a solution to the slavery problem.\n\nD. They said that slaves could be both citizens and property.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what this Pennsylvania law is about. It seems like it's trying to prevent people from kidnapping free black people and taking them out of the state to sell them into slavery elsewhere. So, it's probably a law to protect free blacks from being illegally enslaved.\n\nNow, the question is connecting this law to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution. So, I need to think about what the framers did or didn't do regarding slavery when they wrote the Constitution.\n\nOption A says they declared slavery would be protected forever in the original 13 states. I don't think that's accurate. I know that the Constitution did include provisions related to slavery, like the Three-Fifths Compromise and the Fugitive Slave Clause, but I don't recall them explicitly declaring protection of slavery \"in perpetuity.\" Also, not all of the original 13 states had slavery; some had already started to abolish it by that time.\n\nOption B says they allowed states to exempt themselves from federal laws that contradicted their state constitutions. Hmm, that sounds a bit like the idea of states' rights, which was a big issue around slavery. But I'm not sure if that's exactly what the framers did regarding slavery specifically. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption C says they postponed a solution to the problems of slavery. I remember that the framers were aware of the slavery issue and knew it was contentious, but they didn't want to alienate states that depended on slavery, so they kind of avoided directly addressing it in the Constitution, at least not in terms of abolishing it immediately. They did include some provisions that acknowledged slavery but didn't tackle it head-on.\n\nOption D says they declared that slaves could be both citizens and property. That seems contradictory because if someone is a slave, they're property, not citizens. I think the Dred Scott decision later on basically said that slaves were not citizens, so I don't think the framers declared that.\n\nLet me think again. The Pennsylvania law is from 1826, which is after the Constitution was ratified in 1788. By that time, some states were moving towards abolishing slavery or had already done so, like Pennsylvania. So, perhaps there was a conflict between state laws and federal laws regarding slavery.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C seems plausible because the framers didn't resolve the slavery issue immediately; instead, they made compromises that allowed slavery to continue in some states while restricting it in others, setting up conflicts that would later lead to laws like the one in Pennsylvania and, eventually, the Civil War.\n\nOption A isn't right because the Constitution didn't declare slavery protected forever in all original states; in fact, it allowed for slavery to continue where it existed but didn't prevent states from abolishing it on their own, as some did.\n\nOption B is interesting because it touches on states' rights, but I don't think the Constitution explicitly allowed states to exempt themselves from federal laws that contradicted their state constitutions. The Supremacy Clause actually makes federal law supreme over state law.\n\nOption D is probably incorrect because the Constitution didn't declare slaves to be citizens; in fact, the Dred Scott case in 1857 ruled that slaves were not citizens.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best answer is C: the framers of the Constitution postponed a solution to the problems of slavery. They made compromises to get the Constitution ratified, knowing that slavery was a divisive issue, and left many questions about slavery's future to be addressed later, which led to ongoing debates and conflicts, like the one reflected in the Pennsylvania law of 1826.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
