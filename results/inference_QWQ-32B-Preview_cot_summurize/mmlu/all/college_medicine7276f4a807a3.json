                    "text": "So I have this question here about steroid-based molecules. It lists four options: Testosterone, Triglycerides, Progesterone, and DNA. I need to figure out which of these are steroid-based molecules, and choose the correct combination from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what steroid-based molecules are. Steroids are a class of lipids characterized by a specific structure, typically four interconnected carbon rings. They play various roles in the body, such as hormone functions.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nI. Testosterone - I know that testosterone is a hormone, and I think it's a steroid hormone. Yes, that sounds right. So, I believe testosterone is a steroid-based molecule.\n\nII. Triglycerides - Now, triglycerides are another type of lipid, but they're different from steroids. Triglycerides are composed of glycerol and three fatty acid chains. They're the main constituent of body fat in humans and other animals. So, I don't think triglycerides are steroid-based.\n\nIII. Progesterone - Progesterone is another hormone, and I think it's also a steroid hormone, similar to testosterone. So, I believe progesterone is a steroid-based molecule.\n\nIV. DNA - DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid, which is a nucleic acid, not a lipid. It's composed of nucleotides and is responsible for storing genetic information. So, definitely not a steroid-based molecule.\n\nBased on this, the steroid-based molecules among the options are I (Testosterone) and III (Progesterone). So, the correct answer should be option C: I and III.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that triglycerides could be considered steroid-based? I don't think so, because their structure is entirely different. They don't have the characteristic ring structure of steroids.\n\nAnd DNA is definitely not a steroid. So, yes, only testosterone and progesterone are steroid-based molecules.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: I and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
