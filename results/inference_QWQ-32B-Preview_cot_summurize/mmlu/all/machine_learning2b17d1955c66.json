The nullity of a matrix is the dimension of its null space, which is the set of all vectors \\( \\mathbf{x} \\) such that \\( A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0} \\).\n\nOne way to find the nullity is to use the rank-nullity theorem, which states that for any \\( m \\times n \\) matrix \\( A \\), the rank of \\( A \\) plus the nullity of \\( A \\) equals the number of columns of \\( A \\). In other words:\n\n\\[\n\\text{nullity}(A) = n - \\text{rank}(A)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( A \\) is a \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) matrix, so \\( n = 3 \\). Therefore, we need to find the rank of \\( A \\).\n\nTo find the rank of \\( A \\), we can perform row reduction to bring the matrix to its row echelon form and count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nLet's perform row reduction on \\( A \\):\n\n1. Start with the matrix:\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & -9 \\\\\n-6 & -4 & 18 \\\\\n12 & 8 & -36\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n2. Divide the first row by 3 to get a leading 1:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & \\frac{2}{3} & -3 \\\\\n-6 & -4 & 18 \\\\\n12 & 8 & -36\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n3. Add 6 times the first row to the second row to eliminate the leading term in the second row:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & \\frac{2}{3} & -3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n12 & 8 & -36\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n4. Subtract 12 times the first row from the third row to eliminate the leading term in the third row:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & \\frac{2}{3} & -3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, the matrix is in row echelon form. We can see that there is only one non-zero row, so the rank of \\( A \\) is 1.\n\nUsing the rank-nullity theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\text{nullity}(A) = 3 - 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the dimensionality of the null space of \\( A \\) is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]\n"
