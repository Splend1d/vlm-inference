                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says, \"When a bank's balance sheet shows that the bank has excess reserves...\" and then gives a few options. So, I need to understand what excess reserves mean for a bank and what it can do with them.\n\nFirst, I should recall what reserves are in the context of banking. Banks are required to hold a certain amount of money in reserve, which is called required reserves. This is to ensure that they have enough cash on hand to meet the demands of their customers for withdrawals. Excess reserves are the amount of reserves a bank holds beyond what is required by regulators.\n\nSo, if a bank has excess reserves, that means it has more money in reserves than it is required to hold. What can the bank do with this extra money?\n\nOption A says, \"the bank\u2019s reserves exceed the bank\u2019s assets.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Reserves are a part of a bank's assets, specifically liquid assets like cash and deposits with the central bank. So, reserves can't exceed total assets because reserves are a component of assets. That doesn't make sense.\n\nOption B says, \"the bank can make additional loans.\" Okay, this seems plausible. If a bank has extra reserves, it can use that money to make more loans to customers. When a bank makes a loan, it creates new money in the economy by crediting the borrower's account, and the reserves are used to back up that new money.\n\nOption C says, \"the bank\u2019s actual reserves are less than its required reserves.\" Wait, that's the opposite of what excess reserves mean. Excess reserves mean actual reserves are greater than required reserves. So, this can't be correct.\n\nOption D says, \"the bank is required to change its interest rate.\" I don't think that's directly related to having excess reserves. Banks may adjust their interest rates based on various factors, but having excess reserves doesn't necessarily require them to change their interest rates.\n\nSo, between the options provided, option B seems to be the most accurate. If a bank has excess reserves, it can use those reserves to make additional loans.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A is wrong because reserves are a component of assets, not something that can exceed total assets.\n\nOption C is incorrect because excess reserves mean actual reserves are greater than required reserves, not less.\n\nOption D isn't directly related to having excess reserves; it's more about the bank's strategic decisions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: the bank can make additional loans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
