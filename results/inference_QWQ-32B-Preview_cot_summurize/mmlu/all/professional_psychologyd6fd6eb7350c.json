The question is asking which concept from Elkind (1967) this belief is an example of. The options are:\n\nA. self-conscious emotions.\n\nB. the \u201cpersonal fable.\u201d\n\nC. social referencing.\n\nD. the \u201cimaginary audience.\u201d\n\nOkay, first, I need to remember what Elkind studied. I think Elkind is known for his work on adolescent cognition, especially egocentrism during adolescence. So, probably, the terms like \"personal fable\" and \"imaginary audience\" are related to his work.\n\nLet me start by recalling what the \"personal fable\" is. I think it's the belief that one is unique and that their thoughts, feelings, and experiences are distinct from others. Adolescents might feel like no one else can understand them, and they might exaggerate their own importance.\n\nNow, the \"imaginary audience\" is another concept by Elkind, which refers to adolescents' tendency to believe that others are as preoccupied with their appearance and actions as they are themselves. So, basically, they imagine that there's an audience constantly watching and judging them.\n\nIn Alice's case, she's convinced that everyone is looking at her forehead because of the blemish. This sounds a lot like the imaginary audience concept, where she thinks that others are as focused on her appearance as she is.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is \"self-conscious emotions.\" While it's true that adolescents often experience heightened self-consciousness, this is more of a general term and not specifically related to Elkind's work.\n\nOption C is \"social referencing,\" which I think is more about looking to others for cues on how to react in uncertain situations. That doesn't seem directly related to Alice's belief that everyone is looking at her blemish.\n\nSo, between B and D, I think D, the \"imaginary audience,\" is the best fit here.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should make sure that I'm not confusing the personal fable with the imaginary audience. The personal fable is more about the sense of uniqueness and invincibility, while the imaginary audience is about the belief that others are paying attention to them in ways that they aren't necessarily.\n\nGiven that, Alice's belief that everyone is looking at her blemish is more aligned with the imaginary audience concept.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. the \u201cimaginary audience.\u201d\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
