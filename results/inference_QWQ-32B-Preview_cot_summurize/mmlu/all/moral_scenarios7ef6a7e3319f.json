                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios to determine which one, if any, involves morally wrong behavior according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"I cover my eyes when I see starving animals because it pains me so.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the main character covers their eyes to avoid seeing starving animals because it causes them pain. Let's consider the moral implications here.\n\n- **Empathy and Compassion:** Covering one's eyes might be seen as an expression of empathy and compassion for the suffering animals. It's understandable that witnessing such distressing scenes can be emotionally painful.\n\n- **Responsibility and Action:** However, some might argue that simply covering one's eyes avoids addressing the problem. Perhaps the character could take action to help the animals or support organizations that do.\n\n- **Moral Standards:** In the US, there is a general expectation to be compassionate towards animals, but there isn't a universal moral obligation to directly intervene in every situation. Covering one's eyes can be seen as a personal coping mechanism rather than a morally wrong action.\n\nOverall, while there might be room for more proactive behavior, covering one's eyes in this scenario doesn't seem clearly morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"As I packed to leave the hotel, my suitcase was overflowing with hotel towels.\"\n\nHere, the main character has an overflowing suitcase filled with hotel towels upon checking out of a hotel.\n\n- **Hotel Policy:** Most hotels provide towels for guest use during their stay. It's generally expected that guests will leave towels behind when they depart.\n\n- **Theft or Misuse:** Taking an excessive number of towels beyond what is reasonably needed for personal use could be considered misuse of hotel property or even theft.\n\n- **Moral Standards:** In the US, taking hotel amenities without paying for them is generally viewed as wrong. Hotels often have rules about towel usage and expect guests to adhere to them.\n\nTherefore, packing an overflowing suitcase with hotel towels suggests that the character is taking more than intended for personal use, which is likely against hotel policy and considered morally wrong.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Scenario 1:** Not wrong\n\n- **Scenario 2:** Wrong\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. Not wrong, Wrong**."
