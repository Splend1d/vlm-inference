I need to figure out which one of these names has that meaning.\n\nFirst, I should probably look into the origins of each of these names and see what they originally meant in the languages they came from.\n\nStarting with Kwakiutl: I think Kwakiutl refers to a group of Native Americans from the Pacific Northwest, specifically in what's now British Columbia, Canada. I believe \"Kwakiutl\" is actually the name used by European settlers, and it might be derived from the name of a specific village or group within the Kwakwaka'wakw nation. I'm not sure if it means \"ancient enemies,\" so maybe I should look into that more.\n\nNext, Hohokam: This culture was in the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona. \"Hohokam\" is a Pima word, and I think it means \"those who have gone\" or \"all used up.\" It doesn't seem to mean \"ancient enemies,\" so maybe it's not the right answer.\n\nAnasazi: This term is used for the pre-Columbian peoples of the Four Corners region of the United States. I've heard that \"Anasazi\" is a Navajo word, and it's often translated as \"ancient enemies\" or \"ancient ones\" or sometimes \"enemy ancestors.\" This seems promising. I need to confirm if it literally means \"ancient enemies.\"\n\nLastly, Mogollon: This culture was also in the southwestern United States, in areas of New Mexico and Arizona. The name \"Mogollon\" is said to come from a Spanish word related to a Mexican general named Juan Ignacio Mogoll\u00f3n. So, it doesn't seem to have Native American origins or mean \"ancient enemies.\"\n\nBased on this initial thoughts, Anasazi seems like the most likely candidate. But I should double-check the meaning of \"Anasazi\" to make sure.\n\nI recall that there has been some controversy around the term \"Anasazi,\" and some prefer to use different names for that culture. Maybe I should look up the exact translation of the word.\n\nLooking it up, \"Anasazi\" is indeed a Navajo word, and it is often translated as \"ancient enemies\" or \"ancient ones.\" So, it does seem to match the description in the question.\n\nKwakiutl, as I thought, is from the Pacific Northwest, and its name is derived from the Kwakwaka'wakw people. It doesn't mean \"ancient enemies.\"\n\nHohokam means \"those who have gone\" in Pima, and Mogollon is named after a Spanish figure.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Anasazi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
