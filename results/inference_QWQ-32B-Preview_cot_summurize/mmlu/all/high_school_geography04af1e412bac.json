The options are A. Rostow, B. Ravenstein, C. Von Th\u00fcnen, and D. Burgess.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who each of these geographers is and what their contributions were to the field, especially regarding urban geography.\n\nStarting with A. Rostow, I think he is more associated with economic growth and the stages of economic development. I don't recall him specifically focusing on urban spatial structures.\n\nOption B. Ravenstein is known for his laws of migration, which describe patterns of human migration. Again, not directly related to urban spatial structures.\n\nC. Von Th\u00fcnen is famous for his von Th\u00fcnen's model, which is a theoretical model of how agricultural land use is organized around a central market. It does involve concentric rings, but it's about rural land use, not urban communities.\n\nOption D. Burgess seems most relevant here. I believe he developed the concentric zone model to describe the structure of urban areas. Let me think about that.\n\nYes, Ernest W. Burgess proposed the concentric zone model in the 1920s to explain the spatial organization of cities. He suggested that cities grow in a series of concentric rings, with the central business district (CBD) at the core, surrounded by rings of varying land uses, such as transition zone, workingmen's homes, middle-class homes, and commuting zone.\n\nGiven that the question is about the US urban community of the 1920s viewed as concentric rings, it seems that Burgess is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check the other options.\n\nRostow is known for his work on the stages of economic growth, which includes traditional society, transitional society, take-off, maturity, and high mass consumption. Not directly related to urban spatial structures.\n\nRavenstein's laws of migration include propositions like migrants prefer nearby destinations and that family ties influence migration patterns. Again, not about urban structure.\n\nVon Th\u00fcnen's model is indeed about concentric rings, but it's about agricultural land use, not urban communities.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Burgess.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
