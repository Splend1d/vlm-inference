                    "text": "So Maria spends $9 on lunch each day she's at work, and she wants to know how much she spends in a 5-day work week. She decides to multiply 5 by 9 to find out. Let's see what that comes to.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the multiplication: 5 times 9. That's pretty straightforward. 5 times 9 equals 45. So, Maria spends $45 on lunch during a 5-day work week.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. $40\n\nB. $45\n\nC. $50\n\nD. $59\n\nThe correct answer should be B. $45.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here. Does Maria work every day of the week? The question says \"a 5-day work week,\" so assuming she works 5 days a week, and she spends $9 on lunch each day she's at work, which is 5 days. So, 5 times 9 is indeed 45.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's something about the work week that I'm missing. Does \"work week\" mean something else? In some places, a work week might be more or less than 5 days, but the question specifies \"a 5-day work week,\" so it's clear that she works 5 days.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any holidays or days off, but the question doesn't mention any exceptions. It says \"during a 5-day work week,\" so we can assume she is at work all 5 days and thus spends $9 each day.\n\nAlso, perhaps there's a mistake in the multiplication. Let's recalculate: 5 times 9 is 45. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me by putting a similar number like $40 or $50, but the exact answer is $45, which is option B.\n\nWait a minute, option D is $59, which is quite off from 45, so that's probably not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding about what a work week entails, but again, the question specifies \"a 5-day work week.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Maria doesn't spend $9 on lunch every day, but the question says \"each day she is at work,\" and \"during a 5-day work week,\" so it's safe to assume she spends $9 per day for 5 days.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about it in addition: $9 plus $9 plus $9 plus $9 plus $9. That's $9 times 5, which is $45.\n\nAlternatively, if she spends $9 per day for 5 days, it's $45.\n\nSo, I think the answer is definitely $45, which is option B.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nMaybe the work week is longer than 5 days, but the question says \"a 5-day work week,\" so no, it's 5 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $9 includes something else, but the question is clear: \"spends $9 on lunch each day.\"\n\nSo, no, I think $45 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
