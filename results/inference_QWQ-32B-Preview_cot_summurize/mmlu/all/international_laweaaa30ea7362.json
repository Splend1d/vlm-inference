I remember that the Badinter Commission played a crucial role in the recognition of the new states that emerged after the dissolution of Yugoslavia. It was established by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which later became the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\n\nLet me think about the options provided:\n\nA. The Commission required a commitment to submit disputes to the ICJ.\n\nI know that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the primary judicial organ of the United Nations, and it settles legal disputes submitted to it by states in accordance with international law. I'm not sure if the Badinter Commission specifically required a commitment to submit disputes to the ICJ as a condition for recognition. It's possible, but I need to verify this.\n\nB. The Commission required a change in boundaries.\n\nThe dissolution of Yugoslavia involved complex territorial issues, and there were certainly disputes over borders between the new republics. However, I don't recall the Badinter Commission imposing a specific requirement for a change in boundaries as a condition for recognition. Instead, I think it emphasized the need to respect existing borders and resolve disputes peacefully.\n\nC. The Commission required a commitment to human rights and democracy.\n\nThis seems plausible. In the context of the dissolution of Yugoslavia, which was marked by ethnic conflicts and human rights abuses, it would make sense for the international community, through the Badinter Commission, to require a commitment to human rights and democracy from the new states seeking recognition.\n\nD. The Commission required an exchange of ethnic populations.\n\nThis option sounds concerning. Forced exchange of populations is contrary to international human rights standards and would not be something that an international commission would require or endorse. It's unlikely that the Badinter Commission would impose such a criterion.\n\nConsidering these points, I think option C is the most accurate. The Badinter Commission likely required a commitment to human rights and democracy from the former Yugoslav republics as a condition for their international recognition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
