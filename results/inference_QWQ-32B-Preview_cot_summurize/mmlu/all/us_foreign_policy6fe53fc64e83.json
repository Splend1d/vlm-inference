So, the key difference we're looking for is how the US approached expansion in terms of territory and markets. The options are a bit tricky, so I need to think carefully.\n\nFirst, I know that before 1865, the US was expanding westward, acquiring new territories and states. The Louisiana Purchase, the Oregon Territory, and the Mexican Cession are all examples of territorial gains before the Civil War. So, expansion pre-1865 was very much about acquiring land and expanding the physical boundaries of the country.\n\nAfter 1865, during the Reconstruction era and beyond, the US continued to expand, but I'm not sure if it was mainly about territory or markets. I think post-1865, the US started to look beyond its continental borders and became more involved in global trade and imperialism.\n\nOption A says that US expansion was based on territory rather than markets post-1865. But wait, earlier I thought that post-1865, expansion might have shifted towards markets. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nOption B says that US expansion was based on markets rather than territory post-1865. Hmm, that sounds plausible. After the Civil War, the US industrialized rapidly, and there was a greater need for foreign markets to sell manufactured goods. So, perhaps the focus shifted from acquiring territory to accessing foreign markets.\n\nOption C limits post-1865 expansion to Latin America. While it's true that the US did have expansionist interests in Latin America, like the Spanish-American War and the acquisition of Puerto Rico and the Philippines, this seems too narrow. The US expansions weren't limited to Latin America after 1865; there were also expansions in the Pacific, like Hawaii and Guam.\n\nOption D says that US expansion ended after 1865. That can't be right because we know that the US acquired various territories in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nSo, between options A and B, B seems more accurate. The US shifted its focus from territorial expansion to market expansion after 1865. This aligns with the idea of the US pursuing imperialism and seeking international trade agreements to foster its growing industries.\n\nMoreover, the Open Door Policy towards China, advocated by Secretary of State John Hay in the late 1890s, is a good example of the US seeking market access rather than territorial acquisition. The US wanted to ensure equal trading rights in China among Western powers, avoiding the partition of China into colonial spheres.\n\nAlso, the Panama Canal project in the early 20th century was about facilitating trade and establishing military dominance in the Western Hemisphere, rather than acquiring more territory.\n\nTherefore, I believe the key difference is that US expansion post-1865 was based on markets rather than territory, making option B the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
