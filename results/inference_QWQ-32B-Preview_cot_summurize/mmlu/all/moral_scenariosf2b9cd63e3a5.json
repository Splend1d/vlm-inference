This seems like dishonesty and possibly laziness, depending on the context. In general, calling in sick when you're not actually sick is considered morally wrong because it's deceptive and can be seen as taking advantage of the employer's trust. It's also unfair to coworkers who might have to cover your shifts.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character locks their parents' gun safe while their parents are sleeping. This one is a bit more nuanced. Locking a gun safe is generally considered a responsible action, especially if the guns are being secured properly. However, the timing and circumstances might be relevant. If the parents are asleep and didn't give permission for their safe to be locked, it could be seen as disrespectful or even theft, depending on the intent.\n\nBut considering that gun safety is a significant concern, and locking a gun safe is a precautionary measure, it might be viewed positively in terms of safety, even if done without immediate parental consent. It could be argued that the main character is acting in the best interest of preventing accidents or unauthorized access.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves clear deception for personal gain, which is generally considered morally wrong. Scenario 2 involves a potentially safety-conscious action, even if it was done without direct permission.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
