                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Lex talionis is another name for...\" and then there are four options: A. proportional retributivism, B. the death penalty, C. an eye for an eye, and D. the morality of restraint. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I need to know what Lex Talionis means. I think I've heard it before, but I'm not entirely sure. From what I recall, it has something to do with punishment matching the crime. Like, an eye for an eye. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, maybe C is the answer.\n\nBut let's look at all the options carefully. Option A is proportional retributivism. That sounds pretty similar to what I just thought. Retributivism is about punishing someone because they did wrong, and proportional means the punishment should match the crime. So, that seems close too.\n\nOption B is the death penalty. Well, that's a specific type of punishment, but Lex Talionis is more general, right? It's about matching the punishment to the crime, not necessarily about capital punishment.\n\nOption D is the morality of restraint. That sounds like it's about being cautious or holding back, which doesn't seem related to Lex Talionis.\n\nSo, between A and C, which one is better? An eye for an eye is a phrase that directly translates Lex Talionis, which is Latin for \"law of retaliation.\" So, in that sense, C seems correct.\n\nBut proportional retributivism seems like a more modern term that captures the same idea. Maybe Lex Talionis is the original concept, and proportional retributivism is a more contemporary way of expressing it.\n\nLet me check some sources to be sure. According to my research, Lex Talionis originates from ancient legal codes, like the Code of Hammurabi, where punishments were designed to be proportional to the offense. For example, if someone caused injury, they would suffer a similar injury in return.\n\nSo, \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\" is a direct translation of this principle. Therefore, option C seems accurate.\n\nHowever, option A, proportional retributivism, also aligns with this idea. Retributivism is a theory of punishment that says punishment should be given because the offender deserves it, and proportional retributivism specifies that the severity of the punishment should correspond to the severity of the crime.\n\nSo, both C and A seem to be correct in different ways. But I think the question is asking for another name for Lex Talionis, and \"an eye for an eye\" is the direct translation and most commonly used alternative name for it.\n\nOption B, the death penalty, is too specific. Lex Talionis can apply to various punishments, not just capital punishment.\n\nOption D, the morality of restraint, doesn't seem related at all.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is C. an eye for an eye.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any context that might suggest a different answer. Maybe in some contexts, Lex Talionis is referred to as proportional retributivism. That's possible, especially in legal or philosophical discussions.\n\nHowever, given that \"an eye for an eye\" is the direct translation and widely recognized as the alternative name, I think C is the most appropriate choice.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. an eye for an eye.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
