                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about simulating coin flips. Let me try to understand what's going on. The algorithm is set up to flip a coin 4 times, and we want to check if the number of heads and tails are equal. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, in Step 1, we initialize two variables: heads_counter and flip_counter, both set to 0. This makes sense because before we start flipping, we haven't gotten any heads or flips yet.\n\nThen, in Step 2, there's a variable called coin_flip that gets randomly assigned either 0 or 1. If it's 0, it's considered heads, and we increment the heads_counter by 1. So, every time we get a 0, it's a head, and we count it.\n\nIn Step 3, we increment the flip_counter by 1, which keeps track of how many flips we've done.\n\nStep 4 tells us to repeat steps 2 and 3 until the flip_counter equals 4. So, we keep flipping the coin and counting heads until we've done 4 flips.\n\nNow, the question is asking which expression indicates that the simulation resulted in an equal number of heads and tails. Since we're flipping the coin 4 times, an equal number of heads and tails would mean 2 heads and 2 tails.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. coin_flip = 1\n\nThis seems unrelated because coin_flip is the result of a single flip, and setting it to 1 might represent tails, but it doesn't tell us about the overall count after 4 flips.\n\nB. flip_counter = 1\n\nThis would mean only one flip has been done, which is not what we want since we're doing 4 flips.\n\nC. flip_counter = 2\n\nSimilarly, this would indicate that only two flips have been done, but we need to consider all 4 flips.\n\nD. heads_counter = 2\n\nThis suggests that there are 2 heads. Since there are 4 flips in total, if there are 2 heads, then there must be 2 tails, which is an equal number.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct one. But let's double-check.\n\nIf heads_counter = 2, then number of heads is 2, and since there are 4 flips, the remaining 2 must be tails. Therefore, heads and tails are equal.\n\nThe other options don't make sense in this context:\n\n- Option A is about a single flip.\n\n- Options B and C are about the number of flips being 1 or 2, respectively, which is not the final count after 4 flips.\n\nTherefore, the expression that indicates the simulation resulted in an equal number of heads and tails is D. heads_counter = 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
