                    "text": "So I have this question about Stella and how she remembers the order of the planets. She uses this sentence: \"My very educated mother just served us noodles.\" I need to figure out what this is called among the options: chunking strategy, mnemonic device, peg system, or acoustic encoding sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\n**Chunking strategy:** This is a memory technique where you break down information into smaller, manageable units or chunks. For example, remembering a phone number by splitting it into parts like area code, first three digits, and last four digits.\n\n**Mnemonic device:** This is a learning technique that aids information retention. Mnemonics work by associating new information with something you already know. Common types include acronyms, acrostics, and rhymes.\n\n**Peg system:** This is a specific type of mnemonic device where you associate numbers with words that sound similar (rhyming pegs) or visualize placing items on \"pegs\" in your mind. It's often used for remembering lists in a specific order.\n\n**Acoustic encoding sequence:** This refers to the process of encoding auditory information into memory. It's about how sounds are processed and stored.\n\nNow, looking at the sentence Stella uses: \"My very educated mother just served us noodles.\" This seems like an acrostic mnemonic, where the first letter of each word stands for something else. In this case, it's likely standing for the order of the planets from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.\n\nSo, \"My\" for Mercury, \"very\" for Venus, and so on.\n\nThis fits the definition of a mnemonic device, as it's a memory aid that helps Stella recall the order of the planets.\n\nChunking is about breaking information into chunks, but here, Stella is using a sentence to remember the first letters of the planets, which is more about association than chunking.\n\nThe peg system is about associating items with pre-memorized \"pegs,\" which isn't directly applicable here.\n\nAcoustic encoding is about how sounds are encoded in memory, but Stella is using a sentence to remember the order, which is more about the meaning and association rather than just the sounds.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. mnemonic device.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
