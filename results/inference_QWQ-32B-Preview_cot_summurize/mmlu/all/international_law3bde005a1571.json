                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about acts jure gestionis. I'm a bit rusty on international law terms, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nSo, the question is: What is an act jure gestionis?\n\nAnd we have four options:\n\nA. Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity\n\nB. All purchases by the State are acts jure gestionis\n\nC. All acts undertaken by State corporations are jure gestionis\n\nD. All conduct undertaken by government officials in their free time is considered jus gestionis.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what \"jure gestionis\" means. I think it's related to how states act in international law, specifically whether they're acting as sovereign entities or in a private capacity.\n\nFrom what I remember, there are two main categories: acts jure gestionis and acts jure imperii. Acts jure imperii are those exercised by a state in its sovereign capacity, like declaring war or issuing regulations, and they generally enjoy immunity from jurisdiction in foreign courts. On the other hand, acts jure gestionis are when states act in a capacity similar to private individuals or entities, like entering into contracts or engaging in commercial activities.\n\nSo, option A says that acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity. That sounds consistent with what I just recalled. But I should check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B claims that all purchases by the State are acts jure gestionis. Well, if a state is purchasing something, say, buying office supplies or procuring equipment for a government agency, that seems like a commercial activity, which would be jure gestionis. But is every state purchase considered jure gestionis? Maybe, but I feel like there might be exceptions, especially if the purchase is for something related to the state's sovereign functions.\n\nOption C says that all acts undertaken by State corporations are jure gestionis. State corporations are entities established by the state but often operate in the market like private companies. So, their activities might be considered jure gestionis. However, if these corporations are performing functions that are inherently governmental, maybe their acts could be considered jure imperii. So, I'm not sure if \"all\" acts by state corporations are jure gestionis.\n\nOption D states that all conduct undertaken by government officials in their free time is considered jus gestionis. Hmm, this seems off. Government officials, when acting in their personal capacity outside of official duties, should be treated like any other individual. So, their private conduct wouldn't be considered acts of the state, either jure gestionis or jure imperii.\n\nWait, actually, I think there might be a misunderstanding here. Jus gestionis sounds similar to actus jure gestionis, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up.\n\nUpon a quick search, I see that \"jure gestionis\" refers to acts performed by a state in its capacity as a manager of property or in a commercial sense, akin to private individuals or legal entities. So, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let's verify option B. Are all purchases by the state considered acts jure gestionis? Well, if a state is buying goods or services in the ordinary course of business, it's likely jure gestionis. However, if the purchase is for something related to the state's sovereign functions, like buying land for an embassy, it might be considered jure imperii.\n\nOption C mentions state corporations. These entities often have a degree of autonomy and engage in commercial activities, which would be jure gestionis. But if they're performing public functions, their acts might be considered jure imperii.\n\nOption D seems incorrect because government officials' private actions shouldn't be attributed to the state.\n\nTherefore, option A appears to be the most accurate definition: Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n\nIn international law, the distinction between jure gestionis and jure imperii is important, particularly in determining whether a state can claim sovereign immunity in legal proceedings. States generally enjoy immunity for their sovereign acts (jure imperii), but not for their commercial activities (jure gestionis).\n\nSo, if a state is engaged in a commercial transaction, such as entering into a contract to purchase goods or services, that would typically be considered jure gestionis, and the state could be sued in foreign courts for breaches related to those activities.\n\nHowever, sometimes states engage in activities that have both sovereign and commercial elements, and determining whether a particular act is jure gestionis or jure imperii can be complex and dependent on the specific circumstances.\n\nGiven that, option A seems like the best answer, but I should keep in mind that it's a general statement and there may be exceptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option B is trying to specify a particular type of act jure gestionis, but the problem is that it says \"all purchases,\" which might include both commercial and sovereign-related purchases.\n\nSimilarly, option C's assertion that \"all acts undertaken by State corporations are jure gestionis\" is too broad, as state corporations can engage in both commercial and public functions.\n\nOption D is probably incorrect because government officials' private conduct isn't typically considered an act of the state.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
