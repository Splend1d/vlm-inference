                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's asking for the location of the largest Hindu temple complex ever constructed, and the options are Calcutta, Bombay, Cambodia, and Bali. Now, I know that Hinduism is primarily practiced in India, so I might think that the largest temple complex would be there, maybe in Calcutta or Bombay. But then again, Cambodia and Bali are known for their ancient temples too. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, Calcutta, which is now called Kolkata, is in India and has several important Hindu temples, but I don't recall any being the largest ever constructed. Similarly, Bombay, now known as Mumbai, is home to the famous Shivaji Temple and other important sites, but again, not sure if any of them is the largest.\n\nNow, Cambodia is in Southeast Asia, and it's famous for Angkor Wat, which is a massive temple complex. But I thought Angkor Wat was a Buddhist temple. Wait, actually, Angkor Wat was originally built as a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu by the Khmer Empire, and later it was transformed into a Buddhist temple. So, it started as a Hindu temple. And it's enormous; I've seen pictures and it's incredibly vast.\n\nThen there's Bali, which is part of Indonesia. Bali is known for its Hindu temples as well, since a majority of Balinese people practice a form of Hinduism. There are many temple complexes in Bali, like the Besakih Temple, which is often referred to as the \"Mother Temple.\" But I'm not sure if it's larger than Angkor Wat.\n\nSo, between Cambodia and Bali, both have significant Hindu temple complexes, but I think Angkor Wat is larger. Let me check some facts. Angkor Wat is considered the largest religious monument in the world, covering an area of about 400 acres. Besakih Temple in Bali is also large, but I don't think it's as big as Angkor Wat.\n\nAlso, considering that Angkor Wat was built in the 12th century during the Khmer Empire, which was a Hindu empire, and it's dedicated to Vishnu, it definitely qualifies as a Hindu temple complex, at least originally.\n\nSo, even though Cambodia is not in India, where Hinduism is primarily practiced today, the temple was built during a time when Hinduism was prevalent in the region.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is Cambodia.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider all options. Calcutta and Bombay are both in India, and while they have important temples, none of them is as large as Angkor Wat, from what I know.\n\nFor example, the Kali Mandir in Calcutta is famous, but it's not as big as Angkor Wat. Similarly, the Elephanta Caves near Mumbai are ancient Hindu temples, but again, not as large.\n\nBali's Besakih Temple is impressive, but again, I believe Angkor Wat is larger.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I would go with Cambodia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
