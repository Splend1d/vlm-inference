                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about Wellman's response to the \"egalitarian\" objection to the state's right to exclude. So, Wellman says that states can meet their duties to people outside their borders without letting those people in. Fine thinks that's not good enough. The options are:\n\nA. Egalitarians are committed to utilitarian principles.\n\nB. Wellman himself is an immigrant.\n\nC. Excluding people who want to pursue interests specific to that state could still be harmful.\n\nD. The idea of \"exporting justice\" is internally contradictory.\n\nI need to figure out which one Fine thinks makes Wellman's response insufficient.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's at stake here. The egalitarian objection likely argues that states have a duty to treat all people equally, regardless of their nationality or where they're from. So, if a state excludes outsiders, it might be failing in its egalitarian duties.\n\nWellman counters that states can fulfill their duties to outsiders without allowing them in. Maybe by providing aid, resources, or other forms of support without letting them become citizens or residents.\n\nFine isn't satisfied with this response. Why not?\n\nOption A says that egalitarians are committed to utilitarian principles. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Egalitarianism is about equality, while utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness or utility. They're different ethical theories. So, maybe this isn't the reason Fine objects.\n\nOption B says that Wellman himself is an immigrant. Even if that's true, I don't see how that directly relates to the adequacy of his response to the egalitarian objection. Maybe it's irrelevant.\n\nOption C says that excluding people who want to pursue interests specific to that state could still be harmful. This seems plausible. If a state excludes outsiders who have a particular desire or need to be there, perhaps for economic opportunities, family reunification, or cultural affinities, then those exclusions could harm those individuals. So, even if the state provides some forms of assistance from afar, the denial of the opportunity to pursue those specific interests within the state's territory might still be a problem from an egalitarian perspective.\n\nOption D mentions that \"exporting justice\" is internally contradictory. I'm not sure what \"exporting justice\" means in this context, but maybe it refers to the idea that states can fulfill their duties to outsiders by improving conditions in their home countries, thus reducing the need for migration. If that's the case, Fine might argue that this approach is flawed or contradictory in some way.\n\nBetween options C and D, I think option C is more directly related to the egalitarian objection. Egalitarians are concerned with equality and fairness, so if excluding people from pursuing specific interests in the state is harmful, that would be a egalitarian concern.\n\nOption D seems more about the practicality or coherence of the \"exporting justice\" concept, which might be more of a theoretical objection rather than an egalitarian one.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: excluding people who wish to pursue interests specific to that state is still potentially harmful.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
