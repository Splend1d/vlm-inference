                    "text": "Let's see which of these conditions can be expressed using only the Boolean variables p1, p2, p3, p4 and the connectives AND (\u2227) and OR (\u2228), without using NOT (\u00ac).\n\nFirst, condition I: \"At least three of p1, p2, p3, p4 are true.\"\n\nSo, this means that either three or all four variables are true. To express this without NOT, I can think about all the possible combinations where at least three are true.\n\nFor exactly three variables to be true, I can have:\n\n- p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p3 \u2227 \u00acp4\n\n- p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p4 \u2227 \u00acp3\n\n- p1 \u2227 p3 \u2227 p4 \u2227 \u00acp2\n\n- p2 \u2227 p3 \u2227 p4 \u2227 \u00acp1\n\nAnd for all four to be true:\n\n- p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p3 \u2227 p4\n\nBut wait, I'm not allowed to use NOT. So, how can I express that something is not true without using NOT?\n\nMaybe I can use the fact that p \u2192 q is equivalent to \u00acp \u2228 q, but since I can't use NOT, that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that \"at least three are true\" is the same as \"not less than three are false,\" but again, that involves NOT, which I can't use.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the variables that are true. If at least three are true, that means that in any group of three variables, at least one of them is true.\n\nHmm, but that seems convoluted.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can use the distributive properties of AND and OR.\n\nLet's list all the possible ways to have at least three variables true:\n\n- p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p3 \u2227 p4\n\n- p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p3 \u2227 \u00acp4\n\n- p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p4 \u2227 \u00acp3\n\n- p1 \u2227 p3 \u2227 p4 \u2227 \u00acp2\n\n- p2 \u2227 p3 \u2227 p4 \u2227 \u00acp1\n\nBut again, I can't use NOT. So, maybe I need to find an expression that covers these cases without negation.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I can use the fact that p \u2228 q is true if at least one of p or q is true, and p \u2227 q is true only if both are true.\n\nSo, for at least three variables to be true, I can consider the OR of all possible ANDs of three variables.\n\nBut again, that would involve NOT for the fourth variable.\n\nLet me try to write it without NOT.\n\nSuppose I consider p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p3, which requires all three to be true, and p4 can be either true or false. But actually, if p4 is false, it's \u00acp4, which I can't express.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that p4 is true or false, but since I can't use NOT, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that p \u2228 q is true if at least one is true, and think in terms of that.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe condition I can't be expressed without NOT. Or maybe there's a way around it.\n\nLet's move on to condition II: \"Exactly three of p1, p2, p3, p4 are true.\"\n\nThis is similar to condition I, but now I need exactly three to be true, not four.\n\nAgain, this would typically be expressed as the OR of the ANDs of three variables with the fourth being false.\n\nBut since I can't use NOT, this seems even harder.\n\nMaybe condition II can't be expressed without NOT.\n\nNow, condition III: \"An even number of p1, p2, p3, p4 are true.\"\n\nThis means that either zero, two, or four variables are true.\n\nAgain, expressing evenness without NOT seems tricky.\n\nI know that XOR can be used to express parity, but XOR isn't directly available here, and expressing XOR using only AND and OR is possible but requires NOT, which I can't use.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a way to express that the number of true variables is even without using NOT.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of the variables is even, but in Boolean algebra, that might still require NOT.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nMaybe none of these conditions can be expressed without NOT, but that seems unlikely, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe I can use the fact that p \u2228 q is equivalent to \u00ac(\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq), but again, that involves NOT, which I can't use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express these conditions using only AND and OR by considering the relationships between the variables differently.\n\nLet me consider condition I again: \"At least three of p1, p2, p3, p4 are true.\"\n\nIs there a way to express this without negation?\n\nWell, p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p3 \u2227 p4 is straightforward: all four are true.\n\nBut how do I express that at least three are true without referring to the fourth being false?\n\nWait, maybe I can say that (p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p3) \u2228 (p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p4) \u2228 (p1 \u2227 p3 \u2227 p4) \u2228 (p2 \u2227 p3 \u2227 p4).\n\nThis would cover all cases where at least three variables are true, regardless of the fourth one.\n\nBut does this work? Let's see:\n\n- If p1, p2, p3 are true and p4 is false, then (p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p3) is true, so the whole expression is true.\n\n- If p1, p2, p4 are true and p3 is false, then (p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p4) is true, so the whole expression is true.\n\n- If all four are true, then all four terms are true, so the whole expression is true.\n\n- If only two variables are true, say p1 and p2, then none of the terms are true, so the whole expression is false.\n\n- If only one or none are true, same thing, the expression is false.\n\nSo, this seems to work for condition I. I don't need to use NOT at all. So, condition I can be expressed using only AND and OR.\n\nNow, condition II: \"Exactly three of p1, p2, p3, p4 are true.\"\n\nTo express this, I need to say that exactly three are true, which means that three are true and the fourth is false.\n\nBut without NOT, I can't express that the fourth is false.\n\nIf I try something like (p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p3) \u2228 (p1 \u2227 p2 \u2227 p4) \u2228 (p1 \u2227 p3 \u2227 p4) \u2228 (p2 \u2227 p3 \u2227 p4), this is the same as condition I, which includes the case where all four are true.\n\nBut condition II excludes the case where all four are true.\n\nSo, to express exactly three, I need to exclude the case where all four are true.\n\nBut to exclude that, I would need to say \"not all four are true,\" which requires NOT.\n\nSince I can't use NOT, I don't see a way to express exactly three without being able to say that the fourth is false.\n\nTherefore, condition II likely can't be expressed without NOT.\n\nNow, condition III: \"An even number of p1, p2, p3, p4 are true.\"\n\nThis means that the number of true variables is 0, 2, or 4.\n\nAgain, expressing parity without NOT is tricky.\n\nOne way to think about it is to pair the variables in such a way that the expression is true when an even number are true.\n\nBut without NOT, I can't create the necessary cancellations that would allow me to detect evenness.\n\nFor example, with two variables, p1 and p2, an even number are true when both are true or both are false, which is p1 \u2227 p2 \u2228 \u00acp1 \u2227 \u00acp2.\n\nBut again, without NOT, I can't express that.\n\nWith four variables, it's even more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that (p1 \u2227 p2) \u2228 (p3 \u2227 p4) would be true if at least two pairs are true, but that doesn't capture the evenness precisely.\n\nI can see that it's difficult to express condition III without NOT.\n\nTherefore, among the three conditions, only condition I can be expressed using only AND and OR without NOT.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. I only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
