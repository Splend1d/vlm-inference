                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a toy car and a toy truck colliding. It says that the toy truck\u2019s mass is double that of the toy car, and I need to figure out how their accelerations compare during the collision. Specifically, I need to know if the car\u2019s acceleration is double or half that of the truck\u2019s, and whether it\u2019s in the same or opposite direction.\n\nFirst, I remember that when two objects interact, like colliding, Newton\u2019s third law comes into play. That\u2019s the one about action and reaction: for every action, there\u2019s an equal and opposite reaction. So, the force the car exerts on the truck is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force the truck exerts on the car.\n\nNow, acceleration is related to force by Newton\u2019s second law: F = m*a, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration. So, if I know the forces between the two toys are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, and I know their masses, I should be able to find how their accelerations compare.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- m_c = mass of the toy car\n\n- m_t = mass of the toy truck = 2*m_c (since it\u2019s double the car\u2019s mass)\n\n- F_ct = force exerted by the car on the truck\n\n- F_tc = force exerted by the truck on the car\n\nAccording to Newton\u2019s third law, F_ct = -F_tc\n\nNow, using Newton\u2019s second law for each object:\n\nFor the truck:\n\nF_ct = m_t * a_t\n\nFor the car:\n\nF_tc = m_c * a_c\n\nBut since F_ct = -F_tc, I can write:\n\nm_t * a_t = -m_c * a_c\n\nNow, I can solve for a_c in terms of a_t:\n\na_c = -(m_t / m_c) * a_t\n\nBut m_t = 2*m_c, so:\n\na_c = -(2*m_c / m_c) * a_t = -2 * a_t\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car is double the magnitude of the truck\u2019s acceleration and in the opposite direction.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. double the magnitude and in the same direction\n\nB. double the magnitude and in the opposite direction\n\nC. half the magnitude and in the same direction\n\nD. half the magnitude and in the opposite direction\n\nMy answer matches option B.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again. If the truck has double the mass of the car, and they experience equal and opposite forces during the collision, then the car should accelerate more because it has less mass. Specifically, since acceleration is inversely proportional to mass for a given force, the car\u2019s acceleration should be twice that of the truck\u2019s, and in the opposite direction due to the action-reaction pair.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is B. Double the magnitude and in the opposite direction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
