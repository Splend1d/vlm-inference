So, the web designer downloaded a software program from the company's website to help with her business. She clicked the \"download\" button and got the product without seeing or agreeing to any licensing terms. If she had scrolled down, she would have seen an invitation to review and agree to the licensing terms, but she didn't do that. She used the software for several months without knowing that it was sending third-party promotional offers to her clients through some tracking technology. When she found out and asked the company to stop, they ignored her and cited the licensing terms that require disputes to be resolved through private arbitration.\n\nNow, she sued the company to stop the unauthorized tracking, and the company is asking the court to dismiss her complaint and order arbitration based on the licensing terms. The question is, will the federal district court likely dismiss the complaint and order arbitration?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Yes, because the designer got the benefit of the program and it required compliance with its licensing terms.\n\nB. No, because the designer did not have sufficiently clear notice that she must accept the licensing terms prior to downloading and using the product.\n\nC. Yes, because the terms were obvious enough for anyone to find and she would have seen the notation if she had looked in a reasonable manner.\n\nD. No, because contracts formed online must be signed and executed with the same formality as paper contracts.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of clickwrap or browsewrap agreements in the context of online software licenses. In online agreements, especially for software downloads, companies often present users with licensing terms that the user must accept before downloading or using the product. This is usually done through a clickwrap agreement, where the user has to click an \"I agree\" button after reading the terms.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the web designer downloaded the software without seeing or agreeing to the licensing terms. The invitation to review and agree to the terms was present but not in a place where she would have necessarily seen it without scrolling down.\n\nSo, the key issue here is whether the web designer had sufficient notice of the licensing terms and whether she consented to them by downloading and using the software.\n\nOption A suggests that since the designer benefited from the program, she should comply with the licensing terms. While it's true that she benefited from the software, the question is whether she agreed to the terms by using it. In contract law, there needs to be mutual assent for a contract to be enforceable. Did she manifest an intent to be bound by the terms?\n\nOption B argues that she didn't have sufficiently clear notice of the licensing terms. This seems plausible because she didn't see the invitation to review the terms; it was only visible if she scrolled down. Maybe the terms were not prominently displayed or required her to take some affirmative action to accept them.\n\nOption C says that the terms were obvious enough and that she should have looked if she had acted reasonably. This implies that there was adequate notice, and her failure to read the terms is her own fault. But was the notice really obvious? If the invitation was below the fold, meaning it was not visible without scrolling, one could argue that it wasn't sufficiently prominent.\n\nOption D states that online contracts must have the same formality as paper contracts. I'm not sure about that. While there are laws governing electronic signatures and online contracts, such as the E-SIGN Act and the UETA (Uniform Electronic Transactions Act), they generally hold that electronic contracts can be just as valid as paper ones, provided certain conditions are met, like clear notice and consent.\n\nIn this case, since there was no explicit clickwrap agreement\u2014she didn't click an \"I agree\" button\u2014the court might consider whether there was implicit consent through her actions.\n\nI recall that in some cases, courts have found that by downloading and using software, a user can be bound by the licensing terms, even if they didn't click an \"I agree\" button, provided that there was clear and conspicuous notice of the terms.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the notice was not in the immediate view; it required scrolling down. So, was the notice clear and conspicuous enough?\n\nI think option B is the strongest argument here. The designer did not have sufficiently clear notice that she must accept the licensing terms prior to downloading and using the product. Since she didn't see the invitation to review the terms, and the terms were not integrated into the download process in a way that required her to affirmatively accept them, it's questionable whether she can be bound by those terms.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the company ignored her requests to stop the tracking suggests that they might not have adequately informed users about the tracking practices, which could be seen as unfair or deceptive.\n\nTherefore, the court is unlikely to enforce the arbitration clause in the licensing terms because the designer may not have had adequate notice or consented to those terms.\n\nSo, the answer is B. No, because the designer did not have sufficiently clear notice that she must accept the licensing terms prior to downloading and using the product.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
