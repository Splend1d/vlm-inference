                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nWe need to choose 5 different integers from between 20 and 69, inclusive, and we want to find the probability that each of these integers has a different tens digit.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand the range we're dealing with. From 20 to 69 inclusive, that means we're looking at numbers starting from 20 up to 69, including both endpoints.\n\nLet me think about how many numbers that is in total. To find the total number of integers from 20 to 69, inclusive, I can use the formula for the number of terms in a sequence:\n\nNumber of terms = (largest - smallest) / difference + 1\n\nSo, (69 - 20) / 1 + 1 = 50 numbers.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\n20 to 69 inclusive: 20, 21, ..., 69.\n\nIf I subtract 19 from each, it becomes 1 to 50. Yeah, that makes sense. So there are 50 numbers in total.\n\nNow, we're choosing 5 different integers from these 50. The total number of ways to choose 5 different integers from 50 is given by the combination formula C(50,5).\n\nSo, total number of possible selections is C(50,5).\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable selections where each chosen number has a different tens digit.\n\nLet's think about the tens digits in the range 20 to 69.\n\nThe tens digits possible are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nWait, no. 20 has tens digit 2, 30 has 3, up to 69 has tens digit 6. So tens digits are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nBut hold on, numbers like 29 have tens digit 2, 39 have tens digit 3, and so on.\n\nSo, the tens digits range from 2 to 6.\n\nNow, we need to select 5 numbers such that each has a different tens digit. But since there are only 5 distinct tens digits in this range (2,3,4,5,6), and we're choosing 5 numbers, each number must have a unique tens digit. That means one number with tens digit 2, one with 3, one with 4, one with 5, and one with 6.\n\nSo, essentially, we need to choose one number from each of the tens digit groups.\n\nLet's see how many numbers there are in each tens digit group.\n\nTens digit 2: numbers from 20 to 29, that's 10 numbers (20 to 29 inclusive).\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 3: 30 to 39, 10 numbers.\n\nTens digit 4: 40 to 49, 10 numbers.\n\nTens digit 5: 50 to 59, 10 numbers.\n\nTens digit 6: 60 to 69, 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but 69 is included, so tens digit 6 has 10 numbers as well.\n\nSo, each tens digit group has 10 numbers.\n\nNow, since we need to choose one number from each of these 5 groups, and the groups are mutually exclusive in terms of tens digits, the number of ways to choose one number from each group is the product of the number of choices in each group.\n\nSo, number of favorable selections is 10 (for tens digit 2) * 10 (for 3) * 10 (for 4) * 10 (for 5) * 10 (for 6) = 10^5 = 100,000.\n\nWait a minute, but that doesn't seem right. Because the total number of possible selections is C(50,5), which is equal to 50! / (5! * 45!) = approximately 2,118,760.\n\nBut according to my calculation, the number of favorable selections is 100,000, which is larger than the total number of possible selections. That can't be right.\n\nHmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nOh, I think I miscounted the total number of possible selections.\n\nLet me recalculate C(50,5).\n\nC(50,5) = 50! / (5! * 45!) = (50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 47 \u00d7 46) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 47 \u00d7 46) / 120.\n\nCalculating numerator: 50 \u00d7 49 = 2,450.\n\n2,450 \u00d7 48 = 117,600.\n\n117,600 \u00d7 47 = 5,527,200.\n\n5,527,200 \u00d7 46 = 254,251,200.\n\nNow divide by 120: 254,251,200 / 120 = 2,118,760.\n\nSo, C(50,5) = 2,118,760.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the number of favorable selections as 100,000, which is greater than the total number of possible selections. That can't be right. So, I must have made a mistake in that calculation.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf we need to choose one number from each tens digit group, and there are 5 groups with 10 numbers each, then the number of ways to choose one from each group is indeed 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 = 100,000.\n\nBut wait, that would only be correct if the selection was ordered, meaning if the order mattered. But in combinations, order doesn't matter.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to account for the fact that the order doesn't matter.\n\nBut actually, in combinations, when we choose without regard to order, the formula C(n,k) gives the number of unordered selections.\n\nIn this case, since we're choosing one from each group and the groups are distinct, perhaps the initial calculation is correct.\n\nBut still, 100,000 is larger than the total number of possible selections, which is 2,118,760. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the total number of possible selections.\n\nWait, no, C(50,5) is indeed 2,118,760.\n\nBut maybe the number of favorable selections isn't 100,000.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about permutations.\n\nIf I choose one number from each tens digit group, and the order doesn't matter, then the number of ways should be the product of the number of choices in each group, which is 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 = 100,000.\n\nBut again, that can't be right because it's larger than the total number of possible selections.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that some numbers are being overcounted or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to consider that we're choosing one number from each of the five tens digit groups, and since the groups are mutually exclusive, the total number of ways to choose one from each is indeed 10^5 = 100,000.\n\nBut as I said, that's larger than the total number of possible selections, which shouldn't be possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet's consider that we need to choose 5 numbers, each with a different tens digit.\n\nGiven that there are only 5 distinct tens digits available (2,3,4,5,6), and each number must have a unique tens digit, this means that we're essentially choosing one number from each of these five tens digit groups.\n\nSince there are 10 numbers in each tens digit group, the number of ways to choose one number from each group is indeed 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 = 100,000.\n\nBut as I noted before, this is larger than the total number of possible selections, which is 2,118,760.\n\nWait, no, 100,000 is smaller than 2,118,760.\n\nWait, 10^5 is 100,000, and 2,118,760 is much larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I misstated that earlier.\n\nIf 100,000 is smaller than 2,118,760, then that's possible.\n\nSo, perhaps my calculation of the number of favorable selections is correct.\n\nBut then the probability would be 100,000 / 2,118,760, which simplifies to approximately 0.0472, or 4.72%.\n\nBut let's check if this matches any of the given options.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 1/4 = 0.25\n\nB. 1/3 \u2248 0.333...\n\nC. 1000/52969 \u2248 0.0189\n\nD. 2500/52969 \u2248 0.0472\n\nSo, option D is approximately 0.0472, which matches my calculation of 100,000 / 2,118,760.\n\nWait, but is that accurate?\n\nLet me double-check the calculation.\n\nFirst, total number of ways to choose 5 different integers from 50 is C(50,5) = 2,118,760.\n\nNumber of favorable selections is 10^5 = 100,000.\n\nTherefore, probability is 100,000 / 2,118,760.\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 40:\n\n100,000 / 40 = 2,500\n\n2,118,760 / 40 = 52,969\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 2,500 / 52,969.\n\nWhich matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 2500/52969.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure that the number of favorable selections is indeed 100,000.\n\nEach tens digit group has 10 numbers, and we're choosing one from each group, with the groups being mutually exclusive in terms of tens digits.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose one number from each group is indeed 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 = 100,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 100,000 / 2,118,760, which simplifies to 2,500 / 52,969.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2500}{52969}} \\]"
