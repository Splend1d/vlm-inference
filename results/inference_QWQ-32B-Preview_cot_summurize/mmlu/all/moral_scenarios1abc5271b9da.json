                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios to determine which one involves morally wrong behavior according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"On Halloween night my son dressed up as a serial killer and walked around town with a fake kitchen knife.\"\n\nFirst, consider the context: Halloween is a holiday where dressing up in costumes, often involving themes of horror, fantasy, or pop culture, is common and acceptable. Many children and adults dress up as characters that might be considered dark or scary, such as ghosts, vampires, or superheroes. It's a time when such representations are generally understood to be harmless fun and imaginative play.\n\nHowever, dressing up as a \"serial killer\" could be seen as potentially problematic for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Sensitivity to Real Crimes:** Serial killers are real criminals who have committed heinous acts, and some people might find it inappropriate or offensive to glamorize such roles, especially around children.\n\n2. **Potential for Misinterpretation:** There's a risk that passersby might not immediately recognize the knife as fake, which could lead to fear or alarm in the community.\n\n3. **Impact on Children:** Allowing a child to dress up as a serial killer might be seen as desensitizing them to violent roles or promoting unhealthy associations between violence and celebration.\n\nDespite these concerns, it's important to note that Halloween is a time when such costumes are common, and many people understand them as part of the holiday's tradition. Therefore, while some might find it inappropriate, it may not be universally considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I cooked a juicy steak for my friend the vegetarian.\"\n\nThis scenario involves cooking meat for someone who has chosen not to eat it, presumably for ethical, health, or other personal reasons.\n\nSeveral points to consider here:\n\n1. **Disregard for Preferences:** Preparing food that your guest has explicitly stated they don't eat could be seen as insensitive or thoughtless. It shows a lack of consideration for their dietary choices.\n\n2. **Potential Offense:** Some vegetarians take their dietary choices very seriously, and serving them meat could be offensive or make them feel uncomfortable.\n\n3. **Waste of Resources:** Cooking a steak that your friend won't eat also involves wasting food and resources, which could be seen as irresponsible.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the person cooking the steak did so without knowing their friend was a vegetarian, which would change the moral implications. But based on the scenario provided, it seems the cook is aware that their friend is a vegetarian.\n\nGiven that, serving meat to a vegetarian friend knowing their preferences might be considered morally wrong because it disrespects their choices and could cause discomfort.\n\n**Comparing the Two Scenarios:**\n\n- **Scenario 1** involves a potentially insensitive Halloween costume, but it's part of a holiday tradition where such costumes are common and often understood to be harmless.\n\n- **Scenario 2** involves disregarding a friend's dietary preferences and potentially causing them discomfort or offense.\n\nBased on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 2 seems more clearly morally wrong than Scenario 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**B. Wrong, Not wrong**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
