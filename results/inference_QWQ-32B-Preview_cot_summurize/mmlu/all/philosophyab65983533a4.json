                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Stevenson's view on ethical judgments. The question is: \"Stevenson claims that the primary use of ethical judgments is to:\n\nA. state facts.\n\nB. influence the interests of others.\n\nC. describe one\u2019s own approval of things.\n\nD. none of the above.\"\n\nI remember that Stevenson was an ethical expressivist, which means he thought that moral statements primarily serve to express the speaker's attitudes or emotions rather than to make factual claims. So, option A, \"state facts,\" seems unlikely because expressivism rejects the idea that moral statements are factual assertions.\n\nOption B, \"influence the interests of others,\" sounds interesting. Maybe Stevenson thought that moral language is used to persuade others to have certain attitudes or to influence their behavior. That could make sense in the context of expressivism, where moral statements are seen as having a motivational component.\n\nOption C, \"describe one\u2019s own approval of things,\" seems similar to expressivism because it suggests that moral judgments are about expressing one's own feelings or approvals. But is that the primary use according to Stevenson?\n\nI need to recall Stevenson's specific views. I think he saw moral language as having both an expressive function and a persuasive function. He talked about moral statements as having both an \"attitudinal\" meaning and a \"persuasive\" meaning.\n\nIn his book \"Ethics and Language,\" Stevenson distinguishes between \"persuasive definitions\" and other kinds of definitions. He argues that moral terms have emotive meanings that are used to influence others' attitudes and behavior.\n\nSo, perhaps the primary use, according to Stevenson, is to influence the interests of others. That would make option B the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, option C seems similar, as it mentions describing one's own approval. Maybe Stevenson saw moral judgments as both expressing one's own attitudes and trying to influence others.\n\nUpon closer thought, perhaps the primary use is to influence others by expressing one's own approval or disapproval, thereby trying to bring others to share those attitudes.\n\nStevenson discussed the notion of \"persuasive definitions,\" where terms are defined in such a way as to have an emotional impact and influence attitudes. So, maybe the primary use is to influence others.\n\nHowever, I recall that Stevenson also emphasized that moral language has an expressive function, where it communicates the speaker's attitudes.\n\nPerhaps the primary use is to express one's own approval or disapproval, and secondarily to influence others. But the question asks for the primary use.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is \"influence the interests of others,\" and option C is \"describe one\u2019s own approval of things.\"\n\nMaybe Stevenson saw both as important, but if I have to choose one as the primary use, perhaps influencing others is the main purpose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe describing one's own approval is the primary use, and influencing others is a secondary effect.\n\nI need to think carefully here.\n\nStevenson's theory is often associated with what is called \"emotive theory\" or \"expressivism,\" which emphasizes that moral statements express the speaker's emotions or attitudes.\n\nSo, in that sense, option C, \"describe one\u2019s own approval of things,\" seems fitting.\n\nBut Stevenson also discussed the \"stability of temptation\" and the way moral language can be used to influence others' attitudes and behavior.\n\nPerhaps the primary use is to express one's own attitudes, and a secondary use is to influence others.\n\nBut the question is about the primary use.\n\nI think Stevenson would say that the primary use is to express one's own approval or disapproval, and through that expression, to influence others.\n\nSo, maybe option C is the best answer, with the influence on others being a consequence of that expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Stevenson saw the influence on others as the primary purpose.\n\nI need to check some sources to be sure.\n\nLooking back at Stevenson's works, particularly \"Ethics and Language,\" he discusses how moral language has both an expressive function and a persuasive function.\n\nHe notes that when people make moral judgments, they are not just stating facts but also expressing their attitudes and trying to influence others.\n\nHowever, he seems to emphasize that the core or primary function is to express the speaker's attitudes.\n\nIn his later work, \"The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms,\" Stevenson argues that moral terms have both descriptive meanings and emotive meanings. The descriptive meaning can be stated factually, but the emotive meaning is about expressing attitudes and influencing others.\n\nSo, perhaps the primary use is to express one's own attitudes, and the influence on others is a secondary effect.\n\nGiven that, option C, \"describe one\u2019s own approval of things,\" might be the best answer.\n\nBut I need to be careful because \"describe\" might not be the exact term Stevenson used. He might have preferred \"express\" over \"describe.\"\n\nAlso, option B, \"influence the interests of others,\" could be seen as a goal of moral language, but perhaps not the primary use.\n\nMaybe the primary use is to express one's own attitudes, and influencing others is a secondary aim.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C: describe one\u2019s own approval of things.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider option D, \"none of the above.\" If neither A, B, nor C accurately captures Stevenson's view, then D would be the correct choice.\n\nHowever, based on my understanding of Stevenson's expressivism, option C seems the most appropriate.\n\nSo, I will go with C: describe one\u2019s own approval of things.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
