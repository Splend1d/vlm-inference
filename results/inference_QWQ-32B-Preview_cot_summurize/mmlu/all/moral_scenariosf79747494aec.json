                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I was bored and dug a hole to create a cellar in my backyard.\n\nScenario 2: I was due to start work soon, so I went to a baseball game.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: digging a hole to create a cellar in my backyard because I was bored.\n\nWell, digging in your own backyard might be okay if you own the property and have the rights to do so. But creating a cellar could involve building regulations or permits. If I dig a hole without checking local building codes or getting necessary permissions, that might be illegal, which could be considered morally wrong because I'm breaking the law.\n\nAlso, digging a hole for no real reason except being bored seems irresponsible. Maybe I should have found a more productive way to spend my time.\n\nOn the other hand, if I have the right to dig in my backyard and I've followed all the rules, then it might not be morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I was due to start work soon, so I went to a baseball game.\n\nThis one seems tricky. If I'm supposed to start work soon, going to a baseball game might mean I'm avoiding work or being irresponsible about my job duties.\n\nIf going to the baseball game means I'm skipping work or not preparing properly for my new job, that could be considered morally wrong because I'm being unreliable and not fulfilling my responsibilities.\n\nHowever, maybe the baseball game is unrelated to work, and I'm going on my day off or something. In that case, it might not be wrong.\n\nWait, the scenario says \"I was due to start work soon, so I went to a baseball game.\" It sounds like the reason for going to the game is connected to starting work soon, but it's not clear how.\n\nMaybe \"due to start work soon\" means I have some free time before starting work, and I'm using that time to go to a baseball game. In that case, it might not be wrong at all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"due to start work soon\" implies that I should be preparing for work, but instead I'm going to a baseball game, which could be seen as procrastination or irresponsibility.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn general, people expect others to follow rules and regulations, especially regarding property and building codes. So, in Scenario 1, if digging a cellar requires permits and I didn't get them, that would be wrong.\n\nAlso, being responsible in one's duties, especially regarding work, is important. So, if going to a baseball game means neglecting work responsibilities, that would be wrong.\n\nBut in this case, it's about starting work soon, not actually being at work. Maybe it's before my first day, and I'm taking some personal time. In that case, it might be fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"due to start work soon\" means I'm expected to be doing something work-related, like an internship or a voluntary position, and going to a baseball game instead is\u4e0d\u5f53\u7684.\n\nI'm not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should look at each scenario separately.\n\nFor Scenario 1, digging a hole in my backyard to create a cellar out of boredom.\n\nFirst, is it my property? If it's my backyard and I own the house, I probably have the right to dig, but I need to check local regulations.\n\nIf I don't have the proper permits or if it's against zoning laws, then digging could be illegal, which would be morally wrong.\n\nAlso, digging a hole out of boredom seems impulsive and not well-thought-out. Maybe I should have considered the potential consequences or sought permission first.\n\nSo, in this case, it seems like Scenario 1 could be morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: due to start work soon, so I went to a baseball game.\n\nThis one is less clear. If going to the baseball game is during my personal time and doesn't interfere with my work responsibilities, then it might not be wrong.\n\nHowever, if I'm supposed to be preparing for work or completing tasks before starting, and instead I'm going to a baseball game, that could be seen as irresponsible.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, being responsible and honoring commitments, especially professional ones, is important.\n\nSo, if going to the baseball game means I'm neglecting my responsibilities, then it would be wrong.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nMaybe in 2020, during the pandemic, circumstances were different, and people had more flexibility.\n\nBut according to ordinary standards, if it's personal time, going to a baseball game might be fine.\n\nAlternatively, if it's expected that I should be preparing for work, then it might be wrong.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the key is to consider whether the actions in each scenario harm others or violate rules and responsibilities.\n\nIn Scenario 1, digging without permission could harm neighbors or violate regulations, which would affect others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, going to a baseball game might only affect me and possibly my future employer if I'm supposed to be doing something work-related.\n\nBut again, without clear context, it's hard to judge.\n\nMaybe I should consider what a reasonable person would do in each situation.\n\nIn Scenario 1, a reasonable person would likely check local building codes and obtain necessary permits before digging a cellar.\n\nIf I didn't do that, that would be unreasonable and potentially wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if I'm due to start work soon, a reasonable person would ensure they are prepared and fulfilling any pre-work requirements.\n\nIf going to a baseball game interferes with that, it might be unreasonable.\n\nBut if it's personal time, then it's acceptable.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, and Scenario 2 isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer might be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if both scenarios could be considered not wrong depending on the context, then D would be possible.\n\nBut based on the information given, I think B is the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
