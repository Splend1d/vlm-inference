                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the plastic army figures industry. It says that this industry uses only a small fraction of the plastic demanded for all purposes. And based on that, we're supposed to conclude what kind of industry it is: increasing-cost, constant-cost, decreasing-cost, or profit-making.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these terms mean. An increasing-cost industry is one where as the industry expands, the cost of production increases because of higher input prices. A constant-cost industry is where the cost of production stays the same even as the industry grows, maybe because of technological improvements or better negotiation with suppliers. A decreasing-cost industry is one where the cost of production decreases as the industry expands, perhaps due to economies of scale. And a profit-making industry is just one that makes a profit, which seems a bit different from the other options.\n\nNow, the key point here is that the army figures industry uses only a small fraction of the plastic demanded overall. That suggests that changes in this industry's demand for plastic wouldn't significantly affect the overall price of plastic. In other words, if this industry expands and needs more plastic, the additional demand would be a small part of the total demand, so the price of plastic wouldn't go up much, if at all.\n\nComparing this to the definitions, it sounds like the cost of production wouldn't increase significantly as the industry grows, which seems like it could be a constant-cost industry. But let me think about it more deeply.\n\nIn an increasing-cost industry, expansion leads to higher input prices because the industry is consuming a larger share of the available inputs, driving up their cost. But here, since the army figures industry uses only a small fraction of the plastic, even if it expands, it wouldn't consume a significant portion of the plastic supply, so the price shouldn't increase substantially.\n\nIn a constant-cost industry, the cost of production remains unchanged as the industry expands. This could happen if the industry can access inputs at constant prices, perhaps because the input market is very large relative to the industry's demand.\n\nA decreasing-cost industry would see costs decrease as it expands, perhaps due to economies of scale or technological advancements.\n\nGiven that the army figures industry uses only a small fraction of the plastic, it's likely that the price of plastic won't be affected by the industry's growth, so the cost of production remains relatively constant. Therefore, it seems most similar to a constant-cost industry.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the industry's small demand for plastic means that it can easily adjust its production without affecting input prices, which again points to a constant-cost industry.\n\nOption D, profit-making industry, seems different because it's about whether the industry makes a profit, not about how its costs change with scale.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the answer is B. constant-cost industry.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
