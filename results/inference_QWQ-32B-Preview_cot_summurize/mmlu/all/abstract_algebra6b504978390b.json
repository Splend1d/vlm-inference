The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that for every element \\(a\\) in the ring, \\(n \\cdot a = 0\\), where \\(0\\) is the additive identity of the ring. If no such integer exists, the characteristic is said to be 0.\n\nFirst, let's recall that \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\) is the set of all ordered pairs of integers, with component-wise addition and multiplication. That is, for any two elements \\((a, b)\\) and \\((c, d)\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\), their sum is \\((a + c, b + d)\\) and their product is \\((a \\cdot c, b \\cdot d)\\).\n\nThe additive identity in this ring is \\((0, 0)\\), since adding this to any element \\((a, b)\\) gives \\((a, b)\\) back.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n \\cdot (a, b) = (0, 0)\\) for all \\((a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nLet's compute \\(n \\cdot (a, b)\\):\n\n\\[n \\cdot (a, b) = (n \\cdot a, n \\cdot b)\\]\n\nWe want this to equal \\((0, 0)\\), which means both components must be 0:\n\n\\[n \\cdot a = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n \\cdot b = 0\\]\n\nFor this to hold for all integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(n\\) must be such that \\(n \\cdot a = 0\\) for all \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), and similarly for \\(b\\).\n\nHowever, in the ring of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), the only integer \\(n\\) that satisfies \\(n \\cdot a = 0\\) for all \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) is \\(n = 0\\). This is because if \\(n\\) is a non-zero integer, there exists some \\(a\\) (for example, \\(a = 1\\)) such that \\(n \\cdot 1 = n \\neq 0\\).\n\nTherefore, there is no positive integer \\(n\\) that satisfies \\(n \\cdot (a, b) = (0, 0)\\) for all \\((a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\). Hence, the characteristic of the ring \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\) is 0.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
