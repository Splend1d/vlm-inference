Reduction of triglycerides\n\nB. Hypoglycemia\n\nC. Increase of insulin sensitivity\n\nD. Help controlling hypertension\n\nFirst, I know that exercise is generally good for people with diabetes. It helps with blood sugar control and overall health. So, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A is reduction of triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood, and high levels can be bad for heart health. Exercise is known to help lower triglyceride levels, so that seems like a beneficial effect.\n\nOption B is hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia means low blood sugar. Now, for people with diabetes, especially those who take certain medications, exercise can sometimes lower blood sugar too much, causing hypoglycemia. So, is this a beneficial effect? Hmm, not really. It can be a risk or a side effect, but not something that's desirable.\n\nOption C is increase of insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity is good because it means the body responds better to insulin, which helps lower blood sugar. Exercise is known to improve insulin sensitivity, so that's definitely a beneficial effect.\n\nOption D is help controlling hypertension. Hypertension is high blood pressure, and exercise is effective in helping to manage blood pressure. So, that's another beneficial effect.\n\nComparing all these, option B, hypoglycemia, doesn't seem like a beneficial effect. While exercise can cause it, it's not something that's desirable; it's more of a potential risk that needs to be managed.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. Hypoglycemia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
