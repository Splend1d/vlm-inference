                    "text": "Let's see. I have this passage from Roland Doregel\u00e8s about the announcement of mobilization for war in 1914. He seems pretty excited about it, leaping to read the message and feeling exhilarated. Then he tells Georges Clemenceau that Paris is \"singing,\" and Clemenceau seems to take that as a good sign. So, the question is asking what we can infer from this about how mobilization was greeted in Paris.\n\nOption A says it was greeted with great skepticism in Paris. But from the passage, it seems like the opposite\u2014people are excited and enthusiastic. Doregel\u00e8s himself is exhilarated, and Paris is \"singing.\" So, skepticism doesn't really fit here.\n\nOption B talks about skepticism all across Europe. But the passage only mentions Paris and France, not other European countries. So, that's probably not the right inference.\n\nOption C says mobilization was greeted with great enthusiasm all across Europe. Again, the passage only talks about Paris and France, not all of Europe. So, making a generalization about all of Europe might not be accurate based on this single account.\n\nOption D says mobilization was greeted with great enthusiasm in Paris. That aligns well with the passage. Doregel\u00e8s is excited, people are running and shouting, and Paris is \"singing.\" So, this seems like the most appropriate inference based on the information provided.\n\nI think the key here is to pay attention to the specific details given in the passage and not read more into it than what's there. The passage is about Doregel\u00e8s' experience in Paris, and it portrays a sense of excitement and enthusiasm for the mobilization. So, inferring that mobilization was greeted with great enthusiasm in Paris makes the most sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
