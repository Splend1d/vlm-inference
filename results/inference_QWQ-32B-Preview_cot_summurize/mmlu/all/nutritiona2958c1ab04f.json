                    "text": "D. Vitamin C\n\nVitamin C is essential for the hydroxylation reactions in collagen synthesis. During collagen synthesis, prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase enzymes require vitamin C as a cofactor to hydroxylate proline and lysine residues in the collagen peptide chains. This hydroxylation is crucial for the stability and proper folding of the collagen molecule.\n\nTo elaborate:\n\n1. **Collagen Synthesis Process:**\n   - Collagen is synthesized as procollagen, which consists of three polypeptide chains.\n   - These chains contain repeating sequences of glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline.\n\n2. **Role of Hydroxylation:**\n   - Hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues is necessary for the correct folding and stability of the collagen triple helix.\n   - Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine residues form hydrogen bonds that stabilize the collagen structure.\n\n3. **Enzymes Involved:**\n   - **Prolyl hydroxylase:** Hydroxylates proline residues.\n   - **Lysyl hydroxylase:** Hydroxylates lysine residues.\n\n4. **Vitamin C as a Cofactor:**\n   - Both prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase require vitamin C (ascorbic acid) as a cofactor to carry out the hydroxylation reactions.\n   - Vitamin C donates a hydroxyl group to the enzyme-substrate complex, facilitating the addition of the hydroxyl group to the amino acids.\n\n5. **Deficiency Effects:**\n   - A deficiency in vitamin C leads to impaired collagen synthesis, resulting in conditions like scurvy, characterized by weak connective tissues, bleeding gums, and poor wound healing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Vitamin C."
