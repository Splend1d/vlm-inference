                    "text": "I'm going to take a shot at this question. So, the singer is talking about some argument that messes with a traditional distinction. The options are between duty and charity, egoism and altruism, rights and privileges, and positive and negative rights. I need to figure out which one his argument is upsetting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these pairs means.\n\nDuty and charity: Duty is something you're obligated to do, like paying taxes or keeping promises. Charity is voluntary giving, like donating to charity or helping someone in need out of kindness. So, the distinction here is between what you must do and what you choose to do.\n\nEgoism and altruism: Egoism is acting in your own self-interest, while altruism is acting in the interest of others. So, this distinction is about whether your actions are for yourself or for others.\n\nRights and privileges: Rights are entitlements that are fundamental and inalienable, like the right to free speech or the right to life. Privileges are special advantages or permissions that are not universal, like being allowed to drive or entering a members-only club. So, the distinction is between what everyone is entitled to and what is granted to some.\n\nPositive and negative rights: Positive rights involve entitlement to something, like education or healthcare, which requires action from others to fulfill. Negative rights involve being free from interference, like the right to privacy or freedom of speech, which requires others to refrain from certain actions. So, the distinction is between rights that require action and rights that require inaction.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these distinctions the singer's argument is upsetting. Since it's about the singer, I'm assuming it's Peter Singer, the philosopher known for his work in ethics and humanitarianism, particularly his views on poverty and animal rights.\n\nSinger is famous for his argument about our obligations to help those in need, especially in cases of extreme poverty. He argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable significance, we ought to do it. This is often referred to as the \"drowning child\" analogy, where he compares ignoring poverty to walking past a child drowning in a shallow pond when you're wearing expensive shoes.\n\nSo, his argument seems to be blurring the lines between what we consider charitable acts and what we consider moral duties. Traditionally, helping those in need is seen as charity, something beyond what is required by moral duty. But Singer argues that in cases of extreme need, not helping is morally impermissible, suggesting that it's a matter of duty rather than charity.\n\nLooking back at the options, this seems to relate to option A: duty and charity.\n\nOption B, egoism and altruism, might be relevant in that his argument is against egoistic behavior and in favor of altruistic actions, but the question is about upsetting a traditional distinction, and it's more about redefining what we consider our duties to be, not necessarily about the motivations behind actions.\n\nOption C, rights and privileges, doesn't seem directly related to Singer's argument about helping those in need. His focus is on moral obligations rather than on rights or privileges.\n\nOption D, positive and negative rights, might be tangentially related if we consider that helping those in need could be seen as a positive right (entitlement to assistance), but Singer's argument is more about duties to help rather than about rights themselves.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is A: duty and charity. Singer's argument suggests that what is traditionally considered charitable should be regarded as a moral duty, thus upsetting the distinction between what is obligatory and what is voluntary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
