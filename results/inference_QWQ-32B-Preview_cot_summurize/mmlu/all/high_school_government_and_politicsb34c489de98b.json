                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about voting rates among young Americans. The question is asking which of the options doesn't contribute to lower voting rates in the 18-to-25 age bracket. So, we need to identify the option that isn't a factor in reducing voter turnout for this age group.\n\nFirst, let's look at option A: college attendance in a state other than one's home state. When students go to college in a different state, they might face barriers to voting, such as registering to vote in a new location, understanding the local voting processes, or choosing to maintain their voter registration in their home state instead. These complexities can lead to lower voting rates among this group. So, this seems like it does contribute to lower voting rates.\n\nOption B is frequent relocation of one's primary residence. Young people in this age bracket often move around a lot\u2014for school, internships, jobs, or personal reasons. Each time someone moves, they need to update their voter registration, which can be a hassle. If they miss the deadline or don't know how to update their registration in their new location, they might not be able to vote. So, frequent moving can definitely contribute to lower voting rates.\n\nOption C mentions the remoteness of most political issues to the daily lives of young people. This suggests that young people might not see the immediate relevance of political issues to their day-to-day experiences, which could lead to apathy or disengagement from the voting process. If they don't feel that voting will make a difference in their lives, they might be less likely to vote. So, this also seems like a valid contributor to lower voting rates.\n\nNow, option D is \"the fact that the minimum voting age in some states is 21.\" Wait a second, I know that the national voting age in the United States is 18, and that's been the case since the 26th Amendment was ratified in 1971. So, I'm a bit confused here. Does any state have a minimum voting age higher than 18?\n\nI recall that in the past, some states had voting ages higher than 18, but after the 26th Amendment, the national voting age was set to 18, and states couldn't set a higher voting age for federal elections. In fact, the amendment specifically lowered the voting age from 21 to 18 for all elections, federal and state. So, I don't think any state can set a minimum voting age of 21 for federal elections.\n\nBut maybe for certain types of elections or referendums, there could be different age requirements. For example, some local elections or specific ballot measures might have different age restrictions, but for general elections, the voting age should be 18 nationwide.\n\nGiven that, option D seems unlikely to be a contributor to lower voting rates in the 18-to-25 age bracket because the national voting age is 18. In fact, if there were states with a higher voting age, that would directly prevent younger people from voting, but since that's not the case, this option doesn't make sense.\n\nComparing all the options, A, B, and C present plausible reasons why voting rates might be lower among 18-to-25-year-olds, while D seems incorrect because the voting age is uniformly 18 across the U.S.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: the fact that the minimum voting age in some states is 21. Because, in reality, the minimum voting age is 18 everywhere in the United States for federal elections, and states can't set a higher age.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
