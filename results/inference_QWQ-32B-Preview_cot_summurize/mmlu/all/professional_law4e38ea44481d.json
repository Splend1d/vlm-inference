                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a shopper who got hurt by a mirror that fell from the wall in a grocery store. The mirror was hung by a local carpenter, and it turned out there was a defect in the brackets that held the mirror. Now, the shopper is making a claim against the carpenter based on something called \"strict liability in tort.\" I need to figure out whether the shopper will prevail or not, and why.\n\nFirst off, what is strict liability in tort? From what I remember, strict liability means that someone can be held liable for damages even if they didn't intend to cause harm or were negligent. It's usually applied in situations where the activity is considered especially dangerous or inherently risky.\n\nIn this case, the shopper is claiming against the carpenter under strict liability. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\n\nB. Prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privacy with the plaintiff.\n\nHmm. Option A suggests that since the brackets were defective, the shopper can hold the carpenter strictly liable. But I think strict liability for product defects usually applies to the manufacturer or seller of the defective product, not necessarily to someone who installed it.\n\nOption B says that maintaining a large mirror on a retail wall is abnormally dangerous. I'm not sure about that. Installing mirrors in stores is pretty common; I don't think it's considered abnormally dangerous unless there are specific circumstances.\n\nOption C states that the carpenter wasn't selling the mirror, so the shopper shouldn't prevail. That seems plausible because strict liability often applies to sellers or manufacturers of defective products.\n\nOption D mentions that there was no relationship of privacy between the carpenter and the plaintiff. I'm not sure what \"relationship of privacy\" means in this context. Maybe it's referring to a duty of care or some sort of special relationship that would impose liability, but I'm not certain.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The mirror was installed by a carpenter, who was likely hired by the grocery store. The defect was in the brackets provided by the manufacturer. So, the question is, does the carpenter who installed the mirror have strict liability for injuries caused by a defect in the brackets?\n\nI think strict liability typically applies to those who are in the business of selling or manufacturing products that turn out to be defective. In this case, the carpenter was hired to install the mirror, not to sell or manufacture it. So, perhaps the carpenter doesn't fall under strict liability here.\n\nAlso, the defect was in the brackets, which were provided by the manufacturer. So, it might make more sense for the manufacturer to be held strictly liable, as they are the ones who produced the defective product.\n\nAdditionally, the grocery store might have some liability because they own the store and are responsible for ensuring the safety of their premises for shoppers.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the carpenter and whether the shopper can prevail against him under strict liability.\n\nLet me check what strict liability entails again. Strict liability is a legal doctrine that holds a person legally responsible for damages or injuries even without fault or intent. It's often applied in cases involving ultrahazardous activities or in product liability cases.\n\nIn product liability, manufacturers and sellers can be strictly liable for defects in their products that cause harm. But in this scenario, the carpenter is not the manufacturer or the seller of the mirror or the brackets. He was hired to install them.\n\nSo, perhaps strict liability doesn't apply to the carpenter in this situation. That would make option C correct: the shopper won't prevail because the carpenter wasn't engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the carpenter could be considered in the role of a seller if he provided the brackets, but the question says that the manufacturer provided the brackets and bolts. So, it seems like the carpenter was just hired to do the installation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a concept of strict liability for professionals. Like, if a professional is hired to do a job, and they do it improperly, causing harm, perhaps there's strict liability. But I think that's more related to negligence than strict liability in tort.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's strict liability for ultrahazardous activities, but hanging a mirror doesn't seem ultrahazardous. It's a common activity in many businesses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's strict liability for activities that are abnormally dangerous, but again, hanging a mirror doesn't strike me as abnormally dangerous, especially if it's done properly.\n\nGiven that, I think the most plausible answer is C: the shopper will not prevail because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n\nOption D mentions no relationship of privacy. I'm not sure what that means. Maybe it's referring to no privity, which is a legal concept meaning that there is no direct contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. In older law, you could only sue someone with whom you had a direct contract, but that rule has been largely abolished in many jurisdictions through legislation.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the carpenter and the shopper had no direct relationship, so the shopper can't hold the carpenter strictly liable. But I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"privacy\" is just a typo and it should be \"privity,\" which makes more sense in a legal context.\n\nAssuming it's \"privity,\" then yes, without a direct contractual relationship, the shopper might not be able to hold the carpenter liable under strict liability.\n\nBut again, I think the key point is that strict liability in tort for product defects generally applies to manufacturers and sellers, not to installers who are hired to install the product.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: the shopper will not prevail because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there are any other theories under which the carpenter could be held strictly liable.\n\nFor example, is there strict liability for trespass? No, that doesn't apply here.\n\nHow about strict liability for animals? Not relevant.\n\nStrict liability for defective products\u2014again, that applies to manufacturers and sellers.\n\nStrict liability for abnormally dangerous activities\u2014hanging a mirror doesn't seem abnormally dangerous.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that the carpenter wouldn't be held strictly liable in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the shopper will not prevail in his claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
