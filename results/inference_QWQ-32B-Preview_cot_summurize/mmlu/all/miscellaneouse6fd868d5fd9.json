                    "text": "I think the answer is B. Malcolm Little. I remember reading that Malcolm X's birth name was Malcolm Little. But let me double-check to make sure.\n\nSo, Malcolm X was a significant figure in the civil rights movement in the United States. He was an African American Muslim minister and human rights activist who was a prominent figure during the 1950s and 1960s. He first came to national attention as a leader of the Nation of Islam, an African American religious movement.\n\nNow, regarding his birth name, I recall that he was born Malcolm Little. Let me confirm that. According to various sources, including his autobiography and historical records, Malcolm X was indeed born Malcolm Little on May 19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nOption A is Michael Brown, which sounds familiar because there was a young man named Michael Brown who was involved in a highly publicized incident in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. But that's not related to Malcolm X.\n\nOption C is Malcolm Lincoln. I don't think that's correct because Lincoln is more associated with Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, who played a crucial role in abolishing slavery.\n\nOption D is Michael Lloyd, which doesn't seem to have any connection to Malcolm X.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Malcolm Little.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me see if there's any other information that might suggest a different birth name. After a quick search, all reliable sources confirm that his birth name was Malcolm Little.\n\nSo, I'm confident that B. Malcolm Little is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
