                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem about a couple who both have a family history of \u03b1-thalassemia. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration and has one gene deletion, while the man has microcytic anemia and has two gene deletions. The problem specifies that the two-gene deletion in the man is in trans, meaning one deletion is on the maternal allele and one is on the paternal allele. I need to find out what percentage of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand \u03b1-thalassemia and how it's inherited. Alpha-thalassemia is caused by deletions or mutations in the HBA1 and HBA2 genes, which are responsible for making the alpha chains of hemoglobin. Since hemoglobin is made up of alpha and beta chains, defects in the alpha chains can affect hemoglobin function.\n\nIn \u03b1-thalassemia, the number of deleted genes determines the severity of the condition. There are four potential alpha-globin genes (two on each chromosome 16), and the number of deletions can range from one to four.\n\n- One deletion: silent carrier, usually no symptoms\n\n- Two deletions: can be in cis (both deletions on the same chromosome) or in trans (deletions on different chromosomes). In trans, it's like having one from each parent, which might lead to a more severe form.\n\n- Three deletions: HbH disease, which causes moderate to severe anemia\n\n- Four deletions: hydrops fetalis, which is often fatal before or shortly after birth\n\nGiven that the woman has one deletion and the man has two deletions in trans, I need to figure out the possible combinations their offspring could inherit.\n\nLet me denote the normal alpha-globin gene as \"+\", and the deleted gene as \"-\".\n\nSo, the woman has one deletion, so her genotype is likely \"+ -\" (one normal gene and one deleted gene).\n\nThe man has two deletions in trans, so his genotype is \"- -\" with each \"-\" on a different chromosome.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since his two deletions are in trans, it means he has one chromosome with one deletion and the other chromosome with another deletion. But in reality, for two deletions, it's typically represented as \"--\" on one chromosome and \"++\" on the other, but that might not be accurate.\n\nActually, in \u03b1-thalassemia, having two deletions in trans means that each chromosome has one deleted gene. So, if there are two genes per chromosome, it would be like having one deletion on each chromosome.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps it's better to consider the possible alleles the parents can pass on.\n\nLet's consider that each parent has two chromosomes, each with two alpha-globin genes.\n\nNormal: ++/++\n\nOne deletion: ++/+- or +-/++\n\nTwo deletions in trans: +-/-+ or -+/+-\n\nTwo deletions in cis: --/++\n\nThree deletions: --/+- or +-/-- \n\nFour deletions: --/--\n\nBut this might be getting too complicated for this problem.\n\nMaybe it's easier to consider the possible gametes each parent can produce.\n\nThe woman has one deletion, so her genotype is likely \"+ -\". When she produces eggs, each egg will get one of these alleles, so 50% of her eggs will have \"+\" and 50% will have \"-\".\n\nThe man has two deletions in trans, so his genotype is \"- -\", with each \"-\" on different chromosomes. So, all his sperm will have one \"-\" allele.\n\nWait, no. If he has two deletions in trans, meaning one deletion on each chromosome, then each sperm will get one chromosome with one deletion.\n\nSo, if his chromosomes are \"-+\" and \"-+\", then each sperm will have one \"-\" and one \"+\", but that doesn't make sense because sperm are haploid.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of it differently. Maybe it's better to consider that he has two deleted genes, each on a different chromosome.\n\nSo, his genotype is something like \"- -\", meaning both chromosomes have one deleted gene each.\n\nBut that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to consider the possible genotypes based on the number of deleted genes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the possible combinations based on the number of deleted genes passed from each parent.\n\nThe woman has one deletion, so she can pass on either a normal gene (+) or the deleted gene (-) to her offspring.\n\nThe man has two deletions in trans, which means he passes on one deleted gene (-) to all his offspring because both his alleles are deleted.\n\nWait, no. If he has two deletions in trans, it means he has one deletion on each chromosome. So, when he produces sperm, each sperm will get one chromosome, which has one deletion.\n\nSo, if his chromosomes are \"-+\" and \"-+\", then each sperm will have one \"-\" and one \"+\", but since it's haploid, perhaps it's just \"-\".\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up how deletions are inherited in \u03b1-thalassemia.\n\nUpon checking, \u03b1-thalassemia involves deletions of the alpha-globin genes, and there are four possible genes (two on each chromosome 16).\n\nDeletions can occur on one or both chromosomes, leading to different clinical presentations.\n\nIn this case, the woman has one deletion, so she is a carrier with three functional genes.\n\nThe man has two deletions in trans, meaning he has two chromosomes, each with one deletion, so he has two functional genes.\n\nNow, for their offspring:\n\n- The child can inherit one chromosome from the mother and one from the father.\n\n- The mother has one chromosome with two genes (\"++\") and one with one deleted gene (\"+-\").\n\n- The father has two chromosomes, each with one deleted gene (\"+-\").\n\nWait, I need to clarify.\n\nActually, in \u03b1-thalassemia, the genes are arranged in a pair on each chromosome. So, chromosome 16 has two alpha-globin genes.\n\nIf a person has one deletion, it means one of the two genes on one chromosome is deleted.\n\nIf they have two deletions in trans, it means one deletion on each chromosome.\n\nSo, the woman has one deletion, so her chromosomes are: one with two genes (\"++\"), and one with one deleted gene (\"+-\").\n\nThe man has two deletions in trans, so his chromosomes are: one with one deleted gene (\"+-\") and the other with one deleted gene (\"+-\").\n\nWait, that seems redundant. Perhaps it's better to denote the chromosomes separately.\n\nLet's say:\n\nMother: Chromosome 16a: ++\n\nChromosome 16b: +-\n\nFather: Chromosome 16c: +-\n\nChromosome 16d: +-\n\nSo, the mother can pass on either 16a (++) or 16b (+-) to the child.\n\nThe father can pass on either 16c (+-) or 16d (+-).\n\nTherefore, the possible combinations for the child are:\n\n1. 16a from mother and 16c from father: ++ and +- \u2192 total genes: three functional (+++, but actually, it's ++ on one chromosome and +- on the other, so total functional genes are three)\n\n2. 16a from mother and 16d from father: ++ and +- \u2192 same as above\n\n3. 16b from mother and 16c from father: +- and +- \u2192 total genes: two functional (+- +-)\n\n4. 16b from mother and 16d from father: +- and +- \u2192 same as above\n\nSo, possibilities:\n\n- Option 1 and 2: three functional genes (one deletion)\n\n- Option 3 and 4: two functional genes (two deletions)\n\nSince each combination is equally likely, each has a 25% chance.\n\nTherefore, the offspring have a 50% chance of having three functional genes (one deletion) and 50% chance of having two functional genes (two deletions).\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the percentage of offspring with two-gene deletion.\n\nAccording to this, it's 50%.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider it in terms of alleles.\n\nEach parent has two alleles, each allele can have 0, 1, or 2 deletions.\n\nBut in this case, the mother has one deletion, so her alleles are: one with one deletion (-), one with no deletion (+).\n\nThe father has two deletions in trans, so his alleles are: one with one deletion (-), and another with one deletion (-).\n\nWait, but in diploid organisms, each parent has two chromosomes, each with their own set of genes.\n\nSo, when gametes are formed, they receive one chromosome from each parent.\n\nTherefore, the possible gametes from the mother are:\n\n- Egg with chromosome 16a: ++\n\n- Egg with chromosome 16b: +-\n\nFrom the father:\n\n- Sperm with chromosome 16c: +-\n\n- Sperm with chromosome 16d: +-\n\nTherefore, the possible combinations:\n\n1. Egg ++ + Sperm +-: total genes ++ and +- \u2192 three functional genes\n\n2. Egg +- + Sperm +-: total genes +- and +- \u2192 two functional genes\n\nEach combination has a 50% chance.\n\nTherefore, 50% of the offspring will have two-gene deletions.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 50%.\n\nBut the question is a bit tricky because it specifies \"two-gene deletion,\" and I need to make sure that's interpreted correctly.\n\nIn \u03b1-thalassemia, having two-gene deletions can lead to different clinical presentations depending on whether the deletions are in cis or trans.\n\nHowever, in this case, since the man has two deletions in trans, and the woman has one deletion, the offspring will inherit one chromosome from each parent.\n\nSo, if the offspring inherits the chromosome with one deletion from the mother and one with one deletion from the father, they will have two deletions in trans.\n\nIf they inherit the chromosome with no deletion from the mother and one with one deletion from the father, they will have one deletion.\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, 50% will have two deletions and 50% will have one deletion.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 50%.\n\nHowever, the options include 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%.\n\nSince 50% matches option C, that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider the specific gene inheritance.\n\nEach parent has two chromosomes, each with two alpha-globin genes.\n\nThe woman has one deletion, so one chromosome has two functional genes, and the other has one functional and one deleted gene.\n\nThe man has two deletions in trans, meaning each of his chromosomes has one functional and one deleted gene.\n\nTherefore, the possible combinations for the offspring are:\n\n- Inheriting the chromosome with two functional genes from the mother and the chromosome with one functional and one deleted gene from the father: total functional genes = three\n\n- Inheriting the chromosome with one functional and one deleted gene from the mother and the chromosome with one functional and one deleted gene from the father: total functional genes = two\n\nTherefore, 50% chance of having three functional genes (one deletion) and 50% chance of having two functional genes (two deletions).\n\nThus, the percentage of offspring with two-gene deletion is 50%.\n\n**Final Answer: C**"
