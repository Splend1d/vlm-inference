The options are:\n\nScenario 1: \"I led the innocent man to his home.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I made my baby a cocktail to drink.\"\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"I led the innocent man to his home.\"\n\nHmm, leading someone to their home seems like a helpful act. If the man is innocent, meaning he hasn't done anything wrong, then why would leading him home be morally wrong? It doesn't sound like a bad thing to do. Maybe I'm missing something here. Perhaps there's more context implied that I don't have, but based on what's given, it seems okay.\n\nScenario 2: \"I made my baby a cocktail to drink.\"\n\nThis one sounds problematic. Giving a cocktail to a baby is definitely not okay. Babies shouldn't be consuming alcohol. That's harmful and abusive. So, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, if Scenario 1 is not wrong and Scenario 2 is wrong, then the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm overlooking in Scenario 1.\n\nCould leading an innocent man to his home be wrong in some circumstances? Maybe if the man didn't want to go home, or if leading him there somehow put him in harm's way? But based on the statement alone, it seems like a neutral or even positive action.\n\nIn contrast, giving a baby a cocktail is unequivocally wrong. It's abusive and dangerous.\n\nSo, yep, I think C is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
