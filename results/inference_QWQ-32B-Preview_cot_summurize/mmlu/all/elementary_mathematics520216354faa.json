The problem says that point B is 5 less than point A. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"5 less than point A\" means. If point A is at -20, and B is 5 less than A, that means B is further to the left on the number line, because we're dealing with negative numbers here. So, subtracting 5 from -20 should give me the position of B.\n\nLet me do the math: -20 minus 5. That's -20 - 5 = -25. So, point B is at -25.\n\nNow, I need to determine whether B is to the right or left of A on the number line. On a number line, numbers increase as you move to the right and decrease as you move to the left. Since B is at -25 and A is at -20, and -25 is less than -20, B must be to the left of A.\n\nLet me double-check that. If I imagine the number line, negative numbers are to the left of zero. So, -20 is to the left of zero, and -25 is even further to the left. Therefore, B is indeed to the left of A.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. It is located at -25 and is to the right of point A on the number line.\n\nB. It is located at -15 and is to the right of point A on the number line.\n\nC. It is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the number line.\n\nD. It is located at -15 and is to the left of point A on the number line.\n\nSo, based on my calculations, option C seems to be correct because B is at -25 and to the left of A.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If A is at -20 and B is 5 less than A, then B should be -25. And since -25 is less than -20, B is to the left of A. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret \"5 less than point A.\" Maybe someone could\u8bef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662fA\u51cf\u53bb5\uff0c\u6216\u80055\u51cf\u53bbA\u3002\u4f46\u6839\u636e\u6570\u5b66\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\"5 less than A\"\u5e94\u8be5 \u662fA - 5\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f-20 -5 = -25\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8fd8\u662fC\u9009\u9879\u6b63\u786e\u3002\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The correct statement about point B is that it is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the number line.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
