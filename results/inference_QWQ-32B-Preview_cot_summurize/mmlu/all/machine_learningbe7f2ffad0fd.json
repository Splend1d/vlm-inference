                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two Boolean random variables, A and B. We're given:\n\n- P(A) = 1/2\n\n- P(B) = 1/3\n\n- P(A | \u00acB) = 1/4\n\nAnd we need to find P(A | B). Okay, so first things first, I need to recall some basic probability rules, especially about conditional probability.\n\nI know that conditional probability is defined as:\n\nP(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nP(A | \u00acB) = P(A and \u00acB) / P(\u00acB)\n\nWe're given P(A | \u00acB), and we know P(B), so maybe I can find P(A and B) using these.\n\nFirst, let's find P(\u00acB). Since P(B) = 1/3, P(\u00acB) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\n\nNow, using the given P(A | \u00acB) = 1/4, I can find P(A and \u00acB):\n\nP(A | \u00acB) = P(A and \u00acB) / P(\u00acB)\n\nSo,\n\nP(A and \u00acB) = P(A | \u00acB) * P(\u00acB) = (1/4) * (2/3) = 1/6\n\nAlright, so P(A and \u00acB) = 1/6.\n\nNow, I also know that the total probability of A is the sum of P(A and B) and P(A and \u00acB):\n\nP(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and \u00acB)\n\nWe know P(A) = 1/2 and P(A and \u00acB) = 1/6, so:\n\n1/2 = P(A and B) + 1/6\n\nTherefore,\n\nP(A and B) = 1/2 - 1/6 = 3/6 - 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3\n\nSo, P(A and B) = 1/3.\n\nNow, finally, we can find P(A | B):\n\nP(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = (1/3) / (1/3) = 1\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Is there a mistake here?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, P(\u00acB) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. That seems correct.\n\nThen, P(A | \u00acB) = P(A and \u00acB) / P(\u00acB) => P(A and \u00acB) = P(A | \u00acB) * P(\u00acB) = (1/4)*(2/3) = 1/6. That seems right.\n\nNext, P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and \u00acB) => 1/2 = P(A and B) + 1/6 => P(A and B) = 1/2 - 1/6 = 1/3. That appears to be correct.\n\nFinally, P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = (1/3)/(1/3) = 1. Hmm.\n\nBut let's think about this intuitively. If P(A | B) is 1, that means that whenever B occurs, A is certain to occur. Is that consistent with the given probabilities?\n\nWe have P(A) = 1/2 and P(B) = 1/3. If P(A | B) = 1, then P(A and B) = P(B) = 1/3, which matches our earlier calculation. Also, P(A and \u00acB) = 1/6, and indeed, P(A) = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2, which checks out.\n\nSo, it seems that the answer is indeed 1. But let's see why this makes sense.\n\nMaybe there's a dependency between A and B such that B being true guarantees A is true. That would explain why P(A | B) = 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup or in my reasoning. Let me check the options provided:\n\nA. 1/6\n\nB. 1/4\n\nC. 3/4\n\nD. 1\n\nOption D is 1, which matches my calculation. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the given probabilities.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the law of total probability or Bayes' theorem, but I don't think that's necessary here since we've directly used the definition of conditional probability and it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to test if I remember that P(A | B) cannot exceed P(A)/P(B), but in this case, P(A)/P(B) = (1/2)/(1/3) = 3/2, and our calculated P(A | B) = 1, which is less than 3/2, so that's fine.\n\nWait a second, is there a possibility that P(A | B) could be less than P(A)/P(B)? Not necessarily, because P(A | B) can range from 0 to 1, depending on the dependency between A and B.\n\nGiven that, and considering our calculations, I think the answer is indeed 1.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
