                    "text": "I'm going to take a shot at this question about the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. So, the question is: \"The FED's Board of Governors has members each serving -year terms.\" And then there are options: A. 14 7, B. 7 14, C. 8 8, D. 50 2.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how many members are on the Board of Governors and how long their terms are. I think the Board of Governors has seven members, but I'm not entirely sure. As for the term length, I believe it's 14 years, but again, I'm not entirely confident.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. The Federal Reserve is the central banking system of the United States, and the Board of Governors is its main governing body. I remember that the members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nI think the number of members is set by law, and the terms are also specified. Maybe I should try to eliminate some options based on what I know.\n\nOption A says 14 members with 7-year terms. That seems too many members. I thought there were fewer than 14. Option B says 7 members with 14-year terms, which aligns with what I think I remember. Option C says 8 members with 8-year terms, and Option D says 50 members with 2-year terms, which sounds way off.\n\nWait a minute, 50 members sounds like the number of states, but I don't think the Board of Governors has 50 members. That must be incorrect.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and C, I need to decide. I recall that the terms are quite long to provide independence from political pressures. A 14-year term seems plausible, but I'm not sure about the number of members.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the Federal Reserve. There's the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., and then there are the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The Board of Governors is smaller, and I think seven is the correct number.\n\nAlso, I believe that terms are non-renewable to ensure that no member serves indefinitely. So, if it's seven members with 14-year terms, that would make sense.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about other boards or commissions and see if their structures might be similar.\n\nFor example, the Supreme Court has nine justices with life terms, but that's different because it's not the same as the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is part of the government but operates independently.\n\nAnother example is the Federal Communications Commission, which has five members, each serving five-year terms. But that's different from the Fed.\n\nAlternatively, the Securities and Exchange Commission has five members, each serving five-year terms as well. Again, not similar to the Fed.\n\nSo, going back to the Fed, I think seven members with 14-year terms is correct. That's why option B seems right.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider option C: eight members with eight-year terms. That could also work, but I don't recall the Board having eight members.\n\nOption A: 14 members with seven-year terms seems too large, and option D is clearly incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B: 7 members with 14-year terms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
