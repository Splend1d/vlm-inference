                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out what the Federal Reserve does when it wants to implement an expansionary policy. I remember that expansionary policy is when the Fed tries to stimulate the economy, maybe by making money cheaper or more available. So, I need to think about which of these options would achieve that.\n\nOption A is \"Buying Treasury bonds in the open market.\" Hmm, what does that mean? When the Fed buys Treasury bonds, it basically injects money into the economy because it's paying people for those bonds. So, that should increase the money supply, right? That sounds like it would be expansionary.\n\nOption B is \"Raising the federal funds rate.\" I think the federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans. If the Fed raises this rate, borrowing money becomes more expensive. That should discourage borrowing and slow down the economy. So, that seems like a contractionary policy, not expansionary.\n\nOption C is \"Raising the discount rate.\" The discount rate is the interest rate that the Fed charges banks for loans. If the Fed raises this rate, it makes borrowing from the Fed more expensive for banks. That might encourage banks to borrow less from the Fed and maybe tighten their own lending standards. So, that also seems like it would slow down the economy, making it contractionary.\n\nOption D is \"Raising the required reserve ratio.\" The required reserve ratio is the amount of money that banks are required to hold in reserve and not lend out. If the Fed raises this ratio, banks have less money available to lend, which should decrease the money supply and make loans harder to get. Again, that sounds contractionary.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, only option A seems to be expansionary because it increases the money supply by buying Treasury bonds. The other options all seem to be ways to tighten money supply or make borrowing more expensive, which are contractionary measures.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check myself. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Let me think about option A again. When the Fed buys Treasury bonds, it pays for them by creating money, which it then gives to the sellers of those bonds. So, that increases the amount of money in circulation, which should make money easier to get and encourage spending and investing. That definitely sounds expansionary.\n\nOption B, raising the federal funds rate, is probably intended to cool down the economy by making borrowing more expensive. That's the opposite of what we want for an expansionary policy.\n\nOption C, raising the discount rate, similarly makes it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Fed, which might encourage them to be more cautious with their lending. Again, that's contractionary.\n\nOption D, raising the required reserve ratio, directly reduces the amount of money banks can lend out, which tightens the money supply and makes credit harder to obtain. Definitely contractionary.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is A, buying Treasury bonds in the open market. That's the action that would implement an expansionary policy by increasing the money supply and stimulating the economy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
