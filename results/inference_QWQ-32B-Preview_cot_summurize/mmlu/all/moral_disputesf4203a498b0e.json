It says, \"The view according to which wars are always (or at least nearly always) morally wrong is known as...\" and then it gives four options: A. just war theory, B. antiwar pacifism, C. moral nihilism, D. jus ad bellum.\n\nOkay, so I need to identify which of these options best describes the view that wars are almost always morally wrong. Let's look at each one separately.\n\nFirst, A. just war theory. I think just war theory is about when it's justified to go to war and how war should be conducted. It sets out criteria for a war to be considered just, both in terms of the reasons for going to war and the ways in which it's fought. So, it doesn't seem to align with the idea that wars are always or nearly always wrong because it acknowledges that some wars can be morally justified.\n\nNext, B. antiwar pacifism. Pacifism is the belief that war and violence are unjustifiable, and pacifists often advocate for non-violent resolution of conflicts. Antiwar pacifism specifically seems to be against war, so this could be a candidate for the view that wars are always or nearly always morally wrong.\n\nOption C. moral nihilism. I'm not entirely sure what moral nihilism is, but I think it's the belief that moral values don't exist or that they are without objective foundation. So, it's more about the absence of moral values rather than a specific view on the morality of war.\n\nThen, D. jus ad bellum. I believe jus ad bellum is part of just war theory that deals with the justification for going to war. It outlines the conditions under which initiating a war is considered morally permissible. So, again, this seems to contradict the idea that wars are always or nearly always wrong because it provides a framework for when wars can be justified.\n\nComparing these options, antiwar pacifism seems to be the one that aligns with the view that wars are always or nearly always morally wrong. Just war theory and jus ad bellum are more about determining when wars can be justified, which is the opposite of the position described in the question.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. antiwar pacifism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
