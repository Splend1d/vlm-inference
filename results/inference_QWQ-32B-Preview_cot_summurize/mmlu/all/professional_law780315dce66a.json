                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex with a lot of transactions and players involved, so I need to make sure I understand the sequence of events and the legal principles at play.\n\nFirst, there's an orange grove and a vineyard, adjoining tracts of land. In 2006, a farmer buys the orange grove, which is a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The vineyard, a 20-acre tract to the north, is owned by a rancher, also in fee simple absolute.\n\nNow, a remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the orange grove, and this was done in such a way that an easement appurtenant to the vineyard was created. This easement was executed by deed and properly recorded, but the shepherd never actually used it.\n\nIn 2010, the rancher conveys the vineyard to the farmer. Then, in 2011, the farmer conveys the vineyard by deed to an investor for $200,000, and there's no mention of the easement in either the rancher-farmer deed or the farmer-investor deed.\n\nNow, the investor claims she has a right-of-way across the orange grove, but the farmer says no such easement exists. The orange grove abuts a public highway, and the only access to that highway for the vineyard is across the orange grove.\n\nThe question is, if the investor initiates a lawsuit to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the orange grove, should she prevail?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Prevail, because an easement by implication arose from the farmer's conveyance to the investor.\n\nB. Prevail, because once an easement is properly recorded, it remains in effect ad finem until expressly released.\n\nC. Not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the deed of conveyance from the farmer to the investor failed to contain any mention of the right-of-way.\n\nOkay, first, let's understand the concept of easements and how they transfer.\n\nAn easement appurtenant runs with the land, meaning it benefits the dominant estate (the vineyard) and burdens the servient estate (the orange grove). It's not personal to the owner but attaches to the land itself.\n\nNow, when the rancher conveyed the vineyard to the farmer in 2010, the easement should have passed to the farmer because it's appurtenant to the land. Similarly, when the farmer conveyed the vineyard to the investor in 2011, the easement should pass to the investor unless it was expressly excluded.\n\nBut in this case, neither deed mentioned the easement. So, does that affect the investor's rights?\n\nLet's consider option B first: \"Prevail, because once an easement is properly recorded, it remains in effect ad finem until expressly released.\"\n\nThis seems plausible. The easement was properly recorded, so it should continue to exist unless someone extinguishes it. However, we need to see if there are any circumstances that might have extinguished it.\n\nOption C suggests that the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.\n\nMerger is a doctrine that extinguishes an easement when the same person owns both the dominant and servient estates. So, if the farmer owned both the vineyard and the orange grove, the easement would be extinguished because it's no longer needed.\n\nBut wait, in 2010, the rancher conveyed the vineyard to the farmer, who already owned the orange grove. So, at that point, the farmer owned both tracts. Therefore, the easement between the vineyard and the orange grove would have merged into a single ownership, extinguishing the easement.\n\nHowever, in 2011, the farmer conveyed the vineyard to the investor. Now, the investor owns the vineyard, and the farmer still owns the orange grove.\n\nDoes the easement spring back into existence at this point?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, when the dominant and servient estates are separated again after merger, the easement can be revived if certain conditions are met.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I need to look into the doctrine of merger in more detail.\n\nOption A suggests that an easement by implication arose from the farmer's conveyance to the investor.\n\nEasement by implication is different from an express easement like the one created by deed here. Easement by implication usually arises when there's a necessity for the use of a path or way, especially for access to a landlocked property.\n\nIn this case, the vineyard only has access to the public highway via the orange grove. So, perhaps an easement by implication could be argued based on necessity.\n\nHowever, since there's already an express easement in place, maybe that supersedes any implied easement.\n\nOption D says the investor should not prevail because the deed didn't mention the right-of-way.\n\nBut as I recall, easements appurtenant run with the land and are not dependent on being mentioned in the deed. The deed of conveyance doesn't need to refer to the easement for it to pass to the grantee.\n\nSo, perhaps option D isn't correct.\n\nLet me try to outline the sequence again:\n\n1. Original easement created by deed and recorded, benefiting the vineyard and burdening the orange grove.\n\n2. Rancher owns vineyard, farmer owns orange grove.\n\n3. Rancher conveys vineyard to farmer in 2010. Farmer now owns both tracts.\n\n4. Farmer conveys vineyard to investor in 2011, without mentioning the easement in the deed.\n\nNow, since the farmer owned both the dominant and servient estates after acquiring the vineyard in 2010, the easement merged and was extinguished.\n\nThen, when the farmer conveyed the vineyard to the investor in 2011, did the easement revive?\n\nI need to check the rules on merger and severance.\n\nUpon further research, I find that when there's a merger of the dominant and servient estates, the easement is extinguished. If the properties are later separated, the easement does not automatically revive unless there was an intention to preserve the easement at the time of the merger.\n\nIn this case, when the farmer acquired both properties in 2010, the easement merged and was extinguished.\n\nThen, when the farmer conveyed the vineyard to the investor in 2011, the easement was already extinguished, so there's nothing to pass on to the investor.\n\nTherefore, the investor does not have the right-of-way across the orange grove.\n\nBut wait, there's a twist. The investor might argue that since the orange grove is the only access to the public highway, there should be an easement by necessity.\n\nHowever, easement by necessity requires that at the time of conveyance, there was no access to a public road except through the servient estate.\n\nIn this case, when the rancher conveyed the vineyard to the farmer in 2010, the farmer owned both properties, so there was no necessity because he could access his own orange grove.\n\nThen, when the farmer conveyed the vineyard to the investor in 2011, the investor might argue that there's a necessity for access.\n\nBut, since the original easement was extinguished by merger, and the deed from farmer to investor didn't mention the easement, the investor may not have the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the investor could argue that the easement should have been revived upon the severance of the estates.\n\nBut generally, easements extinguished by merger stay extinguished unless there's an intention to revive them.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the investor does not have the right-of-way across the orange grove.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option C: not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.\n\nOption B is incorrect because even though the easement was recorded, it was extinguished by merger.\n\nOption D might seem plausible, but since easements appurtenant run with the land, they don't need to be mentioned in the deed to pass on to the grantee, assuming they weren't extinguished beforehand.\n\nOption A is less likely because an easement by implication is a different type of easement, and in this case, there's an existing express easement that was extinguished.\n\nSo, I think option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
