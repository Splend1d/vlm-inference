                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between a restaurant owner and a produce distributor for 50 pounds of heirloom tomatoes. The contract is in writing, but there's also an oral agreement that the chef must approve the quality of the tomatoes before the owner pays up.\n\nSo, the owner says orally, \"We do have an understanding that our chef must approve the quality of the heirloom tomatoes before I will pay you.\" And the distributor acknowledges this with, \"If you say so.\"\n\nLater, the distributor delivers the tomatoes, the chef refuses to approve them due to quality issues, and the owner refuses to pay. The distributor sues for breach of contract.\n\nNow, the question is about the admissibility of evidence that the chef refused to approve the tomatoes. The owner wants to prove this over the distributor's objection.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The evidence is admissible to show frustration of purpose.\n\nHmm, frustration of purpose is a doctrine that excuses performance when an unforeseen event undermines the fundamental purpose of the contract. But in this case, it's not about an external event; it's about a condition agreed upon by the parties. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nB. The evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent.\n\nThis seems promising. A condition precedent is a condition that must be met before a party's performance is due. Here, the oral agreement seems to impose a condition that the chef's approval is needed before the owner has to pay. So, if the chef doesn't approve, the owner doesn't have to pay. Therefore, this evidence would be relevant to show that the written contract is subject to this oral condition.\n\nC. The evidence is barred because the written contract appears to be a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement.\n\nThis is referring to the parol evidence rule, which generally prevents parties from introducing evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict a written contract that is intended to be a final and complete expression of their agreement.\n\nIn this case, the written contract is for 50 pounds of tomatoes, and the oral agreement is about the chef's approval. If the written contract is a complete integration, then the oral agreement might not be admissible unless it can be shown that the oral agreement is an additional term not contradicted by the written contract.\n\nD. The evidence is barred because the oral agreement is within the statute of frauds.\n\nThe statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, such as contracts that cannot be performed within one year or agreements for the sale of land. Here, the main contract is in writing, but the oral agreement is a condition attached to that contract.\n\nConsidering all this, let's think about it.\n\nOption B seems attractive because it directly relates to the condition precedent. However, we need to consider whether the parol evidence rule in option C would bar this evidence.\n\nIn contract law, if a written contract is intended to be a complete and final expression of the agreement (a complete integration), then generally, parol evidence (oral agreements) cannot be introduced to contradict or add to the written terms.\n\nBut in this case, the oral agreement about the chef's approval isn't necessarily contradicting the written contract; it's adding a condition to the payment obligation. So, it might be considered a separate agreement or an additional term.\n\nMoreover, sometimes courts allow evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements if they relate to conditions precedent that are not inconsistent with the written contract.\n\nGiven that, option B might be the correct answer because the evidence is admissible to show that there was an oral condition precedent to the written agreement.\n\nOption C might not apply if the oral agreement is not contradicting the written contract but is simply adding a condition.\n\nOption D is about the statute of frauds, which typically requires certain contracts to be in writing. Here, the main contract is in writing, and the oral agreement is a condition attached to it. So, it's not clear that the oral agreement itself falls within the statute of frauds.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: The evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider frustration of purpose again. Frustration of purpose is when an unforeseen event destroys the fundamental purpose of the contract, and it's not really applicable here because the issue is with a condition agreed upon by the parties, not an external event.\n\nSo, I'll stick with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
