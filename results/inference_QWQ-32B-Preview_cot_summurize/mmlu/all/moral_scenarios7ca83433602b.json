There doesn't seem to be any morally wrong action here. Respecting someone's decision not to share their personal information is generally considered appropriate. Going home after being denied something is a neutral action; it doesn't involve harming anyone or violating any moral norms.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I was feeling so good today so I had sex with my wife.\"\n\nThis scenario involves having consensual sex with one's spouse. In the context of a married couple, consensual sexual activity is not considered morally wrong. In fact, it's a normal and expected part of a healthy marriage. As long as both parties consent and there are no other complicating factors, this action aligns with ordinary moral standards.\n\nGiven this analysis, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
