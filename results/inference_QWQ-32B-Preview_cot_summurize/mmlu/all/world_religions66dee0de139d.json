Anthony is often considered the father of Christian monasticism and is known for his life as an anchorite hermit in the Egyptian desert. His biography, \"Life of Antony,\" written by Athanasius, popularized the ascetic lifestyle and inspired many to follow in his footsteps.\n\nPachomius is also an important figure in monasticism as he founded the first Christian monastic community, but he is more associated with cenobitic monasticism, where monks live together in a community, rather than anchoritic hermitism, which involves living in solitude.\n\nAthanasius is a significant church father known for his role in the development of Christian doctrine, particularly in the debates over Arianism, but he is not primarily known as an anchorite hermit.\n\nBasil is another important figure in monasticism, known for his monastic rules and influence on Eastern monasticism, but again, he is more associated with communal monastic life rather than solitary hermitism.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, Anthony seems to be the most fitting answer as the first significant anchorite hermit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
