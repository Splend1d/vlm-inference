                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's about Abdul, who lost sight in his right eye due to an accident, and now when he's driving, he needs to judge the distance of vehicles. The question is asking which cues he can rely on for that, and there are options I, II, III, but I don't see what those cues are. Maybe I need to recall some concepts about depth perception or something related to driving.\n\nSo, first things first, depth perception is crucial for driving because it helps us judge how far away other vehicles are. Normally, people have binocular vision, meaning both eyes work together to perceive depth. But since Abdul lost sight in his right eye, he only has monocular vision now. That means he's relying on one eye to see, which affects his depth perception.\n\nI remember that with monocular vision, there are still several cues that can help judge distance, even without stereoscopic vision. These cues include things like:\n\n1. **Relative size**: Knowing the usual size of an object and perceiving how big it appears can give clues about its distance.\n\n2. **Overlapping objects**: If one object blocks another, it's closer.\n\n3. **Aerial perspective**: Distant objects often look blurrier and less colorful due to atmospheric conditions.\n\n4. **Motion parallax**: When you're moving, objects closer to you appear to move faster across your field of view than those that are farther away.\n\n5. **Height in the visual field**: Objects that are higher in your field of view might be perceived as farther away, assuming you're on flat ground.\n\n6. **Shading and texture gradient**: Finer textures and less shading can indicate distance.\n\nSo, these are some monocular cues for depth perception. Maybe the options I, II, III refer to some of these cues. Since the question is about which cues Abdul can rely on while driving, I need to think about which of these cues are particularly useful in a driving context.\n\nIn driving, relative size might be important for judging the distance of other vehicles, especially if you know the standard sizes of cars, trucks, etc. Overlapping objects could be relevant if one vehicle is passing another or if there are multiple vehicles in your line of sight. Motion parallax would definitely be useful since you're in motion, and objects at different distances will appear to move at different speeds relative to you.\n\nAerial perspective might be less reliable in driving, especially in urban areas or on overcast days where atmospheric conditions might not be as noticeable. Height in the visual field could be misleading in driving, depending on the terrain and the heights of different vehicles.\n\nShading and texture gradient might be somewhat useful, but perhaps not as primary cues for distance judgment while driving.\n\nGiven that, I'm going to guess that options I and II might correspond to relative size and motion parallax, which are both important cues for distance judgment while driving with monocular vision. Option III might be something like aerial perspective, which is less reliable in this context.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be D. I and II only.\n\nBut honestly, without knowing exactly what I, II, and III represent, it's a bit of a guess. Maybe I should try to map the cues to the options.\n\nLet's assume:\n\nI. Relative size\n\nII. Motion parallax\n\nIII. Aerial perspective\n\nThen, relying on I and II would make sense for Abdul while driving.\n\nAlternatively, the options might be different. Maybe I is overlapping objects, II is motion parallax, and III is relative size. In that case, I and II would still be important cues.\n\nRegardless, it seems that combining multiple monocular cues is essential for someone with monocular vision to judge distances effectively.\n\nIt's also worth noting that driving with monocular vision can be challenging, and some jurisdictions may have restrictions on driving with less than perfect vision. Abdul might need to take extra precautions to ensure safety on the road.\n\nIn summary, I think the answer is D. I and II only, assuming those correspond to key monocular depth perception cues like relative size and motion parallax.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
