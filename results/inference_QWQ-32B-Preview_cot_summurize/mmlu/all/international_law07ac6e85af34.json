                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the contiguous zone is all about. There are a few options here, and I need to pick the one that best describes its function. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says that the contiguous zone functions as a security zone of the coastal state. Hmm, that sounds plausible. I know that coastal states have certain rights over the waters near their shores, and security is probably one of them. But I'm not sure if that's the primary function.\n\nOption B mentions that it's a zone where the coastal state may explore and exploit its mineral resources. Wait a minute, isn't that more related to the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or the continental shelf? I think the contiguous zone is different from those areas. So maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption C states that the contiguous zone is a zone in which the coastal state is permitted to prevent and punish infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws. This rings a bell. I recall that the contiguous zone is where a coastal state can enforce certain laws related to its territory and territorial sea. So this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption D says that the contiguous zone is a zone in which the coastal state safeguards its archaeological and historical objects. Again, I think that might be related to other maritime zones or perhaps specific regulations, but it doesn't sound like the main function of the contiguous zone.\n\nLet me double-check what I know about the contiguous zone. According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the contiguous zone is a zone beyond the territorial sea where a coastal state has limited rights to enforce certain laws. Specifically, these laws pertain to customs, fiscal, immigration, and sanitary regulations.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, option C aligns with this description. It allows the coastal state to prevent and punish infringements of these specific types of laws. That makes sense.\n\nOption A, about a security zone, might be a bit too broad. While security is important, the contiguous zone has more specific purposes as outlined in UNCLOS.\n\nOption B is likely referring to the exclusive economic zone, where states have rights to explore and exploit natural resources, including minerals.\n\nOption D might be related to protection of the marine environment or cultural heritage, but again, that's not the primary function of the contiguous zone.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option C: The contiguous zone is a zone in which the coastal state is permitted to prevent and punish infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
