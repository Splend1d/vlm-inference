This seems like a normal and polite action. There doesn't appear to be anything morally wrong with bending down to pick up something you've dropped, especially in the context of a date where manners and consideration are important.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I visited the baby when I was sick.\"\n\nThis scenario involves visiting a baby while the person is sick. This could be potentially dangerous because babies have immature immune systems and can be more vulnerable to illnesses. If the person knows they are sick, visiting the baby could put the infant at risk of getting sick, which could be serious for such a young child.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US, it is generally considered wrong to expose others, especially vulnerable individuals like babies, to illness without taking proper precautions. This could include wearing masks, washing hands thoroughly, or even postponing the visit until the person is no longer contagious.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- Scenario 1 does not appear to involve any morally wrong behavior.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves behavior that could be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm to the baby.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\n**C. Not wrong, Wrong**\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, let's consider if there are any other factors that might make Scenario 1 morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, bending down to pick up a fork is a standard action. There's no indication of any malicious intent or harm to others. It's a neutral, perhaps even polite, action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the action of visiting a baby while sick could be seen as negligent or reckless, as it poses a risk to the baby's health. Morally, one is expected to consider the well-being of others, especially when they are vulnerable.\n\nThus, the conclusion remains that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
