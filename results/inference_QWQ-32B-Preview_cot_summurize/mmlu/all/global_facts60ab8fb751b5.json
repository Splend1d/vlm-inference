                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the percentage of Indians in 2019 who believe that believing in God is necessary for morality and good values. The options are 59%, 69%, 79%, and 89%. I don't remember the exact statistic, but I think it was pretty high. Maybe around 79% or 89%. I recall that in many surveys, a large portion of Indians are religious, so probably a high percentage would agree that believing in God is important for morality.\n\nWait, but I also remember that there might be different views on this, and maybe not everyone thinks that way. Maybe it's lower than 89%. Let me think about other factors that could influence this. India is a diverse country with many religions and also a significant number of people who are secular or non-religious. So perhaps the percentage is lower.\n\nOn the other hand, religion plays a significant role in Indian culture and society, so it's possible that a majority still holds that belief. Let me try to recall if there were any specific studies or surveys that reported this data.\n\nI think Pew Research Center often conducts surveys on religion and public opinion around the world. Maybe they have data on India from 2019. According to their surveys, in many countries, there is a strong correlation between religion and morality.\n\nLet me see, in 2019, Pew Research Center did publish a report on religion and public life. I think in that report, they mentioned that in India, a large majority of people affiliate with some religion, and many consider religion to be important in their lives.\n\nBut I need to find the specific percentage for the belief that one must believe in God to be moral and have good values. I think it was around 79%, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was 69%. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in some surveys, the percentage might be lower than I think. Maybe it's 59% or 69%. But I have a feeling it's higher.\n\nLet me consider the demographic factors. India has a young population, and younger people might be more secular in their views. However, traditional values are still strong in many parts of the country.\n\nAlso, India has a strong influence of Hinduism, which is the majority religion, and Hinduism has diverse beliefs about God and morality. So, it's possible that the percentage varies depending on the religious affiliation.\n\nBut the question is about all Indians, regardless of their religion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the global average and see how India compares. I think globally, the percentage of people who think belief in God is necessary for morality varies by country, with more religious countries having higher percentages.\n\nIn some Western countries, the percentage might be lower, but in countries like India, it might be higher.\n\nGiven that, I would guess that in India, around 79% or 89% of people hold that belief.\n\nBut to be precise, I need to recall the exact statistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the percentage is lower, like 69% or 59%, considering the increasing secularization in urban areas.\n\nBut overall, I think the majority still holds that belief.\n\nSo, among the options given, 79% seems plausible.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with C. 79%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
