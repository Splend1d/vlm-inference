These records are 12 inches in diameter and are designed to be played at a speed of 33 1/3 revolutions per minute (rpm). This slower speed allows for a longer playing time compared to earlier formats, making it possible to fit entire albums on a single record.\n\nOption A, 12 1/2 rpm, is not a standard speed for vinyl records. Option C, 45 rpm, is typically used for smaller, 7-inch singles, although there are some 12-inch singles pressed at this speed, especially in the realm of dance and electronic music. Option D, 100 rpm, is not a standard speed for any common vinyl record format.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 33 1/3 rpm."
