Plate tectonics is the process where the Earth's lithosphere is divided into several plates that move relative to each other, driven by convection currents in the mantle. This movement is responsible for phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountains.\n\nWhile Mars and Venus have geological features that suggest they may have had some form of tectonic activity in the past, they do not exhibit active plate tectonics like Earth does today. For example, Mars has a now-inactive volcanic history and some evidence of past tectonic activity, but its crust is generally considered to be stagnant. Venus also shows signs of past geological activity, including volcanic features, but it lacks the dynamic plate tectonics observed on Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Earth."
