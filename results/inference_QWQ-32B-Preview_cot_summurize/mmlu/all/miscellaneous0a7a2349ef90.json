                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which company makes perfumes called 'Beautiful' and 'Pleasures.' The options are Estee Lauder, Ralph Lauren, Elizabeth Arden, and Calvin Klein.\n\nFirst, I know that Estee Lauder is a well-known cosmetics and fragrance company. I think they have a lot of perfume lines, but I'm not sure about 'Beautiful' and 'Pleasures' specifically.\n\nRalph Lauren is also famous for its fragrances, especially the Polo line, but I don't recall them having a perfume called 'Beautiful' or 'Pleasures.'\n\nElizabeth Arden is another big name in cosmetics and fragrances. They have classics like 'Red Door,' but I'm not sure about these particular perfumes.\n\nCalvin Klein is known for their simple yet iconic perfume brands like 'Eternity,' 'Escape,' and 'Obsession,' but again, I don't think 'Beautiful' and 'Pleasures' are from them.\n\nWait a minute, I think 'Beautiful' is actually a perfume by Estee Lauder. I remember seeing it in department stores and ads. It's a pretty popular fragrance.\n\nAs for 'Pleasures,' I'm not as sure. Maybe it's also by Estee Lauder? Or perhaps it's by another company.\n\nLet me think about this. I know that Estee Lauder has a wide range of perfumes, including 'Beautiful,' 'White Linen,' 'Modern Muse,' and others. 'Pleasures' sounds familiar, but I might be confusing it with another perfume name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'Pleasures' is by Elizabeth Arden. I recall that they have a perfume called 'Pleasures,' which is a floral scent. Yes, that rings a bell.\n\nSo, if 'Beautiful' is by Estee Lauder and 'Pleasures' is by Elizabeth Arden, then the answer would be two different companies. But the question seems to suggest that both perfumes are made by the same company.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misremembering. Perhaps both 'Beautiful' and 'Pleasures' are by Estee Lauder. Or maybe both are by Elizabeth Arden.\n\nLet me try to recall more accurately. Estee Lauder does have 'Beautiful,' and I think they also have a perfume called 'Pleasures.' Yes, I believe 'Pleasures' is part of the Estee Lauder fragrance collection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'Pleasures' is by Ralph Lauren. I've seen Ralph Lauren have a variety of perfume lines, but I'm not positive about this one.\n\nTo make sure, maybe I should consider the launch years or something. 'Beautiful' by Estee Lauder was launched in 1985, if I'm not mistaken. 'Pleasures' might be from around the same era or later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'Pleasures' is by Calvin Klein. But I don't think so; Calvin Klein's fragrances tend to have more minimal names.\n\nWait, maybe 'Pleasures' is not a perfume at all, or maybe it's a less known brand. But the question presents it as a known perfume alongside 'Beautiful.'\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I think both 'Beautiful' and 'Pleasures' are made by Estee Lauder.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Estee Lauder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
