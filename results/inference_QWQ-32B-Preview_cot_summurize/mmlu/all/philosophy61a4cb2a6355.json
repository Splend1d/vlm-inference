In his Nicomachean Ethics, he argues that moral virtues are neither purely natural nor purely conventional; instead, they are cultivated through repeated actions and choices. He compares the development of virtues to the development of skills, suggesting that just as one becomes better at playing the lyre through practice, one becomes virtuous by regularly performing virtuous acts.\n\nOption B, acquired through philosophical reflection, is partially correct because Aristotle did emphasize the role of reason in achieving virtue. However, he also stressed that mere intellectual understanding is not sufficient; one must also act in accordance with that understanding. Therefore, while reflection is important, it is the combination of reflection and consistent action that leads to the development of virtue.\n\nOption C, a gift from the gods, is more aligned with some ancient Greek beliefs but not with Aristotle's perspective. Aristotle's ethics is grounded in human nature and rationality rather than divine intervention.\n\nOption D, innate, contradicts Aristotle's view. He did not believe that virtues are innate or naturally present in us from birth. Instead, he thought that we have the potential to develop virtues, but actually doing so requires effort and practice.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is A. acquired through habit."
