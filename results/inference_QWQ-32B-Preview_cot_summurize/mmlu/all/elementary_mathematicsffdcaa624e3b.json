                    "text": "So Alice has 8 buckets, and each bucket has t tennis balls in it. Overall, there are 56 tennis balls in all the buckets. I need to find out which equation shows how to find t, which is the number of tennis balls in each bucket.\n\nLet me think about this. If there are 8 buckets, and each has t tennis balls, then the total number of tennis balls should be 8 times t, right? Because you're adding t tennis balls eight times, one for each bucket.\n\nSo, 8 times t equals 56. That would be 8 \u00d7 t = 56. That's option B.\n\nLet me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is 8 \u00f7 t = 56. That means dividing 8 by t gives 56. Hmm, that doesn't make sense in this context. If I have 8 buckets and I divide them by the number of tennis balls to get 56, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C is t + 8 = 56. That would mean that the number of tennis balls in each bucket plus 8 equals 56. But that doesn't make sense because we're dealing with multiplication, not addition.\n\nOption D is t \u00f7 8 = 56. That would mean dividing the number of tennis balls in each bucket by 8 gives 56. Again, that doesn't seem right for this situation.\n\nSo, it looks like option B is the correct one: 8 \u00d7 t = 56.\n\nTo double-check, I can solve for t. If 8 \u00d7 t = 56, then t = 56 \u00f7 8, which is 7. So each bucket has 7 tennis balls. Does that make sense? If there are 8 buckets with 7 tennis balls each, then total tennis balls are 8 times 7, which is 56. Yes, that matches the total given.\n\nSo, the correct equation is 8 \u00d7 t = 56.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
