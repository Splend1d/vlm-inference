                    "text": "To determine the H+ (aq) concentration in a 1.0 M phenol solution, we need to consider the acid dissociation of phenol in water. Phenol is a weak acid, and its dissociation can be represented by the following equilibrium:\n\nC6H5OH (aq) + H2O (l) \u21cc C6H5O- (aq) + H3O+ (aq)\n\nThe acid dissociation constant, Ka, for phenol is given as 1 \u00d7 10^-10. The expression for Ka is:\n\nKa = [C6H5O-][H3O+] / [C6H5OH]\n\nGiven that the initial concentration of phenol is 1.0 M and assuming that the dissociation is small compared to the initial concentration, we can set up an ICE table to find the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nLet x be the concentration of H3O+ ions produced by the dissociation of phenol. At equilibrium:\n\n[C6H5OH] \u2248 1.0 M - x \u2248 1.0 M (since x is very small)\n\n[C6H5O-] = x\n\n[H3O+] = x\n\nSubstituting these into the Ka expression:\n\nKa = (x)(x) / (1.0) = x^2 / 1.0 = x^2\n\nGiven Ka = 1 \u00d7 10^-10:\n\nx^2 = 1 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nx = sqrt(1 \u00d7 10^-10) = 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M\n\nTherefore, the H+ (aq) concentration is approximately 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M.\n\nHowever, it's important to check if the approximation made (that x is small compared to 1.0 M) is valid. The value of x is 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M, which is indeed much smaller than 1.0 M, so the approximation holds.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
