                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about bystander intervention and why people might be less likely to help when there are more witnesses around. The researchers mentioned are Darley and Latanne, and they studied this phenomenon. The question is asking which social psychology concept best explains this.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Social loafing - I think this is when people put in less effort when they're working in a group compared to when they're alone. Like, if you're in a team and you don't feel your individual contribution is noticed, you might slack off a bit.\n\nB. Prejudice - This is more about\u504f\u89c1 and discrimination against certain groups. Doesn't seem directly related to bystander intervention.\n\nC. Conformity - This is when people go along with the actions or beliefs of a group, even if they privately disagree. Maybe related, but I'm not sure how it directly explains why people don't intervene.\n\nD. Diffusion of responsibility - This sounds like it could be the answer. It means that when there are many people around, each individual feels less personal responsibility to take action because they think someone else will do it.\n\nSo, in the context of bystander intervention, if there are a lot of people witnessing a crime, each person might assume that someone else will call for help or step in, so they don't feel the need to do anything. This could lead to no one actually intervening.\n\nLet me think about an example. Imagine you're in a crowded street and you see someone\u5012\u5728\u5730\u4e0a\u3002If there are only a few people around, you might feel more compelled to check if they're okay or call for help. But if there are hundreds of people, you might think someone else has already called emergency services or knows what's going on, so you don't need to do anything.\n\nThis seems consistent with the diffusion of responsibility concept. On the other hand, social loafing is more about effort in group tasks, which isn't directly related to helping behavior in emergency situations.\n\nPrejudice doesn't seem relevant here because it's about attitudes toward certain groups, not about helping behavior in general.\n\nConformity is about following group norms, but in this scenario, the group isn't necessarily setting a norm about not helping; it's more about\u5206\u6563\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u611f\u3002\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D. Diffusion of responsibility.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me make sure there isn't another concept that could explain this better.\n\nMaybe groupthink? But groupthink is when a group prioritizes harmony and consensus over critical evaluation of alternatives, leading to poor decisions. That doesn't seem directly related here.\n\nOr perhaps the bystander effect itself is the answer, but that's actually what the question is about\u2014why bystander intervention decreases with more witnesses.\n\nDiffusion of responsibility seems to be the underlying reason for the bystander effect, as proposed by Darley and Latane.\n\nThey found that in emergency situations, individuals are less likely to intervene when there are other people present because they assume that someone else will take action.\n\nThis phenomenon was famously studied in the case of Kitty Genovese, although some details of that case have been disputed.\n\nIn summary, diffusion of responsibility is the social psychology concept that best explains why bystander intervention decreases when more people are present.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
