                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which term describes bending the forearm toward the body. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Abduction - I think abduction is moving a limb away from the midline of the body. For example, raising your arm out to the side. So, that doesn't sound like bending the forearm toward the body.\n\nB. Eversion - I'm not sure about this one. I think eversion has to do with turning something outward, maybe like turning the foot outward. Doesn't seem related to bending the forearm.\n\nC. Flexion - Flexion sounds familiar. I think it's bending a part of the body, decreasing the angle between bones. So, bending the elbow would be flexion, right? That brings the forearm toward the body.\n\nD. Pronation - I believe pronation is rotating the forearm so that the palm faces downward or backward. So, it's more about the orientation of the hand, not necessarily bending the forearm toward the body.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about this more carefully. When you bend your forearm toward your body, are you flexing your elbow or are you doing something else?\n\nLet me consider the movement. If I'm sitting here and I bend my forearm toward my body, it's like bringing my hand closer to my shoulder. That seems like flexing the elbow joint.\n\nAbduction would be lifting my arm out to the side, away from the body, not bending the forearm.\n\nEversion, as I recall, is specific to the foot, turning the sole outward. So, that's not relevant here.\n\nFlexion is bending a joint, like bending the elbow, which brings the forearm closer to the body.\n\nPronation is more about the rotation of the forearm, not necessarily bending it toward the body.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. Flexion.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should double-check the definitions.\n\nAbduction: moving a limb away from the midline of the body.\n\nAdduction: moving a limb toward the midline of the body.\n\nEversion: turning the sole of the foot outward.\n\nFlexion: bending a joint, decreasing the angle between bones.\n\nExtension: straightening a joint, increasing the angle between bones.\n\nPronation: rotating the forearm so the palm faces downward or backward.\n\nSupination: rotating the forearm so the palm faces upward or forward.\n\nSo, based on these definitions, flexion indeed involves bending the joint, which in the case of the elbow, brings the forearm toward the body.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Flexion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
