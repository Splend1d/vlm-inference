Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is about finding the longest simple cycle in G. I think this is related to the Hamiltonian cycle problem, which is known to be NP-complete. So, probably, this isn't solvable in polynomial time.\n\nOption B is finding the shortest cycle in G. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think there's an algorithm using breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) that can find cycles in a graph. Maybe it's possible to find the shortest cycle efficiently.\n\nOption C is finding all spanning trees of G. Spanning trees involve connecting all vertices without cycles, and there are algorithms like Kruskal's or Prim's that deal with minimum spanning trees, but finding all spanning trees sounds more complicated. I'm not sure if that can be done in polynomial time.\n\nOption D is finding the largest clique in G. I know that the clique problem is NP-complete, so that's probably not solvable in polynomial time.\n\nSo, based on my initial thoughts, option B seems the most promising. Let me see if I can find more information to confirm this.\n\nFirst, for option A, the longest simple cycle is indeed related to the Hamiltonian cycle problem, which is NP-complete. So, it's unlikely to have a polynomial-time solution unless P=NP.\n\nFor option B, finding the shortest cycle in a graph can be approached by finding the minimum cycle basis or by using BFS to find the shortest cycle that includes a particular edge. I think BFS can be used to find the shortest cycle by detecting the smallest length cycle in the graph. Since BFS runs in O(V + E) time, which is linear, this should be polynomial-time.\n\nFor option C, finding all spanning trees of a graph, that seems more involved. The number of spanning trees can be exponential in the number of vertices, so listing all of them would take exponential time. Therefore, this can't be done in polynomial time.\n\nFor option D, as I mentioned, the clique problem is NP-complete, so it's not solvable in polynomial time unless P=NP.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: finding a shortest cycle in G, which can be done in polynomial time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
