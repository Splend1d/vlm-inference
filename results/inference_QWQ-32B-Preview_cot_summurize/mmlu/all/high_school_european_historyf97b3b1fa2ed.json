His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe conflict referred to in the final paragraph of the passage was best described in which book?\n\nA.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which book best describes the conflict mentioned in that passage from \u00c9mile Zola's \"Germinal.\" Let me read the final paragraph again to get a clear understanding.\n\n\"So, in the passage, this character, Souvarine, is talking about how these hatworkers in Marseilles won a big lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs and instead of sharing it or doing something communal with it, they went off and invested it, saying they're going to live without doing anything. So, he's criticizing them for wanting to be lazy and selfish with their winnings. He says that French workmen, in general, have this idea that they want to find a treasure and then enjoy it alone, without sharing it with others. He accuses them of not having the courage to give back to the poor any money that comes to them through luck. He goes on to say that they'll never be worthy of happiness as long as they own anything, and that their hatred of the bourgeois is just because they want to be bourgeois themselves.\n\nSo, the conflict here seems to be between the ideals of communal sharing and the reality of individualistic desires. It's about the tension between wanting to help others and wanting to benefit oneself, especially in terms of wealth and resources.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these books best describes this kind of conflict.\n\nOption A is \"On Liberty\" by John Stuart Mill. I know that \"On Liberty\" is about individual freedom and the limits of social control over the individual. It argues for the importance of individual liberty and the harm principle\u2014that the only reason society should interfere with an individual's actions is to prevent harm to others. So, it's more about individual rights and freedoms rather than the specific conflict between communal sharing and individualistic desires. Maybe not the best fit here.\n\nOption B is \"The Communist Manifesto\" by Marx and Engels. This is a foundational text of communism, where Marx and Engels discuss the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and propose that the proletariat should overthrow the bourgeoisie to establish a classless society. The manifesto talks about the abolition of private property and the idea of communal ownership. This seems more aligned with the themes in the passage, where Souvarine is advocating for some form of communal sharing and criticizing individualistic tendencies.\n\nOption C is \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\" I know that this is a antisemitic forgery that purports to describe a Jewish plot for global domination. It's not related to the conflict described in the passage, so I can rule this one out.\n\nOption D is \"Looking Backward\" by Edward Bellamy. This is a utopian novel that envisions a future United States in the year 2000, where society has reorganized along socialist lines, with nationalization of industries and distribution of goods based on need. It presents an idealized version of a socialist society. While it does talk about communal living and the abolition of private property, it's more of a fictional portrayal compared to \"The Communist Manifesto,\" which is a political tract.\n\nComparing options B and D, \"The Communist Manifesto\" directly addresses the conflict between communal ideals and individualistic desires, especially in terms of property and wealth. It talks about the need to abolish private property and have communal ownership, which aligns with Souvarine's disappointment that his fellow workers want to keep their winnings for themselves rather than share them.\n\n\"Looking Backward,\" while also promoting socialist ideas, is more of a fictional depiction of an ideal society, whereas \"The Communist Manifesto\" is a call to action based on class struggle. Given that the passage is about a conflict between ideals and reality, and specifically critiquing the failure to achieve communal fusion, \"The Communist Manifesto\" seems more directly relevant.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. \"The Communist Manifesto\" by Marx and Engels.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
