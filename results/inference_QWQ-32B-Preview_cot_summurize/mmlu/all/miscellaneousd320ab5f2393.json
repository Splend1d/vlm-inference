                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these substances poses the greatest safety risk when being heated in a school laboratory. So, I have four options: a mixture of iron and sulfur, mercury(II) oxide, sodium chloride, and copper(II) sulfate hydrate. I need to think about what happens when each of these is heated and whether any hazardous substances are produced.\n\nFirst, let's consider the mixture of iron and sulfur. When iron and sulfur are heated together, they can react to form iron sulfide. I think the reaction is something like Fe + S -> FeS. I don't recall anything particularly hazardous about iron sulfide, but I should double-check. Iron sulfide is used in some industrial processes, and I don't recall it being extremely dangerous. Maybe it's not the biggest risk here.\n\nNext, mercury(II) oxide. Hmm, mercury is a toxic substance, and I know that mercury compounds can be hazardous. When mercury(II) oxide is heated, it decomposes into mercury metal and oxygen gas. The chemical equation is HgO -> Hg + O2. Mercury vapor is toxic and can be inhaled, which is dangerous. So, heating mercury(II) oxide releases mercury vapor, which is a serious health hazard. This seems like a significant safety risk.\n\nThen, sodium chloride. That's just table salt, right? When heated, it doesn't decompose easily; it melts at high temperatures, but doesn't release any hazardous gases. So, heating sodium chloride shouldn't pose a major safety risk.\n\nLastly, copper(II) sulfate hydrate. Copper(II) sulfate is a common laboratory chemical. When heated, the hydrate loses its water of crystallization, forming anhydrous copper(II) sulfate. The reaction is CuSO4\u00b75H2O -> CuSO4 + 5 H2O. Water vapor is released, which is harmless. Copper(II) sulfate is toxic if ingested, but heating it doesn't release any hazardous gases unless it's heated to very high temperatures, where it might decompose and release sulfur oxides, but that's probably not happening in a school lab setting.\n\nComparing all these, heating mercury(II) oxide releases toxic mercury vapor, which is a serious health hazard. The other substances don't seem to pose the same level of risk when heated. Iron sulfide doesn't seem particularly hazardous, sodium chloride is inert when heated, and copper(II) sulfate only releases water vapor when heated moderately.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. Mercury(II) oxide.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
