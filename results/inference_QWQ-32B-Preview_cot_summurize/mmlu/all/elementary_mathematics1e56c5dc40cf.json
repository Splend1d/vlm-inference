                    "text": "Let's tackle this division problem: 1,224 divided by 9. I need to find the quotient, which is the result of the division. The options are A. 135, B. 136, C. 1,215, and D. 1,360. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that dividing by 9 can be tricky, but maybe there's a straightforward way to do it. One thing I remember is that 9 times 100 is 900, and 9 times 110 is 990, but I need to get to 1,224. Let me try to estimate how many times 9 goes into 1,224.\n\nLet's start by seeing how much is 9 times 100. That's 900. Now, 1,224 minus 900 is 324. So, 9 goes into 1,224 at least 100 times, and there's 324 left over.\n\nNext, how many times does 9 go into 324? Well, 9 times 30 is 270, and 324 minus 270 is 54. So, that means 9 goes into 324 thirty times with a remainder of 54.\n\nNow, how many times does 9 go into 54? Exactly 6 times, because 9 times 6 is 54. So, adding that up, 100 plus 30 plus 6 is 136.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, the quotient of 1,224 divided by 9 is 136. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nLet me multiply 9 by 136 to verify. 9 times 100 is 900, 9 times 30 is 270, and 9 times 6 is 54. Adding those up: 900 plus 270 is 1,170, plus 54 is 1,224. Perfect, it checks out.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, B. 136 is the correct answer. But let's just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is 135. If I multiply 9 by 135, that's 9 times 100 is 900, 9 times 30 is 270, and 9 times 5 is 45. Adding those up: 900 plus 270 is 1,170, plus 45 is 1,215. That's less than 1,224, so it's not correct.\n\nOption C is 1,215. That seems too big. Wait, no, 1,215 is actually less than 1,224. But in the previous step, I saw that 9 times 135 is 1,215, which is less than 1,224, so that's not the quotient.\n\nOption D is 1,360. That seems way too big. 9 times 1,360 would be 9 times 1,000 is 9,000, plus 9 times 360 is 3,240, totaling 12,240, which is way higher than 1,224.\n\nSo, clearly, the correct answer is B. 136.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use long division. Let me try that to confirm.\n\nFirst, divide 9 into 12 (the first two digits of 1,224). 9 goes into 12 once, since 9 times 1 is 9. Subtract 9 from 12, which leaves 3. Bring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 32.\n\nNow, divide 9 into 32. 9 times 3 is 27. Subtract 27 from 32, which leaves 5. Bring down the next digit, 4, making it 54.\n\nFinally, divide 9 into 54. 9 times 6 is 54. Subtract 54 from 54, which leaves 0.\n\nSo, the quotient is 136, with no remainder. That matches what I found earlier.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. It's good to use different methods to confirm the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 136} \\]"
