Entomologist sounds familiar, but I believe that's someone who studies insects, not fish.\n\nC. Marinologist isn't a term I've come across before. Maybe it's related to the sea, but I'm not sure.\n\nD. Herpetologist, I think that's someone who studies reptiles and amphibians.\n\nSo, yeah, B. ichthyologist seems to be the correct answer here. It makes sense because \"ichthy\" relates to fish, like in ichthyology, the scientific study of fish.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
