                    "text": "So I have this problem about unifying expressions with variables. I need to figure out which pairs of expressions can be made lexically identical by substituting variables with some values or other expressions. The expressions given are:\n\nI. f(w,w)\n\nII. f(x,1)\n\nIII. f(y,g(z))\n\nAnd the variables are w, x, y, and z.\n\nI need to check which pairs can be unified. Let's look at each pair one by one.\n\nFirst, pair (I, II): f(w,w) and f(x,1).\n\nTo unify these, I need to find substitutions for the variables so that both expressions look exactly the same.\n\nIn f(w,w), both arguments are the variable w.\n\nIn f(x,1), the first argument is x and the second is the constant 1.\n\nSo, for these to be unified, w would have to be substituted with something that makes both arguments match f(x,1).\n\nIf I substitute w with x in f(w,w), I get f(x,x). But f(x,x) is not the same as f(x,1) unless x is 1. But x is a variable, and in f(x,1), x is not necessarily 1; it's just that the second argument is 1.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Maybe I need to find substitutions for w and x so that f(w,w) becomes equal to f(x,1).\n\nIf I set w to x, then f(w,w) becomes f(x,x). Now, to make f(x,x) equal to f(x,1), the second arguments need to be equal, so x would have to be 1.\n\nIf x is 1, then f(x,x) is f(1,1) and f(x,1) is f(1,1), which are identical.\n\nSo, yes, they can be unified by substituting w with 1 and x with 1.\n\nWait, but in unification, substitutions are done consistently. So if I substitute x with 1, then in f(x,1), it becomes f(1,1). And in f(w,w), if w is substituted with x, which is 1, it also becomes f(1,1). So they match.\n\nSo pair (I, II) is unifiable.\n\nNow, pair (I, III): f(w,w) and f(y,g(z)).\n\nAgain, I need to find substitutions for the variables to make these expressions identical.\n\nIn f(w,w), both arguments are w.\n\nIn f(y,g(z)), the first argument is y and the second is g(z).\n\nFor these to be unified, w would need to be substituted with something that makes both arguments match f(y,g(z)).\n\nIf I set w to y, then f(w,w) becomes f(y,y). Now, to make f(y,y) equal to f(y,g(z)), the second arguments need to be equal, so y would have to be g(z).\n\nIf y is g(z), then f(y,y) is f(g(z),g(z)) and f(y,g(z)) is f(g(z),g(z)), which are identical.\n\nSo, yes, they can be unified by substituting w with g(z) and y with g(z).\n\nAlternatively, you could think of substituting w with y in f(w,w), making it f(y,y), and then setting y to g(z) to match f(y,g(z)).\n\nEither way, it works.\n\nSo pair (I, III) is unifiable.\n\nNow, pair (II, III): f(x,1) and f(y,g(z)).\n\nNeed to find substitutions for x, y, z to make these expressions identical.\n\nIn f(x,1), the first argument is x and the second is 1.\n\nIn f(y,g(z)), the first argument is y and the second is g(z).\n\nFor these to be unified, x must be substituted with y, and 1 must be substituted with g(z).\n\nSo, set x to y, and set g(z) to 1.\n\nBut g(z) is a function application, and 1 is a constant. Whether they can be unified depends on what g is.\n\nIn unification, we can't change the definition of functions; we can only substitute variables.\n\nSo, if g is a constant function that always returns 1, then g(z) would be 1 for any z, and they would unify.\n\nBut generally, g is a function symbol, and g(z) represents the application of g to z.\n\nUnless g is known to be a constant function returning 1, which it's not specified here, we can't assume that.\n\nTherefore, unless g(z) can be equal to 1, which we don't know, we can't unify f(x,1) and f(y,g(z)).\n\nSo, pair (II, III) is not unifiable.\n\nWait, but in unification, we can substitute variables with terms, but we can't change the functions.\n\nSo, in this case, to unify f(x,1) and f(y,g(z)), we would need x to be y, and 1 to be g(z).\n\nBut 1 is a constant, and g(z) is a function application.\n\nIn first-order logic, constants and function applications are different, so 1 cannot be equal to g(z) unless g is defined in a way that g(z) is always 1, which it's not specified here.\n\nTherefore, unless there's additional information saying that g(z) is equal to 1, we can't unify f(x,1) and f(y,g(z)).\n\nSo, pair (II, III) is not unifiable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that only pairs (I, II) and (I, III) are unifiable.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (I, II) only\n\nB. (I, III) only\n\nC. (II, III) only\n\nD. (I, II) and (I, III) only\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, in my analysis, pair (II, III) is not unifiable, so D seems correct.\n\nHowever, let me double-check.\n\nFor pair (I, II):\n\n- Substitute w with 1 and x with 1.\n\n- Then f(w,w) becomes f(1,1) and f(x,1) becomes f(1,1).\n\n- They match.\n\nFor pair (I, III):\n\n- Substitute w with g(z) and y with g(z).\n\n- Then f(w,w) becomes f(g(z),g(z)) and f(y,g(z)) becomes f(g(z),g(z)).\n\n- They match.\n\nFor pair (II, III):\n\n- To unify f(x,1) and f(y,g(z)), need x=y and 1=g(z).\n\n- Unless g(z)=1, which is not generally true, they don't unify.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. (I, II) and (I, III) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
