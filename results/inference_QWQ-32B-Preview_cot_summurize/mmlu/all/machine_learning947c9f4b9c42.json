                    "text": "So I've got these two statements about overfitting, and I need to determine which one is true and which one is false. Let's see:\n\nStatement 1: Overfitting is more likely when the set of training data is small.\n\nStatement 2: Overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what overfitting means. Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well, to the point where it captures the noise and details of the training set that don't generalize to new, unseen data. It's like memorizing the answers to a test instead of understanding the underlying concepts.\n\nNow, let's consider Statement 1. If the training set is small, does that make overfitting more likely?\n\nWell, with a small training set, there's less data for the model to learn from. This can lead to a model that's too closely tailored to the specific examples in the training set, including their quirks and noise. So, yes, that seems like it would increase the chance of overfitting. So, Statement 1 seems true.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: Overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small.\n\nHmm, this one is a bit trickier. A hypothesis space is the set of all possible hypotheses that a model can choose from. If the hypothesis space is small, that means the model has fewer options to choose from. Intuitively, a smaller hypothesis space should make overfitting less likely because there are fewer complex models to choose from that could fit the noise in the training data.\n\nOn the other hand, if the hypothesis space is very large, the model might be able to find a very complex hypothesis that fits the training data perfectly, including all the noise, which would lead to overfitting.\n\nWait a minute, that seems to suggest that a larger hypothesis space increases the risk of overfitting, while a smaller hypothesis space decreases it. So, Statement 2 seems false.\n\nLet me see if I can find any exceptions or scenarios where a small hypothesis space could lead to overfitting.\n\nSuppose the hypothesis space is so small that it doesn't include the true underlying function. In that case, the model might overfit because it's trying to force a poor fit to the data, possibly capturing noise as if it were a pattern. But that sounds more like underfitting, where the model is too simple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some cases, a small hypothesis space could lead to overfitting if the few available hypotheses are very flexible and can still fit the noise in the data. But generally, a smaller hypothesis space should reduce the risk of overfitting.\n\nI think I need to look up the relationship between hypothesis space size and overfitting to be sure.\n\nLet me search for \"hypothesis space and overfitting.\"\n\nOkay, according to this machine learning textbook, the size of the hypothesis space affects the model's capacity to fit the data. A larger hypothesis space means higher model capacity, which can lead to overfitting if the model is too complex relative to the amount of training data.\n\nConversely, a smaller hypothesis space corresponds to a simpler model, which is less likely to overfit but might underfit if it's too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data.\n\nSo, based on this, Statement 2 is false because a smaller hypothesis space reduces the risk of overfitting.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be C. True, False.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any situation where a small hypothesis space could lead to overfitting?\n\nSuppose the training data has some noise, and the small hypothesis space only includes hypotheses that can fit that noise perfectly. In that case, the model might overfit to that noise. But that seems unlikely because a small hypothesis space typically consists of simple models that can't capture noise well.\n\nAnother perspective: overfitting often occurs when the model has high variance and low bias. A small hypothesis space usually corresponds to high bias and low variance, which is more associated with underfitting.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that Statement 2 is indeed false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
