                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"Let \\( n \\) be the product of the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers. Find the sum of the digits of \\( n \\).\" The options are A. 8, B. 3, C. 6, D. 9.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers. I know that the smallest 3-digit number is 100. So, I should start checking from 100 onwards to find the first two prime numbers.\n\nLet's check 100. Is 100 a prime number? Well, 100 is divisible by 2, since it's even, and also by 5, because it ends with a 0. So, 100 is not prime.\n\nNext is 101. Is 101 a prime number? I need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's see, it's not even, not divisible by 3 (1+0+1=2, which is not a multiple of 3), not divisible by 5, and not divisible by 7 (7*14=98, 7*15=105, so 101 is between those). So, 101 seems to be a prime number.\n\nNow, the next number is 102. Is 102 prime? It's even, so it's divisible by 2. Therefore, not prime.\n\nNext is 103. Is 103 a prime number? It's not even, not divisible by 3 (1+0+3=4, not a multiple of 3), not divisible by 5, and not divisible by 7 (7*14=98, 7*15=105, so 103 is between those). So, 103 also seems to be a prime number.\n\nNext is 104. It's even, so not prime.\n\nThen 105. It's divisible by 5 (ends with 5), so not prime.\n\nSo, the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers are 101 and 103.\n\nNow, I need to find their product, \\( n = 101 \\times 103 \\).\n\nTo calculate this, I can use the formula for multiplying two numbers close to 100. I know that \\( (100 + a)(100 + b) = 10000 + 100(a + b) + a b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\), so:\n\n\\( n = 10000 + 100(1 + 3) + (1 \\times 3) = 10000 + 400 + 3 = 10403 \\).\n\nSo, \\( n = 10403 \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the digits of 10403. Let's add them up: 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits is 8.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. 8 is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check everything to be sure.\n\nFirst, confirming the smallest 3-digit primes: 101 and 103 seem correct.\n\nThen, the product: 101 * 103 = 10403. I can verify this by direct multiplication:\n\n101\n\n\u00d7 103\n\n= 101 \u00d7 100 + 101 \u00d7 3\n\n= 10100 + 303\n\n= 10403. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, sum of digits: 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 3 = 8. That seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 8.\n\nBut why are there other options like B. 3, C. 6, D. 9? Maybe to check if I make calculation errors or choose the wrong primes.\n\nFor example, if I mistakenly thought 100 was prime (which it's not), or if I added the digits incorrectly, I might end up with a different sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing if I know that 1 is not a prime number. But in this case, 101 and 103 are indeed the first two 3-digit primes.\n\nSo, I think A. 8 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
