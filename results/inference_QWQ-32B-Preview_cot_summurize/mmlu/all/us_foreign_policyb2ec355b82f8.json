I remember in class, we talked about how liberals believe in spreading democracy because they think it leads to a more peaceful world. Also, they support free trade because it helps countries become economically interdependent, which can prevent conflicts. And international institutions are important to them because these organizations help manage global issues and promote cooperation among nations.\n\nOption B mentions alliances and diplomacy, which liberals do support, but protectionism is more associated with realists who worry about maintaining economic independence and security. So, protectionism doesn't really fit with the liberal approach.\n\nOption C talks about the balance of power, which is a realist concept, and self-sufficiency, which again ties more with realism and its emphasis on national security and autonomy.\n\nOption D is just \"none of the above,\" but based on what I know, A seems to be the correct choice.\n\nSo, I'll go with A. Promotion of Democracy, free-trade, and international institutions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
