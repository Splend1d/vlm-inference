                    "text": "SARS is described as a zoonotic virus. So, what does \"zoonotic\" mean in this context?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Such viruses are confined to animals\n\nB. They do not cause disease in humans\n\nC. They emerge from animals to cross the species barrier infrequently\n\nD. They cause pandemics\n\nFirst, I know that zoonotic diseases are those that can be transmitted from animals to humans. So, option A says they are confined to animals, but if they can be transmitted to humans, that doesn't make sense. So, A might not be correct.\n\nOption B says they do not cause disease in humans. But we know that SARS caused disease in humans, leading to a significant outbreak in 2003. So, B seems incorrect.\n\nOption C mentions that they emerge from animals and cross the species barrier infrequently. SARS is known to have originated from animals, possibly bats, and jumped to humans. The term \"infrequently\" might be relative, but this option seems plausible.\n\nOption D says they cause pandemics. While SARS did cause a pandemic, not all zoonotic viruses lead to pandemics. For example, some zoonotic diseases might cause only sporadic cases or local outbreaks. So, D might be too broad.\n\nConsidering this, option C seems the most accurate. Zoonotic viruses like SARS emerge from animals and can cross the species barrier, although perhaps not frequently.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's think about it again. Zoonotic viruses are indeed those that can be transmitted from animals to humans. SARS is a example of such a virus. It's known that SARS-CoV, the virus that causes SARS, originated in animals and later infected humans.\n\nThe term \"zoonotic\" specifically refers to diseases that can be passed from animals to humans. So, option A is incorrect because these viruses are not confined to animals; they can infect humans as well.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because, by definition, zoonotic viruses can cause disease in humans.\n\nOption C mentions that they emerge from animals and cross the species barrier infrequently. While it's true that zoonotic viruses originate in animals and occasionally jump to humans, the frequency can vary. Some zoonotic diseases, like avian influenza, might cross the species barrier infrequently, while others, like certain types of influenza, might do so more regularly.\n\nHowever, in the case of SARS, the cross-species transmission appears to have been infrequent, as the 2003 outbreak was a one-time event, followed by various smaller occurrences and the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is a different but related virus.\n\nOption D says they cause pandemics. While some zoonotic viruses can cause pandemics, not all of them do. Many zoonotic diseases cause only local outbreaks or sporadic cases.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer seems to be option C: zoonotic viruses emerge from animals to cross the species barrier infrequently.\n\nBut, to make sure, let's consider the definition of zoonotic again. Zoonotic diseases are those that can be transmitted from animals to humans. The key point is the transmission from animals to humans.\n\nOption C not only acknowledges the animal origin but also mentions that the cross-species transmission is infrequent. While this might be generally true for many zoonotic viruses, it's essential to note that the frequency can vary.\n\nHowever, given the options provided, C seems to be the best choice.\n\nSo, the answer is C. They emerge from animals to cross the species barrier infrequently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
