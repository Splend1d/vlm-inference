                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Janice and her feelings towards her husband. It says she has feelings of hostility and contempt, but instead of expressing them, she goes overboard to dote on him. And I need to figure out which defense mechanism she's using from the options given: rational philosophy, reaction formation, repression, or sublimation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these defense mechanisms is. Defense mechanisms are psychological strategies that people use to deal with uncomfortable feelings or to avoid anxiety.\n\nLet's start with rational philosophy. I'm not too sure about this one. It doesn't sound like a standard defense mechanism. Maybe it's a typo or something, or perhaps it's a way of thinking rather than a defense mechanism. I'll keep it in mind but I doubt it's the answer.\n\nNext is reaction formation. I think this one might be relevant. Reaction formation is when someone expresses feelings that are the opposite of their true feelings. So, if someone hates something, they might act as if they love it. That seems pretty similar to what Janice is doing. She has hostile and contemptuous feelings but instead, she's being overly doting and attentive to her husband.\n\nThen there's repression. Repression is when someone pushes uncomfortable thoughts or feelings deep down into their unconscious mind, essentially forgetting about them. But in this case, Janice is not just forgetting her feelings; she's actively doing the opposite.\n\nLastly, sublimation is when someone channels their unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities. For example, instead of acting out aggressively, someone might become a surgeon or a competitive athlete. But in Janice's case, she's not channeling her feelings into another activity; she's expressing the opposite feelings.\n\nComparing all these, reaction formation seems to fit best because she's doing the opposite of what she really feels. Repression might be a possibility if she was just ignoring her feelings, but the fact that she's acting in a contrary manner points more towards reaction formation.\n\nI should probably double-check what each term means to be sure. Let me quickly look up reaction formation to confirm.\n\nOkay, according to my psychology textbook, reaction formation is indeed a defense mechanism where a person converts unwanted or dangerous thoughts, feelings, or impulses into their opposites. So, if someone has aggressive feelings, they might become excessively kind or helpful.\n\nThat matches perfectly with Janice's behavior. She has hostile and contemptuous feelings but instead, she's being overly doting towards her husband.\n\nRepression, on the other hand, is more about pushing those feelings away so they're not even acknowledged consciously. But in this scenario, it seems like Janice is aware of her feelings but is choosing to act in the opposite way, which is more in line with reaction formation.\n\nSublimation is about redirecting those feelings into something productive and socially acceptable, but again, Janice isn't redirecting her feelings; she's expressing the opposite.\n\nRational philosophy doesn't sound like a defense mechanism at all. Maybe it's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be reaction formation.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any other defense mechanisms that could apply here. For example, is there something like undoing, where someone tries to reverse a thought or action they find unacceptable? But that doesn't quite fit here because Janice isn't trying to reverse something she did; she's acting in a certain way consistently.\n\nOr maybe it's projection, where someone attributes their own unwanted feelings to someone else. But no, that doesn't seem to apply here either.\n\nNo, I think reaction formation is still the best fit.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about the context. Janice has been married for forty years and has these feelings of hostility and contempt, but instead of expressing them, she's being overly doting. Maybe there are underlying reasons for this, like guilt or a desire to maintain the marriage, but the behavior described points to reaction formation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is B. Reaction formation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
