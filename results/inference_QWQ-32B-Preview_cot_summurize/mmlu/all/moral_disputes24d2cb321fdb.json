                    "text": "Let's see. I'm looking at this question about Huemer's view on drug prohibition. The question is: \"According to Huemer, even if drug use harms a person's friends, families, and other relations, which of the following options is correct?\" And then there are four options:\n\nA. This would still not justify drug prohibition.\n\nB. This would justify drug prohibition.\n\nC. This would only justify drug prohibition if drug use was extremely likely to cause these harms.\n\nD. This would only justify drug prohibition if drug use was more likely to cause these kinds of harms than other prohibited activities.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what Huemer's position is here. I remember that Huemer is generally critical of drug prohibition and argues that it's morally unjustified. So, probably, he wouldn't think that harms to friends and family are enough to justify prohibition.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. First, what does it mean for drug use to harm friends, family, and other relations? Maybe it means that drug use can lead to domestic violence, financial problems, neglect of responsibilities, etc., which in turn affect the people close to the user.\n\nNow, even if that's the case, Huemer might argue that these harms are not sufficient to justify prohibition. Why? Well, perhaps because prohibition has its own set of harms, such as violence associated with the drug trade, incarceration costs, and the infringement on personal liberty.\n\nMoreover, Huemer might argue that people have the right to make choices that affect themselves and even those around them, as long as those choices don't involve force or fraud. So, even if drug use harms others indirectly, it might not be enough to override the individual's right to choose.\n\nOption B says that such harms would justify drug prohibition. But if Huemer is against prohibition, this probably isn't his view.\n\nOption C says that these harms would only justify prohibition if drug use is extremely likely to cause them. Hmm, that seems like a higher threshold for justification. Maybe Huemer would agree with this, suggesting that the likelihood of harm needs to be very high to justify prohibition.\n\nOption D says that prohibition would only be justified if drug use is more likely to cause these harms than other prohibited activities. This seems like a comparative approach, where drug use is only prohibited if it's worse than other prohibited things.\n\nGiven Huemer's general stance, I think he would lean towards option A: even if drug use harms friends and family, it still wouldn't justify prohibition. Alternatively, he might choose option C, saying that the likelihood of such harms needs to be extremely high to justify prohibition.\n\nBut I need to decide between these options. Maybe I should look back at Huemer's arguments.\n\nIn his essay \"The Problem of Drug Prohibition,\" Huemer argues that the state shouldn't prohibit consensual activities between adults, especially when the harms of prohibition may be greater than the harms of the activity itself.\n\nHe also discusses the principle of harm to others as a justification for prohibition, but he seems to set a high bar for what constitutes sufficient harm to others.\n\nGiven that, I think he would say that even if drug use harms friends and family, it wouldn't automatically justify prohibition unless those harms meet a certain threshold or are particularly severe.\n\nSo, between options C and A, I'm leaning towards C, which says that such harms would only justify prohibition if drug use was extremely likely to cause them.\n\nThis seems consistent with Huemer's cautious approach to state intervention and his emphasis on individual liberty.\n\nAlternatively, option D suggests a comparative approach, where drug use needs to be more harmful than other prohibited activities to justify prohibition.\n\nBut I think option C better captures Huemer's likely position, as he seems more concerned with the likelihood and severity of harms rather than comparing it to other activities.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: this would only justify drug prohibition if drug use was extremely likely to cause these harms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
