It's comparing philosophy to social sciences like psychology, sociology, and economics, which look into how people think and act. Now, philosophy is being defined in relation to these fields, and I need to choose the best description from options A, B, C, and D.\n\nOption A says philosophy is about how people with different beliefs or backgrounds disagree with one another. Hmm, that sounds like it could be part of philosophy, especially maybe in ethics or political philosophy, where different perspectives clash. But I feel like philosophy is broader than just studying disagreements.\n\nOption B says it's about what beliefs mean and whether people with different beliefs are justified in having them. This sounds more like epistemology and semantics, which are parts of philosophy. It seems to capture a key aspect of philosophical inquiry: examining the meaning and justification of beliefs.\n\nOption C says it's about the reasons why philosophical questions never have better or worse answers. I'm not sure about this. Philosophy often deals with questions that are complex and may not have definitive answers, but that doesn't mean all answers are equal. Philosophers argue for better or worse positions based on reasoning and arguments.\n\nOption D says philosophy is about questions that can be answered better by appealing to scientific experiments. But isn't that more aligned with the social sciences? Philosophy often questions the foundations and implications of scientific endeavors, but it doesn't typically rely on empirical experiments itself.\n\nConsidering these thoughts, option B seems the most accurate. Philosophy delves into the meaning of beliefs and evaluates whether those beliefs are justified, which aligns well with its nature as a discipline that questions fundamental assumptions and seeks rational understanding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
