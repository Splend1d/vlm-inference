There are four options, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nOption A says resilience is the ability of an IT system to identify and defend against a cyber-security threat. That sounds pretty good. Identifying threats and defending against them seems like a key part of resilience.\n\nOption B says the only way to build a truly resilient IT system is to ensure it can repel all types of threats and remain unattacked. Hmm, that sounds a bit too perfect. In reality, no system can repel all threats all the time. There are always vulnerabilities that can be exploited eventually.\n\nOption C says resilience refers to the ability of an IT system to function when there are no threats to its security. Well, that doesn't make much sense. If there are no threats, the system should just be operating normally. Resilience is more about handling adverse conditions.\n\nOption D says resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from an attack. That also sounds important. Being able to bounce back after a breach is crucial for maintaining operations and restoring trust.\n\nSo, between A and D, both seem relevant. A is about preventing the threat, and D is about recovering from it. I think resilience encompasses both aspects: preventing threats and recovering when prevention fails.\n\nBut looking back at the options, A and D are different. A is about identifying and defending against threats, while D is about recovering from attacks. Maybe the question is trying to distinguish between these two.\n\nI recall that in cyber-security, resilience is often about not just preventing attacks but also about minimizing damage and restoring operations quickly after an attack. So, option D seems to align with that idea.\n\nOption B is too absolute. No system can repel all threats all the time. It's more about mitigating risks and being able to handle incidents effectively.\n\nOption C is incorrect because resilience is about handling threats, not functioning in the absence of them.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D: Resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from an attack. That seems to capture the essence of resilience in cyber-security.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider combining A and D. Maybe resilience includes both defending against threats and recovering from attacks. But since the question asks for what resilience means and why it's important, and option D captures the recovery aspect, which is a crucial part of resilience.\n\nI think I'll go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
