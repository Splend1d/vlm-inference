                    "text": "So here's this scenario: a guy and his friend go to a bar, have a few drinks, get drunk and aggressive, and then decide to break into a big house that's dark and apparently empty to steal some jewelry. They get caught and arrested for burglary. Now, the passenger in the car is using the defense that he was too drunk to form the specific intent required for burglary. The question is, does this defense stand a good chance of working at trial?\n\nFirst off, let's understand what burglary is. Burglary typically requires two main elements: breaking and entering into a building without permission, and doing so with the intent to commit a felony inside, usually theft. So, in this case, the entering part is clear\u2014they broke into the house. The key here is the intent: did they enter with the purpose of committing a felony, which in this case was stealing jewelry.\n\nNow, the passenger is saying he was too intoxicated to form that specific intent. So, we need to look at how intoxication affects criminal responsibility, especially regarding intent.\n\nIn general, intoxication can affect a person's ability to form specific intent. Specific intent crimes require that the person not only committed the act but also had a particular mental state or intent behind it. Burglary is often considered a specific intent crime because of the requirement to enter with the intent to commit a felony inside.\n\nHowever, there are limits to using intoxication as a defense. In many jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication\u2014meaning the person chose to get drunk\u2014is not a valid defense for general intent crimes. General intent crimes are those where the intent to do the act is enough, without needing a specific purpose beyond that.\n\nBut in the case of specific intent crimes, like burglary, some jurisdictions may allow intoxication to be considered in determining whether the defendant had the specific intent required.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since burglary is a specific intent crime, the passenger might argue that his intoxication prevented him from forming the specific intent to commit a felony upon entering the house.\n\nBut let's look closer at the facts:\n\n- They discussed entering the home and seeing what they could take.\n\n- They broke in and took several bags of jewelry.\n\n- They were feeling drunk and aggressive from the drinks.\n\n- The passenger claims he was too intoxicated to form the specific intent.\n\nNow, the question is, despite being drunk, did he still have the necessary intent to commit burglary?\n\nIn many legal systems, even if a person is intoxicated, if they had the intent at the time of entering the building, that intent can still be attributed to them, especially if they were capable of forming intent to some degree.\n\nMoreover, in some jurisdictions, the law presumes that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of their actions. So, if someone breaks into a house with the plan to steal things, even if they were drunk, the law might hold that they intended to commit a felony inside.\n\nAdditionally, the level of intoxication matters. If someone is so drunk that they couldn't form any intent, that might be different. But in this case, they were able to drive, discuss a plan, break into a house, and take jewelry. That suggests a certain level of consciousness and intent.\n\nAlso, in some places, the defense of intoxication requires that the intoxication was involuntary, meaning the person didn't choose to get drunk. Since in this case, they went to a bar and had several drinks voluntarily, their intoxication was voluntary, which often doesn't excuse criminal behavior.\n\nGiven all this, option A says yes, he was too intoxicated to form the intent needed for burglary. But based on the facts, they were able to discuss a plan, execute it by breaking into the house, and take jewelry. That suggests they had the intent, despite being drunk.\n\nOption B says no, because intoxication is never a defense to a felony. That's not entirely accurate because in some cases, intoxication can be relevant to specific intent crimes.\n\nOption C says no, because the facts indicate he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary. This seems more plausible given that they planned and executed the break-in and theft.\n\nOption D says yes, because the feeling of being drunk and aggressive weren't his natural mental state, so mens rea (guilty mind) was defeated. But again, given that they were able to carry out a plan, it suggests they had the necessary mental state.\n\nTherefore, option C seems most likely correct: no, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.\n\nIt's also worth noting that courts often consider whether the defendant knew or should have known the consequences of their actions, even if they were intoxicated. In this case, breaking into a house to steal things is clearly wrong, and even if intoxicated, the person might still be held responsible for their actions.\n\nOverall, while intoxication can sometimes be a defense in specific intent crimes, in this scenario, the facts suggest that the passenger had the necessary intent to commit burglary, despite being drunk.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
