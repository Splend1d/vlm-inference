                    "text": "I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of squares from 21^2 to 40^2. The formula given is for the sum of squares from 1^2 to n^2, which is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. So, I'm thinking, how can I use this formula to find the sum from 21 to 40?\n\nWell, maybe I can find the sum up to 40 and then subtract the sum up to 20. That way, I'll be left with the sum from 21 to 40. Does that make sense?\n\nLet me try that. First, I'll calculate the sum of squares up to 40^2.\n\nSo, for n=40:\n\nSum = 40(40+1)(2*40 +1)/6\n\nLet's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 40 + 1 = 41.\n\nThen, 2*40 +1 = 81.\n\nSo, Sum = 40*41*81 / 6.\n\nNow, let's compute 40*41.\n\n40*40 = 1600, plus 40*1 = 40, so total 1640.\n\nThen, 1640*81.\n\nI can compute 1640*80 + 1640*1.\n\n1640*80 = 131200.\n\n1640*1 = 1640.\n\nSo, total 131200 + 1640 = 132840.\n\nNow, divide by 6.\n\n132840 / 6 = 22140.\n\nSo, the sum up to 40^2 is 22140.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum up to 20^2.\n\nFor n=20:\n\nSum = 20(20+1)(2*20 +1)/6\n\nCompute step by step.\n\n20+1 = 21.\n\n2*20 +1 = 41.\n\nSo, Sum = 20*21*41 / 6.\n\nFirst, 20*21 = 420.\n\nThen, 420*41.\n\n420*40 = 16800.\n\n420*1 = 420.\n\nSo, total 16800 + 420 = 17220.\n\nNow, divide by 6.\n\n17220 / 6 = 2870.\n\nSo, the sum up to 20^2 is 2870.\n\nNow, subtract this from the sum up to 40^2 to get the sum from 21 to 40.\n\n22140 - 2870 = 19270.\n\nSo, the sum from 21^2 to 40^2 is 19270.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 41\n\nB. 22140\n\nC. 19270\n\nD. 2870\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 19270.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, sum up to 40^2:\n\n40*41*81 / 6.\n\n40*41 = 1640.\n\n1640*81.\n\nLet's compute 1640*80 = 131200.\n\n1640*1 = 1640.\n\nTotal 131200 + 1640 = 132840.\n\n132840 / 6 = 22140. That seems correct.\n\nNext, sum up to 20^2:\n\n20*21*41 / 6.\n\n20*21 = 420.\n\n420*41 = 17220.\n\n17220 / 6 = 2870. That seems correct.\n\nSubtracting: 22140 - 2870 = 19270. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the general formula for the sum of squares from m to n.\n\nIt would be sum from 1 to n minus sum from 1 to m-1.\n\nBut in this case, I used sum up to 40 minus sum up to 20, which should give sum from 21 to 40.\n\nWait, actually, sum up to 20 is 1 to 20, so subtracting that from sum up to 40 should give sum from 21 to 40. Yes.\n\nSo, I think my approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 19270, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19270} \\]"
