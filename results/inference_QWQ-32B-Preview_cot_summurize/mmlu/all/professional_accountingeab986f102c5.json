                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving agency and competency, and I need to figure out who's liable for a contract entered into by an agent after the principal becomes incompetent. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have Frost, who is a sole proprietor, and Long, who is his purchasing agent. Long has express authority to place purchase orders with Frost's suppliers. He mostly conducts business online, so he doesn't have much direct contact with Frost.\n\nThen, Frost is declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding. After this, Long places an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf. Importantly, neither Long nor Grant knew about Frost's incompetence at the time of the transaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether Frost or Frost's legal representative will be liable to Grant for this order.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\n\nB. Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.\n\nC. No, because Grant dealt only with Long.\n\nD. No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n\nOkay, so to answer this, I need to understand how agency works, especially in situations where the principal becomes incompetent.\n\nFirst, in agency law, when a principal becomes incompetent, it generally affects the authority of the agent. Typically, if a principal becomes incompetent, the agency relationship may terminate, especially if the principal's mental capacity is such that they can no longer manage their affairs.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions and nuances. For example, if the agent was acting under a durable power of attorney or had continuing authority even in the event of the principal's incapacity, things might be different.\n\nIn this case, Long had express authority to place purchase orders. But was this authority ongoing, regardless of Frost's competency status? The problem doesn't specify whether the agency relationship was set to continue in the event of Frost's incompetence.\n\nAlso, since both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence, this might affect the situation. In contract law, dealings with an agent are generally binding on the principal, as long as the agent has actual or apparent authority.\n\nBut what happens when the principal becomes incompetent? Does the agent's authority cease immediately, or does it continue until the agent is notified of the principal's incapacity?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, the agency relationship continues until the agent has notice of the principal's incapacity. So, if Long didn't know about Frost's incompetence, he might still have authority to act on Frost's behalf.\n\nMoreover, Grant, as a third party, was unaware of Frost's incompetence and dealt with Long, who had apparent authority to enter into contracts on Frost's behalf.\n\nSo, considering these points, it seems that the contract might still be enforceable against Frost or his legal representative.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\n\nThis could be a possible answer, depending on the specific rules in this jurisdiction regarding agency and principal's incompetence.\n\nB. Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.\n\nThis seems similar to option A. The order was valid as long as Long had authority to make it, regardless of Frost's competence.\n\nC. No, because Grant dealt only with Long.\n\nThis suggests that since Grant dealt with Long directly, perhaps Frost isn't liable. But in agency law, dealings with the agent are typically attributable to the principal, as long as the agent has authority.\n\nD. No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n\nThis would be the case if Frost's incompetence automatically terminated Long's authority.\n\nGiven that both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence, and Long had express authority to place purchase orders, it seems that Long's authority might still be valid at the time of the transaction.\n\nTherefore, options A and B seem more plausible.\n\nWait a minute, but if Frost is incompetent, doesn't that mean he can't enter into contracts anymore? So, even if Long had authority, if Frost lacks capacity, perhaps the contract is voidable.\n\nBut in agency law, the agent's authority flows from the principal's capacity. If the principal lacks capacity, the agent may not have authority to bind the principal.\n\nThis complicates things. On one hand, Long had authority, and Grant was unaware of Frost's incompetence. On the other hand, Frost's incompetence might affect the validity of the contract.\n\nPerhaps the better answer is that Frost or his legal representative is not liable because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract once Frost was incompetent.\n\nBut then, if the agency relationship continues until notice of incompetence, Long might still have authority.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me consider the legal principles involved.\n\nFirst, the general rule is that the authority of an agent ceases when the principal becomes incompetent, but only if the agent knows or has notice of the principal's incapacity.\n\nIn this case, Long was unaware of Frost's incompetence, so his authority might still be intact at the time of the transaction.\n\nFurthermore, Grant, as a third party, was also unaware, so they dealt in good faith with someone they believed had authority.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that Frost or his legal representative would still be liable to Grant for the contract entered into by Long.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\n\nThis seems plausible, given that Long was unaware of Frost's incompetence.\n\nB. Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.\n\nThis might also be correct, as the order was valid due to Long's authority, despite Frost's incompetence.\n\nC. No, because Grant dealt only with Long.\n\nThis seems less likely, because in agency law, dealing with the agent is like dealing with the principal, provided the agent has authority.\n\nD. No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n\nBut given that Long was unaware of Frost's incompetence, his authority might still be valid.\n\nBetween A and B, I think A is a better answer because it specifically addresses the agency relationship surviving incompetence, which is the crux of the issue.\n\nOption B is too broad, as it says the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence, which might not fully capture the dynamics of agency and principal's capacity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
