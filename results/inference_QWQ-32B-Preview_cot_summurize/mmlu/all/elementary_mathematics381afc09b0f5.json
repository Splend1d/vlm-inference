                    "text": "So I've got this map problem here. The map uses a scale where 1 inch equals 25 miles. I need to find out how many miles are represented by 5 inches on this map. The options are A. 5, B. 25, C. 50, and D. 125. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a scale means on a map. The scale tells me that every inch on the map represents 25 miles in real life. So, if 1 inch is 25 miles, then 5 inches would be 5 times that amount, right?\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n1 inch = 25 miles\n\n5 inches = 5 \u00d7 25 miles\n\nNow, 5 times 25 is 125. So, 5 inches on the map would represent 125 miles in reality.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 125 matches my calculation. But maybe I should double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up a proportion. If 1 inch is to 25 miles, then 5 inches is to x miles. So, 1/25 = 5/x. Wait, actually, that might not be the right way to set it up. Let me think again.\n\nActually, it should be that 1 inch is to 25 miles as 5 inches is to x miles. So, the proportion is 1/25 = 5/x. But to solve for x, I can cross-multiply: 1 * x = 5 * 25, so x = 125 miles. Yeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of units. Since 1 inch represents 25 miles, then for every inch I add, I'm adding another 25 miles. So, 2 inches would be 50 miles, 3 inches would be 75 miles, and so on, up to 5 inches being 125 miles.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using ratios. The ratio of map distance to real distance is 1:25. So, if the map distance is 5 inches, the real distance would be 5 times 25, which is 125 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that the scale could be interpreted differently? Like, maybe 1 inch represents 25 miles, but perhaps it's a linear scale, and I need to consider the square of the scale or something. No, in map scales, it's typically a linear measurement unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, in this case, since it's a linear scale, 1 inch equals 25 miles, and 5 inches would simply be 5 times that, which is 125 miles.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility that the answer could be different. For example, if the map scale were nonlinear, but the problem states a straightforward scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles, so I don't think that's the case.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the map is to scale or not, but the problem says it uses a scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles, so I assume it is to scale.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The scale is given in inches and miles, and the question is asking for miles represented by inches, so units are consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any trick or misdirection in the question. The options include 5, 25, 50, and 125. 5 is the number of inches, 25 is the scale for 1 inch, 50 might be a mistake (perhaps someone thought 25 plus 25), and 125 is the correct calculation. So, likely, the answer is 125 miles.\n\nLet me try to visualize it. If 1 inch on the map is 25 miles, then 5 inches would be like having five 25-mile segments in a row, which totals 125 miles.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use dimensional analysis, I could set it up as:\n\n5 inches \u00d7 (25 miles / 1 inch) = 125 miles\n\nThe inches cancel out, leaving miles, which is what I'm looking for.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible ways to approach this problem, and each method leads me to the same conclusion that 5 inches on the map represent 125 miles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
