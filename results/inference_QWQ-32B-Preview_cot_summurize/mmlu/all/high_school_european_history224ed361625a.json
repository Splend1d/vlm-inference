                    "text": "So I've got this passage from John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and I need to figure out which political ideology he was advocating based on the options given: divine right monarchy, absolutism, constitutionalism, or socialism. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Locke is saying in this passage. He talks about power in the state of nature being aimed at preserving all of society, meaning all mankind. When this power is in the hands of magistrates or rulers, it should have the same goal: preserving the lives, liberties, and possessions of the members of society. He clearly states that this power cannot be absolute or arbitrary over people's lives and fortunes, which need to be preserved as much as possible.\n\nInstead, the power of the magistrate is to make laws and impose penalties that help preserve the whole society by removing only those parts that are corrupt and threaten the rest. He emphasizes that this power originates from compact, agreement, and the mutual consent of the people who make up the community.\n\nFurthermore, Locke says that if the legislative body transgresses this fundamental rule of society\u2014by seeking absolute power over people's lives, liberties, and estates\u2014they forfeit the power that was entrusted to them for entirely different purposes.\n\nOkay, so Locke is emphasizing that power should be used to preserve society and its members' rights, and that this power is derived from the consent of the people. He also asserts that if rulers abuse this power, they lose their right to govern.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Divine right monarchy: This is the idea that a monarch's authority is granted by God, and thus cannot be questioned by their subjects. It doesn't seem to align with Locke's emphasis on power originating from the consent of the people and the idea that rulers can forfeit their power through abuse.\n\nB. Absolutism: This refers to a form of government where the ruler has complete and total power, often without any legal or constitutional constraints. Locke explicitly rejects absolute power over people's lives and fortunes, so this doesn't fit.\n\nC. Constitutionalism: This is the idea that government should be guided by a constitution that limits its power and protects the rights of individuals. Locke's emphasis on power being derived from consent, aimed at preserving lives, liberties, and possessions, and the idea that rulers can lose their power through abuse aligns well with constitutional principles.\n\nD. Socialism: This is an economic and political system where the means of production are owned collectively, and there is often a significant role for the state in regulating the economy and society. Locke's passage doesn't discuss economic systems or collective ownership; instead, it focuses on the origin and limits of political power.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that Locke was an advocate of constitutionalism. He believed in government by consent, protection of individual rights, and the idea that rulers who abuse their power lose their authority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
