                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. Starting with Statement 1: \"The derivative of the sigmoid \u03c3(x)=(1+e^{-x})^{-1} with respect to x is equal to Var(B) where B\u223cBern(\u03c3(x)) is a Bernoulli random variable.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the sigmoid function is and its derivative. The sigmoid function is defined as \u03c3(x) = 1 / (1 + e^{-x}). I think its derivative is \u03c3'(x) = \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x)), but I should verify that.\n\nLet me compute the derivative of \u03c3(x):\n\n\u03c3(x) = (1 + e^{-x})^{-1}\n\nUsing the chain rule, \u03c3'(x) = -1 * (1 + e^{-x})^{-2} * (-e^{-x}) = (e^{-x}) / (1 + e^{-x})^2\n\nAlternatively, since \u03c3(x) = 1 / (1 + e^{-x}), maybe there's a better way to express this.\n\nWait, I recall that \u03c3(x) can also be written as \u03c3(x) = e^x / (e^x + 1). Maybe that's easier to differentiate.\n\n\u03c3(x) = e^x / (e^x + 1)\n\nUsing the quotient rule: \u03c3'(x) = [e^x (e^x + 1) - e^x * e^x] / (e^x + 1)^2 = [e^{2x} + e^x - e^{2x}] / (e^{2x} + 2e^x + 1) = e^x / (e^{2x} + 2e^x + 1)\n\nBut e^{2x} + 2e^x + 1 = (e^x + 1)^2, so \u03c3'(x) = e^x / (e^x + 1)^2\n\nHmm, this looks similar to what I had before. But is there a way to relate this to \u03c3(x)?\n\nNotice that \u03c3(x) = e^x / (e^x + 1), and 1 - \u03c3(x) = 1 - e^x / (e^x + 1) = 1 / (e^x + 1)\n\nTherefore, \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x)) = [e^x / (e^x + 1)] * [1 / (e^x + 1)] = e^x / (e^x + 1)^2\n\nWait a minute, that's exactly what I got for \u03c3'(x). So, \u03c3'(x) = \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x))\n\nAlright, so the derivative of the sigmoid function is \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x)).\n\nNow, the statement says that this derivative is equal to Var(B), where B is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter \u03c3(x).\n\nRecall that for a Bernoulli random variable B ~ Bern(p), the variance is Var(B) = p(1 - p).\n\nIn this case, p = \u03c3(x), so Var(B) = \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x))\n\nTherefore, \u03c3'(x) = Var(B)\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"Setting the bias parameters in each layer of a neural network to 0 changes the bias-variance trade-off such that the model's variance increases and the model's bias decreases.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more involved. I need to think about what biases do in a neural network and how setting them to zero affects the model's bias and variance.\n\nFirst, biases in neural networks allow the activation functions to be shifted, which can be crucial for the model's fit. Without biases, the activation functions must pass through the origin, which can limit the model's expressive power.\n\nNow, the bias-variance trade-off refers to the decomposition of the prediction error into two main components: bias and variance. Bias is the error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm, while variance is the error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set.\n\nSetting biases to zero might constrain the model, potentially making it less flexible. If the model becomes less flexible, it might have higher bias because it can't fit the data as well, and possibly lower variance because it's less sensitive to the training data.\n\nWait, but the statement says that variance increases and bias decreases when biases are set to zero. But according to my reasoning, it seems like setting biases to zero would increase bias and decrease variance.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps in some specific contexts, setting biases to zero could increase variance. For example, if the data is not centered, setting biases to zero might force the model to overfit to the mean of the data, leading to higher variance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in deep networks, biases play a role in stabilizing the learning process, and setting them to zero could lead to more unstable training, thus increasing variance.\n\nBut generally, I think setting biases to zero would reduce the model's capacity, leading to higher bias and lower variance.\n\nTherefore, I believe Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, combining both statements, the answer should be C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
