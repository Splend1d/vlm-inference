                    "text": "I've got this question here, and I need to figure out which disorder matches the description. Let's see:\n\nThe person has trouble performing a purposeful skilled movement, like opening a door with a key. But, importantly, their motor and sensory functions are intact. That means they can move and feel things normally, but they have trouble executing specific actions.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Transcortical motor aphasia\n\nI know that aphasia is related to language difficulties, particularly in speaking and understanding speech. Transcortical motor aphasia is a type where the person has impaired speech production but can still understand language. But this seems more about language than about skilled movements. So, maybe not the answer.\n\nB. Apraxia\n\nApraxia sounds familiar. I think it's about difficulties in performing learned or skilled movements, even though the person has the physical ability to make the movements. That seems to fit the description here. So, this could be the answer.\n\nC. Pure alexia\n\nAlexia is about reading difficulties. Pure alexia is when a person loses the ability to read but can still write and speak normally. This seems unrelated to performing skilled movements, so probably not the answer.\n\nD. Agraphia\n\nAgraphia is a condition where a person loses the ability to write, but they can still read and speak. Again, this seems more related to writing and less to performing physical actions like using a key to open a door.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, apraxia seems to be the disorder that matches the description. It's specifically about difficulties in executing purposeful movements despite having normal motor and sensory functions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
