                    "text": "To determine which statement is positive, we need to understand the difference between positive and normative statements in economics.\n\nPositive statements are factual statements that can be tested and verified through data and observation. They describe what is, without expressing any value judgments or opinions.\n\nNormative statements, on the other hand, are value-based statements that express opinions, preferences, or recommendations about what should be. They involve subjective judgments and cannot be proven right or wrong through empirical evidence.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"An economy that produces more butter than guns is better off than an economy that produces more guns than butter.\"\n\nThis statement is normative because it makes a value judgment about which economy is \"better off.\" The use of \"better off\" indicates a preference for one outcome over another, which is a normative stance.\n\nB. \"Nations should concentrate their resources on producing wholesome consumer goods as opposed to the weapons of war.\"\n\nThis is clearly normative. The use of \"should\" expresses a recommendation or prescription about what nations ought to do, based on the speaker's values.\n\nC. \"The production possibilities frontier is concave to the origin because of the law of increasing costs.\"\n\nThis statement is positive. It describes a relationship between the production possibilities frontier and the law of increasing costs, which is a factual statement in economic theory. It can be tested and verified through economic models and data.\n\nD. \"Nations ought to devote at least some of their resources to national defense.\"\n\nAgain, this is normative. The use of \"ought to\" indicates a moral or ethical obligation, expressing what should be done rather than what is.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. It is the only positive statement among the options provided, as it makes a factual claim about economic theory without expressing a value judgment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
