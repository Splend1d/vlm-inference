                    "text": "Let's analyze this argument step by step. The argument is:\n\n\"If the sky is blue, there won't be rain. The sky is blue today. Therefore, there won't be rain.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify what type of syllogism this is. Syllogisms can be categorical, conditional, or disjunctive. From the statements, it seems like it's dealing with conditions, so maybe it's a conditional syllogism.\n\nA conditional syllogism follows the form: If P, then Q. P. Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\nIf the sky is blue (P), then there won't be rain (Q).\n\nThe sky is blue today (P).\n\nTherefore, there won't be rain (Q).\n\nThis matches the form of a conditional syllogism.\n\nNow, I need to determine if it's formally valid or invalid.\n\nFormal validity means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nIn a conditional syllogism, the form is:\n\nIf P, then Q.\n\nP.\n\nTherefore, Q.\n\nThis is a valid form. If the premises are true, the conclusion necessarily follows.\n\nSo, in this case, if it's true that when the sky is blue, there won't be rain, and if the sky is indeed blue today, then it follows necessarily that there won't be rain.\n\nTherefore, this seems to be a formally valid conditional syllogism.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any possibility that the premises are true, but the conclusion is false?\n\nSuppose the first premise is true: if the sky is blue, there won't be rain.\n\nAnd the second premise is true: the sky is blue today.\n\nBut maybe, despite the sky being blue, there is still rain. Could that happen?\n\nIf that's possible, then the argument is invalid.\n\nBut according to the first premise, if the sky is blue, there won't be rain. So, if the sky is blue, rain should not occur.\n\nTherefore, if both premises are true, the conclusion should be true.\n\nHence, the argument is formally valid.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. It is a formally valid categorical syllogism.\n\nB. It is a formally invalid disjunctive syllogism.\n\nC. It is a formally valid conditional syllogism.\n\nD. It is a formally invalid conditional syllogism.\n\nSince it's a conditional syllogism and it's valid, the correct answer should be C.\n\nBut let's make sure that it's not a categorical syllogism.\n\nA categorical syllogism involves categorical propositions, like \"All A are B. All B are C. Therefore, all A are C.\"\n\nIn this argument, it's not in that form. It's dealing with conditions, not categories.\n\nSo, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B suggests it's an invalid disjunctive syllogism.\n\nA disjunctive syllogism is of the form: Either P or Q. Not P. Therefore, Q.\n\nThis argument doesn't match that form, so option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C is what we've determined: a formally valid conditional syllogism.\n\nOption D would be incorrect because it's not invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
