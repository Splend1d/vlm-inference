                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"The rest mass of a particle with total energy 5.0 GeV and momentum 4.9 GeV/c is approximately...\" and there are options from A to D, with different values in GeV/c\u00b2. Okay, first things first, I need to recall the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass in special relativity because this seems to be a relativistic problem.\n\nI remember that in special relativity, the total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation:\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2\n\nWhere c is the speed of light. This equation is derived from the energy-momentum relation in relativity.\n\nSo, in this problem, I'm given E = 5.0 GeV and p = 4.9 GeV/c. I need to find m, the rest mass, in units of GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I should plug in the given values into the equation:\n\n(5.0 GeV)\u00b2 = (4.9 GeV/c * c)\u00b2 + (m * c\u00b2)\u00b2\n\nWait, pc is 4.9 GeV/c * c, which simplifies to 4.9 GeV, since c/c is 1.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(5.0 GeV)\u00b2 = (4.9 GeV)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2\n\nNow, let's calculate the squares:\n\n25.00 GeV\u00b2 = 24.01 GeV\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2\n\nNow, I'll subtract 24.01 GeV\u00b2 from both sides to isolate (m c\u00b2)\u00b2:\n\n25.00 - 24.01 = 0.99 GeV\u00b2\n\nSo, (m c\u00b2)\u00b2 = 0.99 GeV\u00b2\n\nNow, to find m c\u00b2, I'll take the square root of both sides:\n\nm c\u00b2 = \u221a(0.99) GeV\n\n\u221a(0.99) is approximately 0.994987437, but since we're dealing with approximations, I can round it to about 0.995 GeV.\n\nBut the question asks for the rest mass in units of GeV/c\u00b2. Now, m c\u00b2 is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, m c\u00b2 = 0.995 GeV, so m = 0.995 GeV / c\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, m = 0.995 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nBut looking at the options, A is 0.1 GeV/c\u00b2, B is 0.2, C is 0.5, and D is 1.0. My calculation gives approximately 0.995, which is closest to 1.0.\n\nBut let's double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nE = 5.0 GeV\n\np = 4.9 GeV/c\n\nUsing E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2\n\nPlug in values:\n\n(5.0)\u00b2 = (4.9)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2\n\n25.00 = 24.01 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2\n\nSubtract 24.01 from both sides:\n\n0.99 = (m c\u00b2)\u00b2\n\nTake square root:\n\nm c\u00b2 = \u221a0.99 \u2248 0.995 GeV\n\nTherefore, m = 0.995 GeV / c\u00b2 \u2248 1.0 GeV/c\u00b2\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 1.0 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, option C is 0.5 GeV/c\u00b2. Maybe I should consider significant figures or another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula I should be using.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the formula for rest mass:\n\nm = \u221a(E\u00b2/c\u2074 - p\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nBut since energies are given in GeV and momenta in GeV/c, it's easier to use the first equation I used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the relativistic formula for momentum:\n\np = \u03b3mv\n\nWhere \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, m is rest mass, and v is velocity.\n\nBut that might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for \u03b3:\n\n\u03b3 = E / mc\u00b2\n\nAnd also, p = \u03b3mv\n\nBut again, this might not be the most straightforward approach.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct. The discrepancy might be due to rounding errors or misinterpretation of units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the units are already consistent, and I don't need to include c explicitly.\n\nIn particle physics, it's common to use units where c=1, so energies and momenta are often expressed in GeV and GeV/c, respectively.\n\nSo, in natural units where c=1, the equation simplifies to:\n\nE\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2\n\nWhere E and p are in GeV, and m is in GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo, using E=5.0 GeV and p=4.9 GeV/c,\n\nThen, 25.00 = 24.01 + m\u00b2\n\nm\u00b2 = 0.99 GeV\u00b2\n\nm = \u221a0.99 \u2248 0.995 GeV/c\u00b2, which is approximately 1.0 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 1.0 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility of error in this calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the beta (\u03b2) and gamma (\u03b3) factors.\n\nWe know that \u03b2 = v/c, and \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2)\n\nAlso, p = \u03b3m\u03b2c\n\nBut in this case, it might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the relation:\n\nm = \u221a(E\u00b2 - p\u00b2 c\u00b2)/c\u2074\n\nBut again, in natural units, it's E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2, so m\u00b2 = E\u00b2 - p\u00b2.\n\nGiven E=5.0 GeV and p=4.9 GeV/c, then m\u00b2 = 25.00 - 24.01 = 0.99 GeV\u00b2\n\nThus, m = \u221a0.99 \u2248 0.995 GeV/c\u00b2, which rounds to 1.0 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 1.0 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
