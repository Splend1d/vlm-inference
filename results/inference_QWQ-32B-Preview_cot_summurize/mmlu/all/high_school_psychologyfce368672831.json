                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about lifelong learning and ongoing professional development for school psychologists. It's important to understand that professional growth is a continuous process, especially in fields like psychology where research and best practices are constantly evolving.\n\nOption A suggests that a formal professional development plan should be made and updated annually. This sounds like a solid approach because it ensures that professionals are regularly assessing their skills and knowledge, and planning for how to improve them. Annual updates would help keep the plan relevant and aligned with current trends and needs in the field.\n\nOption B proposes rereading textbooks from graduate school annually. While reviewing foundational knowledge can be beneficial, relying solely on old textbooks might not provide the most up-to-date information. Psychology, especially as applied in schools, evolves with new research and changing educational landscapes. So, while revisiting basics can be helpful, it shouldn't be the only method of professional development.\n\nOption C suggests pursuing a degree in another field. While interdisciplinary knowledge can be valuable, this option seems a bit broad and not necessarily directly applicable to the ongoing professional development of school psychologists. It might be more about expanding one's credentials rather than continuously improving in their current role.\n\nOption D states that a graduate education program should offer adequate preparation for professional practice, so no further training will be needed. This is a bit concerning because it implies that once you've completed your graduate studies, you're set for life professionally. In reality, continuing education is crucial in psychology to stay informed about new theories, techniques, and regulations. Relying solely on graduate education could lead to obsolescence over time.\n\nConsidering these points, option A seems to be the most appropriate choice. Creating and annually updating a formal professional development plan aligns with the principles of lifelong learning and ensures that school psychologists are continuously improving their practice based on the latest evidence and their own evolving needs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
