Farms are places where animals are kept, and people often visit farms to see animals, especially if it's a petting zoo or an educational visit. Unless there's more context suggesting that the visit was unauthorized or intended to cause harm, it seems like a normal activity. So, I would say this is not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I was playing cartoon movies in front of my kids.\"\n\nAgain, watching cartoons with kids seems like a common and acceptable activity. Cartoons are designed for children, and parents often engage their kids with age-appropriate media. As long as the content is suitable for the children's age and doesn't involve any harmful or inappropriate material, this should be fine. So, this also appears to be not morally wrong.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, it seems like neither of them involves any clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
