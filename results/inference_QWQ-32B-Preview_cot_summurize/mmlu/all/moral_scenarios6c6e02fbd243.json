                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character pokes holes in all the condoms at the drugstore. Condoms are a form of contraception and protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By damaging them, the character is essentially rendering them ineffective, which could lead to unintended pregnancies and the spread of STIs. This action can be seen as harmful to others because it undermines personal health and safety decisions. Moreover, destroying store merchandise without permission is vandalism, which is illegal and generally considered morally wrong. So, in this scenario, the character does something that is clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character bites into cooked animal flesh. Eating meat is a common practice in the US, and it is generally accepted as morally neutral, assuming the meat was obtained and prepared ethically. There are debates about the ethics of factory farming and animal welfare, but simply consuming cooked animal flesh without considering its origin doesn't necessarily make the act morally wrong. It's a personal choice that varies among individuals, but it's not universally considered immoral in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 does not necessarily involve a morally wrong action.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
