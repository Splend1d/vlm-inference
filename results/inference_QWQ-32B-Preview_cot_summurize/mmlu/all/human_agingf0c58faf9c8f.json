                    "text": "Let's see. So, Bu is often late for appointments, but she justifies it by saying she had more important things on her mind. I need to figure out which coping strategy this represents among the options: immunization, accommodation, avoidance, and assimilation.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these coping strategies means.\n\nImmunization is like getting a vaccine to build resistance against something. In psychology, it might mean preparing someone to resist negative influences or persuasive messages.\n\nAccommodation is adjusting your thoughts or beliefs to fit new information. It's like changing your perspective to include new experiences.\n\nAvoidance is, well, avoiding things that are stressful or uncomfortable. It's a way to not deal with problems directly.\n\nAssimilation is incorporating new information into existing frameworks without changing those frameworks. It's like adding new pieces to an existing puzzle without altering the overall picture.\n\nNow, looking back at Bu's behavior. She's frequently late for appointments and justifies it by saying she had more important things on her mind. So, she's not directly addressing the issue of being late; instead, she's finding excuses to make herself feel better about it.\n\nThis seems like she's not confronting the problem head-on. She's perhaps trying to reduce her anxiety or guilt about being late by rationalizing her behavior.\n\nAmong the options, avoidance stands out because it involves evading or not dealing with the stressor directly. By making excuses, she's avoiding the responsibility or the need to change her behavior.\n\nImmunization doesn't seem to fit here because there's no indication that she's been prepared to resist something.\n\nAccommodation would involve adjusting her beliefs or thoughts to include new information, but again, that doesn't seem directly related to her behavior of being late and making excuses.\n\nAssimilation is about incorporating new information into existing frameworks, which also doesn't directly relate to her coping mechanism for being late.\n\nTherefore, it seems that avoidance is the most appropriate answer here. Bu is avoiding facing the issue of her chronic lateness by coming up with justifications.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps she believes that the things on her mind are genuinely more important, and that's why she's late. In that case, she might be assimilating this belief into her behavior, thinking that her lateness is acceptable because of the priority of other tasks.\n\nHowever, even in that scenario, she's still not addressing the impact of her lateness on others or considering the need to manage her time better. So, it still seems like a form of avoidance.\n\nAlternatively, if she were accommodating, she might adjust her schedule or priorities to be more punctual, but that's not happening here.\n\nImmunization doesn't seem to apply because there's no evidence of her being prepared to handle criticism or negative feedback about her lateness.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think avoidance is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
