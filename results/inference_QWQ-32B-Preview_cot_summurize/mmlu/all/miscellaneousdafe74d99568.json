                    "text": "So when Corporation X pays out $300,000 in salaries, we need to figure out what happens to the company's assets and liabilities. Let's think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what salaries are in accounting terms. Salaries are essentially expenses for the company because they pay money to their employees for their work. So, when the company pays out salaries, it's incurring an expense.\n\nNow, in accounting, expenses increase on the debit side. So, the salary expense account would be debited by $300,000. That means salary expense is increased by $300,000.\n\nNext, the company is paying out this money, which means it's giving away cash. Cash is an asset, and when the company gives away cash, its cash balance decreases. So, the cash account would be credited by $300,000, reducing the cash asset by $300,000.\n\nWait a minute, I need to make sure I have this right. Debits and credits can be a bit confusing. In accounting, for expenses, debits increase the expense, and for assets, debits decrease the asset. Conversely, credits decrease expenses and increase assets.\n\nActually, that's not entirely accurate. Let me recall: for expenses, debits increase them, and credits decrease them. For assets, debits increase them, and credits decrease them. So, in this case, debiting salary expense increases it by $300,000, and crediting cash decreases it by $300,000.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the journal entry would be:\n\nDebit: Salary Expense $300,000\n\nCredit: Cash $300,000\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is increased by $300,000\n\nB. Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is decreased by $300,000\n\nC. Salary expense is decreased by $300,000; cash is increased by $300,000\n\nD. Salary expense is decreased by $300,000; cash is decreased by $300,000\n\nBased on what I just figured out, option B seems correct: salary expense increases by $300,000, and cash decreases by $300,000.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where paying salaries could increase cash? That doesn't make sense intuitively because paying out salaries should reduce the company's cash holdings since it's paying money to employees.\n\nOption A suggests that cash increases, which contradicts what I think should happen. Option C says salary expense decreases and cash increases, which doesn't make sense. Option D says both decrease, but only cash should decrease when paying salaries; salary expense increases.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other aspect to this. Maybe if the salaries were accrued beforehand, but the question says \"pays out\" salaries, so it's the actual payment being made.\n\nIn accrual accounting, if salaries were accrued, there would be a liability called salaries payable. When the company pays the salaries, it would debit salaries payable and credit cash. But in that case, liabilities decrease because salaries payable is reduced.\n\nBut in this question, it's about the impact on assets and liabilities, and the options only mention salary expense and cash. So, perhaps it's focusing on the direct impact on these accounts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the salary expense is already recorded, and now the company is paying it, which affects cash and liabilities.\n\nWait, let's think about the accrual process.\n\nIf the company has already recorded the salary expense when the employees earned it, then at that time, salary expense increased, and salaries payable (a liability) increased.\n\nNow, when the company pays the salaries, it's fulfilling that liability, so salaries payable decreases, and cash decreases.\n\nBut in this question, it just says \"pays out $300,000 in salaries,\" without specifying whether it was accrued or not.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll assume that the salary expense has already been recorded, and now the company is paying the accrued salaries.\n\nSo, in that case, paying the salaries would involve:\n\nDebit: Salaries Payable $300,000\n\nCredit: Cash $300,000\n\nThis would decrease the liability (salaries payable) and decrease cash (an asset).\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them mention salaries payable. They only mention salary expense and cash.\n\nSo, perhaps the question is considering the initial recording of the salary expense and the simultaneous payment.\n\nIn that case, it might be recorded as:\n\nDebit: Salary Expense $300,000\n\nCredit: Cash $300,000\n\nWhich aligns with option B.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a cash basis accounting, where expenses are recorded when paid, then paying salaries would directly increase the expense and decrease cash.\n\nBut typically, corporations use accrual accounting, but perhaps it's not specified here.\n\nGiven that, I think option B is still the correct answer: salary expense increases by $300,000, and cash decreases by $300,000.\n\nI don't see any impact on other liabilities mentioned in the options, so I'll stick with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
