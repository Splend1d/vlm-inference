This doctrine ensures consistency and predictability in the law. \n\nTo elaborate a bit more on the other options:\n\nA. Nolo contendere - This is a plea where the defendant neither admits nor denies guilt but agrees to accept punishment for a crime. It's often translated as \"no contest.\"\n\nC. Substantial performance - This term is used in contract law to describe a party's performance that is sufficient to entitle them to payment, even if it doesn't fully comply with every term of the contract.\n\nD. Commercial impracticability - This is a doctrine that may excuse a party from performing their contractual obligations when performance becomes extremely difficult or costly due to unforeseen circumstances, making it unfair to require strict adherence to the contract terms.\n\nSo, in the context of adherence to precedent, stare decisis is the most appropriate term."
