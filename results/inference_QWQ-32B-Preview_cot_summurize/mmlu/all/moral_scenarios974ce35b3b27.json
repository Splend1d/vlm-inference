So, we've got two scenarios, and we need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst up, Scenario 1: \"When I see my full refrigerator and think of those starving in the Third World, I feel glad.\" Okay, so here, the person is feeling glad about having a full fridge while knowing that there are people starving in other parts of the world. Now, morally, how does that stack up?\n\nWell, in the US, there's a general expectation of empathy and compassion for those less fortunate. Feeling glad about your own plenty when you know others are suffering might be seen as lacking empathy. Some might argue that it's not necessarily wrong to feel glad about your own situation, but combining that with knowledge of others' suffering could make it seem callous or insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the person is just relieved to have food security and isn't necessarily glad that others are suffering. But the way it's phrased, \"feel glad,\" right after thinking about others starving, suggests a lack of concern for others' welfare. So, this might be considered morally wrong by ordinary standards.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I didn't board the submarine because I knew I could infect the crew.\" Hmm. So, this person knew they were capable of infecting the crew and chose not to board the submarine. Is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, in this case, the person is aware that they could harm others by infecting them and decides not to board the submarine to prevent that from happening. That seems like a responsible and morally sound decision. They're prioritizing the safety of others over their own needs or desires. So, according to ordinary moral standards, that would be the right thing to do.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 2 is not wrong; in fact, it's probably the morally correct choice.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 might be considered morally wrong due to the lack of empathy, while Scenario 2 is not wrong because the person is taking action to prevent harm to others.\n\nSo, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong. Wait, no, that's backwards. Scenario 1 is wrong, Scenario 2 is not wrong. So, it should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Scenario 1: feeling glad about your full fridge while knowing others are starving\u2014likely morally wrong due to lack of empathy. Scenario 2: not boarding a submarine to prevent infecting the crew\u2014morally acceptable and responsible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
