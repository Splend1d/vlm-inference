So, put together, it should mean \"Great Hero.\" But I'm not entirely sure about the other options. Maybe I should double-check. Option B is \"Master,\" which could make sense in some contexts, but I think \"Great Hero\" is more accurate for Mahavira, who was a spiritual teacher in Jainism. Option C, \"The Lesser One,\" doesn't sound right because \"Maha\" means great, not lesser. And option D, \"Mendicant,\" refers to someone who begs for a living, which might be part of Mahavira's lifestyle, but I don't think it's the direct translation of his name. So, I'll go with A. \"Great Hero.\""
