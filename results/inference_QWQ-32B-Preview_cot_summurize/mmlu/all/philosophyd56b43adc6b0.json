The options are:\n\nA. can be precisely compared.\n\nB. can be compared, but only roughly.\n\nC. can be compared within individuals, but not between individuals.\n\nD. cannot be compared either within individuals or between individuals.\n\nI need to recall what Parfit says about this in his work. I think it's in \"Reasons and Persons,\" but I'm not entirely sure. I remember that Parfit discusses the comparability of welfare, including pains and pleasures, in the context of ethical theory.\n\nLet me think about this. Parfit is known for discussing personal identity and the rationality of caring about future experiences. In that context, he must have talked about how to compare different pains and pleasures.\n\nI think Parfit argues that while we can compare pains and pleasures, such comparisons are not precise. He might suggest that we can say one pain is worse than another or that one pleasure is greater than another, but these comparisons are approximate rather than exact.\n\nSo, option B seems plausible: \"can be compared, but only roughly.\"\n\nBut maybe he differentiates between comparisons within the same individual and comparisons between different individuals. Perhaps he thinks that comparisons within an individual are more reliable or possible to a greater degree than comparisons between individuals.\n\nIf that's the case, then option C might be more accurate: \"can be compared within individuals, but not between individuals.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe Parfit is more skeptical and thinks that pains cannot be compared at all, either within or between individuals. That would point to option D: \"cannot be compared either within individuals or between individuals.\"\n\nWait, but that seems too strong. If pains cannot be compared at all, then it would be difficult to make any judgments about which situations are better or worse in terms of welfare.\n\nAlternatively, option A says pains can be precisely compared, which seems too optimistic. In reality, pains are subjective experiences, and precise comparisons might not be feasible.\n\nI need to recall Parfit's actual position. I think he acknowledges that while pains and pleasures are subjective, we can still make rough comparisons both within and between individuals.\n\nHe might argue that even if different people experience pains differently, we can still make general judgments about which pains are worse than others, based on factors like duration, intensity, and so on.\n\nMoreover, in the context of ethical theory, especially when discussing impersonal ethics and the total view, Parfit likely assumes that pains and pleasures are comparable across individuals, even if not with perfect precision.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most fitting: pains can be compared, but only roughly.\n\nOption C might be too restrictive, as it limits comparability to within individuals, whereas Parfit probably thinks that comparability, though rough, extends between individuals as well.\n\nOption D is too skeptical, given that it\u5426\u8ba4 any comparability at all.\n\nOption A is too confident in the precision of such comparisons, which seems unrealistic given the subjective nature of pain.\n\nHence, I think the correct answer is B: pains can be compared, but only roughly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
