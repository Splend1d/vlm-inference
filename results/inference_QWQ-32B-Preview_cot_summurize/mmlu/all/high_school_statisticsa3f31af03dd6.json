The correlation coefficient, denoted as \\( r \\), measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, while the coefficient of determination, \\( r^2 \\), represents the proportion of the variance in one variable that is predictable from the other variable.\n\nGiven that, the percentage of variation in \\( y \\) explained by the variation in \\( x \\) is given by \\( r^2 \\times 100\\% \\).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the coefficient of determination for both correlation coefficients:\n\n1. For \\( r = 0.6 \\):\n\n\\[ r^2 = (0.6)^2 = 0.36 \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of variation explained is:\n\n\\[ 0.36 \\times 100\\% = 36\\% \\]\n\n2. For \\( r = 0.3 \\):\n\n\\[ r^2 = (0.3)^2 = 0.09 \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of variation explained is:\n\n\\[ 0.09 \\times 100\\% = 9\\% \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many times the percentage indicated by \\( r = 0.6 \\) is compared to that indicated by \\( r = 0.3 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{36\\%}{9\\%} = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of variation in \\( y \\) explained by the variation in \\( x \\) for a correlation of 0.6 is 4 times that for a correlation of 0.3.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
