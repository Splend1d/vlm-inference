                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a relationship between pencils and pens, and we're given the cost of some pens. We need to find the cost of one pencil in cents.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's given:\n\n1. Eleven pencils cost as much as three pens.\n\n2. Seven pens cost \\$9.24.\n\nWe need to find the cost of one pencil in cents.\n\nOkay, so let's start by finding the cost of one pen. If seven pens cost \\$9.24, then one pen costs \\$9.24 divided by 7.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\$9.24 \u00f7 7 = \\$1.32\n\nSo, one pen costs \\$1.32.\n\nNow, according to the first statement, eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. So, the cost of eleven pencils is equal to the cost of three pens.\n\nWe already know the cost of one pen is \\$1.32, so the cost of three pens is 3 \u00d7 \\$1.32.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n3 \u00d7 \\$1.32 = \\$3.96\n\nSo, eleven pencils cost \\$3.96.\n\nNow, to find the cost of one pencil, we divide \\$3.96 by 11.\n\n\\$3.96 \u00f7 11 = \\$0.36\n\nTherefore, one pencil costs \\$0.36.\n\nBut the question asks for the cost in cents. Since \\$1 is equal to 100 cents, \\$0.36 is equal to 36 cents.\n\nSo, the cost of one pencil is 36 cents.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 11\n\nB. 33\n\nC. 36\n\nD. 52\n\nThe correct answer is C. 36.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, seven pens cost \\$9.24. So, one pen costs \\$9.24 \u00f7 7 = \\$1.32.\n\nThen, three pens cost 3 \u00d7 \\$1.32 = \\$3.96.\n\nEleven pencils cost \\$3.96, so one pencil costs \\$3.96 \u00f7 11 = \\$0.36, which is 36 cents.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me try to set up some equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the cost of one pencil as p and the cost of one pen as q.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n11p = 3q  (since eleven pencils cost as much as three pens)\n\nAnd we're given that 7q = \\$9.24\n\nFirst, solve for q:\n\nq = \\$9.24 \u00f7 7 = \\$1.32\n\nNow, plug this value back into the first equation:\n\n11p = 3 \u00d7 \\$1.32\n\n11p = \\$3.96\n\nNow, solve for p:\n\np = \\$3.96 \u00f7 11 = \\$0.36\n\nWhich is 36 cents.\n\nSo, again, we get the same answer.\n\nI think 36 cents is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nIs there any possibility that the relationship between pencils and pens is different? For example, maybe the cost is per unit, or perhaps there's a discount for buying in bulk. But the problem doesn't suggest any of that. It seems straightforward.\n\nAlso, the problem gives the cost of seven pens in dollars and asks for the cost of one pencil in cents. So, making sure to convert the units correctly is important.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the cost per pen and then find the equivalent cost for pencils.\n\nWe have 7 pens = \\$9.24\n\nSo, pens cost \\$9.24 / 7 = \\$1.32 each.\n\nNow, 3 pens cost 3 \u00d7 \\$1.32 = \\$3.96\n\nThis is equal to the cost of 11 pencils.\n\nTherefore, 11 pencils cost \\$3.96\n\nSo, one pencil costs \\$3.96 / 11 = \\$0.36\n\nWhich is 36 cents.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to find the cost per pencil directly, we can set up a proportion.\n\nThe ratio of pencils to pens is 11:3\n\nSo, the cost ratio should be 3:11\n\nGiven that 7 pens cost \\$9.24, we can find the cost per pen and then find the cost per pencil using the ratio.\n\nBut that seems more complicated than necessary.\n\nI think the straightforward approach is best here.\n\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is 36 cents.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
