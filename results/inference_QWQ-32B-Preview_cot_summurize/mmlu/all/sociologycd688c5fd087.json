                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about what Warner and Myrdal said regarding why black former slaves weren't joining the 'ethnic melting pot' in North American cities. So, I need to recall their perspectives on this issue.\n\nFirst off, I know that the 'melting pot' idea suggests that different ethnic groups blend together to form a new, unified culture. But in this case, it's about why black former slaves weren't participating in that blending in Northern cities.\n\nOption A says that the white population didn't believe in liberty, equality, and democracy. Well, that might be partially true, but I think there's more to it. Racism and discrimination were certainly issues, but I recall that Warner and Myrdal had specific reasons for why blacks weren't integrating into the melting pot.\n\nOption B suggests that black former slaves wanted to retain a strong sense of their original ethnic identity. That makes sense. After being enslaved and losing connections to their heritage, it's possible that they were eager to preserve what ethnic identity they had.\n\nOption C says they weren't prepared to leave the Southern states and move to North America. Wait, but the question mentions North American cities, which I assume includes both the North and the South. But perhaps it's specifically about moving to the North. Still, I don't recall this being the main reason according to Warner and Myrdal.\n\nOption D talks about the promise of citizenship being contradicted by continued discrimination. That seems very plausible. Even if legally freed and granted citizenship, ongoing discrimination could prevent true integration.\n\nNow, I need to remember which of these options aligns most closely with Warner and Myrdal's views.\n\nAlvin W. Gouldner wrote about this in his work, discussing Gunnar Myrdal's perspective. Myrdal was a Swedish sociologist who wrote \"An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy\" in the 1940s. In this work, Myrdal analyzed the treatment of African Americans in the United States and the contradictions between American values and the reality of racism.\n\nMyrdal believed that the lack of integration wasn't just because of white resistance but also because of the self-segregation tendencies among African Americans. He argued that African Americans were forming their own communities as a way to protect themselves from discrimination and to preserve their cultural identity.\n\nSo, considering this, option B seems relevant because it mentions retaining a strong sense of their original ethnic identity. However, Myrdal also noted that discrimination and segregation policies forced African Americans into separate communities, which might align more with option D, where the promise of citizenship is contradicted by continued discrimination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a combination of both B and D. But since I have to choose one, I need to decide which one is more central to Warner and Myrdal's arguments.\n\nLet me think about Melvin L. Oliver's work as well. He has written extensively on racial inequality and the dynamics of race in America. In his books, such as \"Black Wealth/White Wealth,\" he discusses how structural inequalities prevent African Americans from fully integrating economically and socially.\n\nGiven that, option D seems compelling because it highlights the contradiction between the ideals of citizenship and the reality of discrimination, which would hinder integration.\n\nBut going back to Myrdal, he did emphasize the importance of African Americans maintaining their own institutions and identities as a form of resistance and self-preservation. So, option B also has merit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should consider the context in which Warner and Myrdal were writing. If they were observing that African Americans weren't assimilating into the broader white culture, it could be because they were choosing to retain their ethnic identity or because they were being excluded despite wanting to integrate.\n\nI think Myrdal argued that it was a bit of both: African Americans faced so much discrimination that they had to develop their own parallel institutions, but also, there was a desire to hold onto their cultural heritage.\n\nGiven that, option D seems more comprehensive because it includes the idea of continued discrimination contradicting the promise of citizenship, which would encompass both the forced separation and the choice to maintain ethnic identity.\n\nMoreover, the term 'ethnic melting pot' suggests assimilation into a dominant culture, which in this case was white, Anglo-Saxon culture. If African Americans were facing discrimination, it would make it difficult for them to fully assimilate, thus preventing them from joining the melting pot.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: the promise of citizenship was contradicted by continued discrimination.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's quickly dismiss options A, B, and C.\n\nOption A says that the white population did not believe in liberty, equality, and democracy. While racism certainly existed and many whites may not have fully embraced equality for African Americans, this option seems too broad and doesn't specifically address why blacks weren't joining the melting pot.\n\nOption B suggests that black former slaves wanted to retain their ethnic identity. While this is true and was certainly a factor, it might not fully capture the complexity of the situation, which also included forced segregation and discrimination.\n\nOption C says they weren't prepared to leave the Southern states and move to North America. This seems less relevant because the question is about why they weren't joining the melting pot in North American cities, implying that they had already moved there.\n\nTherefore, option D appears to be the most accurate reflection of Warner and Myrdal's claims.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
