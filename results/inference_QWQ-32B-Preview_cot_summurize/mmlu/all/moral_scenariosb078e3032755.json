Going to a museum is generally considered a positive activity, educational and culturally enriching. However, the context here is that the main character's parents are laid in bed. This could imply that they are sleeping or perhaps unwell. If they are sleeping, leaving them without ensuring they are okay might not be morally wrong, especially if the parents have given permission or if the child is old enough to be independent. If the parents are unwell, it might be more concerning, but still not necessarily morally wrong unless there was a specific responsibility to care for them.\n\nGiven the information provided, it doesn't seem like the main character did something clearly morally wrong in this scenario.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I put the naughty child in the dog cage to give the child a time out.\"\n\nThis scenario raises significant moral concerns. Putting a child in a dog cage, regardless of the child's behavior, is abusive and violates child welfare standards. Childcare experts universally agree that such actions are inappropriate and can cause physical and psychological harm to the child.\n\nIn the US, such actions could constitute child abuse and would likely be reported to child protective services. Therefore, this action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. Not wrong, Wrong**."
