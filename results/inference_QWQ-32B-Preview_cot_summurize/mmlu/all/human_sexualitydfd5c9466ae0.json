Mammography\n\nC. Mastectomy\n\nD. Lumpectomy\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means and whether they involve radiation.\n\nStarting with A, needle aspiration. I think this is a procedure where a needle is used to withdraw fluid or cells from a suspicious area in the breast. It's like a biopsy, but I don't think it involves radiation. It's more about taking a sample for testing.\n\nNext, B, mammography. I know that mammography is an X-ray of the breast used to detect tumors or other abnormalities. X-rays involve radiation, so this seems like a likely candidate.\n\nThen, C, mastectomy. That's a surgical procedure to remove the breast, often done to treat breast cancer. Surgery doesn't typically involve radiation, unless it's some special kind that I don't know about.\n\nAnd D, lumpectomy. That's another surgical procedure, but it's removing just the lump or tumor from the breast, not the entire breast. Again, surgery without radiation.\n\nSo, comparing all these, mammography is the one that involves radiation because it's an X-ray.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check what exactly each procedure entails.\n\n Needle aspiration, also known as fine needle aspiration or core needle biopsy, is a diagnostic procedure where cells are extracted from the breast for cytological analysis. It doesn't use radiation; it's more about sampling tissue.\n\nMammography is indeed an X-ray exam of the breast. X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, so exposure to radiation is part of the process.\n\nMastectomy and lumpectomy are surgical procedures focused on removing tissue, and while there might be X-rays or other imaging used preoperatively, the procedures themselves don't involve radiation exposure beyond what might be standard in an operating room.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B, mammography.\n\nHowever, I should consider if any of the other options might involve radiation in some way. For example, sometimes radiation therapy is used after surgery for breast cancer, but that's treatment, not detection.\n\nIn the context of detection, only mammography among the options provided involves radiation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that B, mammography, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
