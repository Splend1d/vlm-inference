                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what happens to blood glucose levels during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise. The options are:\n\nA. frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM.\n\nB. remains relatively unchanged.\n\nC. frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM.\n\nD. falls to hypoglycaemic levels.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how exercise affects blood glucose. I know that during exercise, the body uses glucose for energy, especially during high-intensity workouts. So, you'd think that blood glucose levels would decrease because the body is using it up.\n\nBut, I also remember that during intense exercise, hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline are released, which can increase blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis in the liver. Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen to glucose.\n\nSo, there are two opposing effects here: the body is using glucose for energy, which would lower blood glucose, but at the same time, hormone responses are increasing glucose release from liver glycogen.\n\nFor short-duration, high-intensity exercises, like sprints, the increase in glucose release might outweigh the usage, leading to an increase in blood glucose levels. But for longer durations, like 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise, I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should look at some research or recall specific studies on this topic.\n\nI recall that in prolonged exercise, even if it's intermittent high intensity, the overall glucose utilization increases, and if the exercise duration is long enough, blood glucose levels can decrease, potentially leading to hypoglycemia in some cases.\n\nBut hypoglycemia is a drop below normal levels, usually considered below 3.9 mM. So, option D suggests that it falls to hypoglycaemic levels, which might not always be the case, especially if the individual has adequate glycogen stores or is consuming carbohydrates during exercise.\n\nOption C says frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM. That seems plausible because during exercise, glucose is being used, and over 80-90 minutes, especially with high intensity, the levels could drop by that amount.\n\nOption A suggests that it frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM. While there might be an initial increase due to hormone-stimulated glucose release, sustained high-intensity exercise would likely lead to a net decrease over time.\n\nOption B says it remains relatively unchanged. That might be the case for shorter durations or lower intensities, but for 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise, I doubt it.\n\nLet me consider the type of exercise. Intermittent high-intensity exercise could involve periods of intense activity followed by rest or lower intensity. During the intense periods, there's a high demand for glucose, and during the rest periods, the demand decreases.\n\nPerhaps during the intense bouts, blood glucose increases due to hormone release, and during the rest periods, it decreases as glucose is used. Over time, the net effect might be a decrease.\n\nAlso, the duration of 80-90 minutes is long enough that liver glycogen stores could become depleted in some individuals, leading to a greater drop in blood glucose.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is C. frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM.\n\nOption D might be possible in some cases, but \"frequently\" falls to hypoglycaemic levels seems too strong of a statement. Not everyone will reach hypoglycaemia after 80-90 minutes of exercise, especially if they've eaten recently or are consuming carbs during exercise.\n\nSo, I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
