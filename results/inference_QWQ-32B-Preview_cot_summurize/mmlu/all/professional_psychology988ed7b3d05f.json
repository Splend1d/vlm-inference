Withdrawal of the more disturbed parent\n\nB. Degree of continued conflict between the parents after the divorce\n\nC. Residence of the child with the preferred parent\n\nD. Degree of hostility during the divorce process\n\nI need to think about which one of these has the most significant impact on a child's well-being in the two years following a divorce.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: withdrawal of the more disturbed parent. If one parent is disturbed, maybe their withdrawal could be beneficial for the child's adjustment. But, on the other hand, if the child is attached to that parent, withdrawal might cause additional stress. It's a bit unclear.\n\nOption B: degree of continued conflict between the parents after the divorce. This seems important because ongoing conflict can create a stressful environment for the child, even after the divorce is finalized. If parents are still fighting, it can affect the child's emotional state and adjustment.\n\nOption C: residence of the child with the preferred parent. This might be important, but it assumes that the preferred parent is better suited for the child's needs, which isn't always the case. Also, preference might be subjective and vary from child to child.\n\nOption D: degree of hostility during the divorce process. This is also significant because a hostile divorce can be very stressful for the child. However, the question specifies the two years following the divorce, so maybe the ongoing conflict after divorce is more relevant to the child's adjustment during that period.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Research has shown that children fare better when there is less conflict between their parents, both during and after the divorce. So, perhaps option B is the best predictor.\n\nAlso, considering that the post-divorce period is when new routines and arrangements are being established, ongoing conflict between parents can disrupt these routines and cause uncertainty for the child.\n\nIn contrast, the withdrawal of a disturbed parent might sometimes be beneficial if that parent was a source of stress, but it could also be harmful if the child misses that parent.\n\nAs for the residence with the preferred parent, it might provide some stability, but if the relationship with that parent is strained or if there is still conflict, it may not be the most predictive factor.\n\nThe degree of hostility during the divorce process is important, but since the question is about the two years following the divorce, perhaps the ongoing conflict is more relevant to the child's adjustment during that specific period.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: the degree of continued conflict between the parents after the divorce.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
