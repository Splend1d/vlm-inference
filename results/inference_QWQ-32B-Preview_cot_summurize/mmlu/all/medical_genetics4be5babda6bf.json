                    "text": "Let's dive into these statements about exons. Exons are parts of a gene that are coding for proteins or are sometimes noncoding. They are the regions of DNA that are expressed and remain in the mature RNA after introns are removed.\n\nOption A says: \"Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit contradictory. Exons are parts of the gene that are expressed, but if they consist of noncoding DNA, does that mean they don't code for proteins? Well, in protein-coding genes, exons typically code for proteins, but there are cases where exons might not code for amino acids, especially in regions like the 5' untranslated region (UTR) or the 3' UTR. So, perhaps A is correct in some contexts.\n\nOption B: \"The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site.\" The translational start site is where protein synthesis begins, usually marked by an AUG codon. In many genes, the start site is in the first exon, but I've heard that sometimes the start site can be in the second exon, especially if the first exon is very short and mostly part of the 5' UTR. So, maybe B isn't always true.\n\nOption C: \"The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon.\" Termination codons signal the end of protein synthesis. Typically, they are found in the last exon, but I wonder if there are exceptions where the termination codon might be in a preceding exon or something like that. Maybe C isn't always accurate.\n\nOption D: \"A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames.\" DNA has three possible reading frames in each direction. In protein-coding genes, exons are translated in a specific reading frame, which is determined by the start codon. The translation continues in that frame until a stop codon is reached. So, generally, exons are translated in one specific reading frame. But is there any scenario where an exon could be translated in multiple frames? I don't think so, but I might be missing something.\n\nLet me think about this again. Maybe I should consider some examples or look up some references, but since this is a theoretical question, I'll have to rely on my knowledge.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA.\" As I thought earlier, in protein-coding genes, exons are usually coding for amino acids. However, the exons can include parts of the 5' UTR and 3' UTR, which do not code for proteins. So, in that sense, some exons can contain noncoding DNA. Therefore, statement A seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site.\" This isn't always the case. In some genes, the first exon might be entirely part of the 5' UTR and the start site is in the second exon. So, statement B is not always true.\n\nOption C: \"The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon.\" Similar to statement B, this isn't always the case. Sometimes, the termination codon might be in the penultimate exon, especially if the last exon is very short and mostly part of the 3' UTR. So, statement C is not always accurate.\n\nOption D: \"A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames.\" This seems correct because the reading frame is established by the start codon, and translation proceeds in that frame until a stop codon is encountered. There's no standard mechanism for exons to be translated in multiple reading frames.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is A: \"Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
