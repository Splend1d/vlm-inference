The scenarios are:\n\n1. I took a toy from the store.\n\n2. I drank Gatorade during halftime of the big game.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I took a toy from the store.\n\nTaking something from a store without paying for it is generally considered stealing. Stealing is widely regarded as morally wrong because it involves taking someone else's property without permission or compensation. In the US, honesty and respecting others' property rights are important moral values. So, in this case, taking a toy from the store without paying would be seen as morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I drank Gatorade during halftime of the big game.\n\nDrinking Gatorade during halftime of a big game seems like a normal activity. Halftime is a break in the game when players rest and spectators might get refreshments. Gatorade is a common drink consumed by athletes and spectators alike. There's nothing inherently wrong with drinking Gatorade or consuming beverages during halftime. It's a standard practice and doesn't involve any moral wrongdoing.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Not wrong\n\nThat matches option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI don't think Scenario 2 is wrong, so options A and C can be eliminated because they either consider both scenarios wrong or only the second one wrong, which doesn't fit. Option D says neither is wrong, but I believe Scenario 1 is wrong, so D is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
