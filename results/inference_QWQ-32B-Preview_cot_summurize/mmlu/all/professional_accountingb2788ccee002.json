                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about AMT tax preference items for someone named West. He's single, no dependents, and doesn't itemize. He has some income from long-term capital gains, percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis, and dividends from publicly-held companies. The amounts are $15,000 for long-term capital gains, $9,000 for excess percentage depletion, and $10,000 for dividends. I need to figure out the total amount of his AMT tax preference items from these sources.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what AMT tax preference items are. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a parallel tax system designed to ensure that taxpayers pay a minimum amount of tax, even if they have deductions and preferences that would otherwise lower their regular tax liability. Preference items are certain types of income or deductions that are added back to the regular taxable income to calculate the AMT taxable income.\n\nSo, for West's case, I need to identify which of his incomes are considered preference items for AMT purposes.\n\nLet's look at each type of income he has:\n\n1. **Long-term capital gains**: Normally, long-term capital gains are taxed at preferential rates under the regular tax system. However, for AMT purposes, they are treated as ordinary income. So, long-term capital gains are not considered preference items; they are just included in AMT taxable income at their full amount.\n\n2. **Percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis**: Depletion is a deduction for the extraction of natural resources. Percentage depletion allows a deduction based on a percentage of gross income from the property, up to the property's adjusted basis. If the depletion claimed exceeds the adjusted basis, that excess is a preference item for AMT purposes.\n\n3. **Dividends from publicly-held companies**: Qualified dividends are taxed at preferential rates under the regular tax system, similar to long-term capital gains. For AMT purposes, qualified dividends are treated as ordinary income. So, like long-term capital gains, they are not preference items but are included in AMT taxable income at ordinary income rates.\n\nGiven this, only the excess percentage depletion is a preference item in this list.\n\nSo, the amount of West's AMT tax preference items is $9,000, which is the excess percentage depletion.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there are any other preference items here that I might have missed.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Long-term capital gains: Not a preference item for AMT; they're just included in AMT income at ordinary rates.\n\n- Excess percentage depletion: Yes, this is a preference item.\n\n- Dividends: Similar to capital gains, they're included in AMT income at ordinary rates, not as preference items.\n\nTherefore, the total AMT tax preference items are indeed $9,000.\n\nBut the question is multiple-choice, and option A is $9,000, which seems to match my conclusion.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other aspect or if perhaps some of these items are partially preference items.\n\nAlso, I should recall that there are several types of preference items under AMT, such as miscellaneous itemized deductions, personal exemptions, certain deductions for state and local taxes, etc. But since West doesn't itemize, many of those won't apply to him.\n\nMoreover, the problem specifies that he has \"percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis,\" which is clearly a preference item.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the only preference item is the $9,000 of excess percentage depletion.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. $9,000.\n\nBut let's consider why the other options might be higher.\n\nOption B is $19,000, which is $9,000 plus $10,000. Maybe someone might think that dividends are a preference item, but they're not; they're just included in AMT income at ordinary rates.\n\nOption C is $24,000, which is $9,000 plus $15,000. Perhaps if someone\u8bef\u4ee5\u4e3a long-term capital gains are a preference item, but again, they're not; they're included at ordinary rates.\n\nOption D is $34,000, which is the total of all three amounts: $15,000 + $9,000 + $10,000. This would be incorrect because only the excess depletion is a preference item.\n\nHence, the correct answer is A. $9,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
