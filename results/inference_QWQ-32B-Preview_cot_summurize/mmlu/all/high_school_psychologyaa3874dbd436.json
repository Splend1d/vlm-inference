                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option would help me detect a gas leak in my car quickly. Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A is \"olfactory receptors.\" I know that olfactory receptors are in our nose and they help us smell things. Gas leaks often have a distinctive smell, like rotten eggs, especially in the case of natural gas. So, if there's a gas leak, I might smell something unusual. That seems like it could be important for detecting a gas leak.\n\nOption B is \"gustatory receptors.\" I think gustatory receptors are related to taste. They're in our tongue and help us taste different flavors. But taste doesn't really help with detecting gas leaks, right? I don't think you can taste gas, at least not in a way that would help you detect a leak. So, this one probably isn't the answer.\n\nOption C is \"feature detectors.\" I'm not entirely sure what feature detectors are. I think in the context of vision, feature detectors are neurons that respond to specific features of a visual scene, like edges or movements. But gas leaks are more about smell, which is related to olfaction. So, unless feature detectors are involved in smell, this might not be the correct choice.\n\nOption D is \"basilar membrane.\" I recall that the basilar membrane is part of the inner ear and is important for hearing. It helps in sound detection and processing. But again, gas leaks are detected through smell, not sound. So, the basilar membrane probably isn't relevant here.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems like olfactory receptors are the most directly involved in detecting a gas leak, since gas leaks often have a smell that we can detect. The other options seem unrelated to smell detection.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check if gas leaks always have a smell. I know that natural gas is often odorized with a chemical called mercaptan, which gives it that characteristic rotten egg smell. But what about other types of gas leaks, like gasoline leaks in a car? Does gasoline have a smell?\n\nYes, gasoline has a distinct smell that most people can recognize. So, even if it's not natural gas, other types of gas leaks would still have an odor that could be detected by olfactory receptors.\n\nFeature detectors might be more relevant in visual or auditory systems, but less so in olfaction. And the basilar membrane is definitely more related to hearing.\n\nGustatory receptors are for taste, which isn't really relevant for detecting gas leaks.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is A, olfactory receptors, because they allow us to smell the gas and thus quickly alert us to a leak in the car.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
