                    "text": "To determine the budgeted cash disbursements for June purchases, we need to understand the relationship between the cost of goods sold, merchandise inventory, and accounts payable.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for cost of goods sold (COGS):\n\nCOGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for Purchases:\n\nPurchases = COGS + Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory\n\nGiven the data:\n\n- COGS = $300,000\n\n- Beginning Inventory (June 1) = $150,000\n\n- Ending Inventory (June 30) = $180,000\n\nPlugging in these values:\n\nPurchases = $300,000 + $180,000 - $150,000 = $330,000\n\nSo, the total purchases for June are $330,000.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much of these purchases will be paid for in cash during June. This involves looking at the accounts payable balances.\n\nAccounts payable represents the amount owed to suppliers for merchandise purchased on credit.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Accounts payable, June 1: $85,000\n\n- Accounts payable, June 30: $75,000\n\nThe change in accounts payable during June is:\n\nChange in AP = AP June 30 - AP June 1 = $75,000 - $85,000 = -$10,000\n\nA negative change indicates that the company paid down its accounts payable by $10,000 during June.\n\nNow, the cash disbursements for purchases can be calculated by considering the purchases made during the month and the change in accounts payable.\n\nThe relationship is:\n\nCash Disbursements = Purchases - Increase in AP or + Decrease in AP\n\nSince there was a decrease in AP of $10,000, we add this to the purchases to find the cash disbursements.\n\nCash Disbursements = $330,000 + ($-10,000) = $330,000 - $10,000 = $320,000\n\nTherefore, the amount Star should budget for cash disbursements for June purchases is $320,000.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. $320,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
