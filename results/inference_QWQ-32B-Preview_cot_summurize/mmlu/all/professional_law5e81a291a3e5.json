                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which purchaser should get the property in this situation. It seems like there's a dispute between two buyers, and we need to see who has the better claim in a race-notice jurisdiction.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a race-notice jurisdiction is. In such a jurisdiction, to have a valid claim to the property, a purchaser must:\n\n1. Take the property without notice of any prior claims.\n\n2. Record their deed first.\n\nSo, the key elements are lack of notice and recording first.\n\nNow, let's look at the facts:\n\n- The original owner sold the property to the first purchaser, but the first purchaser didn't record the deed. However, she moved in and paid the property taxes.\n\n- Five years later, the original owner tried to sell the property again to the second purchaser.\n\n- The second purchaser did a title search, which showed that the original owner still held title, but the tax lien certificate indicated that someone else had been paying the taxes for the past few years.\n\n- The second purchaser didn't investigate further and went ahead with the purchase, recording his deed first.\n\n- The first purchaser found out later, recorded her deed three months after the second purchaser, and filed a quiet title action.\n\nOkay, so the first purchaser was in possession and had been paying taxes, but didn't record the deed. The second purchaser bought from the original owner, did a title search that showed the original owner as the titled owner, but also saw that someone else had been paying taxes.\n\nNow, in a race-notice jurisdiction, the second purchaser would generally prevail if he took without notice of the prior claim and recorded first.\n\nBut here, the second purchaser saw that someone else had been paying the taxes for several years, as indicated by the tax lien certificate. Does this constitute notice of a prior claim?\n\nWell, paying taxes doesn't necessarily mean that someone has a claim to the property. Taxes can be paid by various parties for different reasons. However, in this case, the first purchaser paid the taxes, which might suggest that she had an interest in the property.\n\nBut, the second purchaser didn't investigate further. He just saw the tax payments and proceeded with the purchase.\n\nNow, in terms of notice, there's a distinction between actual notice and constructive notice.\n\nActual notice would be if the second purchaser had direct knowledge of the first purchaser's claim.\n\nConstructive notice is when the purchaser should have known about a prior claim based on information that's publicly available.\n\nIn this case, the tax lien certificate showed someone else paying the taxes, which might put the second purchaser on inquiry notice, meaning he should have investigated further.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, mere payment of taxes doesn't constitute constructive notice of a prior claim. Possession of the property might be a different matter.\n\nBut in this scenario, the second purchaser didn't check who was in possession of the property. He only did a title search and got a tax lien certificate.\n\nNow, open possession by the first purchaser might be considered constructive notice of her claim.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if a purchaser has knowledge that someone is in open possession of the property, that could be constructive notice of a prior claim.\n\nBut in this case, the second purchaser didn't check who was in possession.\n\nSo, did he have constructive notice?\n\nIt's possible that a court might find that he should have known about the first purchaser's possession, especially since the first purchaser had been paying taxes and was living there.\n\nBut, in race-notice jurisdictions, the focus is on recording first and having no notice of prior claims.\n\nGiven that the second purchaser recorded first and perhaps didn't have actual notice of the first purchaser's claim, he might prevail.\n\nHowever, option A suggests that the second purchaser had constructive notice from the title search, which triggered a duty to further investigate.\n\nOption B says the second purchaser prevails because he recorded first.\n\nOption C suggests that the first purchaser prevails because she paid taxes, and the tax lien certificate is treated like a recorded deed.\n\nOption D says the second purchaser wins because the first purchaser had to record within five years.\n\nHmm.\n\nIn race-notice jurisdictions, recording is crucial, and having no notice of prior claims is also important.\n\nGiven that, option B seems plausible\u2014second purchaser recorded first and perhaps had no actual notice of the first purchaser's claim.\n\nBut option A argues that the second purchaser had constructive notice from the title search, which should have led him to investigate further, thus he shouldn't prevail.\n\nOption C is unlikely because paying taxes doesn't necessarily confer title, and a tax lien certificate isn't the same as a recorded deed.\n\nOption D doesn't make much sense because there's no general rule that a deed must be recorded within five years to be valid in a race-notice jurisdiction.\n\nSo, between A and B, it's a bit tricky.\n\nIf the court finds that the second purchaser had constructive notice from the tax payments, then he shouldn't prevail.\n\nBut if the court finds that he had no notice and recorded first, then he should prevail.\n\nGiven that the first purchaser was in open possession and had been paying taxes, it's possible that a court would find that the second purchaser should have known about the prior claim and thus didn't take without notice.\n\nTherefore, option A might be the correct answer.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this jurisdiction, recording is the determinative factor, and since the second purchaser recorded first, he prevails.\n\nBut the fact that the first purchaser was in open possession and had been paying taxes complicates things.\n\nMaybe the answer is B\u2014second purchaser prevails because he recorded first.\n\nBut I need to consider the notice aspect more carefully.\n\nIn race-notice jurisdictions, if a subsequent purchaser records first and had no notice of prior claims, they generally prevail.\n\nBut if they had constructive notice, then they might not.\n\nSo, did the second purchaser have constructive notice?\n\nHe saw that someone else had been paying the taxes, which might suggest that there was someone else involved with the property.\n\nPerhaps this should have put him on inquiry notice, meaning he should have investigated further to see why someone else was paying the taxes.\n\nIf he had done so, he might have discovered the first purchaser's possession and claim.\n\nTherefore, arguably, he had constructive notice, and thus, the first purchaser should prevail.\n\nSo, option A seems plausible.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the payment of taxes isn't sufficient to constitute constructive notice of a prior claim.\n\nPerhaps, only recording a deed or having open possession would constitute constructive notice.\n\nIn that case, since the first purchaser didn't record her deed, the second purchaser might not have notice, and thus, he prevails by recording first.\n\nThis would align with option B.\n\nI think the key here is to understand what constitutes constructive notice in this jurisdiction.\n\nIf open possession constitutes constructive notice, then the second purchaser should have known about the first purchaser's claim and thus doesn't prevail.\n\nBut if only recorded deeds constitute constructive notice, then since the first purchaser didn't record, the second purchaser had no notice and thus prevails by recording first.\n\nGiven that, I'm inclined to think that option B is correct\u2014the second purchaser prevails because he recorded first and had no notice of the prior claim.\n\nHowever, the presence of the tax payments complicates things, suggesting that perhaps there was constructive notice.\n\nBut, generally, payment of taxes might not be sufficient to constitute constructive notice of a prior claim.\n\nPossession might be more indicative.\n\nIf the second purchaser had knowledge that someone was in possession, that could be constructive notice.\n\nBut in this case, he didn't check who was in possession.\n\nSo, perhaps he didn't have notice, and thus, he prevails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court would find that he should have known about the possession and thus had constructive notice.\n\nThis is a bit tricky.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. First purchaser wins because the second had constructive notice from the title search.\n\nB. Second purchaser prevails because he recorded first.\n\nC. First purchaser prevails because she paid taxes, and the tax lien certificate was treated like a recorded deed.\n\nD. Second purchaser wins because the first had to record within five years.\n\nI think C and D are less likely.\n\nOption C is incorrect because paying taxes doesn't confer title, and a tax lien certificate isn't equivalent to a recorded deed.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there's no general requirement to record within five years in race-notice jurisdictions.\n\nBetween A and B, I'm leaning towards B\u2014second purchaser prevails because he recorded first and had no notice.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident.\n\nPerhaps the answer is A\u2014first purchaser wins because the second had constructive notice from the title search.\n\nThis seems plausible because the tax payments should have put the second purchaser on inquiry notice, leading him to discover the first purchaser's possession and claim.\n\nTherefore, he had constructive notice and shouldn't prevail.\n\nSo, option A might be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
