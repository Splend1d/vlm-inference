                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an investment that's growing over time. The investment starts at $4000, and it grows at a rate of 320 times e to the power of 0.08t dollars per year, where t is the number of years. I need to find out its value after 10 years and choose the correct approximation from the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being described here. The problem gives me the rate of growth of the investment, which is dV/dt = 320*e^(0.08t), where V is the value of the investment at time t. To find the value of the investment at any time t, I need to integrate this rate with respect to t.\n\nSo, V(t) = \u222b(320*e^(0.08t)) dt\n\nI know that the integral of e^(kt) is (1/k)e^(kt), so applying that here:\n\nV(t) = 320 * (1/0.08) * e^(0.08t) + C\n\nSimplifying that:\n\nV(t) = 4000 * e^(0.08t) + C\n\nNow, I need to find the constant C. I know that at t=0, the investment is worth $4000, so:\n\nV(0) = 4000 * e^(0) + C = 4000 * 1 + C = 4000 + C\n\nBut V(0) should be $4000, so:\n\n4000 + C = 4000 => C = 0\n\nTherefore, the value of the investment at any time t is:\n\nV(t) = 4000 * e^(0.08t)\n\nNow, I need to find V(10):\n\nV(10) = 4000 * e^(0.08*10) = 4000 * e^0.8\n\nI know that e^0.8 is approximately 2.22554, so:\n\nV(10) \u2248 4000 * 2.22554 = 8902.16\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $4,902\nB. $8,902\nC. $7,122\nD. $12,902\n\nIt seems like B. $8,902 is the closest to my calculation. However, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I integrated the rate of growth to find the value function. The rate is dV/dt = 320*e^(0.08t). When I integrate that, I get V(t) = 320/(0.08) * e^(0.08t) + C, which simplifies to 4000*e^(0.08t) + C. Then, using the initial condition V(0) = 4000, I found C=0. So V(t) = 4000*e^(0.08t).\n\nEvaluating at t=10, V(10) = 4000*e^0.8. Using e^0.8 \u2248 2.22554, V(10) \u2248 8902.16, which rounds to $8,902.\n\nWait a minute, but option B is $8,902, which matches my calculation, but the other options seem plausible too, so I need to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is interpreted differently. Maybe the rate is not dV/dt but something else. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"An investment of $4000 grows at the rate of 320*e^(0.08t) dollars per year after t years.\"\n\nThis sounds like dV/dt = 320*e^(0.08t). Yes, that's how I interpreted it initially.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's meant to be V(t) = 4000 + \u222b(320*e^(0.08t)) dt from 0 to t.\n\nWait, actually, that's what I did effectively, since V(t) = V(0) + \u222b(dV/dt) dt from 0 to t.\n\nSo V(t) = 4000 + \u222b(320*e^(0.08t)) dt from 0 to t.\n\nEvaluating that integral:\n\n\u222b(320*e^(0.08t)) dt from 0 to t = 320/(0.08) * (e^(0.08t) - e^(0)) = 4000*(e^(0.08t) - 1)\n\nTherefore, V(t) = 4000 + 4000*(e^(0.08t) - 1) = 4000*e^(0.08t)\n\nSo again, V(10) = 4000*e^(0.8) \u2248 4000*2.22554 = 8902.16\n\nThis confirms my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the investment starts at $4000 and grows by an additional 320*e^(0.08t) each year, but that would involve a different approach.\n\nWait, if it's growing at a rate of 320*e^(0.08t) per year, that should be the derivative of the value function, so my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider it as a differential equation: dV/dt = 320*e^(0.08t), with V(0) = 4000.\n\nSolving this differential equation by integration gives the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the value after 10 years is approximately $8,902, which corresponds to option B.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's another interpretation that could lead to a different answer.\n\nSuppose the growth rate is 320*e^(0.08t) dollars per year, and the initial investment is $4000. Maybe the total value is the initial investment plus the accumulated growth over 10 years.\n\nIn that case, V(t) = 4000 + \u222b(320*e^(0.08t)) dt from 0 to 10.\n\nEvaluating the integral:\n\n\u222b(320*e^(0.08t)) dt from 0 to 10 = 320/(0.08) * (e^(0.8) - e^(0)) = 4000*(e^(0.8) - 1)\n\nTherefore, V(10) = 4000 + 4000*(e^(0.8) - 1) = 4000*e^(0.8) \u2248 4000*2.22554 = 8902.16\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is stating that the investment grows by 320*e^(0.08t) each year, and I need to sum up these annual growths over 10 years.\n\nBut that would involve discretizing time, which doesn't seem appropriate here since the growth is described continuously over time.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach seems correct, and the answer should be B. $8,902.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider if the problem could be interpreted as compound interest or something similar.\n\nIn compound interest, the value is given by V(t) = P*(1 + r/n)^(n*t), where P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of compounding periods per year, and t is the time in years.\n\nBut in this problem, the growth rate is given as a function of time, not as a fixed interest rate, so the standard compound interest formula doesn't directly apply.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the rate is meant to be dV/dt = k*V, which would lead to exponential growth V(t) = V(0)*e^(kt). But in this problem, dV/dt = 320*e^(0.08t), which is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and it should be dV/dt = k*V, leading to exponential growth.\n\nBut as per the given information, dV/dt = 320*e^(0.08t), so integrating that gives the value function as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation of the integral.\n\nLet me re-evaluate the integral: \u222b(320*e^(0.08t)) dt.\n\nUsing the integral formula \u222be^(kt) dt = (1/k)e^(kt) + C, so:\n\n\u222b(320*e^(0.08t)) dt = 320*(1/0.08)*e^(0.08t) + C = 4000*e^(0.08t) + C\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, applying the initial condition V(0) = 4000:\n\n4000 = 4000*e^(0) + C = 4000*1 + C => C = 0\n\nSo V(t) = 4000*e^(0.08t)\n\nTherefore, V(10) = 4000*e^(0.8)\n\nCalculating e^(0.8):\n\ne^(0.8) \u2248 2.22554\n\nSo V(10) \u2248 4000*2.22554 = 8902.16\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar, it's $8,902, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different method, like numerical integration or something else, but given the context, the analytical approach seems appropriate.\n\nAnother consideration: maybe the \"rate\" is meant to be the interest rate, and the growth is exponential based on that rate.\n\nBut the problem specifies that the growth rate is 320*e^(0.08t) dollars per year, which seems to be a direct expression of dV/dt.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach is correct, and the answer is B. $8,902.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\$8,902} \\]"
