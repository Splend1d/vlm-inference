The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nThe views expressed in this journal passage are best seen as evidence of which of the following concerning medieval Islamic societies?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see. This passage is from Ibn Battuta, a famous traveler from the medieval period, around the 14th century. He's describing his visit to 'Aden, which is a port in Yemen. So, he's giving us insights into what life was like there, the geography, the economy, and the people.\n\nFirst, he mentions that 'Aden is surrounded by mountains and can only be approached from one side. It doesn't have crops, trees, or water, except for reservoirs that collect rainwater. That sounds pretty harsh. He also says that Arabs sometimes cut off the inhabitants' water supply until they pay with money and cloth. So, there's some conflict or leverage being exerted over water resources.\n\nThen, he notes that it's a very hot place and an important port for Indians. Large vessels come from places like Cambay, Quilon, Calicut, and other Malabar ports in India. There are Indian and Egyptian merchants living there, and some of these merchants are extremely wealthy, so wealthy that a single merchant can own a large ship and its contents. That suggests a significant level of commerce and wealth in this port city.\n\nDespite their wealth, Ibn Battuta describes the merchants as pious, humble, upright, and generous. They treat strangers well, give to devotees, and pay full tithes to God. So, there's a strong emphasis on religious piety and good character among these wealthy merchants.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the best evidence this passage provides regarding medieval Islamic societies. The options are:\n\nA. The absence of religious orthodoxy\n\nB. Hostility toward outsiders\n\nC. Limited economic opportunities\n\nD. The supremacy of piety\n\nLet's evaluate each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The absence of religious orthodoxy. The passage mentions that the merchants are pious and pay full tithes to God, which suggests a strong religious orthodoxy, not its absence. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nOption B: Hostility toward outsiders. Ibn Battuta himself is an outsider, a traveler, and he mentions that the merchants treat strangers well. So, this doesn't align with the information provided.\n\nOption C: Limited economic opportunities. The passage describes 'Aden as a bustling port with wealthy merchants owning large ships and engaging in trade with India and other regions. This suggests robust economic opportunities, not limited ones.\n\nOption D: The supremacy of piety. The description of the merchants as pious, humble, upright, and generous, even while being extremely wealthy, suggests that piety is held in high regard and perhaps is supreme in their society.\n\nGiven these points, option D seems to be the best fit. The passage highlights the importance of piety among the wealthy merchants, indicating that even with their wealth, they maintain religious devotion and charitable practices.\n\nSo, the answer is D. The supremacy of piety.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
