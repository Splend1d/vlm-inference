                    "text": "Let's see. Imprinting is a type of learning that occurs at a particular life stage and is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior. It's often associated with attachment behaviors in animals, especially in birds.\n\nOption A: A mother eagle flying under her young while they're learning to fly. This seems more like parental guidance or protection rather than imprinting. Imprinting is about forming a rapid social attachment to a parent or parent figure.\n\nOption B: A newborn gosling attaching to the first moving object it sees, usually its mother. This sounds a lot like imprinting. In species like geese and ducks, imprinting is well-documented, where the young quickly become attached to a moving object, typically their mother, which helps them learn and stay safe.\n\nOption C: An infant left by primary caregivers for significant periods develops indifference to their presence. This seems more related to attachment theory in humans, particularly insecure attachment styles. It's not exactly imprinting, which is more about rapid attachment to a specific individual.\n\nOption D: A mother cat teaching her kittens how to clean themselves. This seems more like observational learning or social learning, where kittens learn behaviors by watching their mother. Imprinting is more about forming an attachment rather than learning specific behaviors.\n\nSo, between these options, B seems to be the classic example of imprinting, where a young animal quickly attaches to a parent figure upon hatching or birth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
