The options are:\n\nA. brain injury\n\nB. serial position effect\n\nC. leading questions\n\nD. proactive interference\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a constructed memory is. From what I know, a constructed memory is when someone recalls an event that didn't actually happen, or remembers it differently from how it really was. It's like their memory is built or constructed from pieces that might not be entirely accurate.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Brain injury: This could definitely affect memory. Brain injuries can lead to memory loss or alter how memories are formed and recalled. But is it most likely to lead to constructed memories? Maybe. People with brain injuries might fill in gaps in their memory with fabricated details, especially if they have amnesia or other memory impairments.\n\nB. Serial position effect: This is a phenomenon where people remember the first and last items in a series better than the middle ones. It's about recall order and doesn't directly relate to constructing false memories. So, probably not the answer.\n\nC. Leading questions: These are questions that suggest a particular answer or contain information that might influence the person's recall. For example, asking \"Didn't you see the red car?\" instead of \"What color was the car?\" can lead someone to recall seeing a red car even if they didn't. This seems closely related to constructing memories because it can plant suggestions in a person's mind that they might incorporate into their recollection.\n\nD. Proactive interference: This is when older memories interfere with the formation of new memories. For example, trying to remember a new phone number but being distracted by your old phone number. It's more about interference with memory formation rather than constructing false memories.\n\nComparing these options, leading questions seem most directly related to constructing memories because they can implant suggestions that people incorporate into their recall, even if those details aren't accurate. Brain injury can certainly lead to memory construction, but leading questions are more specifically designed to influence memory recall.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. leading questions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
