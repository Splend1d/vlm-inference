Both are chosen at random, and I need to find the probability that their product, A times B, is positive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ranges:\n\n- For A: -3 \u2264 A \u2264 1\n\n- For B: -2 \u2264 B \u2264 4\n\nSince both A and B are real numbers, we're dealing with continuous uniform distributions over their respective intervals.\n\nThe product A*B is positive in two cases:\n\n1. Both A and B are positive.\n\n2. Both A and B are negative.\n\nSo, I need to find the probabilities of these two scenarios and then add them together.\n\nLet's first identify the positive and negative parts of each range.\n\nFor A:\n\n- Positive: 0 < A \u2264 1\n\n- Negative: -3 \u2264 A < 0\n\nFor B:\n\n- Positive: 0 < B \u2264 4\n\n- Negative: -2 \u2264 B < 0\n\nNow, since A and B are chosen independently, the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nFirst, find the probabilities for A and B being positive and negative.\n\nFor A:\n\n- Total range: 1 - (-3) = 4\n\n- Positive part: 1 - 0 = 1\n\n- Negative part: 0 - (-3) = 3\n\nSo,\n\n- P(A > 0) = 1/4\n\n- P(A < 0) = 3/4\n\nFor B:\n\n- Total range: 4 - (-2) = 6\n\n- Positive part: 4 - 0 = 4\n\n- Negative part: 0 - (-2) = 2\n\nSo,\n\n- P(B > 0) = 4/6 = 2/3\n\n- P(B < 0) = 2/6 = 1/3\n\nNow, the probability that both A and B are positive:\n\nP(A > 0 and B > 0) = P(A > 0) * P(B > 0) = (1/4) * (2/3) = 2/12 = 1/6\n\nThe probability that both A and B are negative:\n\nP(A < 0 and B < 0) = P(A < 0) * P(B < 0) = (3/4) * (1/3) = 3/12 = 1/4\n\nNow, add these two probabilities to get the total probability that A*B is positive:\n\nP(A*B > 0) = P(A > 0 and B > 0) + P(A < 0 and B < 0) = 1/6 + 1/4\n\nTo add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12:\n\n1/6 = 2/12\n\n1/4 = 3/12\n\nSo, P(A*B > 0) = 2/12 + 3/12 = 5/12\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5/12.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5/12\n\nB. 5/11\n\nC. 7/12\n\nD. 5/17\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 5/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{12}} \\]"
