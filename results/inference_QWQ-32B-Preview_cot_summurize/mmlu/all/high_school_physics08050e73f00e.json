                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about ionized isotopes being projected into a magnetic field, and I need to figure out which one will have the largest circular path radius. All of them are projected with the same speed, and their initial velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field. Okay, let's start by understanding what's going on here.\n\nFirst, when a charged particle moves in a magnetic field, and its velocity is perpendicular to the field, it experiences a force called the Lorentz force. This force is given by F = qvB, where q is the charge, v is the velocity, and B is the magnetic field strength. This force is always perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field, which means it causes the particle to move in a circular path.\n\nThe radius of this circular path can be found by equating the Lorentz force to the centripetal force required for circular motion. The centripetal force is given by mv\u00b2/r, where m is the mass, v is the velocity, and r is the radius. So, setting F = mv\u00b2/r, we get:\n\nqvB = mv\u00b2/r\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = mv / (qB)\n\nOkay, so the radius is directly proportional to the momentum (mv) and inversely proportional to the charge times the magnetic field strength. Since the speed v and the magnetic field B are the same for all isotopes in this problem, the radius depends on the mass and the charge.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. m = 16 u, q = \u20135 e\n\nB. m = 17 u, q = \u20134 e\n\nC. m = 18 u, q = \u20133 e\n\nD. m = 20 u, q = \u20131 e\n\nI need to find which combination of m and q gives the largest r. From the formula r = mv / (qB), since v and B are constant, r is proportional to m / |q|. So, I need to find the option with the largest m / |q| ratio.\n\nLet's calculate m / |q| for each option:\n\nA. 16 u / 5 e = 3.2 u/e\n\nB. 17 u / 4 e = 4.25 u/e\n\nC. 18 u / 3 e = 6 u/e\n\nD. 20 u / 1 e = 20 u/e\n\nWait a minute, option D has a much larger m / |q| ratio compared to the others. So, according to this, option D should have the largest radius.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The formula is r = mv / (qB), and since v and B are the same for all, it's indeed m / |q| that determines the radius.\n\nOption A: 16 / 5 = 3.2\n\nOption B: 17 / 4 = 4.25\n\nOption C: 18 / 3 = 6\n\nOption D: 20 / 1 = 20\n\nYes, option D has the largest ratio by far. So, the isotope with m = 20 u and q = -1 e will have the largest circular path radius.\n\nI think that makes sense because for a given speed and magnetic field, a larger mass with a smaller charge will have a larger radius since the force is proportional to the charge, and the inertia is proportional to the mass.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider the signs of the charges. In the formula, we use |q| because the magnetic force depends on the magnitude of the charge, regardless of its sign. The sign only determines the direction of the force, not the magnitude, so it doesn't affect the radius.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
