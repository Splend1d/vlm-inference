                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the city of Ghana in the 11th century, based on the description from Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri's \"The Book of Routes and Realms.\" The question is: \"What is the most likely explanation for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury?\" And we have four options to consider.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context here. The passage describes a city where there are both Muslims and pagans living together. There are twelve mosques, salaried religious officials, and scholars, which suggests a significant Muslim presence. However, the king and the majority of the population seem to practice paganism, as they worship idols and have pagan religious practices.\n\nDespite this, the king's interpreters, treasury official, and many of his ministers are Muslims. That's interesting\u2014why would a pagan king have Muslims in such important positions?\n\nOption A suggests that a Muslim was in charge of the treasury to facilitate trade with predominantly Muslim merchants during that era. Given that the passage mentions trade activities, such as the taxation on goods like salt, copper, and other commodities, this seems plausible. If the kingdom was engaged in trade with Muslim merchants, having a Muslim in charge of the treasury could help smooth over any religious or cultural differences, making trade more efficient.\n\nOption B proposes that the king of Ghana had recently become a Muslim. However, the passage clearly states that the king and his people practice paganism, so this seems unlikely.\n\nOption C suggests that merchants and trade were taboo in the traditional pagan religion. But the passage mentions that the king levies taxes on trade goods, which implies that trade is happening and is important to the kingdom. It doesn't indicate that trade is taboo; rather, it's a source of revenue.\n\nOption D claims that African kings were merely vassals of the Muslim caliphs. The passage doesn't suggest any political subservience to a caliphate; instead, it portrays the king of Ghana as an independent ruler with his own kingdom and practices.\n\nGiven these considerations, Option A seems the most reasonable explanation. The presence of Muslims in key positions like the treasury likely facilitated trade with Muslim merchants, which was economically beneficial for the kingdom. The fact that the king allows Muslims to practice their religion and hold important offices suggests a degree of religious tolerance and a recognition of the value that Muslims bring to the kingdom, particularly in terms of trade and commerce.\n\nAdditionally, the passage mentions that beyond Ghana lies another country called Malal, whose king was \"sincerely attached to Islam,\" while his subjects remained polytheists. This indicates that Islam was present in the region and had some influence, even if not universally adopted.\n\nIn conclusion, the most likely reason for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury is to facilitate trade with predominantly Muslim merchants during that era, making Option A the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
