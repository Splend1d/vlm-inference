                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about John Stuart Mill and the harm principle. The question is: \"Mill defends the harm principle on the basis of which moral theory?\" And the options are A. Kantian moral theory, B. Utilitarianism, C. The ethics of prima facie duty, and D. Social contract theory.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the harm principle is. I think it's from Mill's book \"On Liberty,\" where he argues that the only reason society should interfere with an individual's actions is to prevent harm to others. So, the harm principle is about limiting individual freedom only to prevent harm to others.\n\nNow, I need to think about which moral theory Mill uses to defend this principle. I know that Mill was a utilitarian, so maybe it's B. Utilitarianism. But let me make sure.\n\nUtilitarianism is a consequentialist theory that says actions are right if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. So, does Mill defend the harm principle using this idea?\n\nI recall that in \"On Liberty,\" Mill does talk about utility, but in a specific way. He distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures and emphasizes individual liberty. So, perhaps his version of utilitarianism is different from classical utilitarianism.\n\nLet me consider option A, Kantian moral theory. Immanuel Kant's moral theory is based on duty and universal maxims, like the categorical imperative. Mill was critical of Kant's deontological approach, so it's unlikely that he defends the harm principle on Kantian grounds.\n\nOption C, the ethics of prima facie duty, is associated with W.D. Ross, who came later than Mill. So, it's probably not that.\n\nOption D, social contract theory, is about moral principles arising from agreements in society. While Mill may have some elements of social contract in his thinking, his main defense of liberty seems to be based on consequences.\n\nGoing back to utilitarianism, I remember that Mill argues that individual liberty contributes to the overall happiness of society. So, by allowing individuals to act freely, as long as they don't harm others, society as a whole benefits.\n\nMoreover, in \"On Liberty,\" Mill discusses the three reasons for interfering with individual liberty: self-protection, protection from harm by others, and the harm principle itself. He argues that only the harm to others justifies interference, as it maximizes utility.\n\nAlso, Mill provides several arguments for the harm principle, including the importance of individuality, the development of human faculties, and the idea that individuals know their own good better than others.\n\nBut fundamentally, his justification seems to rest on the utilitarian idea that maximizing individual liberty leads to the greatest happiness.\n\nLet me see if there's any evidence that Mill drew from other moral theories. For instance, did he incorporate elements of social contract theory?\n\nWell, in \"On Liberty,\" Mill does discuss the limits of authority that can be legitimately exercised over individuals, which sounds a bit like social contract ideas. However, his primary justification seems to be consequentialist, focusing on the benefits of liberty.\n\nAdditionally, Mill was influenced by his father, James Mill, and by Bentham, both of whom were utilitarians. So, it's consistent that he would base his arguments on utilitarian principles.\n\nFurthermore, in \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill's other major work, he defends utilitarianism as the main moral theory. So, it's likely that he applies utilitarianism in \"On Liberty\" as well.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider whether Mill might have drawn from social contract ideas or Kantian deontology in defending the harm principle.\n\nRegarding social contract theory, while Mill may have been influenced by it, his explicit arguments in \"On Liberty\" seem to be based on utilitarian consequences rather than on contractual agreements.\n\nAs for Kantian moral theory, Mill was actually critical of Kant's approach. In \"Utilitarianism,\" he critiques Kant's categorical imperative and argues against deontological ethics. Therefore, it's unlikely that he defends the harm principle using Kantian theory.\n\nOption C, the ethics of prima facie duty, is associated with W.D. Ross, who developed a form of deontology that includes multiple duties that may conflict. Since Ross came after Mill, it's not plausible that Mill based his harm principle on Ross's theory.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer is B. Utilitarianism.\n\nTo double-check, I can look back at some key quotes from \"On Liberty.\" For example, Mill says, \"Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\" But he also says, \"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\"\n\nHe justifies this by arguing that individual liberty maximizes utility in the long run. He believes that allowing people to pursue their own good in their own way leads to overall happiness and progress.\n\nMoreover, Mill discusses cases where intervention might seem justifiable but argues that, in most cases, individual liberty should prevail because it promotes general welfare.\n\nTherefore, it's clear that Mill is defending the harm principle on utilitarian grounds, aiming to maximize happiness and well-being through the promotion of individual liberty.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Utilitarianism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
