                    "text": "So I have this question here about a ball being thrown downward, and I need to figure out its acceleration immediately after leaving my hand, assuming there's no air resistance. The options are 9.8 m/s\u00b2, more than that, less than that, or that I can't say without knowing the speed of the throw.\n\nFirst, I know that when you drop a ball from rest, it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s\u00b2 because of gravity. That's the acceleration due to gravity on Earth. So, in the case of just dropping it, the acceleration is solely due to gravity.\n\nNow, if I throw the ball downward, I'm applying an initial velocity to it, but once it's in the air and assuming there's no air resistance, the only force acting on it is gravity. So, the acceleration should still be due to gravity alone.\n\nI think the key here is understanding that acceleration is caused by forces, and in this scenario, the only force is gravity, regardless of whether I throw it or drop it. So, the acceleration should be the same, which is 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, when I throw the ball downward, I'm giving it an initial velocity, but acceleration is about how the velocity changes over time. Since gravity is the only force acting after it leaves my hand, it should still accelerate at 9.8 m/s\u00b2 downward.\n\nI don't think the initial speed matters for the acceleration; acceleration is constant in this case, right? So, the answer should be A. 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other force that might be acting on it. If there's no air resistance, then no, only gravity is acting on it.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll think about what happens if I throw it upward. At the highest point, its velocity is zero, but its acceleration is still 9.8 m/s\u00b2 downward. So, acceleration doesn't depend on the direction of velocity; it's always due to gravity.\n\nTherefore, whether I throw it up, down, or sideways, as long as there's no air resistance, the acceleration is always 9.8 m/s\u00b2 downward.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
