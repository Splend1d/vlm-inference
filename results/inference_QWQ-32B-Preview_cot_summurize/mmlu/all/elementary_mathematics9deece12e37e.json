                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about golf balls and their costs at a practice range. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nIt says that a bucket of 40 golf balls costs $4.00. And I need to find out how much a bucket of 100 golf balls would cost at the same rate.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand the rate at which the golf balls are being sold. It's $4.00 for 40 balls. I think I should find out the cost per golf ball and then use that to find the cost for 100 balls.\n\nSo, to find the cost per golf ball, I'll divide the total cost by the number of balls in the bucket.\n\nCost per ball = Total cost / Number of balls\n\nSo, Cost per ball = $4.00 / 40 balls\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n$4.00 divided by 40 is $0.10 per ball.\n\nAlright, so each golf ball costs $0.10.\n\nNow, to find out the cost for 100 golf balls, I'll multiply the cost per ball by 100.\n\nTotal cost for 100 balls = Cost per ball \u00d7 100\n\nSo, Total cost = $0.10 \u00d7 100\n\nThat would be $10.00.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is $10.00, B is $10.50, C is $13.50, and D is $16.00.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the answer should be A. $10.00.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, $4.00 for 40 balls means $0.10 per ball.\n\nThen, 100 balls at $0.10 each would be $10.00.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf 40 balls cost $4.00, then 100 balls would cost X.\n\nSo, I can set up a proportion:\n\n40 balls / $4.00 = 100 balls / X\n\nThen, cross-multiplying, 40X = 100 \u00d7 $4.00\n\nSo, 40X = $400.00\n\nThen, X = $400.00 / 40\n\nX = $10.00\n\nAgain, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nI don't see any errors in this approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how many times 40 goes into 100 and multiply the cost accordingly.\n\n100 divided by 40 is 2.5.\n\nSo, 100 balls are 2.5 times 40 balls.\n\nTherefore, the cost would be 2.5 times $4.00.\n\n2.5 \u00d7 $4.00 = $10.00\n\nOnce more, I get $10.00.\n\nIt seems consistent across different methods.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here or additional factors to consider.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. $10.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
