                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about alcoholic drinks and knockout drugs. It's asking which one refers to a drink that's been spiked with a drug to knock someone out. The options are: Zombie, Kamikaze, Mickey Finn, and Molotov cocktail.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with \"Zombie.\" I know that in pop culture, zombies are undead creatures, but in the context of drinks, I think there's a cocktail called a Zombie. I believe it's a strong drink made with multiple kinds of rum and other ingredients. But I don't think it specifically refers to a drink spiked with a drug.\n\nNext, \"Kamikaze.\" Again, I know that Kamikaze refers to Japanese suicide pilots in World War II, but there's also a cocktail by that name. I think it's a mix of vodka, triple sec, and orange juice. It's pretty strong, but I don't recall it being associated with spiked drinks or knockout drugs.\n\nNow, \"Mickey Finn.\" This one sounds familiar. I think Mickey Finn is specifically associated with a drink that's been spiked to knock someone out. I recall reading about it in old detective stories or something like that. It seems plausible.\n\nLastly, \"Molotov cocktail.\" That's a completely different thing, right? A Molotov cocktail is a improvised incendiary device, like a bottle filled with gasoline and a rag wad, used to start fires. It has nothing to do with drinks or drugs.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like \"Mickey Finn\" is the term that refers to an alcoholic drink laced with a knockout drug.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nI recall that in older literature and movies, a \"Mickey Finn\" was a drink that had been spiked with a sedative or knockout drug, intended to render the person unconscious. It was often used in criminal contexts, like committing a robbery or sexual assault.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Zombie\" and \"Kamikaze\" are just names of cocktails, nothing to do with drugs or crime.\n\nAnd \"Molotov cocktail\" is entirely different, being a weapon.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty sure the answer is \"Mickey Finn.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Mickey Finn}} \\]"
