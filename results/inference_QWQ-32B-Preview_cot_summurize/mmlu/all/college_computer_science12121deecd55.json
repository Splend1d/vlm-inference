To determine which of the given graphs must have an Euler circuit, we need to recall the conditions for the existence of an Euler circuit.\n\nA fundamental theorem in graph theory states that an undirected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this criterion.\n\n**Option I: A complete graph with 12 vertices**\n\nA complete graph with \\( n \\) vertices, denoted \\( K_n \\), is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In \\( K_n \\), each vertex has a degree of \\( n-1 \\) because it is connected to every other vertex.\n\nFor \\( K_{12} \\), each vertex has degree \\( 12 - 1 = 11 \\), which is odd. Since there are vertices with odd degrees, \\( K_{12} \\) does not have an Euler circuit.\n\n**Option II: A complete graph with 13 vertices**\n\nSimilarly, for \\( K_{13} \\), each vertex has degree \\( 13 - 1 = 12 \\), which is even. Since all vertices have even degrees, \\( K_{13} \\) must have an Euler circuit.\n\n**Option III: A tree with 13 vertices**\n\nA tree is a connected acyclic graph. In a tree with \\( n \\) vertices, there are \\( n - 1 \\) edges. Moreover, a tree always has at least two leaves (vertices of degree 1), unless it consists of a single vertex (which is not the case here since \\( n = 13 \\)).\n\nTherefore, in a tree with 13 vertices, there are at least two vertices with degree 1, which is odd. Hence, a tree with 13 vertices does not have an Euler circuit.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, only option II (a complete graph with 13 vertices) must have an Euler circuit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
