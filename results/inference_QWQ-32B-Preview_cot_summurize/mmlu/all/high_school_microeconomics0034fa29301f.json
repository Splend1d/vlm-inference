A regressive tax system\n\nC. A proportional tax system\n\nD. An excise tax system\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these tax systems means.\n\nA progressive tax system is one where the tax rate increases as the individual's income increases. So, the richer you are, the higher percentage of your income you pay in taxes. This seems like it could be designed to take more from the wealthy.\n\nA regressive tax system is the opposite, where the tax rate decreases as income increases. So, lower-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to higher-income individuals. This seems like it would benefit the wealthy more.\n\nA proportional tax system, also known as a flat tax, is where everyone pays the same tax rate, regardless of their income. So, rich and poor pay the same percentage of their income in taxes.\n\nAn excise tax system is a tax on specific goods or services, like taxes on cigarettes or gasoline. This doesn't directly relate to income levels.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for a tax system that redistributes income from the wealthy to the poor, I want one that takes a larger percentage from the wealthy and a smaller percentage from the poor.\n\nThat sounds like a progressive tax system.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nA regressive tax system would take more from the poor relative to their income, which is the opposite of what I'm looking for.\n\nA proportional tax system treats everyone the same, so it doesn't specifically target the wealthy to redistribute income.\n\nAn excise tax is more of a consumption tax and doesn't directly aim to redistribute income based on wealth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A, a progressive tax system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
