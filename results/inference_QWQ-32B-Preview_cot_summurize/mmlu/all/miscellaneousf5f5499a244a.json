                    "text": "Let's see... I know that Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez are both actors, and I think they're related somehow. Let me try to remember this.\n\nI recall that Charlie Sheen's real name is Carlos Irwin Estevez, and Emilio Estevez is also an actor with the name Emilio Estevez. So, maybe they share the same last name. Maybe they're related through their last name.\n\nWait, is Estevez their family name? If so, maybe they're brothers or something. Let me think about this.\n\nI think Charlie Sheen was in a show called \"Two and a Half Men,\" and Emilio Estevez has been in movies like \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" They seem to have different careers, but that doesn't mean anything about their relation.\n\nMaybe I should think about their ages. Charlie Sheen was born in 1965, and Emilio Estevez was born in 1964, so they're pretty close in age. That might suggest they could be brothers or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cousins. But I don't know much about their family backgrounds.\n\nWait a minute, I think Charlie Sheen's father is Martin Sheen, who's also an actor. And Emilio Estevez's father is also Martin Sheen. Is that right?\n\nLet me check that. If both Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez have the same father, that would make them brothers.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe I'm confusing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps their fathers are brothers, which would make them cousins.\n\nI need to think carefully here.\n\nI know that Charlie Sheen's real name is Carlos Irwin Estevez, and he changed his name to Charlie Sheen for his acting career. His father is Martin Sheen, whose real name is Ram\u00f3n Antonio Mart\u00ednez Est\u00e9vez.\n\nSimilarly, Emilio Estevez's father is also Martin Sheen. So, if both Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez have Martin Sheen as their father, that would make them brothers.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should look up their mothers.\n\nI think Martin Sheen has been married multiple times. Maybe their mothers are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Charlie Sheen's father is Martin Sheen, and Emilio Estevez's father is someone else, and they just happen to have the same last name.\n\nI need to be careful here.\n\nWait, I recall that Charlie Sheen's mother is Janet Lisino, and Emilio Estevez's mother is also Janet Lisino. So, if they have the same parents, that would make them brothers.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Emilio Estevez is the son of Martin Sheen and Jane Wagner, and Charlie Sheen is the son of Martin Sheen and Janet Lisino, which would make them half-brothers.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nI need to verify this.\n\nLet me try to recall: Martin Sheen has been married to several women, including Jane March, Janet Lisino, and Brenda Vaccaro.\n\nFrom what I remember, Emilio Estevez is the son of Martin Sheen and Jane March, while Charlie Sheen is the son of Martin Sheen and Janet Lisino. So, if that's the case, they would be half-brothers, sharing the same father but having different mothers.\n\nBut in the options provided, there's no \"half-brothers.\" The options are cousins, brothers, father and son, or uncle and nephew.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misremembering their parental relationships.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf Charlie Sheen is the son of Martin Sheen and Janet Lisino, and Emilio Estevez is the son of Martin Sheen and Jane March, then they are half-brothers.\n\nBut since half-brothers are still brothers, perhaps option B \"They're brothers\" could encompass half-brothers as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects a more specific relationship.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that Emilio Estevez is actually the son of Martin Sheen and Jane March, and Charlie Sheen is the son of Martin Sheen and Janet Lisino, which would make them half-brothers.\n\nBut in the options, \"brothers\" is listed, and that could include half-brothers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers them full brothers.\n\nI need to clarify this.\n\nLet me check what I know about their mothers.\n\nI believe Martin Sheen married Jane March, and they had children, including Emilio Estevez.\n\nThen, Martin Sheen married Janet Lisino, and they had Charlie Sheen.\n\nSo, Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen have the same father but different mothers, making them half-brothers.\n\nBut in the options, it's just \"brothers,\" which could mean full brothers or half-brothers.\n\nPerhaps the question considers them brothers in a general sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have the same mother, and I'm misremembering.\n\nI need to be sure.\n\nWait, maybe their mothers are related, making them cousins.\n\nBut that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another relationship between them.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nIf Emilio Estevez is the son of Martin Sheen and Jane March, and Charlie Sheen is the son of Martin Sheen and Janet Lisino, then they are half-brothers.\n\nBut if their mothers are sisters, that would make them first cousins.\n\nWait, is that the case?\n\nI need to know if Jane March and Janet Lisino are related.\n\nI don't know that information off the top of my head.\n\nIf Jane March and Janet Lisino are sisters, then Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen would be first cousins.\n\nBut if their mothers are not related, then they are half-brothers.\n\nI need to find out the relationship between Jane March and Janet Lisino.\n\nAlternatively, maybe their fathers are brothers, making them cousins.\n\nBut I know that Martin Sheen is their father, so that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nIf both Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen have the same father, Martin Sheen, and different mothers, then they are half-brothers.\n\nUnless their mothers are the same, which I don't think is the case.\n\nTherefore, they are half-brothers.\n\nBut since the option says \"brothers,\" which can include half-brothers, perhaps the answer is B. They're brothers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects a more precise relationship, in which case none of the options fit perfectly.\n\nBut since half-brothers are still a type of brother relationship, I think B is the closest answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinformed about their parental relationships.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nIf I look at their last names, Emilio Estevez keeps his birth name, while Charlie Sheen was born Carlos Estevez but changed his name for his career.\n\nSo, they both have the last name Estevez, which suggests they are related through their father, who is Martin Sheen, whose birth name is Martin Sheen, but his real name is Ram\u00f3n Antonio Mart\u00ednez Est\u00e9vez.\n\nSo, perhaps their last names indicate their relation.\n\nBut I still need to determine the exact relationship.\n\nLet me try to recall more information.\n\nI know that Martin Sheen has several children in the acting business, including Emilio Estevez, Jonathan Estevez, Ren\u00e9e Estevez, and Charlie Sheen.\n\nIf they all have different mothers, then they are all half-siblings.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the maternal relationships.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of them have the same mother.\n\nI need to find out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Emilio Estevez is the son of Martin Sheen and Jane March, and Charlie Sheen is the son of Martin Sheen and Janet Lisino, who are not related.\n\nTherefore, Emilio and Charlie are half-brothers.\n\nBut since the option is \"brothers,\" which can include half-brothers, I think B is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me by suggesting they are full brothers when they are actually half-brothers.\n\nBut in any case, they are still brothers.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. They're brothers.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider the other options.\n\nA. They're cousins.\n\nIf their parents are siblings, then they would be cousins.\n\nBut from what I know, their father is the same, Martin Sheen, so they are not cousins.\n\nUnless their mothers are sisters, which I don't know, but assuming their mothers are not sisters, then they are not cousins.\n\nC. They're father and son.\n\nMartin Sheen is the father of Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen, so they are not father and son to each other.\n\nD. They're uncle and nephew.\n\nIf one is the uncle of the other, but since they are both sons of Martin Sheen, they are not uncle and nephew to each other.\n\nTherefore, the only plausible option is B. They're brothers.\n\nEven if they are half-brothers, technically, they are still brothers.\n\nSo, I will go with B. They're brothers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
