                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a cannonball being fired horizontally from a cliff. It's going at 10 m/s initially, and I need to figure out its speed one second after being fired. The options are A. 10 m/s, B. 14 m/s, C. 16 m/s, and D. 20 m/s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. The cannonball is fired horizontally, which means its initial velocity is entirely in the horizontal direction. Since it's fired from a cliff, there's also the effect of gravity pulling it downward. So, one second after being fired, it would have both horizontal and vertical components of velocity.\n\nI remember that in projectile motion, the horizontal component of velocity remains constant if we ignore air resistance, and the vertical component increases due to gravity. So, the horizontal velocity is still 10 m/s after one second.\n\nNow, for the vertical velocity, I can use the formula for velocity under constant acceleration: v = u + at, where u is the initial velocity in that direction, a is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is time.\n\nSince the cannonball was fired horizontally, its initial vertical velocity u is 0 m/s. The acceleration due to gravity, a, is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2 downward. And time, t, is 1 second.\n\nSo, the vertical velocity after 1 second is:\n\nv_vertical = 0 + (9.8 m/s\u00b2)(1 s) = 9.8 m/s downward.\n\nNow, the total velocity of the cannonball after one second is the vector sum of its horizontal and vertical velocities. Since these are perpendicular to each other, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the total velocity.\n\nSo, total speed v = \u221a(v_horizontal\u00b2 + v_vertical\u00b2) = \u221a(10\u00b2 + 9.8\u00b2) = \u221a(100 + 96.04) = \u221a196.04 \u2248 14 m/s.\n\nWait, but 14 m/s is option B. Is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nHorizontal velocity: 10 m/s (remains constant)\n\nVertical velocity after 1 second: 9.8 m/s downward\n\nTotal speed: \u221a(10\u00b2 + 9.8\u00b2) = \u221a(100 + 96.04) = \u221a196.04 \u2248 14 m/s\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the speed one second after being fired is approximately 14 m/s.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. The problem says \"about,\" so approximate values are acceptable. Also, I used g = 9.8 m/s\u00b2, which is standard, but sometimes in problems, they might use 10 m/s\u00b2 for simplicity.\n\nIf I use g = 10 m/s\u00b2, then v_vertical = 10 m/s, and total speed v = \u221a(10\u00b2 + 10\u00b2) = \u221a(100 + 100) = \u221a200 \u2248 14.14 m/s, which is still approximately 14 m/s.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A, 10 m/s, is the initial horizontal speed, but after one second, the cannonball has gained vertical speed due to gravity, so its total speed should be higher than 10 m/s.\n\nOption C, 16 m/s, is larger than 14 m/s, but my calculations show it should be around 14 m/s.\n\nOption D, 20 m/s, is even larger and doesn't make sense based on the calculations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 14 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
