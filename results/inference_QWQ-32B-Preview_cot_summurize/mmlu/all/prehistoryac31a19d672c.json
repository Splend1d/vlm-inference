                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about which concept first described human culture in terms of a Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The options are uniformitarianism, multilinear evolution, three-age system, and triple-age catastrophism. I think the three-age system sounds right, but I'm not entirely sure about the others.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these terms means.\n\nUniformitarianism is a principle that the same geological processes we see today have always operated in the past. It's more about geology and the natural world than about human culture or history.\n\nMultilinear evolution suggests that human societies evolve in different ways and at different rates, depending on their own paths and adaptations. It doesn't specifically outline a sequence like Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages.\n\nThe three-age system is a concept that divides human prehistory into three consecutive time periods based on the main material used to make tools and weapons: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. This seems directly related to the question.\n\nTriple-age catastrophism isn't a term I'm familiar with, but it might suggest a catastrophic event marking the transition between three ages. However, the three-age system doesn't necessarily involve catastrophes; it's more about technological advancements.\n\nGiven this, the three-age system seems to be the correct answer. It was developed by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen in the early 19th century as a way to organize and understand prehistoric artifacts based on the materials they were made from.\n\nUniformitarianism is more about geological processes, multilinear evolution is about the diverse paths of cultural development, and triple-age catastrophism doesn't seem to be a standard term in this context.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is C. three-age system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
