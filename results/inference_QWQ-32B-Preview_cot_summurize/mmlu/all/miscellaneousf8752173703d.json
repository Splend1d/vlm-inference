                    "text": "C. The Fair Labor Standards Act\n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a federal law in the United States that establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and child labor standards affecting full-time and part-time workers in the private sector and in federal, state, and local governments. It was enacted in 1938 and has been amended several times since then.\n\nThe FLSA sets the federal minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 per hour, although some states and localities have higher minimum wages. The law also requires overtime pay of at least one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek.\n\nThe FLSA applies to employees engaged in interstate commerce or employed by an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce. It also applies to domestic service workers, such as babysitters and cooks, under certain conditions.\n\nThe FLSA exempts certain types of employees from its minimum wage and overtime pay provisions, such as executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and computer employees who meet specific tests regarding their job duties and salaries.\n\nIn addition to wage and hour provisions, the FLSA also contains child labor provisions that limit the types of jobs and hours that minors under the age of 18 can work.\n\nOverall, the FLSA plays a crucial role in protecting workers' rights and ensuring fair compensation for their labor.\n\n**Other Options Explained:**\n\nA. **The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA):** ERISA is a federal law that sets minimum standards for most voluntarily established retirement and health plans in private industry to provide protection for individuals in these plans. It does not directly prescribe standards for wages and overtime pay.\n\nB. **The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA):** ARRA was enacted in 2009 as a stimulus package in response to the Great Recession. It provided economic recovery measures, including investments in infrastructure, education, and health care, but it does not prescribe general standards for wages and overtime pay.\n\nD. **The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA):** FECA is a federal workers' compensation program that provides benefits to federal employees who are injured on the job or suffer from work-related illnesses. It does not establish standards for wages or overtime pay.\n\n**References:**\n\n- U.S. Department of Labor. (n.d.). Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
