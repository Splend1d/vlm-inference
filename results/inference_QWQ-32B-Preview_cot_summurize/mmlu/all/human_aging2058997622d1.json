But I'm not sure about partying once a month. Maybe that's something else. Let me think again.\n\nSo, option A is about eating the correct food but not too much. That sounds familiar. They emphasized the importance of a healthy diet in aging well. So, that's probably one of their keys.\n\nOption B is about respecting each other. I think they mentioned that maintaining good relationships and mutual respect is crucial for successful aging. So, that seems to be another key.\n\nOption C is about partying at least once a month. Hmm, I don't recall them mentioning anything about partying specifically. Maybe they talked about staying socially active, but partying once a month seems a bit specific. I'm starting to think that might be the one they didn't name.\n\nOption D is about making long-range plans. I remember them stressing the importance of having goals and planning for the future, even in older age. So, that aligns with their advice.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look back at the material where they presented these keys. But since I can't do that right now, I need to rely on my memory.\n\nLet me list what I remember:\n\n1. Maintain a healthy diet: eat right, not too much.\n\n2. Stay physically active.\n\n3. Keep mentally stimulated.\n\n4. Maintain social connections and relationships.\n\n5. Have a positive attitude.\n\n6. Make long-term plans and have goals.\n\nI see that eating right and making long-range plans are mentioned, which correspond to options A and D. Respecting each other is part of maintaining relationships, which is option B. But partying once a month isn't something I recall them specifying.\n\nMaybe they just mentioned staying socially active, but not necessarily partying once a month. Perhaps option C is the one they didn't name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe partying once a month is their recommended way to stay socially active. But I doubt it. It seems too specific.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about which one they did not name as a key to successful aging. So, if they didn't mention partying once a month, then C would be the answer.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to consider another approach.\n\nLet's consider that all of these could be aspects of successful aging, but only one isn't mentioned by the Kingbergs. Since A, B, and D seem to align with their known advice, maybe C is the one they didn't name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they did mention something about social activities, including parties, but not specified once a month.\n\nBut since the question is which one they did not name, I'm going to go with C. Party at least once a month.\n\nSo, my answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
