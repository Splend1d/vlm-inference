                    "text": "Let's see. So, in this scenario, a mother and her infant are alone in a room, and then a stranger comes in and the mother leaves. Later, when the mother comes back, the infant starts crying and keeps crying even when the mother picks them up. But then, after some time, the infant stops crying, goes back to playing with toys, and seems happy. The question is asking which attachment style this infant is likely to have. The options are Disorganized, Anxious-resistant, Avoidant, or Secure.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these attachment styles looks like in practice. Let me start with Secure attachment. Securely attached infants generally feel safe and comfortable exploring when their mother is present. When the mother leaves, they might get upset, but when she returns, they are glad to see her and are easily comforted. They use their mother as a \"secure base\" to explore from.\n\nAnxious-resistant attachment, also known as insecure-ambivalent attachment, is different. These infants are often clingy and wary of exploration even when the mother is present. When the mother leaves, they get very upset and have a hard time calming down when she returns. They might seek contact but then resist it, pushing away or being angry.\n\nAvoidant attachment is characterized by infants who don't seem particularly interested in their mother's presence or absence. They might not show much emotion when the mother leaves or comes back, and they often avoid seeking comfort from her when upset.\n\nDisorganized attachment is a bit more complex. It's when an infant doesn't have a consistent strategy for dealing with stress or the departure and return of the mother. Their behaviors might seem confused or contradictory.\n\nIn the scenario described, the infant cries when the mother returns and initially continues to cry even after being picked up, but then eventually settles down and returns to playing happily. This sounds a bit like the secure attachment style, where the infant is upset upon the mother's return but then is comforted and returns to positive behavior. However, the initial resistance to being comforted might suggest something else.\n\nLet me think about this again. In secure attachment, the infant would be upset upon the mother's return but would be quickly comforted and then return to positive behavior. Here, the infant continues to cry even after being picked up, which isn't typical of secure attachment. In secure attachment, the comfort is usually more immediate.\n\nAnxious-resistant attachment might fit better because these infants often are clingy and upset when the mother leaves, and when she returns, they might seek contact but then resist it, showing anger or ambivalence. The crying and initial resistance to being picked up could be seen as resisting contact.\n\nAvoidant attachment seems less likely because avoidant infants typically don't show much emotion when the mother leaves or returns and don't seek comfort when upset.\n\nDisorganized attachment might be considered if the infant's behavior seems confused or doesn't fit neatly into one of the other categories.\n\nGiven this, I think Anxious-resistant attachment is the most likely classification for this infant. The crying upon the mother's return and the initial resistance to being picked up align with the ambivalent behavior typical of this attachment style. Eventually settling down and playing could be seen as the infant regulating their emotions, which might also be consistent with this style.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe it's not so clear-cut. Perhaps it's Disorganized attachment if the infant's behavior seems inconsistent or confused. However, the description suggests that the infant eventually settles down and plays happily, which might not fit the disorganized category as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's still Secure attachment, but with a more sensitive reading. Perhaps the infant is just really upset and takes a bit more time to be comforted, but ultimately, they do settle down and return to positive behavior.\n\nI guess I need to consider the key features of each attachment style in relation to the behavior described.\n\nSecure attachment: Upset upon reunion but quickly comforted and return to positive behavior.\n\nAnxious-resistant attachment: Upset upon reunion, seek contact but resist it, ambivalent behavior.\n\nAvoidant attachment: Little emotion upon reunion, avoid seeking comfort.\n\nDisorganized attachment: Confused or contradictory behavior.\n\nIn this case, the infant cries upon reunion and initially continues to cry even after being picked up, which suggests resistance to comfort. Then, they settle down and play happily, which could indicate that they have regulated their emotions.\n\nComparing this to the descriptions, Anxious-resistant attachment seems the closest fit because of the initial resistance to comfort. In secure attachment, the infant would typically be comforted more quickly.\n\nTherefore, I think the most likely attachment classification for this infant is Anxious-resistant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
