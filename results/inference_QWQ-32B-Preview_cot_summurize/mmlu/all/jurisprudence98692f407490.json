The options are Austin, Salmond, Holland, and Gray. I need to remember which one of these legal theorists defined law in this way.\n\nFirst, I recall that John Austin is known for his command theory of law, where he defined law as commands from the sovereign backed by sanctions. So, that doesn't seem to match the statement given.\n\nNext, I think about Salmond. Edward Samuel Sheldon Salmond was a British jurist and legal scholar. He wrote \"Jurisprudence,\" which is a foundational text in the field. Salmond defined law as \"the body of principles recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice.\" That sounds very similar to the statement in the question.\n\nThen there's Holland. Thomas Erskine Holland was another influential jurist who wrote \"The Elements of Jurisprudence.\" I think he also had a definition of law, but I don't recall it being exactly like the one in the question.\n\nFinally, there's Gray. John Chipman Gray was an American legal scholar who wrote \"The Nature and Sources of the Law.\" His focus was more on the actual practices of courts and lawyers rather than a abstract definition of law.\n\nGiven that, I believe Salmond is the one who defined law as \"the body of principles recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice.\" So, the answer should be B. Salmond.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should double-check. Let me look up Salmond's definition of law.\n\nAfter a quick search, I confirm that Edward Samuel Sheldon Salmond defined law as \"the body of principles recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice.\" This matches the statement in the question perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Salmond.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
