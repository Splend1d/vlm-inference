After scoring a touchdown, the scoring team gets to choose from two options for the \"extra point\": they can kick the ball through the uprights for one additional point (called an extra point or point after touchdown, PAT), or they can run or pass the ball into the end zone again for two additional points (called a two-point conversion). So, the total points for a touchdown can be seven or eight, but the touchdown itself is worth six points.\n\nOption A, two points, is incorrect because that's the value of a safety, which is when the defensive team tackles the offensive team in their own end zone.\n\nOption B, three points, is the value of a field goal, which is when the kicking team successfully kicks the ball through the opponent's uprights.\n\nOption D, seven points, is the total if a touchdown (six points) is followed by a successful extra point (one point), but the touchdown alone is six points.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. six."
