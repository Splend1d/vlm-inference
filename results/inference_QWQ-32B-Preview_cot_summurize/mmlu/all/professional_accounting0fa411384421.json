Let's see what it's asking.\n\nFirst, Carson owns 40% of the outstanding stock of a C corporation. The corporation had $400,000 in taxable income and distributed $70,000 in cash dividends. Carson reported $28,000 in gross income on his individual tax return. Now, the question is asking, if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions were proportionate, how much income would Carson have reported on his individual return?\n\nOkay, so let's break this down. First, I need to understand the difference between C corporations and S corporations, especially regarding how their income is taxed and how dividends are treated.\n\nIn a C corporation, the company pays corporate income tax on its profits, and then when it distributes dividends to shareholders, those dividends are taxed again at the shareholder's individual tax rate. This is called double taxation.\n\nIn an S corporation, it's a pass-through entity, meaning that the corporation's income passes through to the shareholders, and they report it on their individual tax returns. The corporation itself doesn't pay income tax; the shareholders do.\n\nSo, in this scenario, with a C corporation, Carson received $28,000 in dividends, which he reported as gross income. But in an S corporation, things would be different because the income would pass through to him, regardless of whether distributions are made.\n\nWait, but the question mentions that the distributions to the owners would have been proportionate. So, in an S corporation, the shareholders are allocated a share of the corporation's income based on their ownership percentage, and they report that as income on their individual tax returns.\n\nGiven that Carson owns 40% of the S corporation, his share of the corporation's income would be 40% of $400,000, which is $160,000. That would be the income he'd report on his individual return, right?\n\nBut the question is a bit tricky because it mentions that in the C corporation scenario, Carson reported $28,000 in gross income from dividends. So, perhaps there's more to it.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the fact that in a C corporation, only the dividends are reported as income by the shareholder, whereas in an S corporation, the shareholder reports their share of the corporation's income, which could include both distributed and undistributed earnings.\n\nSo, in the C corporation case, Carson received $28,000 in dividends, which is his share of the $70,000 total dividends paid by the corporation. Given that he owns 40% of the stock, $70,000 times 40% is indeed $28,000.\n\nBut in the S corporation case, Carson would have to report 40% of the corporation's $400,000 taxable income, regardless of whether the corporation distributed any dividends or not. So, that would be $160,000.\n\nHowever, the question mentions that the distributions would have been proportionate. Does that mean that in the S corporation scenario, there would still be distributions made, but it doesn't affect the income reporting?\n\nIn S corporations, distributions are generally not taxable to the extent of the shareholder's basis in the S corporation. The income is reported when it's earned, not when it's distributed.\n\nSo, in this case, Carson would report $160,000 as income on his individual return, regardless of whether the S corporation distributed any money to him or not.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that there are distributions being made, even in the S corporation scenario, and that they are proportionate.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the fact that in an S corporation, to the extent that distributions exceed basis, they may be taxable, but generally, the income is reported when earned, based on ownership percentage.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is that Carson would report $160,000 in income on his individual return if the corporation were an S corporation.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $28,000\n\nB. $132,000\n\nC. $160,000\n\nD. $188,000\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nLet me double-check. In a C corporation, dividends are only taxable to the shareholder when they are received, and they are reported as dividend income.\n\nIn an S corporation, the shareholder includes their pro-rata share of the corporation's income in their individual tax return, whether or not the corporation distributes any money.\n\nSo, in this case, since the S corporation would have $400,000 in taxable income, and Carson owns 40%, he would report $160,000 as income.\n\nThe fact that distributions are proportionate doesn't change the income reporting; it only affects the shareholder's basis and potentially the tax treatment of the distributions themselves.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. $160,000.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
