The options are:\n\nA. 1,300 and 1,500\n\nB. 1,000 and 1,200\n\nC. 700 and 900\n\nD. 400 and 600\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It says \"estimate\" 999 - 103, and then determine between which pair of numbers the result falls.\n\nEstimation usually means to find an approximate value, so I don't need to calculate the exact difference, but rather get a sense of what range it should be in.\n\nLet's look at the numbers: 999 and 103.\n\n999 is very close to 1,000, and 103 is close to 100.\n\nSo, if I estimate 999 as 1,000 and 103 as 100, then the difference would be 1,000 - 100 = 900.\n\nBut wait, is that the correct way to estimate here? Let me think.\n\nActually, 999 is just 1 less than 1,000, and 103 is 3 more than 100. So, 999 - 103 should be slightly less than 1,000 - 100, which is 900.\n\nLet me calculate it precisely to check.\n\n999 - 103:\n\nStart with 999, subtract 100 to get 899, then subtract the remaining 3 to get 896.\n\nSo, the exact difference is 896.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 1,300 and 1,500\n\nB. 1,000 and 1,200\n\nC. 700 and 900\n\nD. 400 and 600\n\n896 falls between 700 and 900, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let's see if estimation could have led me directly to that conclusion without calculating the exact difference.\n\nI estimated 999 as 1,000 and 103 as 100, getting 900.\n\nBut the actual difference is 896, which is indeed between 700 and 900.\n\nSo, estimation worked here.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about rounding.\n\nRounding 999 to the nearest hundred is 1,000, and 103 to the nearest hundred is 100.\n\nSubtracting gives 900, and since both rounding directions (999 up to 1,000 and 103 up to 100) are in the same direction (both up), the error in estimation is minimal.\n\nThus, the difference should be around 900, which again points to option C.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 700 and 900.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
