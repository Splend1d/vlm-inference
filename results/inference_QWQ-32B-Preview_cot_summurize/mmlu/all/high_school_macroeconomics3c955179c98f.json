                    "text": "Let's see. So, we have good Z and good X, and they're close substitutes. That means if the price of X goes up, people might switch to buying Z instead, right? So, what happens to the demand for Z if X gets more expensive?\n\nWell, if X is more expensive, people might buy less of X and more of Z because Z is now relatively cheaper. So, the demand for Z should increase, right? That means the demand curve for Z shifts to the right.\n\nNow, what does that do to the equilibrium price and quantity of Z? If demand increases, the demand curve shifts right, and if supply stays the same, the equilibrium price should rise, and the equilibrium quantity should also increase.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Is there any reason why the supply of Z would change in this scenario? The question only talks about the price of X changing, which affects demand for Z, not supply.\n\nSo, if supply remains constant and demand increases, yes, price and quantity both increase.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The equilibrium price will rise and the equilibrium quantity will fall.\n\nB. The equilibrium price will fall and the equilibrium quantity will rise.\n\nC. The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will both rise.\n\nD. The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will both fall.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, option C seems correct. Both price and quantity rise when demand increases and supply remains the same.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that supply could be affected by the price of X changing. Maybe if X and Z are produced using the same resources, or something like that. But the question doesn't suggest any relationship between the production of X and Z. It only says they're close substitutes in consumption.\n\nSo, no, supply should remain unchanged. Therefore, the demand shift is the only effect here, leading to higher price and higher quantity for Z.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
