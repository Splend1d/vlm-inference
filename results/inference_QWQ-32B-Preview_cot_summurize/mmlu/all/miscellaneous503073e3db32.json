She was kind of his alter ego, and he would often do these routines where he'd talk to her or channel her, I think. So, I believe the answer is C. Geraldine Jones.\n\nBut let me double-check. Flip Wilson was a comedian who had a variety show in the 1970s, and one of his most famous characters was indeed Geraldine Jones. She was a sassy, over-the-top female character that he would impersonate, often in sketches where he would switch between his own voice and Geraldine's.\n\nI don't think Miss Jackie was a character he played; that sounds more like a different show or perhaps a different comedian. Elizabeth Sanford doesn't ring a bell in relation to Flip Wilson, and Gladys Knight is a singer, not a character played by Flip Wilson.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty sure the answer is C. Geraldine Jones.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
