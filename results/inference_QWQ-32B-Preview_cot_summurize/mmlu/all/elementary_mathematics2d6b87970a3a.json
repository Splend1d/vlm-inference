                    "text": "So I have this problem here: a post office delivered eighteen thousand ninety-six pieces of mail in a week, and I need to write this number in expanded form. The options are:\n\nA. 18 + 1,000 + 90 + 6\n\nB. 18 + 1,000 + 900 + 60\n\nC. 10,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6\n\nD. 10,000 + 8,000 + 900 + 60\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"expanded form\" means. Expanded form is when you break down a number into the value of each digit. For example, the number 123 would be 100 + 20 + 3.\n\nSo, for the number eighteen thousand ninety-six, I need to identify the value of each digit.\n\nLet's write down the number: 18,096.\n\nNow, let's identify each digit's place value:\n\n- The '1' is in the ten thousands place, so it's 10,000.\n\n- The '8' is in the thousands place, so it's 8,000.\n\n- The '0' is in the hundreds place, so it's 0.\n\n- The '9' is in the tens place, so it's 90.\n\n- The '6' is in the ones place, so it's 6.\n\nSo, the expanded form should be 10,000 + 8,000 + 0 + 90 + 6.\n\nBut in the options, option C is 10,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6, which matches our expanded form, except it skips the zero. Is that okay?\n\nYes, because adding zero doesn't change the sum.\n\nOption D is 10,000 + 8,000 + 900 + 60, which would be 10,000 + 8,000 = 18,000 + 900 = 18,900 + 60 = 18,960, which is not 18,096.\n\nOption A is 18 + 1,000 + 90 + 6, which adds up to 1,114, way off.\n\nOption B is 18 + 1,000 + 900 + 60 = 1,978, still not 18,096.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check.\n\nThe number is eighteen thousand ninety-six, which is 18,096.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- 10,000 (from the '1' in the ten thousands place)\n\n- 8,000 (from the '8' in the thousands place)\n\n- 0 (from the '0' in the hundreds place)\n\n- 90 (from the '9' in the tens place)\n\n- 6 (from the '6' in the ones place)\n\nSo, 10,000 + 8,000 + 0 + 90 + 6 = 18,096.\n\nOption C: 10,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6 = 18,096.\n\nOption D: 10,000 + 8,000 + 900 + 60 = 18,960.\n\nClearly, option C is correct.\n\nBut why is there confusion with option D?\n\nMaybe because if someone misreads the number as 18,960 instead of 18,096.\n\nBut the question says eighteen thousand ninety-six, which is 18,096.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
