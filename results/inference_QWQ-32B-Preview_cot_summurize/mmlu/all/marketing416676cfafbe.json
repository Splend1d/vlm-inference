Let me read them again to make sure I understand each one.\n\nOption A says: \"Basing the price on what the customer is willing to pay.\" Hmm, that sounds more like value-based pricing or maybe willingness-to-pay pricing. It's not directly about costs, right?\n\nOption B: \"Basing the price on the psychological expectations of the customer.\" That seems like it could be psychological pricing, where you set prices to influence customers' perceptions or behavior. Again, not directly related to costs.\n\nOption C: \"Basing the price on the features and benefits of the product.\" This sounds like value-based pricing as well, where the price is determined by what the product offers to the customer. Still not focused on costs.\n\nOption D: \"Basing the price on the full cost of production plus the required profit.\" Okay, this one mentions costs directly. It seems like it's about covering the costs of producing the product and then adding a margin for profit.\n\nWait a minute, cost-based pricing\u2014what does that actually mean? I think it's a method where the price is set based on the costs involved in producing the product, plus a markup for profit. So, it starts with calculating the total cost per unit and then adding a certain percentage to determine the selling price.\n\nLet me think about option D again. It says \"basing the price on the full cost of production plus the required profit.\" That sounds exactly like cost-based pricing. You calculate the total cost, including all expenses related to making the product, and then add the desired profit margin to set the price.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, seems more focused on what the market can bear or what customers are willing to pay, which is more of a market-oriented pricing strategy.\n\nOption B is about psychological pricing, which might involve setting prices to influence how customers perceive the value or to make the price more attractive.\n\nOption C is similar to value-based pricing, where the features and benefits of the product dictate the price.\n\nSo, compared to these options, option D is the only one that directly refers to costing elements in determining the price.\n\nLet me double-check. Cost-based pricing is a method where the price is determined by adding a profit margin to the cost of the product. It's a common approach, especially in cost-oriented industries or when starting a new business.\n\nIn contrast, other pricing strategies like value-based pricing focus more on what customers perceive the value to be, rather than the cost of production.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: \"Basing the price on the full cost of production plus the required profit.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
