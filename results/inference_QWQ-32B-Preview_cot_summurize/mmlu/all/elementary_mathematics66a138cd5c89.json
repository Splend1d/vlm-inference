The options are:\n\nA. 0.25, 1.6, 1.0\n\nB. 1.0, 0.25, 1.6\n\nC. 0.25, 1.0, 1.6\n\nD. 1.6, 1.0, 0.25\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"least to greatest\" means. It means starting with the smallest number and ending with the largest number, arranged in increasing order.\n\nSo, I need to compare the numbers in each option and see if they are arranged from smallest to largest.\n\nLet's look at option A: 0.25, 1.6, 1.0\n\n- 0.25 is less than 1.6, that's correct.\n\n- But 1.6 is greater than 1.0, which means 1.6 should come after 1.0 if they are in order from least to greatest.\n\nWait, but in this option, 1.6 is before 1.0, which is not correct because 1.6 is larger than 1.0. So, option A is not in order from least to greatest.\n\nNow, option B: 1.0, 0.25, 1.6\n\n- 1.0 is greater than 0.25, so starting with 1.0 isn't correct because 0.25 is smaller.\n\n- Then 0.25 is less than 1.6, which is correct.\n\nBut since the first number is larger than the second, this isn't ordered from least to greatest. So, option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: 0.25, 1.0, 1.6\n\n- 0.25 is the smallest number.\n\n- 1.0 is greater than 0.25 but less than 1.6.\n\n- 1.6 is the largest number.\n\nThis seems to be in increasing order: 0.25, 1.0, 1.6. This looks correct.\n\nLet's check option D: 1.6, 1.0, 0.25\n\n- 1.6 is larger than 1.0, so starting with 1.6 isn't correct for least to greatest.\n\n- Then 1.0 is less than 1.6, but in this order, it's after 1.6, which is incorrect.\n\n- Finally, 0.25 is the smallest, but it's last in the sequence, which is not least to greatest.\n\nSo, option D is also incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C seems to be the correct order from least to greatest: 0.25, 1.0, 1.6.\n\nTo double-check, let's compare all the numbers:\n\n- 0.25 is less than 1.0.\n\n- 1.0 is less than 1.6.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is correctly ordered from least to greatest.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 0.25, 1.0, 1.6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
