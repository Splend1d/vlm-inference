                    "text": "Let's see. I have this scenario about Bill and his estate. He owned some pasture land and a condominium, and he had a will devising these properties to his son Tommy and daughter Julie, respectively. He also had other assets that were to be split equally between Tommy and Julie. Then, he married Kathy after she signed a prenuptial agreement giving up her rights to his estate. On their honeymoon, they saw the condominium, and Kathy said she'd love to live there. After the honeymoon, Bill signed a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety, planning to live there once the tenant vacated. Unfortunately, Bill died the next day.\n\nI need to figure out how his assets are distributed based on this information.\n\nFirst, let's look at the will. It devises the pasture land to Tommy and the condominium to Julie. All other assets are to be divided equally between Tommy and Julie.\n\nBut then, Bill married Kathy after she signed a prenuptial agreement relinquishing her rights to his estate. So, typically, when someone marries, and they don't have a prenuptial agreement, the surviving spouse might have inheritance rights. But here, Kathy signed a valid prenuptial agreement giving up those rights. So, in principle, Kathy shouldn't have any claim on Bill's estate.\n\nHowever, Bill signed a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety right before he died. This is interesting because tenants by the entirety is a form of joint ownership between husband and wife, and it usually has survivorship rights. That means that when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse automatically owns the entire property.\n\nSo, even though the will devises the condominium to Julie, Bill changed the ownership of the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety. Does this mean that the condominium now belongs to Kathy upon Bill's death?\n\nI think it does, because the deed supersedes the will in this case. The will is a testamentary document that disposes of property at death, but if Bill transferred the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety during his lifetime, then at his death, Kathy would inherit the condominium outright due to the right of survivorship.\n\nSo, the condominium goes to Kathy.\n\nNow, what about the pasture land? The will devises it to Tommy. Since there's no mention of any transfer or change in ownership of the pasture land before Bill's death, it should pass to Tommy as per the will.\n\nAnd the remaining assets are to be divided equally between Tommy and Julie.\n\nBut wait, there's a twist. Bill married Kathy, and even though there's a prenuptial agreement, I need to consider if there's any law that might give Kathy a share of the estate despite the prenuptial agreement.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there is the concept of a \"pretermitted spouse,\" which is a spouse who was married to the decedent but was not provided for in the will because the will was executed before the marriage. In such cases, the spouse may be entitled to a share of the estate as if there was no will.\n\nHowever, since Bill married Kathy after he executed his will, and he had a prenuptial agreement with her relinquishing her rights to his estate, I'm not sure if the pretermitted spouse statute would apply here.\n\nI think the prenuptial agreement would override any pretermitted spouse provisions, meaning that Kathy waived her right to claim any part of Bill's estate.\n\nTherefore, the distribution should be as per the will: pasture land to Tommy, condominium to Julie, and the rest divided between Tommy and Julie.\n\nBut hold on, Bill transferred the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety just before he died. So, does the will still control the condominium, or does the deed take precedence?\n\nI think the deed takes precedence because it's a lifetime transfer. The will only disposes of property that Bill owns at his death, and if the condominium is now owned by Bill and Kathy as tenants by the entirety, then at Bill's death, Kathy inherits the condominium.\n\nSo, despite the will devising the condominium to Julie, the prior conveyance to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety would mean that Kathy inherits the condominium.\n\nTherefore, the distribution would be:\n\n- Pasture land to Tommy\n\n- Condominium to Kathy\n\n- Remaining assets divided equally between Tommy and Julie\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\n\nThis seems to match my analysis.\n\nB. Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium, and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\n\nBut the prenuptial agreement relinquishes Kathy's rights, but the deed to tenants by the entirety might still give her the condominium.\n\nC. Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.\n\nThis is similar to option A, but it's not clear what \"remaining estate\" means here.\n\nD. Regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.\n\nThis seems incorrect because of the prenuptial agreement.\n\nI think the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
