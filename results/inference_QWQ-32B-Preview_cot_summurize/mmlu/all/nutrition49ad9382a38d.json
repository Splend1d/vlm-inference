                    "text": "I've come across this question about zinc supplements and which groups the World Health Organization recommends them for. The options are:\n\nA. Pregnant and lactating women\n\nB. Children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea\n\nC. All children in low-income areas with high prevalence of stunting\n\nD. Elderly people with low incomes\n\nI need to figure out which of these groups WHO advises should take zinc supplements.\n\nFirst, I know that zinc is an essential mineral for the body. It plays a role in immune function, protein synthesis, and cell division. So, it's crucial for growth and development, especially in vulnerable populations like pregnant women, young children, and those who are malnourished.\n\nLet's look at option A: pregnant and lactating women. During pregnancy and lactation, women have increased nutrient needs, including zinc, to support the growing fetus and breast milk production. So, it makes sense that they might need supplements.\n\nOption B mentions children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea. Malnutrition can lead to zinc deficiencies, and diarrhoea can cause zinc loss. I've heard that zinc supplements can help reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoeal episodes in children, so this seems likely.\n\nOption C is about all children in low-income areas with high prevalence of stunting. Stunting is a sign of chronic malnutrition, which can be related to zinc deficiency. So, perhaps universal supplementation in such areas is recommended.\n\nOption D is about elderly people with low incomes. While elderly people may have nutrient deficiencies due to various factors, I'm not sure if zinc supplements are specifically recommended for them by WHO.\n\nI need to recall or look up the specific WHO recommendations for zinc supplements.\n\nI remember that WHO does recommend zinc supplements for certain groups, particularly in relation to diarrhoeal diseases in children.\n\nAccording to WHO, zinc supplements are recommended for the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children aged 2 months to 12 years, regardless of the severity of the diarrhoea or the presence of dehydration. The standard treatment is oral zinc supplements for 10-14 days.\n\nAdditionally, WHO recommends daily zinc supplementation for prevention of diarrhoea and respiratory infections in children aged 6 months to 5 years in areas where zinc deficiency is prevalent.\n\nFor pregnant women, WHO recommends daily iron and folic acid supplementation to prevent anaemia, but I'm not sure about zinc supplements specifically.\n\nLactating women might have increased zinc needs, but I don't recall specific recommendations for them.\n\nRegarding elderly people, WHO does have guidelines on nutrition for older adults, but I don't think zinc supplements are specifically recommended for them based on income levels.\n\nConsidering this, options A and D seem less likely to be correct, while B and C seem more aligned with WHO recommendations.\n\nHowever, option C suggests supplementing all children in low-income areas with high prevalence of stunting. While universal supplementation might be considered in certain contexts, I think WHO recommends targeted supplementation based on risk factors rather than universal distribution.\n\nLet me check my facts.\n\nUpon reviewing WHO guidelines, it appears that zinc supplementation is indeed recommended for children with diarrhoea and in areas with high rates of zinc deficiency.\n\nWHO recommends:\n\n- Zinc supplementation for 10-14 days during episodes of acute diarrhoea in children aged 2 months to 12 years.\n\n- Daily zinc supplementation (10-14 mg elemental zinc per day) for children aged 6 months to 5 years in areas where zinc deficiency is prevalent, to prevent diarrhoea and respiratory infections.\n\nFor pregnant and lactating women, WHO recommends iron and folic acid supplementation, but zinc supplements are not routinely recommended unless there is a specific deficiency.\n\nFor elderly people, there are general nutrition recommendations, but no specific recommendation for zinc supplements based on income.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that options B and C are the most accurate, but the question seems to expect a single answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the question allows for multiple correct answers, but since it's phrased as \"which groups,\" it might expect a single choice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is a combination of A and B, but since A includes two subgroups, it's a bit confusing.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Pregnant and lactating women\n\nB. Children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea\n\nC. All children in low-income areas with high prevalence of stunting\n\nD. Elderly people with low incomes\n\nBased on WHO recommendations, option B is clearly supported.\n\nOption C is partially supported, as WHO recommends zinc supplementation in areas with high prevalence of zinc deficiency, which may correlate with stunting, but it's not universally recommended for all children in low-income areas.\n\nOption A is less supported, as zinc supplements are not routinely recommended for pregnant and lactating women unless deficient.\n\nOption D has no specific recommendation from WHO for zinc supplements based on age and income.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer seems to be option B: children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should confirm if WHO recommends zinc supplements specifically for children with severe malnutrition.\n\nUpon checking, WHO does recommend zinc supplementation for children with severe acute malnutrition, as part of the treatment protocol.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct.\n\nOption C might be partially correct, but WHO recommends preventive zinc supplementation for children in areas with high prevalence of zinc deficiency, not necessarily in all low-income areas with high stunting.\n\nStunting is associated with chronic malnutrition and possibly zinc deficiency, but it's not a direct indicator for universal supplementation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option B: children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
