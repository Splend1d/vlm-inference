The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers. The state court has now scheduled a prompt hearing on this matter. In addition, the state court has indicated that it hopes to render a decision on the merits within the next three weeks. Which of the following statements is correct concerning the federal court's adjudication of the candidate's suit?\n\nA. The federal court should hear the case on the merits.\nB. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nC. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.\nD. The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out what the federal court should do with the candidate's lawsuit. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a state statute that requires voters who want to write in a candidate to print the candidate's full name and designate the office in ink on the ballot. The candidate is Chinese-American and thinks he needs a lot of Chinese voters to win. His campaign manager sends out stickers with the candidate's name and the office to registered Chinese voters because many may have trouble writing in English.\n\nAn election official says this doesn't comply with the statute, which requires writing in ink. The candidate sues in federal court, saying the official's interpretation violates the U.S. Constitution. Meanwhile, one of his opponents sues in state court to stop the election officials from counting ballots with these stickers.\n\nThe state court is going to have a hearing soon and hopes to decide the matter in three weeks. Now, I need to figure out what the federal court should do with the candidate's suit.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The federal court should hear the case on the merits.\n\nB. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.\n\nC. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.\n\nD. The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented.\n\nOkay, so option A is straightforward: just hear the case and decide it. But I need to see if there's a reason the federal court shouldn't hear it.\n\nOption B mentions a \"nonjusticiable political question.\" I know that some issues are considered so politically charged that courts might avoid deciding them. But in this case, it's a constitutional challenge to a state statute as interpreted by election officials. That seems like something courts are supposed to decide. So maybe B isn't the best choice.\n\nOption C talks about the \"abstention doctrine.\" I think this is relevant. The abstention doctrine is when a federal court decides not to hear a case because there's a pending state court proceeding that's addressing the same issue, especially when it involves state law and election procedures. Here, there's already a state court hearing on the matter, and it's about state election rules.\n\nOption D suggests remanding the case to state court to decide the constitutional issue. But remanding usually happens when a case is already in federal court and needs to go back to state court, which isn't quite the same as abstention, where the federal court declines to hear the case in the first place.\n\nGiven that there's a parallel state court proceeding on the same issue, and it's expected to decide within three weeks, the federal court might want to abstain from hearing the case to avoid conflicting decisions and to let the state court handle the state election law issues.\n\nSo, between options C and D, C seems more appropriate because it's about the federal court refusing to hear the case due to the abstention doctrine, which is precisely the situation here.\n\nOption A might be tempting, but considering the parallel state court proceeding, it's probably better for the federal court to abstain.\n\nOption B doesn't seem to fit because this isn't a political question in the sense that courts can't decide it; it's a straightforward constitutional challenge to a state statute.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nC. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
