                    "text": "Let's see what \"nonrival\" means in the context of public goods. I remember that public goods have two main characteristics: nonrivalry and non-excludability. Non-excludability means that once the good is provided, it's hard to prevent people from using it, like a lighthouse. But nonrivalry is about how one person's use doesn't diminish another's.\n\nSo, option A says, \"one person's use of the public good does not reduce the amount available to others.\" That sounds exactly like the definition of nonrivalry I've learned. For example, if I'm listening to a radio broadcast, it doesn't prevent anyone else from listening to it too. The signal is available to everyone who has a radio, and my listening doesn't reduce the signal for others.\n\nOption B says, \"the public good is produced by the government without any competition.\" Well, public goods are often provided by the government, but that's not what \"nonrival\" means. Nonrivalry is about the nature of the good, not who produces it or how it's produced.\n\nOption C says, \"the public good is produced at zero marginal cost.\" Now, sometimes public goods can be produced at zero marginal cost, like broadcasting a radio program, where adding one more listener doesn't cost anything extra. But is that what nonrivalry means? Not exactly. Nonrivalry is about the use of the good, not the cost of producing it. So, while there might be a relationship between nonrivalry and zero marginal cost, they're not the same thing.\n\nOption D says, \"the public good is mostly consumed by free riders.\" Free riders are people who benefit from a public good without paying for it, which is a problem because of the non-excludability. But again, this isn't defining nonrivalry; it's related to the free-rider problem.\n\nSo, going back, the core idea of nonrivalry is that one person's consumption of the good doesn't reduce another's ability to consume it. That matches option A.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's any overlap or if I'm missing something. Let's think about some examples.\n\nTake national defense, which is a classic public good. If the military is defending the country, one person\u2019s protection doesn\u2019t mean less protection for others. Everyone benefits from the defense provided, and it\u2019s nonrival in consumption.\n\nAnother example is a public park. One person enjoying the park doesn\u2019t prevent others from doing the same. The park\u2019s enjoyment is nonrival.\n\nContrast this with a private good like a hamburger. If I eat a hamburger, it\u2019s no longer available for someone else to eat. That\u2019s rival consumption.\n\nSo, in summary, nonrivalry is about the simultaneous consumption without depletion, which aligns with option A.\n\nI think option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
