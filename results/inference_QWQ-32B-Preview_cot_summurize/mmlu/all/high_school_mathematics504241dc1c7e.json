The options are 5, 8, 3980, and 1160. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that 1990 is common in both terms, so maybe I can factor it out. Let me try that:\n\n\\(1990 \\times 1991 - 1989 \\times 1990 = 1990 \\times (1991 - 1989)\\)\n\nNow, subtracting inside the parentheses: \\(1991 - 1989 = 2\\)\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to: \\(1990 \\times 2 = 3980\\)\n\nLooking at the options, 3980 is one of them. But wait, let's double-check if there's another way to look at this just to be sure.\n\nAnother approach could be to expand both multiplications and then subtract, but that seems more complicated and prone to error with such large numbers. Let's see:\n\nFirst, calculate \\(1990 \\times 1991\\):\n\n\\(1990 \\times 1991 = 1990 \\times (2000 - 9) = 1990 \\times 2000 - 1990 \\times 9 = 3,980,000 - 17,910 = 3,962,090\\)\n\nNext, calculate \\(1989 \\times 1990\\):\n\n\\(1989 \\times 1990 = 1989 \\times (2000 - 10) = 1989 \\times 2000 - 1989 \\times 10 = 3,978,000 - 19,890 = 3,958,110\\)\n\nNow, subtract the two results:\n\n\\(3,962,090 - 3,958,110 = 3,980\\)\n\nAgain, I get 3980. Okay, that matches my first method.\n\nIs there a third way to confirm this? Maybe using algebraic identities or something?\n\nLet me think: the expression is \\(1990 \\times 1991 - 1989 \\times 1990\\). Let me denote 1990 as \\(n\\), so 1991 is \\(n + 1\\) and 1989 is \\(n - 1\\). Then the expression becomes:\n\n\\(n \\times (n + 1) - (n - 1) \\times n\\)\n\nExpanding both terms:\n\n\\(n^2 + n - (n^2 - n) = n^2 + n - n^2 + n = 2n\\)\n\nSo, \\(2n = 2 \\times 1990 = 3980\\)\n\nAgain, the same answer. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of a mistake in assuming the common factor or in the algebraic manipulation.\n\nIn the first method, factoring out 1990:\n\n\\(1990 \\times 1991 - 1989 \\times 1990 = 1990 \\times (1991 - 1989)\\)\n\nThis is correct because it's the distributive property in reverse.\n\nIn the second method, expanding the multiplications, I might have made arithmetic errors with large numbers, but I double-checked the calculations and they seem correct.\n\nIn the third method, using algebraic substitution, it's straightforward and hard to mistake.\n\nGiven that all three methods lead to the same result, I'm confident that 3980 is the correct answer.\n\nLooking back at the options, 3980 is option C.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 3980.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3980} \\]"
