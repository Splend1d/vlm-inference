                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about piracy on the high seas. It's asking when an illegal act of violence doesn't qualify as piracy. The options are:\n\nA. When it's against a public vessel of another State\n\nB. When it's for 'private ends'\n\nC. When it's by a warship, even if its crew has mutinied and taken control\n\nD. When it's not against another vessel and not for 'private ends'\n\nFirst, I need to recall what piracy is under international law. I think piracy is a specific type of illegal act on the high seas that involves violence or detention for private ends. It's usually considered a universal crime that any state can prosecute.\n\nOption A says when it's against a public vessel of another State. I think piracy can be committed against any vessel, whether public or private, but maybe there's a exception for public vessels. Maybe states have different rules for attacks on their naval or government ships.\n\nOption B says when it's for 'private ends'. I think piracy requires that the act is for private ends, like personal gain. So, if it's not for private ends, maybe it wouldn't be piracy. But that seems contrary to the definition I recall.\n\nOption C mentions a warship, even if its crew has mutinied. I know that warships have special status under international law. Maybe even if the crew takes control, it's still considered an act related to the state, not piracy.\n\nOption D combines two things: not against another vessel and not for private ends. That seems comprehensive, but I need to see if that's accurate.\n\nLet me look up the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to get a precise definition of piracy.\n\nAccording to UNCLOS, piracy consists of any of the following acts:\n\n(a) any illegal acts of violence or detention committed for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft;\n\n(b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft known to have committed such an act or in preparation for such an act;\n\n(c) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).\n\nHowever, UNCLOS also states that piracy is a crime that can be repressed by any state, and it doesn't apply to acts of war or to acts committed by government ships or aircraft for government non-commercial purposes.\n\nSo, considering that:\n\nOption A: Attacking a public vessel might not qualify as piracy because public vessels are governed differently. Perhaps such acts are considered acts of war or sovereign immunity applies.\n\nOption B: If it's not for private ends, then it might not be piracy. But according to UNCLOS, piracy requires acts for private ends.\n\nOption C: If it's a warship, even if mutinied, maybe it's still considered a state actor, and thus not piracy.\n\nOption D: Not against another vessel and not for private ends seems to cover situations where the act isn't directed at another vessel and isn't motivated by private gain.\n\nI think the correct answer is D: When it is not committed against another vessel and when it is not committed for 'private ends'.\n\nBecause piracy requires an illegal act of violence or detention committed against another vessel (or aircraft) for private ends. So, if it's not against another vessel and not for private ends, it wouldn't qualify as piracy.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf it's not against another vessel, then it's probably not piracy, as piracy typically involves attacks on vessels.\n\nAnd if it's not for private ends, then it might be considered a different type of illegal act, like acts of war or political motivations.\n\nSo, both conditions together make sense.\n\nOption A might be partially correct, but attacking a public vessel could still be piracy if it's for private ends, I think.\n\nOption B is tricky because piracy requires private ends, so if it's not for private ends, it shouldn't be piracy.\n\nOption C: Even if a warship's crew mutinies, perhaps it's still considered a state actor, and thus their acts might not be classified as piracy.\n\nBut according to UNCLOS, piracy is defined in such a way that it's about private ends and involves private ships or aircraft.\n\nSo, maybe option C is incorrect because warships are government vessels, and their acts, even if mutinied, might fall under different categories.\n\nWait, but if the crew mutinies and takes control for private ends, maybe it could be considered piracy.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the key is in the definition of piracy requiring private ends and involving private ships or aircraft.\n\nSo, if it's a warship, even if mutinied, it might still be considered a state actor, and thus not piracy.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nOption D seems the most comprehensive, as it covers both aspects: not against another vessel and not for private ends.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
