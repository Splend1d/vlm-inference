The neighbor's predecessor had received an easement from the woman's predecessor in title to cross the woman's land for access to the public highway. This access was desired even though the neighbor and his predecessor had other access to public roads. Recently, the woman erected a large solar collector on a portion of her land subject to the easement, even though the woman has other power resources. The location was essential to acquire the maximum sunlight. However, by erecting the collector there, the woman effectively cut off the neighbor's ability to use the easement. The local zoning code permits the use of solar collectors. The neighbor immediately sued to compel the woman to remove the solar collector. Must the solar collector be removed?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor has other means of access.\nB. No, because the zoning code permits the use of solar collectors.\nC. Yes, because the easement remains valid.\nD.

                    "text": "This is a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. So, there's this woman who owns a piece of land that borders a public highway to the south. Her neighbor owns the land right next to her, to the north. Back in the day, the neighbor's previous owner got an easement from the woman's previous owner. This easement allows them to cross the woman's land to get to the public highway. Even though the neighbor has other ways to access public roads, they still want to use this easement.\n\nRecently, the woman put up a big solar collector on her land, but the spot she chose is right where the easement is. This solar collector is blocking the neighbor's access through the easement. Now, the local zoning code allows solar collectors, so that's fine, but the neighbor is suing to make her remove it.\n\nThe question is, does the solar collector have to be removed?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the neighbor has other means of access.\n\nB. No, because the zoning code permits the use of solar collectors.\n\nC. Yes, because the easement remains valid.\n\nD. Yes, because the woman has other power resources.\n\nFirst, option A suggests that the neighbor has other ways to access public roads, so maybe the easement isn't that crucial. But just because there are other ways doesn't necessarily mean the easement can be blocked. Easements are legal rights, and even if there are alternative routes, the easement holder might still be entitled to use it as agreed.\n\nOption B mentions that the zoning code allows solar collectors, so perhaps the woman can put it wherever she wants. But easements are about private rights between landowners, separate from zoning regulations. So, even if zoning allows solar collectors, she can't necessarily block an existing easement with it.\n\nOption C says yes, the solar collector must be removed because the easement remains valid. This seems plausible because easements are legal rights that run with the land, meaning they stay even if the owners change. So, the neighbor should still have the right to use that path across the woman's land.\n\nOption D says yes, because the woman has other power resources. So, maybe she doesn't need the solar collector that much, and the neighbor's easement right is more important. But does the woman's personal situation affect the validity of the easement? Probably not; easements are about the rights of the land, not about the individuals' needs.\n\nThinking deeper, easements are meant to allow certain uses of the land by someone other than the owner, often for necessary access. In this case, the neighbor has an easement for access to the public highway. The woman putting up the solar collector is interfering with that easement.\n\nNow, the woman might argue that she has the right to use her land as she pleases, within zoning laws, but the easement limits her rights. She can't do things that would interfere with the easement's purpose.\n\nThe fact that she has other power resources might be irrelevant to the easement. The key issue is whether the solar collector is obstructing the easement.\n\nAlso, the neighbor sued immediately upon the installation of the solar collector, which suggests that the obstruction is significant.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that the easement takes precedence, and the solar collector should be removed to allow the neighbor to use the easement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Yes, because the easement remains valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
