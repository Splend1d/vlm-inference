I've got these four options, and I need to pick the one that best captures their idea.\n\nOption A says that scientists are guided by social values and interests, and they define and measure phenomena to support their theories. Hmm, that seems related to how scientific knowledge is influenced by social factors, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what Berger and Luckmann were getting at.\n\nOption B talks about people negotiating shared definitions of their situation and living according to these definitions, often forgetting that these social worlds aren't fixed and external. This sounds more like the concept of social constructionism, where reality is created through social interaction and shared understanding. It seems like this might be the right answer.\n\nOption C suggests that sociologists decide what constitutes social reality and measure only that. That sounds a bit like how sociologists study society, but it doesn't capture the idea that reality is constructed through social processes. It seems too narrow.\n\nOption D says that terms like 'reality' have no deeper meaning beyond the level of discourse. That sounds more like postmodernism, where reality is seen as a construct of language and discourse. While related, I don't think that's exactly what Berger and Luckmann meant.\n\nLooking back, Berger and Luckmann are known for their book \"The Social Construction of Reality,\" where they explore how reality is not simply out there, but is created and maintained through social interactions and shared beliefs. So, it seems like option B is the closest to their idea.\n\nBut to be sure, let me think about it again. In their book, they discuss how people collectively create meanings and social realities through their interactions, and how these realities can become taken for granted over time. That aligns well with option B, where people negotiate shared definitions and live according to them, often forgetting that these worlds are not fixed.\n\nOption A seems more about how scientific knowledge is shaped by social factors, which is a part of social constructionism, but it's more specific to science, whereas Berger and Luckmann were talking about reality in general.\n\nOption C seems to place too much agency in the hands of sociologists, as if they alone decide what reality is, which isn't accurate. Sociologists study social reality, but they don't create it.\n\nOption D seems to dismiss the idea of reality having any deeper meaning beyond words, which isn't quite what Berger and Luckmann were saying. They acknowledged that reality is constructed through social interactions, but it's not just about discourse; it's about the shared meanings and practices that constitute our social world.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is option B: people negotiate shared definitions of their situation and live according to these, often forgetting that these social worlds are not fixed and external.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
