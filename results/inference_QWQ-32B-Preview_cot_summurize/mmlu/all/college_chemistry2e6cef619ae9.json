                    "text": "So I've got this redox reaction to balance: MnO4^- + I^- + H^+ -> Mn^2+ + IO3^- + H2O. I need to figure out which statement is true once it's balanced. The options are about different ratios of the reactants and products. I'm a bit rusty on balancing redox equations, especially in acidic solutions, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in acidic solutions, we can use H^+ to balance the hydrogen atoms. The reaction is between permanganate ion (MnO4^-) and iodide ion (I^-), producing manganese(II) ion (Mn^2+) and iodate ion (IO3^-), with water as another product.\n\nTo balance this, I should separate it into half-reactions: one for the oxidation and one for the reduction.\n\nLet's start with the reduction half-reaction:\n\nMnO4^- -> Mn^2+\n\nI need to balance the manganese atoms, which they already are, since there's one Mn on each side.\n\nNext, balance the oxygen atoms. There are 4 oxygen atoms in MnO4^- and none in Mn^2+, so I need to add H2O to the product side:\n\nMnO4^- -> Mn^2+ + 4 H2O\n\nNow, balance the hydrogen atoms. There are 8 hydrogen atoms in 4 H2O, so I need to add 8 H^+ to the reactant side:\n\n8 H^+ + MnO4^- -> Mn^2+ + 4 H2O\n\nFinally, balance the charges. The left side has 8+1=9 positive charges from H^+ and MnO4^-, and the right side has 2+ from Mn^2+. So, I need to add 7 electrons to the left side to make the charges equal:\n\n8 H^+ + MnO4^- + 5 e^- -> Mn^2+ + 4 H2O\n\nWait, actually, the charge on the left would be 8+ (-1) = +7, and on the right, it's +2. So, +7 + 5 electrons equals +2, which balances the charges.\n\nNow, the oxidation half-reaction:\n\nI^- -> IO3^-\n\nBalance the iodine atoms, which are already balanced.\n\nBalance the oxygen atoms. There are 3 oxygen atoms in IO3^- and none in I^-, so add 3 H2O to the reactant side:\n\n3 H2O + I^- -> IO3^-\n\nNow, balance the hydrogen atoms. There are 6 hydrogen atoms in 3 H2O, so add 6 H^+ to the product side:\n\n3 H2O + I^- -> IO3^- + 6 H^+\n\nBalance the charges. The left side has 1- from I^- and 6+ from H^+, totaling +5. The right side has 1- from IO3^-, so to balance, add 6 electrons to the left side:\n\n3 H2O + I^- + 6 e^- -> IO3^- + 6 H^+\n\nNow, I need to combine these two half-reactions. To do that, the number of electrons gained in the reduction must equal the number lost in the oxidation. The reduction half-reaction involves 5 electrons, and the oxidation involves 6 electrons. So, I need to find a common multiple, which is 30. That means I'll multiply the reduction half-reaction by 6 and the oxidation half-reaction by 5.\n\nFirst, multiply the reduction half-reaction by 6:\n\n6*(8 H^+ + MnO4^- + 5 e^- -> Mn^2+ + 4 H2O)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n48 H^+ + 6 MnO4^- + 30 e^- -> 6 Mn^2+ + 24 H2O\n\nNow, multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 5:\n\n5*(3 H2O + I^- + 6 e^- -> IO3^- + 6 H^+)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n15 H2O + 5 I^- + 30 e^- -> 5 IO3^- + 30 H^+\n\nNow, add these two modified half-reactions together:\n\n48 H^+ + 6 MnO4^- + 30 e^- + 15 H2O + 5 I^- + 30 e^- -> 6 Mn^2+ + 24 H2O + 5 IO3^- + 30 H^+\n\nWait, actually, when adding, the electrons should cancel out since they're on both sides. Let me write it correctly:\n\n48 H^+ + 6 MnO4^- + 15 H2O + 5 I^- + 30 e^- -> 6 Mn^2+ + 24 H2O + 5 IO3^- + 30 H^+ + 30 e^-\n\nNow, cancel out the electrons:\n\n48 H^+ + 6 MnO4^- + 15 H2O + 5 I^- -> 6 Mn^2+ + 24 H2O + 5 IO3^- + 30 H^+\n\nNow, cancel out the water and H^+ where possible.\n\nSubtract 15 H2O from both sides:\n\n48 H^+ + 6 MnO4^- + 5 I^- -> 6 Mn^2+ + 9 H2O + 5 IO3^- + 30 H^+\n\nNow, subtract 30 H^+ from both sides:\n\n18 H^+ + 6 MnO4^- + 5 I^- -> 6 Mn^2+ + 9 H2O + 5 IO3^- + 0 H^+\n\nSo, the balanced equation is:\n\n18 H^+ + 6 MnO4^- + 5 I^- -> 6 Mn^2+ + 9 H2O + 5 IO3^-\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The I^- : IO3^- ratio is 3:1.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, I^- to IO3^- is 5:5, which is 1:1. So, A is false.\n\nB. The MnO4^- : I^- ratio is 6:5.\n\nIn the balanced equation, it's 6 MnO4^- to 5 I^-. So, B is true.\n\nC. The MnO4^- : Mn^2+ ratio is 3:1.\n\nIn the balanced equation, it's 6 MnO4^- to 6 Mn^2+, which is 1:1. So, C is false.\n\nD. The H^+ : I^- ratio is 2:1.\n\nIn the balanced equation, it's 18 H^+ to 5 I^-, which is 18:5, not 2:1. So, D is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
