                    "text": "Let's see which statement is correct here. I need to recall the differences between economic and accounting terms, especially regarding profits and costs.\n\nFirst, option A says: \"Economic Profits = Accounting Profits.\" I think this might not be accurate. Accounting profits are calculated by subtracting explicit costs from total revenue, whereas economic profits subtract both explicit and implicit costs from total revenue. So, economic profits are generally lower than accounting profits because they account for opportunity costs. Therefore, A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: \"Economic Costs = Explicit Costs plus Implicit Costs.\" Hmm, this sounds familiar. Explicit costs are direct out-of-pocket expenses, like wages and rent, while implicit costs are the opportunity costs of using resources owned by the firm. So, economic costs should indeed be the sum of both explicit and implicit costs. This seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"Economic Costs = Explicit Costs minus Implicit Costs.\" This contradicts what I just thought about option B. If economic costs include both explicit and implicit costs, subtracting implicit costs from explicit costs wouldn't make sense. This probably is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"Opportunity Costs = Economic Profits.\" I don't think this is right. Opportunity costs are the benefits foregone from the next best alternative, and economic profits are total revenue minus both explicit and implicit costs. So, opportunity costs are part of economic costs, but they are not equal to economic profits.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I believe option B is correct: \"Economic Costs = Explicit Costs plus Implicit Costs.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
