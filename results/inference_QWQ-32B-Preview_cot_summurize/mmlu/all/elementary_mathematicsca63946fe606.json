                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We start with the initial price of the stock, which is $24.75 at the beginning of the week. Then, we have to account for the gains and losses over each day from Monday to Friday.\n\nFirst, on Monday, the stock gains $2.50. So, we'll add that to the starting price:\n\n\\( 24.75 + 2.50 = 27.25 \\)\n\nNext, on Tuesday, the stock loses $3.25. We'll subtract that from the Monday's closing price:\n\n\\( 27.25 - 3.25 = 24.00 \\)\n\nThen, on Wednesday, it loses another $0.75:\n\n\\( 24.00 - 0.75 = 23.25 \\)\n\nAfter that, on Thursday, it gains $1.25:\n\n\\( 23.25 + 1.25 = 24.50 \\)\n\nFinally, on Friday, it gains $4.75:\n\n\\( 24.50 + 4.75 = 29.25 \\)\n\nSo, at the end of Friday, the stock price should be $29.25.\n\nLet me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nStarting at $24.75.\n\nMonday: +$2.50 \u2192 24.75 + 2.50 = 27.25\n\nTuesday: -$3.25 \u2192 27.25 - 3.25 = 24.00\n\nWednesday: -$0.75 \u2192 24.00 - 0.75 = 23.25\n\nThursday: +$1.25 \u2192 23.25 + 1.25 = 24.50\n\nFriday: +$4.75 \u2192 24.50 + 4.75 = 29.25\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. $12.25\n\nB. $25.75\n\nC. $29.25\n\nD. $37.25\n\nThe correct answer should be C. $29.25.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by summing up all the gains and losses first, and then adding them to the initial price.\n\nTotal gains: $2.50 (Monday) + $1.25 (Thursday) + $4.75 (Friday) = $2.50 + $1.25 = $3.75; then $3.75 + $4.75 = $8.50\n\nTotal losses: $3.25 (Tuesday) + $0.75 (Wednesday) = $3.25 + $0.75 = $4.00\n\nNet change: Total gains - total losses = $8.50 - $4.00 = $4.50\n\nAdding this net change to the initial price: $24.75 + $4.50 = $29.25\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same answer, $29.25.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider using negative values for losses and positive for gains, and then sum them up along with the initial price.\n\nInitial price: $24.75\n\nMonday: +$2.50\n\nTuesday: -$3.25\n\nWednesday: -$0.75\n\nThursday: +$1.25\n\nFriday: +$4.75\n\nTotal price = 24.75 + 2.50 - 3.25 - 0.75 + 1.25 + 4.75\n\nLet's compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, 24.75 + 2.50 = 27.25\n\nThen, 27.25 - 3.25 = 24.00\n\nNext, 24.00 - 0.75 = 23.25\n\nThen, 23.25 + 1.25 = 24.50\n\nFinally, 24.50 + 4.75 = 29.25\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's clear that the price of the share at the end of Friday is $29.25, which corresponds to option C.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of a mistake in the calculations. Maybe I misread one of the gains or losses.\n\nLet's list them again:\n\n- Monday: +$2.50\n\n- Tuesday: -$3.25\n\n- Wednesday: -$0.75\n\n- Thursday: +$1.25\n\n- Friday: +$4.75\n\nAdding them up:\n\n2.50 - 3.25 - 0.75 + 1.25 + 4.75\n\nLet's add the positive values: 2.50 + 1.25 + 4.75 = 8.50\n\nNow, the negative values: -3.25 - 0.75 = -4.00\n\nNet change: 8.50 - 4.00 = 4.50\n\nInitial price: 24.75 + 4.50 = 29.25\n\nEverything checks out. I'm confident that $29.25 is the correct final price of the stock at the end of Friday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\, \\$29.25} \\]"
