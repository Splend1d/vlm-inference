                    "text": "So I'm trying to wrap my head around this genetics problem. Let's see if I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an autosomal gene that was fixed, meaning that everyone in the population had the same allele for that gene. Then, a mutation introduces a new allele, and this new allele is inherited according to incomplete dominance. So, incomplete dominance means that the heterozygote has a phenotype that's intermediate between the two homozygotes.\n\nNext, natural selection acts on this locus through stabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection favors the average phenotype and selects against extreme variations. In terms of alleles, this usually means that heterozygotes have a fitness advantage over homozygotes.\n\nSo, over many generations, what should happen?\n\nOption A says that the proportions of both types of homozygotes should decrease. That sounds plausible because stabilizing selection favors heterozygotes, so homozygotes might be selected against.\n\nOption B says that the proportion of heterozygous individuals should remain constant. Hmm, but if stabilizing selection is favoring heterozygotes, maybe their proportion would increase rather than stay the same.\n\nOption C suggests that the population's average heterozygosity should increase. That aligns with stabilizing selection favoring heterozygotes.\n\nOption D combines A and C, which seems possible if both homozygotes decrease and heterozygotes increase.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. In incomplete dominance, the heterozygote has a phenotype that's intermediate between the two homozygotes. If stabilizing selection favors the intermediate phenotype, then heterozygotes should have higher fitness than either homozygote.\n\nOver time, this should lead to an increase in the proportion of heterozygotes and a decrease in both homozygotes. So, both A and C seem correct.\n\nBut wait, in population genetics, there's something called balanced polymorphism, where both alleles are maintained in the population because heterozygotes have higher fitness. Maybe that's what's happening here.\n\nIn the case of stabilizing selection with incomplete dominance, the population might reach a equilibrium where the frequency of heterozygotes is high, and both homozygotes are present at lower frequencies.\n\nSo, over many generations, the proportions of both homozygotes should decrease, and the average heterozygosity should increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Both A and C.\n\nBut let me double-check. If stabilizing selection is acting, and heterozygotes have the optimal phenotype, then indeed, their fitness is higher, leading to an increase in heterozygosity.\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u7eaf\u5408\u5b50\u7684\u9891\u7387\u5e94\u8be5\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, over time, we'd see a decrease in both types of homozygotes and an increase in heterozygotes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Both A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
