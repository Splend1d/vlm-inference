The options are carbon atoms, oxygen atoms, nitrogen atoms, and hydrogen atoms. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that both amino acids and carbohydrates are important biomolecules, but they serve different purposes in living organisms. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are essential for various functions like enzyme catalysis, structural support, and signaling. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are mainly involved in energy storage and production.\n\nNow, looking at the elements present in each. Carbohydrates are typically composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The general formula is often cited as Cn(H2O)m, although that's a bit of a simplification. Amino acids, however, have a more complex structure. They contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and additionally, nitrogen. Some amino acids also contain other elements like sulfur.\n\nSo, comparing the two, both have carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But amino acids have nitrogen, which carbohydrates generally do not. There might be some exceptions, but in general, carbohydrates don't contain nitrogen.\n\nLet's double-check this. Carbohydrates are made up of sugars and their polymers, like starch, cellulose, and glycogen. These are all based on carbon rings with hydroxyl groups attached. No nitrogen there.\n\nAmino acids, though, have an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxyl group (-COOH), along with a variable side chain. The amino group is where the nitrogen comes in.\n\nSo, it seems pretty clear that the presence of nitrogen atoms is a feature of amino acids that is not found in carbohydrates.\n\nWait a minute, are there any carbohydrates that contain nitrogen? I'm not sure. Maybe some glycoproteins have nitrogen, but that's proteins combined with sugars, not pure carbohydrates.\n\nUpon a quick think, I can't recall any carbohydrates that contain nitrogen as a regular component. So, I think option C, nitrogen atoms, is the correct answer here.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Carbon atoms - Both amino acids and carbohydrates have carbon.\n\nB. Oxygen atoms - Both have oxygen.\n\nC. Nitrogen atoms - Amino acids have nitrogen, carbohydrates do not.\n\nD. Hydrogen atoms - Both have hydrogen.\n\nTherefore, the feature not found in carbohydrates is the presence of nitrogen atoms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
