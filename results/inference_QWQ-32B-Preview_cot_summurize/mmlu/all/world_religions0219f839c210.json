It's supposed to be a form of spiritual expression and is often associated with the gifts of the Holy Spirit in Christianity.\n\nLet me see why the other options might not be the best answers.\n\nA. Evangelicalism is a broad movement in Protestant Christianity that emphasizes personal conversion, biblical authority, and evangelism. While some evangelical churches may have members who speak in tongues, it's not a defining characteristic of the entire movement.\n\nB. Pietism is a branch of Lutheranism that focuses on individual piety and a more personal relationship with God. It emphasizes moral living and a devout lifestyle but doesn't specifically highlight speaking in tongues as a central practice.\n\nD. Fundamentalism is a conservative approach to Christianity that stresses the literal interpretation of the Bible and defends traditional beliefs against modern influences. While some fundamentalist churches may accept speaking in tongues, it's not a distinctive feature of fundamentalism as a whole.\n\nSo, based on this, Pentecostalism seems to be the most accurate answer because it is known for its emphasis on the gifts of the Holy Spirit, including speaking in tongues.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
