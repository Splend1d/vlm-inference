                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal scenario. So, we have a woman who hired a builder to construct a house based on specific plans and specs created by her architect. They agreed on a price of $250,000 with a completion deadline of four months. A couple of weeks after signing the building contract, the builder reaches out to a lumber yard to buy the necessary wood for the house. The builder and the lumber yard owner enter into a valid written agreement where the lumber yard agrees to supply the required lumber for $10,000, payable within 30 days.\n\nNow, a week later, a fire breaks out and destroys a significant portion of the lumber yard's lumber supply. Because of this, the lumber yard refuses to supply the lumber to the builder. The builder, unable to find another lumber supplier, notifies the woman that he can't complete her house on time. So, the woman decides to sue the lumber yard owner for breach of contract. The question is, will she prevail?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because by operation of law the woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract.\n\nB. Yes, but only if the builder's contract with the owner of the lumber yard was not discharged by the fire.\n\nC. No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.\n\nD. No, because the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard.\n\nFirst, let's understand the concept of privity of contract. Privity of contract generally means that only the parties to a contract can enforce it or sue for breach. So, if the woman wasn't a party to the contract between the builder and the lumber yard, she might not have a direct right to sue the lumber yard owner.\n\nOption C states that there's no privity of contract between the woman and the lumber yard owner, which seems correct because the contract was between the builder and the lumber yard owner, not the woman.\n\nOption D suggests that the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the lumber yard owner. An incidental beneficiary is someone who benefits from a contract but doesn't have the right to enforce it or sue for breach because their interest wasn't intended to be protected by the contract.\n\nIn contrast, a third-party beneficiary is someone whom the contracting parties intend to benefit directly, and such a beneficiary can enforce the contract. So, if the woman is considered a third-party beneficiary, she might have the right to sue the lumber yard owner for breach of contract.\n\nLooking back at option A, it suggests that the woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the lumber yard owner. Assignment is when one party transfers their rights under a contract to a third party. Equitable assignment might refer to a situation where the law implies an assignment based on the circumstances.\n\nHowever, in this case, there's no indication that the builder assigned his rights against the lumber yard owner to the woman. The contract was between the builder and the lumber yard owner, and the woman was not a party to that contract.\n\nOption B says yes, but only if the builder's contract with the lumber yard owner was not discharged by the fire. This touches on the concept of frustration of purpose or impossibility due to the fire. If the fire destroyed the lumber yard's supply, it might be considered an event that discharges the lumber yard from its contractual obligations, depending on the terms of the contract and applicable law.\n\nBut even if the contract wasn't discharged by the fire, the question remains whether the woman, who is not a party to that contract, can sue the lumber yard owner directly.\n\nGiven these considerations, options C and D seem more plausible because they address the issue of privity and the woman's relationship to the contract between the builder and the lumber yard owner.\n\nOption C states that privity of contract doesn't exist between the woman and the lumber yard owner, which is accurate. Option D suggests that the woman is only an incidental beneficiary, which might also be correct.\n\nHowever, there might be a finer point here. In some jurisdictions, if a contract is made for the benefit of a third party, that third party can enforce the contract, even if not a party to it. This is known as a third-party beneficiary contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the builder contracted with the lumber yard to supply lumber for the woman's house. One could argue that the woman was the intended beneficiary of that contract, as the lumber was needed to build her house.\n\nBut typically, for the woman to be a third-party beneficiary, the contract between the builder and the lumber yard would need to expressly or implicitly indicate that the woman was intended to receive a direct benefit from the contract, and that the parties intended to allow her to enforce the contract.\n\nIn this case, it's possible that the contract between the builder and the lumber yard didn't mention the woman or intend to benefit her directly. It was likely a standard supply contract between the builder and the lumber yard.\n\nTherefore, it's more likely that the woman is an incidental beneficiary, meaning she benefits from the contract but doesn't have the right to enforce it or sue for breach.\n\nGiven that, option D seems correct: No, because the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the lumber yard owner.\n\nOption C also seems correct: No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.\n\nBetween C and D, I think D provides a more precise reason, specifying that she's an incidental beneficiary.\n\nOption A about equitable assignment doesn't seem applicable here, as there's no assignment mentioned.\n\nOption B is partially correct in that the contract's validity depends on whether it was discharged by the fire, but it doesn't address the main issue of the woman's standing to sue.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is likely D: No, because the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
