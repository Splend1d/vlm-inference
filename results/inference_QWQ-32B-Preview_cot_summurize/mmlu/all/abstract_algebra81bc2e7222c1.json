                    "text": "So I've got these two statements about group theory, and I need to determine if they're true or false. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** If a finite group has order \\(n\\), then the group contains a subgroup of order \\(d\\) for every positive divisor \\(d\\) of \\(n\\).\n\nHmm, this sounds familiar. I think it's related to Sylow's Theorems or maybe Lagrange's Theorem. Lagrange's Theorem says that the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group. But this statement is going the other way: it's saying that for every divisor of the group's order, there exists a subgroup of that order.\n\nI recall that Lagrange only gives us one direction: the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group, but it doesn't guarantee that for every divisor, there's a subgroup of that order. So maybe this statement is false.\n\nWait, but there are groups where this is true. For example, in cyclic groups, for every divisor \\(d\\) of \\(n\\), there is a subgroup of order \\(d\\). But not all finite groups are cyclic. So perhaps there are counterexamples where the group has order \\(n\\), and there's a divisor \\(d\\) of \\(n\\), but no subgroup of order \\(d\\).\n\nLet me think of a specific example. What about the alternating group \\(A_4\\)? Its order is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Does \\(A_4\\) have subgroups of all these orders?\n\n- Order 1: trivial subgroup, yes.\n\n- Order 2: Are there subgroups of order 2? Well, \\(A_4\\) consists of even permutations of 4 elements. There are elements of order 2 in \\(A_4\\), like double transpositions (e.g., (12)(34)), so subgroups generated by these should be of order 2.\n\n- Order 3: There are cycles of length 3 in \\(A_4\\), like (123), so subgroups generated by these should be of order 3.\n\n- Order 4: Does \\(A_4\\) have a subgroup of order 4? Well, \\(A_4\\) has a Klein four-group, which is a subgroup of order 4.\n\n- Order 6: This is tricky. Does \\(A_4\\) have a subgroup of order 6? I think \\(A_4\\) does not have a subgroup of order 6. I recall that any subgroup of order 6 in \\(S_4\\) would be isomorphic to \\(S_3\\), but \\(A_4\\) doesn't have such a subgroup.\n\n- Order 12: The whole group, yes.\n\nSo, in \\(A_4\\), which has order 12, there is no subgroup of order 6, even though 6 divides 12. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\(a\\) belongs to a finite group, then \\(|a|\\) divides \\(|G|\\).\n\nThis sounds like Lagrange's Theorem again. Lagrange's Theorem states that the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group. Since the order of an element \\(a\\), denoted \\(|a|\\), is the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by \\(a\\), which is \\(\\langle a \\rangle\\), it follows that \\(|\\langle a \\rangle|\\) divides \\(|G|\\). But \\(|\\langle a \\rangle| = |a|\\), so indeed, \\(|a|\\) divides \\(|G|\\).\n\nSo, Statement 2 is true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement 1: False\n\n- Statement 2: True\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
