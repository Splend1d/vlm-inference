The options are chain migration, cluster migration, circular migration, and international migration. I need to choose the most appropriate one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nChain migration is when people migrate to a country because they have family members or relatives already living there. It's like a chain, where one person migrates and then helps others to follow.\n\nCluster migration is when people migrate to a specific area where there are existing communities or networks from their home country. It's like clustering together in one place.\n\nCircular migration is when people move back and forth between their home country and another country, often for work. They might go to another country to work for a season and then return home.\n\nInternational migration is when people move from one country to another. It's a broad term that includes many types of migration, including the other three options.\n\nNow, considering farm workers from another country, I need to think about their patterns of movement.\n\nFarm workers often migrate seasonally to work on farms during planting or harvesting seasons. After the season ends, they might return to their home country or move to another area for different farm work.\n\nThis sounds a lot like circular migration because they are moving back and forth between their home and the host country on a regular basis, usually for work.\n\nChain migration is about family connections, which might be a factor, but it's not specifically about the pattern of moving for work.\n\nCluster migration is about settling in specific areas with existing communities, but again, it's more about the location than the reason for migration.\n\nInternational migration is too broad because it doesn't specify the pattern of movement.\n\nSo, I think circular migration is the most accurate answer here.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there are any other aspects to consider.\n\nPerhaps some farm workers stay in the host country longer term and bring their families, but the question is about farm workers from another country during the year, which suggests temporary, possibly seasonal work.\n\nTherefore, circular migration seems to fit best.\n\nI'll go with option C, circular migration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
