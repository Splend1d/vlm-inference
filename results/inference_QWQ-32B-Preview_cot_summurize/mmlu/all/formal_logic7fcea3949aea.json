(\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 Fx)\n\nB. (\u2200x)(Fx \u2283 Sx)\n\nC. (\u2200x)(Fx \u2228 Sx)\n\nD. (\u2200x)(Fx \u2261 Sx)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the sentence means. \"All first-year students\" means every student who is a first-year student, and \"take a swim test\" means they perform or undergo a swim test.\n\nNow, I need to define my predicates. Let's say:\n\n- Fx: x is a first-year student.\n\n- Sx: x takes a swim test.\n\nSo, the sentence is saying that for every x, if x is a first-year student, then x takes a swim test.\n\nIn predicate logic, \"all\" corresponds to the universal quantifier (\u2200), and \"if... then\" corresponds to the conditional (\u2283).\n\nSo, \"All first-year students take a swim test\" would be translated as \"For all x, if x is a first-year student, then x takes a swim test.\"\n\nThat translates to (\u2200x)(Fx \u2283 Sx).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 Fx): This would mean \"All who take a swim test are first-year students,\" which is not the same as the original sentence.\n\nB. (\u2200x)(Fx \u2283 Sx): This matches my translation, meaning \"All first-year students take a swim test.\"\n\nC. (\u2200x)(Fx \u2228 Sx): This means \"For all x, x is a first-year student or x takes a swim test,\" which is not the same as the original sentence.\n\nD. (\u2200x)(Fx \u2261 Sx): This means \"For all x, x is a first-year student if and only if x takes a swim test,\" which is too strong; it implies that only first-year students take the swim test, and all first-year students do.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is option B: (\u2200x)(Fx \u2283 Sx).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
