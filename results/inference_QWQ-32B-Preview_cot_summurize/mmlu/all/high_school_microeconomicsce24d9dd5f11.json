                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about cartels in economics. So, a cartel is essentially a group of firms that agree to coordinate their production and pricing decisions to maximize their collective profits. This is different from perfect competition or even monopolistic competition, where firms act independently.\n\nOption A says: \"normal profits for all cartel firms.\" Normal profits are when a firm's total revenues equal its total costs, including opportunity costs. In other words, the firm isn't making economic profits above what's considered normal in the industry. But in a cartel, the whole point is to restrict output and drive up prices to earn higher than normal profits. So, I don't think A is correct because cartels aim for supernormal profits, not just normal profits.\n\nOption B: \"an incentive for cartel firms to cheat on the cartel agreement.\" This is an interesting one. In theory, cartels work best when all members cooperate and stick to the agreed-upon production quotas and prices. However, each firm has an incentive to cheat by producing more than its quota and selling extra output at the higher cartel price. This way, the cheating firm can increase its own profits at the expense of others in the cartel. This is a classic problem in game theory, often illustrated by the Prisoner's Dilemma. So, it seems likely that there's always an incentive for firms to cheat.\n\nOption C: \"profit maximization by individual firms in the cartel.\" Hmm. In a cartel, the goal is to maximize joint profits, not necessarily the profits of each individual firm. In fact, some firms might be required to produce less than they would otherwise to maintain the higher price level. So, while the cartel as a whole is trying to maximize profits, individual firms might not be maximizing their own profits if they are adhering to the cartel's production quotas.\n\nOption D: \"allocative efficiency.\" Allocative efficiency occurs when resources are allocated in such a way that it's impossible to make one person better off without making someone else worse off. In perfect competition, allocative efficiency is achieved because price equals marginal cost. However, in a cartel, prices are set above marginal cost to restrict output and earn higher profits. This results in a deadweight loss, meaning that society as a whole is worse off because some efficient transactions aren't taking place. So, cartels do not achieve allocative efficiency.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems the most accurate. There's always an incentive for cartel firms to cheat on the agreement because they can potentially increase their own profits by producing more and selling at the higher price. This is a fundamental challenge that cartels face, and it's one of the reasons why cartels are often unstable and may not last in the long run.\n\nBut let's double-check. If cartels are successful in maintaining their agreement, they can achieve higher profits than in competitive markets, so A might not be entirely wrong, but as I thought earlier, they aim for supernormal profits, not just normal profits. Option C is tricky because while the cartel tries to maximize joint profits, individual firms might not be maximizing their own profits if they comply with production limits. Option D is clearly incorrect because cartels lead to allocative inefficiency.\n\nSo, I think B is the best answer here. It highlights the inherent instability of cartels due to the incentive for individual firms to cheat, which can lead to the cartel's breakdown over time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
