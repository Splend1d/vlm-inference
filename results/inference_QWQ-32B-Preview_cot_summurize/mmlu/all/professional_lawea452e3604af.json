Before relocating, the husband met with an attorney to seek his advice about how he could gain full custody of his son.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out whether the husband should be found guilty of kidnapping in this scenario. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a divorce decree that gives custody of the son to the wife, with the husband having weekend visitation rights. The husband then gets a new job in a neighboring state and wants to gain full custody of his son. He consults an attorney, who gives him incorrect advice, saying that the new state doesn't give full faith and credit to divorce proceedings from the previous state. Based on this advice, the husband thinks he can take his son to live with him without violating any laws.\n\nHowever, the reality is that his new state does honor and give full faith and credit to other states' divorce decrees. So, when he picks up his son for a scheduled visitation and doesn't return him, instead taking him to live in the new state, he's violating the existing custody order.\n\nNow, he's been charged with kidnapping, and the statute defines it as \"knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location.\" The question is whether he should be found guilty under this definition.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree.\n\nB. Yes, because mistake of law is no defense.\n\nC. No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.\n\nD. No, because he received erroneous legal advice.\n\nOption A seems straightforward. He did transport his son to another state against the custody order. But was it unlawful? Well, according to the correct law, yes, it was, because the new state honors the previous state's divorce decree. But he was operating under the mistaken belief that it didn't, based on his attorney's advice.\n\nOption B says yes, because mistake of law is no defense. That's a general legal principle: ignorance of the law doesn't excuse illegal behavior. But is there more to it in this specific case?\n\nOption C says no, because he lacked the requisite state of mind. Kidnapping requires knowing abduction. Maybe his intention wasn't to unlawfully take his son, but to exercise what he believed was his right to custody based on his attorney's advice.\n\nOption D says no, because he received erroneous legal advice. This is similar to C but focuses on the source of his mistake.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the mental state required for kidnapping, especially since it involves his own child and he was acting based on legal advice, albeit incorrect.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, kidnapping requires that the defendant acted with the specific intent to abduct and move the victim without the consent of the legal guardian. In this case, the husband believed, albeit mistakenly, that he had the right to take his son based on his attorney's advice. So, did he act with the intent to unlawfully abduct his son?\n\nGiven that he thought his attorney's advice was correct, his action was based on a misunderstanding of the law. Does that negate the requisite intent for kidnapping?\n\nAdditionally, attorneys are supposed to give correct legal advice, but sometimes they make mistakes. Should the husband be penalized for his attorney's error in this critical matter?\n\nI recall that mistake of law is generally not a defense, but there might be exceptions, particularly when the mistake is made in good faith and involves a complex area of law where even attorneys can err.\n\nIn this scenario, the husband acted based on professional legal advice, which turned out to be wrong. Does that affect his criminal liability?\n\nI need to consider the purpose of the kidnapping statute. It's designed to protect individuals from being forcibly moved against their will, often in dangerous or harmful situations. In this case, the husband took his own son, whom he has a relationship with, to live with him in another state.\n\nWhile it was a violation of the custody order, was it comparable to the typical kidnapping scenario where someone is abducted against their will for ransom or harm?\n\nPerhaps not. So, maybe the circumstances mitigate his intent to commit a criminal act.\n\nOn the other hand, the statute clearly defines kidnapping as \"knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location.\" If he knowingly took his son and moved him to another state, then technically, he fits the definition.\n\nBut again, his knowledge included the belief that he had the legal right to do so, based on his attorney's advice.\n\nI think the crux of the matter is whether his belief, even if mistaken, affects his criminal intent.\n\nIn some crimes, particularly those requiring specific intent, a mistake of fact or law can be relevant to determining guilt. However, as I mentioned, mistake of law is generally not a defense.\n\nBut in this case, it's not just any mistake; it's a mistake based on professional legal advice that turned out to be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the court would consider this in determining whether he acted with the necessary intent to commit kidnapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court would hold that, as an adult, he is responsible for his actions and should have ensured the accuracy of the legal advice he received, or even sought a second opinion.\n\nBut requiring him to verify his attorney's advice seems problematic. People rely on attorneys to provide accurate legal counsel.\n\nWait, attorneys are officers of the court and are expected to know the law. If an attorney gives incorrect advice, should the client bear the brunt of that mistake in a criminal context?\n\nI'm not sure. It's a tricky situation.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nOption A: Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it doesn't address his state of mind or the advice he received.\n\nOption B: Yes, because mistake of law is no defense.\n\nThis aligns with the general legal principle, but perhaps there are exceptions, especially in cases involving custody and parental rights.\n\nOption C: No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.\n\nThis seems plausible if his belief that he had the right to take his son was genuine and based on professional advice.\n\nOption D: No, because he received erroneous legal advice.\n\nThis is similar to C but emphasizes the source of his mistake.\n\nI think Option C is stronger because it directly addresses the intent required for the crime.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the answer is C. No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.\n\nThe husband acted under the mistaken belief that he had the legal right to take his son, based on his attorney's advice. This mistake affects his intent to commit a criminal act, as he didn't know he was violating the law. Therefore, he should not be found guilty of kidnapping.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
