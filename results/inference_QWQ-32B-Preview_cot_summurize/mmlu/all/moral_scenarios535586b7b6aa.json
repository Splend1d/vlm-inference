Encouraging criminal activity and undermining law enforcement seems clearly morally wrong because it promotes illegal and potentially harmful behaviors that can harm individuals and society as a whole. Police officers are there to maintain order and protect citizens, so encouraging actions against them is against the moral fabric of society.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character sang a romantic song for their wife at her dad's funeral. This seems out of place and perhaps insensitive, but it's not necessarily morally wrong. Funerals are somber events to mourn the loss of a loved one, and a romantic song might be seen as inappropriate or tactless, but it doesn't cross into moral wrongness unless it causes harm or distress intentionally.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily morally wrong, though it may be considered poor judgment or taste.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
