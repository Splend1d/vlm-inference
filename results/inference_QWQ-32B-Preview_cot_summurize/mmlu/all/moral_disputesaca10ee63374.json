                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about a premise in Kamm's discussion on \"lack of imagination.\" So, I need to recall what Kamm says about that. I think Kamm is a philosopher who talks about ethics, particularly in the context of genetic enhancement and whatnot.\n\nOption A says that genetic enhancement is always morally permissible. Hmm, that sounds too absolute. I don't recall Kamm saying that. In fact, I think she might argue that there are limits or conditions under which genetic enhancement is permissible, so maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B says that nature ought to be honored over personal choice. That sounds like a possible premise someone might hold against genetic enhancement. Kamm might be discussing how some people believe we should respect nature and not interfere with it through genetic manipulation. But I'm not sure if this is the specific \"lack of imagination\" argument she's referring to.\n\nOption C says that most people's conception of the varieties of goods is limited. This sounds interesting. The \"lack of imagination\" argument might be that people don't fully appreciate the range of possible goods or valuable traits that could be achieved through genetic enhancement because their imagination is limited. So, they might oppose enhancement not because it's inherently wrong, but because they can't envision the full spectrum of possibilities.\n\nOption D says that we ought to always leave the development of valuable traits up to chance. That seems extreme. While some might argue that we should let nature take its course, saying \"always\" leave it to chance might not align with Kamm's nuanced view. She might argue for a balance between natural development and intentional enhancement.\n\nConsidering these options, I think option C is the most likely correct answer. The \"lack of imagination\" argument suggests that people underestimate the potential benefits of genetic enhancement because they can't imagine the diverse goods it could produce. Therefore, their opposition stems from a limited conception of what is possible and valuable.\n\nTo confirm, I should think about why Kamm would discuss this. Perhaps she is arguing that those who oppose genetic enhancement are doing so based on a narrow view of human flourishing and that expanding our imagination about what constitutes a good life could justify certain forms of enhancement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she is critiquing the idea that natural traits are inherently superior, by pointing out that our imagination is limited by what we've experienced naturally, and that genetic enhancement could open up new possibilities that we can't currently conceive of.\n\nIn any case, option C seems to best capture the essence of a \"lack of imagination\" premise in this context. So, I'll go with C: most people's conception of the varieties of goods is limited.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
