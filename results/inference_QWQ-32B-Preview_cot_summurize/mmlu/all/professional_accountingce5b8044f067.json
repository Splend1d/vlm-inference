                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the yearly yield on an investment in a limousine. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the costs and revenues involved.\n\n**Costs:**\n\n1. **Initial purchase cost:** $98,000\n\n2. **Daily costs:** $50 per day\n\n**Revenues:**\n\n1. **Renting the limousine:** $245 per hour\n\n2. **Average hours per day:** 2 hours\n\nSince the question says to assume working all year round, i.e., every day of the year, I'll need to calculate the total annual revenue and subtract the total annual costs to find the net yield.\n\nLet's start by calculating the daily revenue.\n\n**Daily Revenue:**\n\nRent per hour: $245\n\nHours per day: 2\n\nDaily revenue = 245 * 2 = $490\n\n**Daily Costs:**\n\nDaily costs are given as $50.\n\nSo, **daily net profit** = daily revenue - daily costs = 490 - 50 = $440\n\nNow, to find the annual net profit, I need to know the number of days in a year.\n\n**Days in a year:** 365\n\n**Annual net profit:** 440 * 365\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n440 * 365 = 440 * 300 + 440 * 65 = 132,000 + 28,600 = $160,600\n\nNow, the initial investment was $98,000.\n\nTo find the yield, I need to calculate the return on investment (ROI), which is the net profit divided by the initial investment, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**Yield (%) = (Annual net profit / Initial investment) * 100**\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nYield (%) = (160,600 / 98,000) * 100\n\nFirst, divide 160,600 by 98,000.\n\n160,600 \u00f7 98,000 = 1.64 (approximately)\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n1.64 * 100 = 164%\n\nSo, the estimated yearly yield on the investment is 164%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 164%\n\nB. 1.64%\n\nC. 0.45%\n\nD. 183%\n\nIt seems that option A is correct.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nDaily revenue: 245 * 2 = 490\n\nDaily costs: 50\n\nDaily net profit: 490 - 50 = 440\n\nAnnual net profit: 440 * 365 = 160,600\n\nInitial investment: 98,000\n\nYield: (160,600 / 98,000) * 100 = approximately 164%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the time value of money or depreciation of the limousine, but the question doesn't mention anything about that. It seems like it's focusing on straightforward revenue and costs.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. 164%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
