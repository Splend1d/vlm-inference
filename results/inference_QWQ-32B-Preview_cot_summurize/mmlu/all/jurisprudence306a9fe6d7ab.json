                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on Kant's philosophy, but I think I can figure this out. So, Kant's categorical imperative is a key concept in his moral philosophy. It's about how we should make decisions based on universal moral laws.\n\nOption A says, \"You must not consciously harm another person.\" That sounds a lot like the idea of not treating people as mere means to an end, which is related to Kant's concept of treating people as ends in themselves. But I think there's a more direct statement of the categorical imperative than this.\n\nOption B says, \"You must always act in the best interests of the community.\" Hmm, that sounds more like utilitarianism, where the goal is to maximize overall happiness or benefit. Kant was critiquing that approach, so I don't think this is his categorical imperative.\n\nOption C says, \"You must treat human beings as means rather than ends.\" Wait, I think I have this backwards. Doesn't Kant say we should treat people as ends in themselves, not just as means to an end? So this seems opposite to what I remember of Kant's ethics.\n\nOption D says, \"You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.\" This sounds close to the idea of universalizability, which is central to the categorical imperative. Kant argues that moral maxims should be universal and applicable to everyone in similar situations.\n\nLet me think about this again. The categorical imperative, as I recall, has a few formulations. One is the universalizability principle, which says that you should only act on maxims that you can will to become universal laws. Another is the idea of treating humanity, whether in yourself or in others, always as an end and never simply as a means.\n\nGiven that, option D seems closest to the universalizability aspect, while option C is incorrect because it suggests treating humans as means rather than ends, which is against Kant's view.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that the categorical imperative encompasses multiple ideas. However, since it's a multiple-choice question, I need to pick the best single option.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way to approach this. Let's look at Kant's own words. He formulated the categorical imperative in several ways, but one well-known formulation is: \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\"\n\nAnother formulation is: \"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.\"\n\nGiven these formulations, none of the options perfectly capture Kant's words, but option D seems closest to the first formulation about universalizing your maxims.\n\nOption A is similar to the idea of not harming others, which could be derived from Kant's ethics, but it's not the direct statement of the categorical imperative.\n\nOption B is more utilitarian, as I thought earlier.\n\nOption C is contrary to Kant's view.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: \"You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's a better way to express Kant's categorical imperative in the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I understand that the categorical imperative is about universalizing your maxims.\n\nIn that case, option D is the closest, even if it's not perfectly worded.\n\nSo, I'll go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
