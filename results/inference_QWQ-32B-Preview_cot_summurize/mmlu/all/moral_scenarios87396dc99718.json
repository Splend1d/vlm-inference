The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I picked up the stranger's briefcase and ran.\n\nScenario 2: I sold my cows for money.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I need to look at each scenario separately and decide whether it's morally wrong or not, based on general US standards around 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I picked up the stranger's briefcase and ran.\"\n\nHmm, picking up someone else's belongings without their permission and running away with them sounds a lot like theft. In the US, theft is generally considered morally wrong. It's taking something that doesn't belong to you without the owner's consent, which can cause harm or loss to the other person.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I sold my cows for money.\"\n\nSelling one's own property, like cows, for money seems like a normal economic transaction. As long as the cows are yours to sell and the sale is conducted legally, there doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action.\n\nIn fact, selling animals for profit is a common practice in agriculture. It might raise ethical questions about the treatment of animals, but just the act of selling them for money doesn't seem morally wrong in itself, especially according to ordinary standards.\n\nSo, based on this analysis:\n\nScenario 1: Wrong\n\nScenario 2: Not wrong\n\nThat matches option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider some additional aspects.\n\nFor Scenario 1, is there any context where picking up a stranger's briefcase and running could be justified or not considered wrong?\n\nWell, maybe if the briefcase was left unattended and you were trying to return it to the owner, but in this case, it says \"picked up... and ran,\" which implies keeping it or at least not returning it immediately. So, still seems like theft.\n\nFor Scenario 2, could selling cows be wrong in some moral frameworks?\n\nSome people might have ethical concerns about owning or selling animals, but in general US moral standards as of 2020, selling one's own animals for money is acceptable, especially if it's done humanely and within the law.\n\nTherefore, my initial assessment stands: Scenario 1 is wrong, Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
