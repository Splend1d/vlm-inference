                    "text": "In atomic physics, particularly when dealing with transitions between energy levels in hydrogen-like atoms, certain selection rules govern which transitions are allowed and which are not. These rules are derived from the principles of quantum mechanics and are essential for understanding the emission and absorption spectra of atoms.\n\nFor electronic transitions in hydrogen, the selection rules are based on the change in the quantum numbers associated with the electron's state. The primary quantum numbers involved are:\n\n- \\( n \\): the principal quantum number, which determines the energy level of the electron.\n\n- \\( l \\): the azimuthal (or angular momentum) quantum number, which determines the shape of the orbital.\n\n- \\( m_l \\): the magnetic quantum number, which determines the orientation of the orbital in space.\n\n- \\( m_s \\): the spin quantum number, which determines the spin direction of the electron.\n\nWhen an electron transitions from one energy level to another, the selection rules for the quantum numbers are:\n\n1. **Change in \\( l \\)**: \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\). This means that during a transition, the azimuthal quantum number can only increase or decrease by one unit.\n\n2. **Change in \\( m_l \\)**: \\( \\Delta m_l = 0, \\pm 1 \\). The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one unit.\n\n3. **Change in \\( s \\)**: \\( \\Delta s = 0 \\). The spin quantum number does not change during a transition.\n\nThese rules are a consequence of the angular momentum conservation and the nature of the electromagnetic interaction that causes the transitions.\n\nGiven the initial state of the electron in hydrogen is \\( n = 4 \\), \\( l = 1 \\), we need to determine which of the provided final states cannot be reached by an allowed transition.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**Option A: \\( n = 3 \\), \\( l = 2 \\)**\n\n- Initial \\( l = 1 \\), final \\( l = 2 \\). So, \\( \\Delta l = +1 \\), which satisfies the selection rule \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, this transition is allowed.\n\n**Option B: \\( n = 3 \\), \\( l = 1 \\)**\n\n- Initial \\( l = 1 \\), final \\( l = 1 \\). So, \\( \\Delta l = 0 \\), which does not satisfy \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, this transition is not allowed.\n\nWait a minute, but according to the selection rule, \\( \\Delta l = 0 \\) is not permitted. So, this transition should not be allowed.\n\nHowever, let's confirm this.\n\n**Option C: \\( n = 3 \\), \\( l = 0 \\)**\n\n- Initial \\( l = 1 \\), final \\( l = 0 \\). So, \\( \\Delta l = -1 \\), which satisfies \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, this transition is allowed.\n\n**Option D: \\( n = 2 \\), \\( l = 0 \\)**\n\n- Initial \\( l = 1 \\), final \\( l = 0 \\). So, \\( \\Delta l = -1 \\), which satisfies \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, this transition is allowed.\n\nBased on the selection rules, option B (\\( n = 3 \\), \\( l = 1 \\)) does not satisfy the condition \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\) because \\( \\Delta l = 0 \\). Hence, this transition is not allowed.\n\nWait, but in reality, for electric dipole transitions, which are the most common, \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\) is indeed a selection rule. However, there are higher-order transitions, like quadrupole transitions, that can allow \\( \\Delta l = 0 \\), but these are generally much weaker and less probable than dipole transitions.\n\nIn the context of this question, which seems to be focusing on allowed transitions under the standard dipole approximation, option B would be considered not allowed because \\( \\Delta l = 0 \\).\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions or other types of transitions that might allow \\( \\Delta l = 0 \\).\n\nFor example, magnetic dipole transitions can allow \\( \\Delta l = 0 \\), but these are typically weaker and might not be considered \"allowed\" in the same sense as electric dipole transitions.\n\nGiven that the question is likely referring to electric dipole transitions, which are the most probable and commonly observed, the selection rule \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\) holds, and thus option B is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B: \\( n = 3 \\), \\( l = 1 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
