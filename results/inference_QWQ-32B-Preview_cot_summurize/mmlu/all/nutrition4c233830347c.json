                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about the molecules of natural polyunsaturated fatty acids found in vegetable oils. So, first off, I need to recall what polyunsaturated fatty acids are.\n\nI remember that \"polyunsaturated\" means that the fatty acid has more than one double bond in its carbon chain. Unlike saturated fatty acids, which have all single bonds between carbon atoms, polyunsaturated fatty acids have multiple double bonds, which affect their properties, like melting point and stability.\n\nNow, the question specifies \"natural\" polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils. So, I should consider the typical fatty acids found in plants, not those that have been chemically altered.\n\nOption A says: 18 carbon atoms with one carbon-carbon double bond in the cis configuration.\n\nWait, but if it's polyunsaturated, it should have at least two double bonds, right? Because \"poly\" means many, which is more than one. So, having only one double bond would make it monounsaturated, not polyunsaturated. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: 20 carbon atoms with at least two carbon-carbon double bonds in the cis configuration.\n\nThis seems plausible. Many polyunsaturated fatty acids do have around 20 carbon atoms, like arachidonic acid, which is a 20-carbon fatty acid with four double bonds. And in natural fatty acids, the double bonds are usually in the cis configuration.\n\nOption C: 18 carbon atoms with at least two carbon-carbon double bonds in the trans configuration.\n\nHmm, 18 carbon atoms with at least two double bonds in the trans configuration. While it's possible to have trans double bonds, especially in industrially hydrogenated oils, the question specifies \"natural\" polyunsaturated fatty acids. Natural fatty acids typically have cis double bonds, not trans. So, this option seems less likely.\n\nOption D: 18 carbon atoms with at least two carbon-carbon double bonds in the cis configuration.\n\nThis also seems plausible. Many common polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils have 18 carbon atoms and multiple cis double bonds. For example, linoleic acid has 18 carbon atoms and two double bonds in the cis configuration.\n\nNow, between options B and D, both describe fatty acids with at least two double bonds in the cis configuration, but differ in the number of carbon atoms: 20 vs. 18.\n\nI need to think about which of these is more commonly found in vegetable oils.\n\nLinoleic acid, which is a key polyunsaturated fatty acid in many vegetable oils, has 18 carbon atoms and two double bonds. Alpha-linolenic acid, another important one, also has 18 carbon atoms with three double bonds. So, these are both 18-carbon fatty acids.\n\nOn the other hand, 20-carbon fatty acids like arachidonic acid are also polyunsaturated, but they are more commonly found in animal fats rather than vegetable oils.\n\nTherefore, considering that the question specifies \"vegetable oils,\" option D seems more appropriate.\n\nBut wait, some vegetable oils do contain 20-carbon fatty acids, though in smaller amounts. For instance, evening primrose oil contains arachidonic acid, but it's not a major component in most vegetable oils.\n\nMoreover, the question asks about \"molecules of natural polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils.\" So, it's likely referring to the primary polyunsaturated fatty acids found in these oils.\n\nGiven that, and considering that 18-carbon fatty acids like linoleic and alpha-linolenic are predominant in vegetable oils, option D appears to be the correct choice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes a monounsaturated fatty acid, not polyunsaturated.\n\nOption C is less likely because natural fatty acids typically have cis double bonds, not trans.\n\nOption B, while not entirely incorrect, seems less representative of the typical polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils, which are more commonly 18-carbon fatty acids.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: 18 carbon atoms with at least two carbon-carbon double bonds in the cis configuration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
