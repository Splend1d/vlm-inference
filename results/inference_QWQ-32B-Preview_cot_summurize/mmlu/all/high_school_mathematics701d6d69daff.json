I know that sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732.\n\nTherefore, Area \u2248 36 * 1.732\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n36 * 1.732 = 36 * 1.7 = 61.2\n\nPlus 36 * 0.032 = 1.152\n\nSo, total area \u2248 61.2 + 1.152 = 62.352\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 62\n\nB. 72\n\nC. 84\n\nD. 112\n\nThe closest approximation is 62.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall that for an equilateral triangle, the height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nIf I split the triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles, the height (h) can be found using:\n\nh = (sqrt(3)/2) * side\n\nSo, h = (sqrt(3)/2) * 12 = 6 * sqrt(3) \u2248 6 * 1.732 \u2248 10.392 inches\n\nThen, the area is (base * height)/2:\n\nArea = (12 * 10.392)/2 = (124.704)/2 \u2248 62.352 square inches\n\nAgain, this approximates to 62.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 62\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
