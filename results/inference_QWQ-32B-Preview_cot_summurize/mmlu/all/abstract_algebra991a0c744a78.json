                    "text": "So I have this problem here: find all zeros in the indicated finite field of the given polynomial with coefficients in that field. The polynomial is \\(x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\). The options are A. 0, B. 1, C. 0,1, D. 0,4. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to find zeros in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\). \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\) is the finite field with five elements: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, I need to plug in each of these values into the polynomial and see which ones make the polynomial equal to zero.\n\nThe polynomial is \\(x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x\\). Let's denote it as \\(f(x) = x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x\\).\n\nI'll evaluate \\(f(x)\\) for each \\(x\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\):\n\n1. For \\(x = 0\\):\n\n\\(f(0) = 0^5 + 3(0)^3 + 0^2 + 2(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\). So, 0 is a zero.\n\n2. For \\(x = 1\\):\n\n\\(f(1) = 1^5 + 3(1)^3 + 1^2 + 2(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7\\). Now, 7 modulo 5 is 2, since 5 goes into 7 once with a remainder of 2. So, \\(f(1) = 2 \\neq 0\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\). Therefore, 1 is not a zero.\n\n3. For \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\(f(2) = 2^5 + 3(2)^3 + 2^2 + 2(2) = 32 + 3(8) + 4 + 4 = 32 + 24 + 4 + 4 = 64\\). 64 modulo 5 is 64 - 12*5 = 64 - 60 = 4. So, \\(f(2) = 4 \\neq 0\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\).\n\n4. For \\(x = 3\\):\n\n\\(f(3) = 3^5 + 3(3)^3 + 3^2 + 2(3) = 243 + 3(27) + 9 + 6 = 243 + 81 + 9 + 6 = 339\\). 339 modulo 5 is 339 - 67*5 = 339 - 335 = 4. So, \\(f(3) = 4 \\neq 0\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\).\n\n5. For \\(x = 4\\):\n\n\\(f(4) = 4^5 + 3(4)^3 + 4^2 + 2(4) = 1024 + 3(64) + 16 + 8 = 1024 + 192 + 16 + 8 = 1240\\). 1240 modulo 5 is 1240 - 248*5 = 1240 - 1240 = 0. So, \\(f(4) = 0\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\). Therefore, 4 is a zero.\n\nSo far, I've found that 0 and 4 are zeros of the polynomial in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\). Looking back at the options, option D is 0 and 4, which matches what I've found. But wait, let's make sure there are no other zeros beyond these.\n\nI've already checked all elements of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\), and only 0 and 4 gave me zero when plugged into the polynomial. So, the answer should be D. 0,4.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's a possibility of multiple zeros for a polynomial in a finite field. In general, a polynomial of degree n over a field can have at most n zeros. Here, the polynomial is of degree 5, so it can have up to 5 zeros in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\). But in practice, it might have fewer.\n\nGiven that I've checked all five elements and only found two zeros, 0 and 4, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can factor the polynomial to see if there are any repeated roots or other factors that could indicate additional zeros.\n\nLet's see: \\(f(x) = x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x\\). I can factor out an x:\n\n\\(f(x) = x(x^4 + 3x^2 + x + 2)\\).\n\nI already know that x = 0 is a zero. Now, I need to find the zeros of \\(x^4 + 3x^2 + x + 2\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\).\n\nLet's denote \\(g(x) = x^4 + 3x^2 + x + 2\\).\n\nEvaluate \\(g(x)\\) for x = 0,1,2,3,4:\n\n1. \\(g(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 \\neq 0\\)\n\n2. \\(g(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7 \\equiv 2 \\neq 0\\) mod 5\n\n3. \\(g(2) = 16 + 3*4 + 2 + 2 = 16 + 12 + 2 + 2 = 32 \\equiv 2 \\neq 0\\) mod 5\n\n4. \\(g(3) = 81 + 3*9 + 3 + 2 = 81 + 27 + 3 + 2 = 113 \\equiv 3 \\neq 0\\) mod 5\n\n5. \\(g(4) = 256 + 3*16 + 4 + 2 = 256 + 48 + 4 + 2 = 310 \\equiv 0\\) mod 5\n\nSo, x = 4 is also a zero of \\(g(x)\\), which means x = 4 is a double zero of the original polynomial, since it's a zero of both f(x) and g(x).\n\nTherefore, the zeros of f(x) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\) are x = 0 and x = 4, which corresponds to option D.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 0,4} \\]"
