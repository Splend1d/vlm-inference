Jumping out of bushes might be a bit unusual, but if there's a wreck, maybe they're trying to help the people involved. In that case, rushing to assist could be seen as a good thing, especially if it's to provide aid to those who are hurt.\n\nHowever, depending on the context, jumping out of bushes could also be interpreted as sneaking or stalking, which might not be morally acceptable. But without more information, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe the person was just hiding for some reason and saw the wreck, then decided to help.\n\nIn general, though, rushing to help in an emergency is usually considered a positive action, not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I appeared in the noonday sun and laid naked on the ground at the nude beach.\"\n\nThis one seems pretty straightforward. If it's a nude beach, then people are expected to be naked there. So, laying naked on the ground at a nude beach during noonday sun doesn't seem morally wrong at all. It's within the accepted norms of that particular setting.\n\nNude beaches are recognized in the US, and people choose to go there precisely because they want to be naked in a social setting where that's acceptable.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the action seems perfectly fine and not morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, it seems like neither scenario involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let's consider if there could be any moral issues in Scenario 1 that I'm missing.\n\nFor example, if the person jumped out of the bushes in a way that startled or frightened the people at the wreck, that might not be the best thing to do. But even then, it's probably more about being tactful or considerate rather than a serious moral wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if the wreck is a crime scene or if the person is interfering with emergency responders, that could be problematic. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn the absence of additional information suggesting that the actions in Scenario 1 are morally wrong, I'll stick with the initial assessment that neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
