                    "text": "I'm trying to understand Kant's view on the moral worth of actions. So, according to Kant, what determines whether an action is morally good or not?\n\nI remember that Kant was a big proponent of deontological ethics, which means that the morality of an action is based on whether it adheres to a rule or duty, rather than on its consequences. So, maybe the answer is related to following moral duties.\n\nOption A says the moral character of the agent. That sounds plausible because if someone has good intentions and a virtuous character, their actions would be morally worthy. But I think Kant might have a more specific criterion.\n\nOption B mentions the consequences of the action. However, in deontology, consequences aren't the primary determiner of moral worth. So, this might not be the right answer.\n\nOption C refers to the maxim that is acted on. I think this is key in Kant's ethics. A maxim is a personal principle or rule that guides your action. Kant thought that for an action to have moral worth, its maxim must be universalizable and not contradict itself.\n\nOption D says all of the above, but I'm not sure if that's the case in Kant's philosophy.\n\nLet me think about this. In Kant's \"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals,\" he discusses the concept of the categorical imperative, which is central to his ethical theory. The categorical imperative requires that we act only according to maxims that we can will to become universal laws.\n\nSo, perhaps the moral worth of an action depends on whether the maxim behind it can be universalized without leading to contradictions.\n\nBut what about the agent's character? Doesn't that play a role? Well, Kant does emphasize good will as the basis of morality. Good will is when someone acts out of a sense of duty and with good intentions.\n\nMaybe both the maxim and the agent's character are important.\n\nWait, but in Kant's view, the consequences aren't as important as the motive behind the action. So, option B might not be correct.\n\nLet me look up a quote from Kant to confirm.\n\n\"In a strict sense, indeed, there is absolutely no such thing as a highest good [in the realm of experience], because the perfection of happiness entirely according to desert can never be attained in this life, nor perhaps in any finite time, and hence not in the whole series of contingencies. It is, therefore, only in the world of understanding that such a highest good can exist, and even there only as a postulate of pure practical reason, i.e., as a necessary presupposition if moral laws are to have practical validity for us, which is certain.\" - Immanuel Kant, Critique of Practical Reason.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complex. Maybe I need to focus on the concept of moral worth.\n\nKant argues that the moral worth of an action depends on the principle or maxim that motivates it, not on its outcomes. So, perhaps the correct answer is C, the maxim that is acted on.\n\nBut option A mentions the moral character of the agent. Isn't having a good moral character related to acting on good maxims?\n\nMaybe Kant would say that the moral character is reflected in the maxims one acts on. So, in a way, both A and C are connected.\n\nBut if I had to choose one, I think C is more directly Kant's view.\n\nOption D says all of the above, but since Kant is known for emphasizing the maxim over consequences and perhaps separately from the agent's character, maybe D isn't accurate.\n\nLet me consider this differently. Suppose someone with a generally immoral character performs an action that has good consequences, but their maxim was not moral. According to Kant, would that action have moral worth?\n\nI don't think so. Kant emphasizes that only actions done from duty, that is, from a good will and in accordance with moral law, have moral worth. So, even if the consequences are good, if the motive isn't right, the action doesn't have moral worth.\n\nSimilarly, if someone with a good moral character performs an action based on a flawed maxim, would it have moral worth? I don't think so.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the maxim is the crucial factor in determining moral worth.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure about option A. Doesn't the agent's moral character influence the maxims they act on?\n\nProbably, but Kant might argue that it's the maxim itself that determines the moral worth of the specific action, rather than the overall character of the agent.\n\nMaybe it's a bit nuanced. The agent's character might incline them to choose certain maxims, but the moral worth is in the maxim itself.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is C, the maxim that is acted on.\n\nBut I should check if Kant also considers the agent's character in evaluating moral worth.\n\nLet me look up some more Kant quotes.\n\n\"Nothing in the world\u2014indeed nothing even beyond the world\u2014can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a good will.\" - Immanuel Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals.\n\nThis suggests that a good will is the only thing good without qualification. So, perhaps the agent's character, in terms of having a good will, is important.\n\nBut still, it's the maxim that the good will chooses to act on that determines the moral worth of the action.\n\nSo, maybe both A and C are relevant, but in Kant's view, it's primarily the maxim that determines moral worth.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C, the maxim that is acted on.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider option B again. Kant does discuss the \"\u738b\u56fd of ends\" where actions are judged based on whether they could be willed to become universal laws. This seems more related to the maxim than to consequences.\n\nHowever, in some interpretations, Kant's ethics could consider the consequences indirectly, insofar as they relate to the universalizability of the maxim.\n\nBut overall, consequences aren't the primary focus.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
