I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these terms means. Let's start with the question itself. It's talking about applying irrelevant standards to the subject of the argument. That sounds like the argument is using criteria that don't actually apply or aren't relevant to the topic at hand. So, it's probably a type of logical fallacy where the standards being used to evaluate something are not appropriate or pertinent.\n\nOption A is \"ad crumenam.\" I think \"ad crumenam\" is a Latin phrase, and I believe it translates to \"appeal to wealth\" or \"appeal to money.\" So, this would be a fallacy where someone argues that something is better or more valuable because it's more expensive or because someone wealthy says so. That seems like it's about appealing to wealth rather than using irrelevant standards in general.\n\nOption B is \"ad antiquitatem.\" Again, Latin, and I think this means \"appeal to tradition\" or \"appeal to antiquity.\" This fallacy occurs when someone argues that something is better or correct just because it's older or has been done that way for a long time. So, it's about tradition or age being the standard, which might not always be relevant.\n\nOption C is \"false criteria.\" This sounds pretty straightforward. It suggests that the criteria being used are false or irrelevant to the subject. That seems to match the description in the question.\n\nOption D is \"hasty generalization.\" This is when someone makes a broad generalization based on a small or unrepresentative sample. It's about jumping to conclusions without enough evidence.\n\nComparing these, the one that directly relates to applying irrelevant standards is \"false criteria.\" So, option C seems to be the best fit.\n\nBut let's double-check. \"Ad crumenam\" is about appealing to wealth, which is a specific type of irrelevant standard. \"Ad antiquitatem\" is about appealing to tradition or age, which is another specific type of irrelevant standard. \"False criteria\" is more general and directly refers to using standards that are not relevant or appropriate for the subject at hand. \"Hasty generalization\" is about making unwarranted generalizations, which is different from using irrelevant standards.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is likely \"false criteria,\" which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
