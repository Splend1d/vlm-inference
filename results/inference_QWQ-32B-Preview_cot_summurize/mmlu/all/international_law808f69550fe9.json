                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option correctly identifies the formal sources of international law. The choices are:\n\nA. Custom, treaties and judicial decisions\n\nB. Custom, general principles of law and theory\n\nC. Treaties, custom and general principles of law\n\nD. Treaties, custom and General Assembly Resolutions\n\nI remember that international law has certain established sources, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, I know that treaties are a major source of international law. When countries agree to a treaty, they bind themselves to certain rules and obligations. So, treaties should definitely be included in the list of formal sources.\n\nNext, custom is also important in international law. It refers to the practices of states that are followed out of a sense of legal obligation. These practices, when consistently followed and accepted as law, become customary international law. So, custom is another key source.\n\nNow, between the remaining options, I have to choose between judicial decisions, general principles of law, theory, and General Assembly Resolutions.\n\nLet's consider judicial decisions. I know that international courts and tribunals, like the International Court of Justice (ICJ), make decisions that can influence international law. However, are these decisions considered formal sources of law, or are they more interpretative?\n\nI think that judicial decisions are more about interpreting the law rather than creating it. So, maybe they're not considered formal sources in the same way that treaties and custom are.\n\nWhat about general principles of law? I believe that these are principles derived from the legal systems of various countries, and they are used in international law when there are no treaties or customs to address a particular issue. So, general principles seem like they could be a formal source.\n\nTheory, on the other hand, seems too vague and not directly applicable as a source of law. International law is based on more concrete foundations, so I doubt that theory is considered a formal source.\n\nLastly, General Assembly Resolutions are decisions made by the United Nations General Assembly. While they can reflect the opinions of the international community and sometimes lead to the development of customary law, are they themselves formal sources of law?\n\nI think that General Assembly Resolutions are more like recommendations or expressions of the will of member states, but they don't necessarily have the binding force of law unless they are incorporated into treaties or develop into custom.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems that treaties, custom, and general principles of law are the formal sources of international law.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA includes custom, treaties, and judicial decisions.\n\nB has custom, general principles, and theory.\n\nC lists treaties, custom, and general principles of law.\n\nD mentions treaties, custom, and General Assembly Resolutions.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option C seems to be the correct one.\n\nTo double-check, I recall that the Statute of the International Court of Justice, in Article 38, outlines the sources of international law. It mentions:\n\n1. International conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states.\n\n2. International custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law.\n\n3. The general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.\n\n4. Judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.\n\nSo, according to the Statute of the ICJ, the primary sources are treaties (international conventions), custom, and general principles of law. Judicial decisions and teachings of publicists are subsidiary means, not formal sources themselves.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct: Treaties, custom, and general principles of law are the formal sources of international law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
