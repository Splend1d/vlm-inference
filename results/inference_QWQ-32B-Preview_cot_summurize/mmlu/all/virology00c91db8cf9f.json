The options are mother's age, mother's viral load, mother's immune status, and father's viral load. I need to figure out which one is the biggest single determinant.\n\nFirst, I know that HIV can be transmitted from a mother to her baby during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. So, I need to think about which factor most influences this transmission.\n\nOption A is mother's age. I don't recall age being a major factor in HIV transmission from mother to child. I think the risk is more related to biological factors rather than the mother's age. So, maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B is mother's viral load. I remember that viral load is the amount of HIV virus in the mother's blood. If there's a higher amount of virus, it might be more likely to be transmitted to the baby. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption C is mother's immune status. Immune status refers to how well the mother's immune system is functioning, which is often measured by CD4 cell count in HIV-positive individuals. A weaker immune system might correlate with higher viral load, but is it the direct determinant of transmission?\n\nOption D is father's viral load. I don't think the father's viral load directly affects the transmission from mother to child. The father's status might influence the mother's status indirectly, but in terms of direct transmission, this seems less relevant.\n\nComparing B and C, both are related to the mother's health, but I think the viral load is more directly linked to transmission risk. In fact, I recall that antiretroviral therapy is used to reduce the mother's viral load to prevent transmission to the baby. So, if the viral load is low, the risk of transmission is significantly reduced.\n\nAlso, I think there are studies that show that the higher the maternal viral load at the time of delivery, the higher the risk of transmission to the infant. So, that suggests that the mother's viral load is a key determinant.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's immune status, while important for her health, may not be as directly linked to the transmission risk as the viral load is. Although a lower CD4 count might be associated with higher viral load, it's the viral load that seems to be the more direct factor in transmission.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the mother's viral load is the biggest single determinant of HIV transmission to the infant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
