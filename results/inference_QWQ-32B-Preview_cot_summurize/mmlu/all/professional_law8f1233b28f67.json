                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal problem about a motel that shows adult movies in private rooms, and now the owner is being prosecuted under a state statute that prohibits showing obscene films in public areas. I need to decide whether the owner's conviction will probably be sustained or overturned, and choose the best reason from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key elements here. The motel allows only adults to occupy the rooms, and each room is private. So, even though it's a motel, which is a public establishment, the rooms are intended for private use by adults. The state statute prohibits showing obscene films in areas open to the public.\n\nOption A says the conviction will be sustained because the state can use its police power to prohibit showing pornography in public areas. But, in this case, the rooms are private, not open to the public. So, maybe this isn't the best reason.\n\nOption B says the conviction will be sustained because the state can use local standards to determine if a movie has redeeming qualities. This seems relevant, but I'm not sure how it directly applies to the privacy of the rooms.\n\nOption C says the conviction should be overturned because prosecuting the owner violates the right of consenting adults to view such films in private. This sounds promising, as it touches on privacy rights.\n\nOption D says the conviction should be overturned because the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit suppressing sexually oriented materials based on their obscene content. This also seems relevant, but I need to think about how it applies here.\n\nLet me consider the legal principles involved. There's the issue of obscenity and what constitutes obscene material, and there's also the right to privacy, especially for consenting adults in their private spaces.\n\nI recall that the Supreme Court has ruled on obscenity cases, and there are tests to determine what is obscene. One such test is the Miller test, which considers local community standards to determine if material is obscene. So, maybe Option B is correct.\n\nBut wait, the Miller test is used to determine if material is obscene, but in this case, the question is whether showing such material in private rooms of a motel constitutes a public display.\n\nI think the key here is the privacy of the rooms. If the rooms are private and only accessible to adults, then perhaps the state can't regulate what happens inside those rooms, especially if it's between consenting adults.\n\nOn the other hand, the motel is a public establishment, and the state might argue that any activity within it is subject to public regulation.\n\nI need to think about Supreme Court cases that deal with privacy and obscenity. For example, in Roe v. Wade, the Court recognized a right to privacy in matters of abortion, and in Obergefell v. Hodges, the right to privacy in matters of marriage.\n\nSimilarly, in cases involving obscenity, the Court has held that while obscene material isn't protected by the First Amendment, the government can't regulate speech or expression without considering free speech rights.\n\nIn this scenario, the motel rooms are private spaces, and the patrons are adults. So, perhaps the right to view adult films in private should be protected.\n\nOption C seems to align with this idea, stating that prosecuting the owner violates the right of consenting adults to view such films in private.\n\nOption D is also appealing because it mentions that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit suppressing sexually oriented materials based on their obscene content. However, isn't that contradictory, since obscenity isn't protected speech?\n\nWait, in Miller v. California, the Court held that obscenity isn't protected by the First Amendment, and local communities can determine what is obscene based on their standards.\n\nSo, perhaps Option B is correct, that the conviction will be sustained because the state can use local standards to determine if the movies have redeeming literary, artistic, political, or scientific merit.\n\nBut, I'm confused because if the rooms are private, should the state be able to regulate what adults watch in those private spaces?\n\nI remember a case called Stanley v. Georgia, where the Supreme Court held that mere possession of obscene materials in the home can't be prohibited, as it violates the right to privacy.\n\nIn Stanley, the Court said that the government can't criminalize private possession of obscene material because it's a form of thinking and acting that the government can't control.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, if the motel rooms are private spaces where adults are watching these movies, perhaps the state can't prohibit it.\n\nSo, maybe Option C is the correct answer: the conviction should be overturned because prosecuting the owner violates the right of consenting adults to view such films in private.\n\nOption D seems too broad, as it suggests that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit suppressing sexually oriented materials based on their obscene content, which contradicts established case law that obscenity isn't protected speech.\n\nWait, but in Miller, the Court did allow regulation of obscenity, but only if it meets certain standards, including local community standards.\n\nPerhaps both Options C and B have merit, but I need to choose the most appropriate one.\n\nGiven that the rooms are private and only adults are allowed, I think the right to privacy trumps the state's interest in regulating what adults view in private.\n\nTherefore, I lean towards Option C: the conviction will probably be overturned because his prosecution violates the right of consenting adults to view such films in private.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
