Let's see, the options are Cheryl Ladd, Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith, and Kate Jackson.\n\nFirst, I know that 'Charlie's Angels' was a popular TV show in the 1970s. It featured three female detectives who worked for a private investigator named Charlie Townsend, although they never met him in person.\n\nI think Farrah Fawcett was one of the original angels. She played Jill Munroe, if I'm not mistaken. But I believe she left the show after the first season or maybe stayed for a couple of seasons.\n\nThen there's Jaclyn Smith, who played Kelly Garrett. I think she was in the show for most of its run, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nCheryl Ladd joined the show in the second season, replacing Farrah Fawcett's character. She played Stella St. John. I think she was with the show for a good portion of its run.\n\nAnd Kate Jackson, she played Sabrina Duncan, if I remember right. I think she was in the show for several seasons as well.\n\nLet me think about this. The show ran for five seasons, from 1976 to 1981. The original cast included Farrah Fawcett, Kate Jackson, and Jaclyn Smith. Then, in the second season, Cheryl Ladd joined the cast.\n\nFarrah Fawcett left after the first season, so she wasn't with the show for its entire run. Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith were in the show from the beginning, and Cheryl Ladd joined in season two.\n\nSo, if I'm trying to find out who starred on 'Charlie's Angels' for the show's entire run, it would probably be Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson, but I need to confirm which one stayed for all five seasons.\n\nWait, actually, Kate Jackson left the show for a few seasons and then returned, or something like that. I'm a bit confused.\n\nLet me try to recall: Jaclyn Smith was in all five seasons, while Kate Jackson left after season three and was replaced by Shelley Hack and Catherine Mary Stewart. Then, in season five, Kate Jackson returned.\n\nSo, Jaclyn Smith was the only original angel to remain for the entire run of the show.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Jaclyn Smith.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nI know that Farrah Fawcett left after season one, Cheryl Ladd joined in season two and stayed through season five, Jaclyn Smith was there from season one to season five, and Kate Jackson was in seasons one through three and then returned for season five.\n\nSo, indeed, Jaclyn Smith was the only actress who appeared in all five seasons of 'Charlie's Angels.'\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Jaclyn Smith.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
