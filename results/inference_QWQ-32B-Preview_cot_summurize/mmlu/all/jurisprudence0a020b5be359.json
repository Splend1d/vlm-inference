                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which school of legal thought believes that a custom becomes law only when it's recognized by the courts. The options are Analytical, Natural Law, Historical, and Sociological schools. I need to understand the key beliefs of each to see which one matches this view.\n\nFirst, the Analytical School, also known as the Command School, was influenced by thinkers like John Austin and later developed by Hans Kelsen with the Pure Theory of Law. This school views law as a set of rules commanded by the sovereign and backed by sanctions. It emphasizes the separation of law and morality. So, in this perspective, law is what the sovereign says it is, and custom would only become law if the sovereign (through the courts) recognizes it as such. That sounds pretty close to the statement.\n\nNext, the Natural Law School bases its ideas on the belief that there are inherent rights and wrongs that are discoverable through reason. Natural law proponents argue that true law is derived from moral principles and that positive law (laws made by humans) should align with these natural principles. Custom in this context might be seen as evolving from moral practices, but I'm not sure if this school specifically ties the legal recognition of custom to judicial stamp.\n\nThe Historical School, associated with thinkers like Friedrich Carl von Savigny, emphasizes the organic growth of law through a nation's customs and traditions. According to this school, law is a reflection of the people's spirit (Volksgeist), and custom is a major source of law. So, in this view, custom is law insofar as it reflects the people's practices and norms, without necessarily requiring judicial recognition. In fact, judges are seen as discoverers of existing customs rather than creators of law.\n\nThen there's the Sociological School, which includes thinkers like Eugen Ehrlich and Roscoe Pound. This school focuses on how law is influenced by social forces and actually operates in society. It argues that law should adapt to social needs and that legal scholarship should study the social effects of law. Custom, in this perspective, might be considered as a social practice that could influence law, but again, I'm not sure if it requires judicial recognition to become law.\n\nComparing these, the Analytical School seems to align most closely with the idea that custom becomes law when it receives judicial recognition. The Historical School, on the other hand, sees custom as inherently law, derived from the people's practices, and judges as recognizing what already exists. So, the Analytical School might be more about custom becoming law through the act of judicial recognition, whereas the Historical School sees custom as law prior to any judicial recognition.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look deeper. In the Analytical School, particularly in Austin's view, law is the command of the sovereign. Custom could be recognized as law if the sovereign (through the courts) accepts it as such. So, in this case, custom doesn't have legal authority until the sovereign decrees it, which could happen through judicial recognition.\n\nIn contrast, the Historical School views law as emerging organically from the society's customs and traditions. Judges are seen as expressing the existing customs rather than creating law through recognition. So, in this school, custom is already law, and judges merely confirm it.\n\nGiven this, the Analytical School seems to fit the description in the question, where custom becomes law only when it receives judicial recognition.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to be sure.\n\nNatural Law: Focuses on moral principles as the basis of law. While custom might align with natural law if it reflects moral norms, I don't think this school specifically ties the legal status of custom to judicial recognition.\n\nSociological School: Emphasizes the social aspects and functions of law. Custom could be seen as a social practice that influences law, but again, the focus is on law adapting to social needs rather than requiring judicial recognition to become law.\n\nTherefore, between the options provided, the Analytical School is the one that supports the view that custom becomes law when it receives the stamp of judicial recognition by courts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
