There are a few options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nOption A says that self-executing treaties are adopted only by the executive. I think treaties usually require involvement from both the executive and legislative branches, at least in the US system. So, I'm not sure about that one.\n\nOption B says that self-executing treaties are clear and precise enough so as not to require any further implementing measures. That sounds familiar. I remember something about treaties being self-executing if they can be enforced directly by courts without needing additional legislation.\n\nOption C mentions that self-executing treaties rely on implementing measures stipulated in the treaty itself. Hmm, that seems a bit contradictory. If they rely on implementing measures, wouldn't that mean they're not self-executing?\n\nOption D talks about self-executing treaties following the doctrine of transformation. I think transformation is related to how international treaties become part of domestic law, but I'm not sure how it relates to self-executing treaties.\n\nLet me try to recall what I've learned. In the US, treaties are part of the law of the land under the Supremacy Clause, but sometimes they need to be implemented through domestic legislation to be enforceable in courts. Self-executing treaties, I believe, are those that can be enforced directly without such legislation.\n\nSo, going back to the options:\n\nA seems incorrect because treaties usually require more than just executive adoption.\n\nB aligns with my understanding that self-executing treaties are clear and precise enough to be enforced directly.\n\nC suggests that they rely on implementing measures within the treaty itself, which contradicts the idea of self-execution.\n\nD mentions the doctrine of transformation, which I think is more about how international law is incorporated into domestic law, not specifically about self-executing treaties.\n\nTherefore, I think option B is the correct answer: Self-executing treaties are clear and precise enough so as not to require any further implementing measures.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should check what the other options are implying.\n\nOption A: Adopted only by the executive. In the US, treaties are made by the President but require Senate approval. So, it's not just the executive branch involved.\n\nOption C: Rely on implementing measures stipulated in the treaty itself. That sounds more like non-self-executing treaties, which may require domestic legislation to implement.\n\nOption D: Follow the doctrine of transformation. I think transformation is when international law is incorporated into domestic law through a specific act, like legislation. Self-executing treaties might relate to this, but it doesn't seem to capture the essence of what self-executing means.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B is the right answer. Self-executing treaties are those that are clear and precise enough to be enforced directly, without needing additional implementing measures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
