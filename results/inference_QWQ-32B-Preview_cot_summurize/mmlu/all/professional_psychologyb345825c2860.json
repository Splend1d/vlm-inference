                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory in the context of a social psychology experiment. So, the setup is that participants are paid either $1 or $20 to tell potential participants that a dull experiment was very interesting. Then, we're supposed to predict, based on these two theories, how these participants will subsequently report their own liking for the dull experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each theory says.\n\nCognitive dissonance theory, developed by Leon Festinger, suggests that when people engage in an action that is inconsistent with their attitudes or beliefs, they experience psychological discomfort called dissonance. To reduce this dissonance, people will adjust their attitudes to align better with their actions.\n\nSelf-perception theory, proposed by Daryl Bem, takes a different approach. It suggests that people infer their attitudes by observing their own behavior, much like an outside observer would. So, if someone sees themselves performing a certain action, they conclude that must reflect their attitude.\n\nIn this experiment, participants are asked to tell others that a dull experiment is interesting, which is inconsistent with the actual nature of the experiment. So, according to cognitive dissonance theory, participants who were paid only $1 might experience more dissonance because the external justification (the reward) is smaller. To reduce this dissonance, they might convince themselves that the experiment was actually interesting, thus reporting greater liking for it.\n\nOn the other hand, participants paid $20 have a larger external justification for their behavior, so they experience less dissonance. They can tell themselves that they only said it was interesting because they were well paid, not because they actually liked it. Therefore, they might report less liking for the experiment.\n\nNow, looking at self-perception theory, participants observe their own behavior\u2014telling others the experiment is interesting. According to this theory, they will infer their attitude based on this behavior. However, the theory also considers the presence of external incentives. If there's a large external incentive, like $20, participants might attribute their behavior to the reward rather than to their own attitude. So, they might not conclude that they like the experiment just because they said it was interesting; they can attribute it to the money.\n\nIn contrast, participants paid only $1 might attribute their behavior more to their attitude since the external incentive is smaller. They might think, \"I told others it was interesting, and I didn't get much for it, so maybe I do like it.\" Therefore, self-perception theory would predict that participants in the $1 condition report greater liking for the experiment.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Cognitive dissonance theory: $1 condition reports greater liking.\n\n- Self-perception theory: $1 condition reports greater liking.\n\nWait, but option C says both theories predict that $1 condition will report greater liking than the $20 condition, which matches what I just thought.\n\nOption A says cognitive dissonance predicts $1 condition reports greater liking, and self-perception predicts $20 condition reports greater liking. But according to my understanding, self-perception also predicts $1 condition reports greater liking.\n\nOption B says self-perception predicts $1 condition reports greater liking, and cognitive dissonance predicts $20 condition reports greater liking. Again, that doesn't align with my understanding.\n\nOption D says both theories predict $20 condition reports greater liking than $1 condition. That seems opposite to what I think.\n\nSo, it seems like option C is the correct one, as both theories predict that participants in the $1 condition will report greater liking for the dull experiment than those in the $20 condition.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm misremembering self-perception theory.\n\nUpon reflection, self-perception theory might predict that participants in the $20 condition would report less liking because they can attribute their behavior to the external reward, whereas those in the $1 condition have less external justification and thus might infer that their behavior reflects their true attitudes.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, both theories seem to converge on the prediction that $1 condition participants will report greater liking for the experiment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
