                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which pair of hypotheses to use for this claim about the department store. The claim is that over 60 percent of the mall\u2019s visitors shop at that store. So, p is the proportion of the mall\u2019s visitors who shop at the store.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (Ha) are. The null hypothesis is usually the status quo or the default assumption, and the alternative hypothesis is what we're trying to test or support.\n\nIn this case, the claim is that more than 60% shop at the store, so I think the alternative hypothesis should reflect that. So, Ha: p > 0.60.\n\nNow, the null hypothesis should be the opposite of that. So, H0: p \u2264 0.60.\n\nWait, but in some options, H0 is p = 0.60. Is there a difference?\n\nI think sometimes H0 is set as p = some value, and Ha is p \u2260, <, or > that value. In this case, since the claim is specifically that the proportion is greater than 60%, it makes sense for H0 to be p \u2264 0.60 and Ha to be p > 0.60.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. H0: p \u2264 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60\n\nB. H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p \u2260 0.60\n\nC. H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p < 0.60\n\nD. H0: p > 0.60 and Ha: p \u2260 0.60\n\nOption A matches what I was thinking: H0: p \u2264 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60.\n\nOption B has H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p \u2260 0.60, which would be for a two-tailed test, but our claim is one-tailed, specifically greater than 60%.\n\nOption C has H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p < 0.60, which would be testing if the proportion is less than 60%, which isn't what we're trying to support.\n\nOption D has H0: p > 0.60 and Ha: p \u2260 0.60, which doesn't make much sense because if H0 is p > 0.60, then Ha should be p \u2264 0.60 to be the opposite.\n\nSo, Option A seems correct. But wait, why is Option D even listed? It seems unclear. Maybe it's a typo in the question.\n\nI think the best choice is Option A: H0: p \u2264 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60, because this setup allows us to test whether the proportion is significantly greater than 60%, which aligns with the claim.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
