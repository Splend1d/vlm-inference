                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what \"derived demand for labor\" means. The question says it's called derived demand because it is something specific. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. dependent on the demand for the final product that the labor is used to produce\n\nB. inversely related to the wage rate\n\nC. dependent on the availability of capital goods\n\nD. directly related to the marginal utility of working\n\nI think I need to recall what derived demand means in economics. Derived demand refers to the demand for a factor of production, like labor, that comes from the demand for the final product it helps to produce. So, if there's a high demand for the product, there will be a higher demand for the labor that produces it.\n\nOption A seems to align with that definition. It says that the demand for labor is dependent on the demand for the final product that the labor is used to produce. That makes sense. If more of a product is wanted, more labor is needed to make it.\n\nOption B says it's inversely related to the wage rate. While it's true that, generally, as wage rates increase, the demand for labor might decrease because it's more expensive, this isn't the definition of derived demand. This is more about the law of demand in general.\n\nOption C mentions that it's dependent on the availability of capital goods. While capital and labor can be complements in production, this isn't directly related to the concept of derived demand.\n\nOption D says it's directly related to the marginal utility of working. Marginal utility is more related to consumer theory and how much satisfaction a consumer gets from an additional unit of a good or service. It doesn't directly relate to the demand for labor in production.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option A seems to be the correct answer. The demand for labor is called derived demand because it depends on the demand for the final product that the labor helps to produce.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Derived demand emphasizes that the demand for labor isn't based on its own merits but on the demand for what it produces. So, if the final product's demand increases, the demand for labor increases as well, and vice versa.\n\nYes, that reinforces that option A is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
