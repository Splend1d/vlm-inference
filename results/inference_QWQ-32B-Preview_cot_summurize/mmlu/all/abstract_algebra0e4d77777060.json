I need to determine what kind of property this relation has. The options are:\n\nA. symmetric only\n\nB. anti-symmetric only\n\nC. both symmetric and anti-symmetric\n\nD. an equivalence relation\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions of these properties.\n\nSymmetric: A relation S on a set A is symmetric if for every (a, b) in S, the pair (b, a) is also in S.\n\nAnti-symmetric: A relation S on a set A is anti-symmetric if whenever (a, b) and (b, a) are in S, then a must be equal to b.\n\nEquivalence relation: A relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\nSo, let's check each property for the given relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}.\n\nFirst, symmetry:\n\nLook at each pair in S.\n\n- (1, 1): The reverse pair is (1, 1), which is also in S.\n\n- (2, 2): The reverse pair is (2, 2), which is also in S.\n\nSo, for every (a, b) in S, the pair (b, a) is also in S. Therefore, S is symmetric.\n\nNext, anti-symmetry:\n\nCheck if whenever (a, b) and (b, a) are in S, then a = b.\n\nIn S, the pairs are:\n\n- (1, 1) and (2, 2).\n\nFor (1, 1), both (1, 1) and (1, 1) are in S, and indeed a = b since 1 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for (2, 2), both (2, 2) and (2, 2) are in S, and a = b since 2 = 2.\n\nThere are no other pairs, so there's no case where (a, b) and (b, a) are in S with a \u2260 b.\n\nTherefore, S is anti-symmetric.\n\nSo, S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric.\n\nNow, let's check if S is an equivalence relation.\n\nFor S to be an equivalence relation, it needs to be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\nWe've already established that S is symmetric.\n\nLet's check reflexivity:\n\nA relation S on A is reflexive if for every element a in A, (a, a) is in S.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}, so we need (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3) to be in S.\n\nBut S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}. It missing (3, 3).\n\nTherefore, S is not reflexive, and hence not an equivalence relation.\n\nSo, options A and D are incorrect.\n\nNow, option B is \"anti-symmetric only.\"\n\nBut we've determined that S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, can a relation be both symmetric and anti-symmetric?\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nSymmetric means if (a, b) is in S, then (b, a) is also in S.\n\nAnti-symmetric means if (a, b) and (b, a) are in S, then a = b.\n\nSo, if a relation is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, then the only pairs it can have are of the form (a, a), where a = b.\n\nBecause if there were a pair (a, b) with a \u2260 b in S, then by symmetry, (b, a) would also be in S, and by anti-symmetry, a would have to equal b, which contradicts a \u2260 b.\n\nTherefore, the only possible pairs in a relation that is both symmetric and anti-symmetric are pairs where a = b, i.e., pairs of the form (a, a).\n\nIn this case, S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}, which fits this description.\n\nSo, S is indeed both symmetric and anti-symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other possibilities.\n\nIs there any way S could be only symmetric or only anti-symmetric?\n\nWell, we've seen that S is symmetric because for every (a, b) in S, (b, a) is also in S.\n\nAnd S is anti-symmetric because whenever (a, b) and (b, a) are in S, a equals b.\n\nThere are no pairs in S where a \u2260 b and both (a, b) and (b, a) are present.\n\nTherefore, S satisfies both properties.\n\nSo, option C is correct.\n\nOption D is incorrect because S is not an equivalence relation due to lack of reflexivity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. both symmetric and anti-symmetric.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
