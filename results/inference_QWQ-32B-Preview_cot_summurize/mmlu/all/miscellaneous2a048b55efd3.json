The Netherlands is a country in Northwestern Europe, and Dutch is the language spoken by the majority of its population. It's important not to confuse The Netherlands with other countries that may have similar names or languages. For example, Denmark has Danish as its official language, and Sweden has Swedish. Germany has German as its official language, but The Netherlands and Germany are separate countries with their own distinct languages, although Dutch and German are both West Germanic languages and share some similarities.\n\nSo, to summarize, if you're asked about the official language of The Netherlands, the answer is Dutch.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
