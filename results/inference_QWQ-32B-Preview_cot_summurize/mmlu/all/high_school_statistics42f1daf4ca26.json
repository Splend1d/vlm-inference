                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about house appraised values in a city. The mean appraised value is $125,000, and the standard deviation is $23,000. Then, because of a new teachers' contract, the school district needs an extra 10% in funds compared to the previous year. To raise this additional money, the city decides to instruct the assessment office to raise all appraised house values by $5,000. The question is asking for the new standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city after this increase.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's going on here. There are a few key pieces of information:\n\n1. Original mean appraised value: $125,000\n\n2. Original standard deviation: $23,000\n\n3. The city is raising all appraised house values by $5,000 to meet the extra funding needed by the school district.\n\nNow, the question is specifically asking for the new standard deviation after this $5,000 increase across all house appraisals.\n\nI remember that standard deviation is a measure of dispersion or spread in a set of data. It tells us how much the values typically deviate from the mean.\n\nWhen we add or subtract a constant from all data points, it shifts the mean but doesn't affect the spread of the data. So, adding $5,000 to every house appraisal should increase the mean by $5,000, but the standard deviation should remain the same because the spread of the data doesn't change.\n\nWait, but let's think about that again. If we add $5,000 to every house, the differences between each house's value and the new mean should stay the same, right? Because both the values and the mean increase by the same amount.\n\nLet me recall the formula for standard deviation. For a dataset, standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n\nSo, if we have original values x1, x2, ..., xn with mean \u03bc, then the standard deviation \u03c3 is:\n\n\u03c3 = sqrt( [(x1 - \u03bc)^2 + (x2 - \u03bc)^2 + ... + (xn - \u03bc)^2] / n )\n\nNow, if we add $5,000 to each xi, the new values are xi + 5000, and the new mean is \u03bc + 5000.\n\nThe new standard deviation \u03c3' would be:\n\n\u03c3' = sqrt( [( (x1 + 5000) - (\u03bc + 5000) )^2 + ( (x2 + 5000) - (\u03bc + 5000) )^2 + ... + ( (xn + 5000) - (\u03bc + 5000) )^2 ] / n )\n\nSimplifying inside the squared terms:\n\n(x1 + 5000 - \u03bc - 5000) = (x1 - \u03bc)\n\nSimilarly for all other terms.\n\nSo, \u03c3' = sqrt( [(x1 - \u03bc)^2 + (x2 - \u03bc)^2 + ... + (xn - \u03bc)^2] / n ) = \u03c3\n\nTherefore, \u03c3' = \u03c3\n\nThat means the standard deviation remains unchanged at $23,000.\n\nWait, but the question mentions that the school district needs an extra 10% in funds compared to the previous year, and the city is raising all appraised house values by $5,000 to raise this additional money. Is there any relevance of the 10% extra funds needed to the calculation of the new standard deviation?\n\nFrom what I can see, the 10% extra funds needed is just the context for why the city is raising the appraised values by $5,000, but it doesn't directly affect the calculation of the standard deviation after the increase.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the standard deviation remains $23,000 after adding $5,000 to each house appraisal.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $23,000\n\nB. $25,300\n\nC. $28,000\n\nD. $30,300\n\nOption A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any possibility that adding a fixed amount to each value could affect the standard deviation?\n\nI think not, because standard deviation is based on the differences from the mean, and if you shift all values and the mean by the same amount, those differences remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the new standard deviation should indeed be $23,000.\n\nI think the answer is A. $23,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
