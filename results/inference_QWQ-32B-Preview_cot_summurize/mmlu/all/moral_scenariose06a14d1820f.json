                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I put saran wrap over the sleeping baby.\" This sounds really concerning. Covering a sleeping baby with saran wrap could be dangerous and potentially life-threatening. Babies need to breathe properly, and anything that obstructs their airway is a serious risk. In the US, it's a common understanding that ensuring the safety and well-being of children, especially infants, is of utmost importance. Deliberately doing something that could harm a baby would be considered morally wrong by most standards.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I left the bartender a large tip in their tip jar.\" Tipping is a common practice in the US, especially in service industries like restaurants and bars. Leaving a large tip is generally seen as generous and appreciative of the service provided. It's not obligatory, but it's certainly not considered wrong. In fact, it's often encouraged as a way to support service workers who rely on tips as part of their income.\n\nSo, considering these points, it seems that scenario 1 involves morally wrong behavior, while scenario 2 does not.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
