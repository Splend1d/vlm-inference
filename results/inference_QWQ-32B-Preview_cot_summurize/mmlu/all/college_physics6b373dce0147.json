                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how the time required for one revolution (the period) of a satellite orbiting a planet depends on the mass of the planet (M), the mass of the satellite (m), and the radius of the orbit (R). Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, recall that for a satellite orbiting a planet in a circular path, the gravitational force between the planet and the satellite provides the necessary centripetal force for the circular motion. The gravitational force is given by Newton's law of gravitation:\n\n\\[ F_{grav} = G \\frac{M m}{R^2} \\]\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe centripetal force required for circular motion is:\n\n\\[ F_{cent} = m \\frac{v^2}{R} \\]\n\nwhere v is the orbital speed of the satellite.\n\nSince the gravitational force equals the centripetal force, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\[ G \\frac{M m}{R^2} = m \\frac{v^2}{R} \\]\n\nWe can simplify this equation by canceling out the mass of the satellite, m, from both sides:\n\n\\[ G \\frac{M}{R^2} = \\frac{v^2}{R} \\]\n\nNow, solve for the orbital speed, v:\n\n\\[ v^2 = G \\frac{M}{R} \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{G \\frac{M}{R}} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the period of the orbit, which is the time it takes for the satellite to complete one full revolution around the planet. The circumference of the circular orbit is \\( 2 \\pi R \\), and the orbital speed is v, so the period T is:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{\\text{circumference}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{2 \\pi R}{v} \\]\n\nSubstitute the expression for v that we found earlier:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{2 \\pi R}{\\sqrt{G \\frac{M}{R}}} \\]\n\nSimplify the expression inside the square root:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{2 \\pi R}{\\sqrt{G M / R}} = \\frac{2 \\pi R}{\\sqrt{G M} / \\sqrt{R}} = \\frac{2 \\pi R \\sqrt{R}}{\\sqrt{G M}} \\]\n\n\\[ T = 2 \\pi \\frac{R^{3/2}}{(G M)^{1/2}} \\]\n\nThis is the expression for the period of a satellite in a circular orbit. Now, let's analyze how T depends on M, m, and R.\n\nFirst, notice that the mass of the satellite, m, cancels out in the derivation, so the period is independent of m. Therefore, options B and C, which mention dependencies on m, can be eliminated.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining options, A says the period is independent of M, and D says it's proportional to \\( R^{3/2} \\).\n\nFrom the expression we derived:\n\n\\[ T \\propto \\frac{R^{3/2}}{M^{1/2}} \\]\n\nThis shows that T is not independent of M, as option A suggests, because it depends on \\( M^{-1/2} \\). Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption D suggests that T is proportional to \\( R^{3/2} \\), which matches part of our expression. However, since T also depends on M, option D is not entirely accurate unless M is held constant.\n\nWait a minute, let's re-examine the options:\n\nA. independent of M\n\nB. proportional to \\( m^{1/2} \\)\n\nC. linear in R\n\nD. proportional to \\( R^{3/2} \\)\n\nGiven that the correct expression is \\( T \\propto R^{3/2} M^{-1/2} \\), and assuming that M is constant (which is often the case when comparing different satellites orbiting the same planet), then T is proportional to \\( R^{3/2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider if M can be considered constant. In most orbital mechanics problems, the mass of the planet is much larger than the mass of the satellite, so M is treated as constant. Hence, the period's dependence on R is indeed \\( R^{3/2} \\).\n\nSo, the answer is D. proportional to \\( R^{3/2} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
