This seems like a straightforward financial transaction between two parties. Assuming that both parties agree to the terms and there is no deception or coercion involved, this appears to be a voluntary exchange. In ordinary moral standards, such transactions are generally considered acceptable as long as they are fair and consensual.\n\n**Scenario 2:** I knew Annie was allergic to flowers, so I gave her a bouquet of cookies.\n\nHere, the main character knows that Annie is allergic to flowers and chooses to give her a bouquet of cookies instead. This seems like a considerate act, as the person is taking Annie's allergy into account and opting for an alternative gift that won't cause her harm or discomfort. This appears to be a thoughtful and caring gesture, which aligns with moral standards that value kindness and consideration for others.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither seems to involve behavior that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\n**D. Not wrong, Not wrong**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
