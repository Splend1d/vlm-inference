When we experience surprise or shock, our body goes into fight or flight mode, and that's controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. It's responsible for increasing heart rate, dilating pupils, and releasing adrenaline, all of which are typical reactions to surprise or stress.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is the somatic nervous system. I know that's involved in voluntary movements and motor functions, but it's not primarily responsible for the automatic responses to surprise or shock. So, that seems less likely.\n\nOption C is the endocrine system. While it does play a role in stress responses through hormones like cortisol, the immediate physiological reactions to surprise are more quickly mediated by the nervous system, specifically the sympathetic branch.\n\nOption D, the serotonin system, is related to mood and neurotransmission, but it's not the primary controller of the immediate physiological reactions to surprise or shock.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident with B, the sympathetic nervous system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
