As consideration for the loan, the man executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the apartment building. The mortgage was dated January 1, 2008, and was recorded January 2, 2008. Thereafter, on February 1, 2008, the man executed a deed absolute on the apartment building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the man then delivered the deed to an escrow agent in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the man failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1, 2009, the man failed to pay the note when it came due. The next day, the escrow agent delivered the deed to the apartment building to the friend. The friend then properly recorded this deed on January 3. One week later, on January 10, the friend conveyed the apartment building by warranty deed to an investor for the purchase price of $200,000. On January 12, the man tendered the $125,000 balance due to the friend, which he refused to accept. The man now brings an appropriate action against the friend and the investor to set aside the conveyance and to permit the redemption of the property by the man. Which of the following best states the man's legal rights, if any, in his action against the friend and the investor?\n\nA. The man has no rights against the investor, but the man does have an action for redemption against the friend for the value of the property.\nB. The man has no rights against the friend, but the man does have an action for redemption against the investor for the value of the property.\nC. The man has the option of seeking redemption against either the friend or the investor for the value of the property, but the man cannot set aside the conveyance.\nD. The man has no rights against either the friend or the investor because he defaulted on the promissory note.\n"

                    "text": "This problem involves a series of transactions related to a mortgage and a deed of trust, and it tests your understanding of security interests, foreclosure procedures, and the rights of parties involved. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the man borrowed $125,000 from his friend and secured the loan with a mortgage on his four-story apartment building. The mortgage was dated January 1, 2008, and recorded the next day. This establishes a security interest in favor of the friend for the debt.\n\nThen, on February 1, 2008, the man executed a deed absolute to the friend, intending it only as additional security for the debt. This deed was delivered to an escrow agent with instructions to deliver it to the friend if the man failed to pay the promissory note at maturity.\n\nOn January 1, 2009, the man failed to pay the note when it came due. The next day, the escrow agent delivered the deed to the friend, who recorded it on January 3. Then, on January 10, the friend sold the property to an investor for $200,000. Two days later, on January 12, the man tendered the $125,000 balance to the friend, who refused it.\n\nNow, the man is suing both the friend and the investor to set aside the conveyance and permit redemption of the property. We need to determine the man's legal rights in this action.\n\nLet's consider the nature of the transactions:\n\n1. **Mortgage**: The mortgage is a security interest in real property that encumbers the property to secure repayment of the loan. It usually requires judicial foreclosure to enforce.\n\n2. **Deed in Escrow**: The deed absolute was intended as additional security and was held in escrow to be delivered upon default. This resembles a deed of trust or a mortgage with a power of sale clause, which allows for non-judicial foreclosure.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, a deed absolute is construed as a present conveyance of title, making the grantee the owner unless and until the grantor redeems the property. But here, it was intended only as security, and was held in escrow, suggesting an intent to avoid immediate transfer of title.\n\nGiven that the deed was delivered to the friend upon default, and then recorded, it seems the friend took title to the property.\n\nThen, the friend sold the property to the investor for $200,000, which is above the mortgage amount, suggesting a profitable sale.\n\nNow, the man tenders the $125,000, which the friend refuses.\n\nThe man is now suing to set aside the conveyance to the investor and to redeem the property.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. The man has no rights against the investor, but he does have an action for redemption against the friend for the value of the property.\n\nB. The man has no rights against the friend, but he does have an action for redemption against the investor for the value of the property.\n\nC. The man has the option of seeking redemption against either the friend or the investor for the value of the property, but he cannot set aside the conveyance.\n\nD. The man has no rights against either the friend or the investor because he defaulted on the promissory note.\n\nFirst, consider the investor's position. The investor purchased the property from the friend for $200,000, which is a fair price, and presumably had no knowledge of any outstanding claims by the man. In many jurisdictions, a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any outstanding interests takes free of those interests. However, in this case, since the friend obtained the property through a security deed, the investor might have some inquiry notice, but assuming the investor had no actual knowledge, he might be protected.\n\nRegarding redemption, in some jurisdictions, a mortgagor has the right to redeem the property even after default, provided they pay the amount due plus costs. However, if the property has been sold to a third party, the right to redeem might be limited.\n\nIn this scenario, the man tendered the payment after the deed was delivered to the friend and recorded, and after the friend sold the property to the investor.\n\nGiven that, the man's right to redeem might be compromised because the property has already been transferred to an innocent third party.\n\nOption A suggests that the man has no rights against the investor, which might be correct if the investor is a bona fide purchaser without notice of the man's interest. However, the man might still have rights against the friend.\n\nOption B suggests that the man has no rights against the friend, which seems unlikely because the friend may have acted improperly in refusing the tendered payment.\n\nOption C allows for redemption against either party but states that the man cannot set aside the conveyance. This might be possible if the man can pay the amount due to the friend or to the investor.\n\nOption D completely denies the man any rights, which seems harsh, especially since he tendered the payment after default.\n\nConsidering these points, the best answer is likely A: The man has no rights against the investor, but he does have an action for redemption against the friend for the value of the property.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- The investor purchased the property from the friend, who had taken title upon default. If the investor was a bona fide purchaser without notice of any outstanding interests, the man cannot reclaim the property from the investor.\n\n- However, against the friend, the man might have a cause of action because the friend refused a tendered payment that would have satisfied the debt. The man could argue that the friend was obliged to accept the payment and release the security interest.\n\nAdditionally, depending on the jurisdiction, there might be statutory or common law provisions regarding the acceptance of tenders and the obligations of mortgagees or deed of trust holders upon tender.\n\nIn conclusion, option A seems the most appropriate, as it acknowledges the man's lack of rights against the investor due to the investor's purchase, while allowing for an action against the friend for refusing a valid tender of payment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
