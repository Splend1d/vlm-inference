In September 1989, a doctor conveyed 1500 acres of timberland to a dentist via a warranty deed, and the dentist recorded it right away in the Grantor-Grantee Index.\n\n2. Then, in April 1990, the dentist conveyed the same property to a buyer, again with a warranty deed, and the buyer also recorded it immediately.\n\n3. The land had never been occupied, fenced, or cleared, except for a pathway that a mining company had been using since 1986, based on an agreement with the doctor.\n\n4. This agreement, signed in 1986, allowed the mining company to use the pathway as a road in perpetuity, in exchange for paying $700 per annum to the doctor.\n\n5. The agreement was recorded.\n\n6. After the buyer acquired the property in 1990, they told the mining company they wouldn't honor the 1986 agreement anymore.\n\n7. Now, the mining company is suing for specific performance to enforce the right to use the pathway.\n\nThe question is: who should win the lawsuit? The options are:\n\nA. The mining company, because their property interest would \"run with the land.\"\n\nB. The mining company, because the possessor of a servient interest would prevail against subsequent owners.\n\nC. The buyer, because the mining company's interest was extinguished by the subsequent conveyance.\n\nD. The buyer, because there was no privity of estate between the buyer and the mining company.\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what's going on here. There's a property with a pathway that the mining company has been using since 1986, based on an agreement with the original owner, the doctor.\n\nThen, the doctor sold the property to the dentist, who later sold it to the buyer. The mining company wants to keep using the pathway, but the buyer doesn't want to allow that.\n\nSo, the issue is whether the mining company's right to use the pathway continues even after the property has been sold to someone else.\n\nI think this has to do with easements and the concept of \"running with the land.\" In property law, an easement is a non-possessory interest in land that allows the holder of the easement to use someone else's property for a specific purpose.\n\nThere are different types of easements, but in this case, it seems like it's an easement appurtenant, which benefits a particular piece of land rather than an individual person.\n\nWait, but the mining company is using the pathway to access their own property, which is one mile away. So, it's not directly connected to their land, but it's still for their benefit.\n\nI need to recall the rules for easements appurtenant and easements in gross.\n\nAn easement appurtenant benefits a particular piece of land, and it runs with the land, meaning that when the land is sold, the easement continues to benefit the new owner of that land.\n\nOn the other hand, an easement in gross is a personal right to use someone else's land, and it doesn't run with the land. It's more like a personal privilege.\n\nIn this case, the agreement is between the doctor and the mining company, allowing the mining company to use the pathway in perpetuity for $700 per annum.\n\nThis sounds like an easement in gross because it's a personal right granted to the mining company, not necessarily tied to another piece of land they own.\n\nBut, there's a debate about whether an easement in gross can be assigned or transferred to others.\n\nWait, in this problem, the mining company is the original grantee of the easement in gross, and they're trying to enforce it against a subsequent owner of the servient estate (the land burdened by the easement).\n\nSo, the buyer is the new owner of the servient estate, and they don't want to honor the easement.\n\nI need to think about whether the easement in gross binds subsequent owners of the servient estate.\n\nI recall that easements in gross are generally not transferable, meaning they can't be assigned to others, and they usually don't run with the land.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions. In some jurisdictions, if the easement in gross is granted for commercial purposes, it may be assignable and capable of running with the land.\n\nIn this case, the mining company is using the pathway for commercial purposes, as they're a mining company and likely using it to access their mining operations.\n\nAlso, the agreement says \"perpetually,\" which suggests that it's intended to last indefinitely.\n\nMoreover, the agreement was recorded, which might give it more legal weight.\n\nNow, considering that the dentist bought the property from the doctor, and then the buyer bought it from the dentist, and both recorded their deeds.\n\nThe question is whether the buyer is bound by the easement in gross granted by the doctor to the mining company.\n\nI think the key here is whether the easement in gross \"runs with the land\" or not.\n\nFor an easement in gross to run with the land, certain conditions must be met.\n\nI believe that for an easement in gross to be appurtenant to land (i.e., to run with the land), it must be created with the intent that it benefits the land rather than an individual, and it should be recorded.\n\nIn this case, the agreement was recorded, and it seems to benefit the mining company's land, even though it's one mile away.\n\nBut, generally, easements in gross don't run with the land unless they're for commercial purposes and the intent is clear.\n\nI think that in this scenario, since the mining company is using the pathway for commercial purposes and there's a perpetual agreement in place, recorded properly, it's possible that the easement in gross runs with the land.\n\nTherefore, the mining company should be able to enforce it against subsequent owners of the servient estate, including the buyer.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The mining company, because their property interest would \"run with the land.\"\n\nThis seems plausible, given my reasoning.\n\nB. The mining company, because the possessor of a servient interest would prevail against subsequent owners.\n\nHmm, this one is a bit confusing. Usually, it's the dominant estate that benefits from the easement, not the servient estate.\n\nIn this case, the mining company has the easement appurtenant to their land, making their land the dominant estate, and the timberland is the servient estate.\n\nSo, this option seems incorrect.\n\nC. The buyer, because the mining company's interest was extinguished by the subsequent conveyance.\n\nThis would be the case if the easement didn't run with the land, but based on my earlier analysis, it seems like it does, at least in this scenario.\n\nSo, this option might not be correct.\n\nD. The buyer, because there was no privity of estate between the buyer and the mining company.\n\nPrivity of estate generally means that there's a relationship between the parties regarding the property interest.\n\nIn this case, the mining company had an agreement with the doctor, and the buyer purchased from the dentist, who bought from the doctor.\n\nSo, there's no direct privity between the buyer and the mining company.\n\nHowever, in property law, the lack of privity doesn't necessarily mean that the easement is extinguished, especially if it's an easement that runs with the land.\n\nTherefore, this option seems incorrect.\n\nGiven all this, I think option A is the correct answer: the mining company should win because their property interest runs with the land.\n\nBut, to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nFor example, was the buyer on notice about the easement when they purchased the property?\n\nThe agreement was recorded in 1986, and both the dentist and the buyer recorded their deeds, but it's not specified whether the buyer had actual knowledge of the easement.\n\nHowever, since the agreement was recorded, it's likely that a title search would have revealed it, meaning the buyer had constructive notice.\n\nIn that case, the buyer should have known about the easement and purchased the property subject to that existing easement.\n\nTherefore, they can't extinguish the mining company's right to use the pathway.\n\nAnother point to consider is whether the mining company's use of the pathway was apparent.\n\nThe problem states that the mining company regularly drove trucks over the cleared path since 1986.\n\nSo, it's a visible use, which would put anyone on notice that there's an easement in place.\n\nTherefore, even if the agreement wasn't recorded, the visible use of the pathway would give constructive notice to subsequent purchasers.\n\nThus, the buyer is bound by the easement.\n\nIn conclusion, the mining company should prevail because their easement runs with the land, and the buyer is bound by the existing easement.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
