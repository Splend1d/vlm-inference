The land has an adjusted basis of $16,000 and a fair market value of $50,000. The land is subject to a $24,000 mortgage, which Ace assumes.\n\n2. **Calculate the Boot Received**: Boot is any money or other property received by the contributor in addition to the partnership interest. In this case, since Strom is contributing property subject to a liability (mortgage), and the partnership assumes that liability, Strom is effectively receiving boot equal to the amount of the liability assumed.\n\n   - Boot received = Mortgage assumed by Ace = $24,000\n\n3. **Determine the Total Consideration Received**: The total consideration Strom receives consists of the partnership interest and the boot.\n\n   - Partnership interest = 25% interest in Ace\n   - Boot = $24,000\n\n4. **Calculate the Allocated Basis to the Partnership Interest**: Strom's basis in the partnership interest is generally his adjusted basis in the property contributed, reduced by any money he receives and increased by any liability he transfers to the partnership that the partnership assumes.\n\n   - Adjusted basis of land contributed = $16,000\n   - Liability assumed by partnership = $24,000\n   - Money received (boot) = $24,000\n\n   The formula to calculate the basis in the partnership interest is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Basis in partnership interest} = \\text{Adjusted basis of property} + \\text{Liability assumed by partnership} - \\text{Money received}\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Basis in partnership interest} = 16,000 + 24,000 - 24,000 = 16,000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Consider the Fair Market Value**: In this scenario, the fair market value of the land is $50,000, but for determining the basis in the partnership interest, we use the adjusted basis of the property contributed, not its fair market value.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Strom's basis in his partnership interest in Ace is $16,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $16,000\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
