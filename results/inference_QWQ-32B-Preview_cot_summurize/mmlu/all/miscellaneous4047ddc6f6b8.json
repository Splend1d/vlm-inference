                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option best defines federalism. Let's look at each one:\n\nOption A says, \"A government in which the political leader is also the religious leader.\" Hmm, that sounds like a theocracy, where religion and government are combined. But federalism is about how power is divided in a government, not about the relationship between church and state. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nOption B is \"The concentration of government power in the hands of a small group of people.\" That sounds like oligarchy, where a few people hold all the power. Federalism is more about how power is distributed between different levels of government, not about how many people hold the power. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption C says, \"The division of national power into different branches of government.\" Oh, that sounds like the separation of powers, where you have executive, legislative, and judicial branches. That's an important concept in government, but it's not the same as federalism. Federalism is about the division of power between different levels of government, like national and state governments. So, this isn't the best definition.\n\nOption D is \"The division of a country's power into national and subnational units.\" Alright, this seems to fit what I know about federalism. In a federal system, power is divided between the national government and smaller units like states or provinces. Each level has its own areas of authority, and they work together to govern the country. This sounds exactly like the definition of federalism.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the best answer is D. The division of a country's power into national and subnational units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
