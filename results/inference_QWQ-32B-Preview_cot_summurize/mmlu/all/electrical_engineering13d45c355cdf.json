                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these are passive elements: a resistor, a bulb, both, or none. I remember that in electronics, components are often classified as active or passive based on their function in a circuit.\n\nFirst, what's the difference between active and passive elements? Active elements are those that can control the flow of current or provide power to the circuit. Examples include transistors and power supplies. Passive elements, on the other hand, don't control current flow; they just respond to it. They can store or dissipate energy.\n\nSo, a resistor is a passive element because it resists the flow of current but doesn't control it or provide power. It just dissipates energy in the form of heat.\n\nWhat about a bulb? A bulb, or lamp, is also a passive element. It converts electrical energy into light and heat. It doesn't control the current; it just receives the current and uses it to produce light.\n\nSo, both a resistor and a bulb are passive elements. That would make option C, \"Both,\" the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where a bulb could be considered an active element? I don't think so. Even in fancy smart bulbs, the lighting part is still passive; the active parts would be any embedded microcontrollers or sensors that control the current, but the bulb itself is passive.\n\nSimilarly, a resistor is always passive. It doesn't have any ability to amplify or control current; it just resists it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Both.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
