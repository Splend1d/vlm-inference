It is used to evaluate the main and interaction effects of categorical variables on a continuous dependent variable, while statistically controlling for the effects of other continuous variables, known as covariates or extraneous variables (EVs).\n\nLet's break down why option D is correct and why the others are not:\n\nA. when there are 2 or more IVs\n\nWhile ANCOVA can be used with multiple independent variables (IVs), this is not its defining characteristic. Factorial ANOVA is also used when there are two or more IVs. Therefore, this option is too broad and doesn't specifically address what makes ANCOVA unique.\n\nB. when study has 2 or more DVs\n\nThis description fits MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance), which is used when there are two or more dependent variables. ANCOVA deals with a single dependent variable while controlling for covariates.\n\nC. when all subjects receive all levels of the IV\n\nThis scenario describes a repeated measures or within-subjects design, which can be analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. ANCOVA does not require that all subjects receive all levels of the IV; it is more about adjusting for covariates.\n\nD. used to adjust DV scores to control for the effects of an EV\n\nThis is the correct answer. ANCOVA is used to statistically control for the effects of extraneous variables (covariates) that may influence the dependent variable. By including these covariates in the model, ANCOVA can provide a more precise estimate of the treatment effects by removing the variability in the dependent variable that is attributable to the covariates.\n\nIn summary, ANCOVA is particularly useful when you want to adjust the dependent variable scores to account for the influence of other continuous variables, thereby providing a clearer picture of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable."
