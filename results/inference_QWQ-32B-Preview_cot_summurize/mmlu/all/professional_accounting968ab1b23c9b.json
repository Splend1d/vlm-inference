Subsequent events are those that happen after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. Auditors need to make sure that these events are properly considered and disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nOption A: Verifying inventory pledged under loan agreements by confirming with financial institutions. This seems more related to verifying the existence and condition of inventory, especially if it's been pledged as collateral. It's important, sure, but it doesn't directly relate to subsequent events occurring after the balance sheet date.\n\nOption B: Inquiring about the current status of transactions that were recorded on the basis of preliminary data. Hmm, this sounds promising. If the auditor is looking at transactions that were recorded based on preliminary data, inquiring about their current status could help identify any changes or developments that occurred after the balance sheet date. This could include things like disputes, returns, or adjustments to the transactions, which would be subsequent events.\n\nOption C: Comparing the financial statements being reported on with those of the prior year. While this can help identify trends and inconsistencies, it doesn't directly address subsequent events. Subsequent events are about what happened after the balance sheet date, not necessarily comparisons with previous periods.\n\nOption D: Tracing information from shipping documents to sales invoices and sales journal transactions. This seems more related to testing the completeness and accuracy of sales transactions recorded in the period. It's a standard audit procedure to ensure that all sales are properly recorded, but it doesn't directly speak to subsequent events.\n\nSo, between these options, option B seems to be the most directly related to obtaining evidence about the occurrence of subsequent events. By inquiring about the current status of transactions recorded on the basis of preliminary data, the auditor can uncover any events that may have occurred after the balance sheet date that affect the validity or completeness of those transactions.\n\nBut let me think a bit more. Maybe there are other considerations. For instance, subsequent events could include things like litigation, natural disasters, or changes in the market that affect the entity's financial position. Option B focuses on transactions recorded based on preliminary data, which is one aspect, but perhaps not comprehensive.\n\nHowever, among the given options, option B is the most relevant to subsequent events. Options A, C, and D seem more related to standard audit procedures for existence, comparisons, and transaction recording, respectively, but not specifically targeted at subsequent events.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is B: Inquire about the current status of transactions that were recorded on the basis of preliminary data.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
