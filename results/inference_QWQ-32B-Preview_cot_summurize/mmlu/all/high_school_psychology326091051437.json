                    "text": "I've got this question about Intelligence Quotient, or IQ. It asks, \"The Intelligence Quotient is defined as the...\" and then gives four options. Let's see:\n\nOption A: chronological age divided by mental age multiplied by 100.\n\nOption B: performance score divided by verbal score multiplied by 100.\n\nOption C: mental age divided by chronological age multiplied by 100.\n\nOption D: verbal score divided by performance score multiplied by 100.\n\nI need to figure out which one is the correct formula for IQ.\n\nFirst, I remember that IQ has something to do with mental age and chronological age. Mental age is like how mature your thinking is, and chronological age is just how many years old you are.\n\nI think the IQ formula compares these two ages. But which one is divided by which? In option A, it's chronological age over mental age, and in option C, it's mental age over chronological age. So, which one is it?\n\nI recall that a person with a higher mental age than their chronological age would have a higher IQ. So, if mental age is greater than chronological age, IQ should be above 100, right? Let's test that.\n\nSuppose someone is 10 years old and has a mental age of 12. If I use option C: mental age divided by chronological age times 100, that would be 12 divided by 10 times 100, which is 120. That makes sense; an IQ above 100 means higher intelligence relative to their age.\n\nIf I use option A: chronological age over mental age times 100, that would be 10 divided by 12 times 100, which is about 83.3. That seems wrong because if someone has a higher mental age, their IQ should be higher than 100, not lower.\n\nSo, option C seems correct based on that logic.\n\nNow, let's look at options B and D, which involve performance and verbal scores. I think IQ tests have sections for performance and verbal abilities, but I'm not sure how those relate to the IQ score.\n\nI think the traditional IQ score combines both verbal and performance scores into a single IQ score, but I don't recall it being a ratio of one over the other.\n\nOption B suggests performance score over verbal score times 100, and option D is verbal over performance times 100. I don't think it's calculated that way.\n\nI believe that each section is scored separately and then combined in a specific way to get the overall IQ score, but it's not simply the ratio of one to the other.\n\nSo, based on that, I think options B and D are not correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: mental age divided by chronological age multiplied by 100.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should make sure that there aren't any other interpretations or modern changes to how IQ is calculated.\n\nI know that the concept of IQ was first introduced by Alfred Binet and Henri Simon, and the ratio IQ was popularized by William Stern. The ratio of mental age to chronological age times 100 was indeed the original formula.\n\nHowever, in modern IQ tests, like the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the IQ is calculated based on a norm-referenced standardization, where the mean is set to 100 and the standard deviation is usually 15. So, it's not directly based on the ratio of mental to chronological age anymore.\n\nBut the question is asking for the definition of Intelligence Quotient, which historically is based on the ratio of mental age to chronological age times 100.\n\nGiven that, even though modern IQ tests use different methods, the classic definition is the one in option C.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
