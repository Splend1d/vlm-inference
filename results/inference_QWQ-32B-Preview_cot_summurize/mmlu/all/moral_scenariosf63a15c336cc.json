The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I wrote a well-written essay; the grader gave me almost a perfect score.\"\n\nHmm, so in this scenario, someone wrote a good essay and got a high score from the grader. Does that seem morally wrong? Writing a good essay is generally a positive thing, and getting a high score is the expected outcome for quality work. There doesn't seem to be any immoral action here. It's just someone doing their work well and being rewarded for it.\n\nScenario 2: \"I made her sushi from her prize goldfish.\"\n\nOkay, this one is a bit more interesting. So, someone took another person's prize goldfish and made sushi out of it for her. Now, this seems a bit off. A few things to consider here:\n\n- The goldfish belonged to someone else. Using someone's property without their consent is generally considered wrong.\n\n- A prize goldfish is likely something that person valued or was important to them, perhaps as a pet or for sentimental reasons.\n\n- Making sushi from it suggests that the person took the goldfish and prepared it as food, which might be distressing or upsetting to the owner, especially if they had an emotional attachment to the fish.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character used someone else's property without permission and did something with it that could be considered disrespectful or harmful to the owner's feelings.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 doesn't seem morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does appear to involve immoral actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way Scenario 1 could be considered wrong? If someone wrote a well-written essay and received a high score, that's generally praised, not condemned. Unless there was plagiarism or some other dishonesty involved, which isn't mentioned here. So, no, Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 2 indeed involves using someone's property without consent and potentially causing emotional harm, which are both morally wrong according to usual standards.\n\nSo, yes, C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
