                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's asking about the \"three-legged stool\" of retirement, and which leg most retirees rely on. The options are Pension, Social Security, Savings, and Assets. I think the three-legged stool refers to the three main sources of income for retirees: Social Security, pensions, and personal savings or investments. But the question seems to have four options, and \"assets\" might be similar to savings, or it could include other things like property.\n\nI recall that in many discussions about retirement planning, Social Security is a major component for most retirees in the United States. Pensions used to be more common, especially in the past, but nowadays, fewer people have traditional pensions, and more rely on defined contribution plans like 401(k)s, which would fall under savings or assets.\n\nSo, perhaps most retirees rely on Social Security as one leg, pensions as another (for those who have them), and savings or assets as the third. But the question is asking which one most retirees have. I think that Social Security is nearly universal for retirees who qualify, while pensions and savings vary more.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Pension\n\nB. Social Security\n\nC. Savings\n\nD. Assets\n\nI think B, Social Security, is the most common leg of the stool for retirees in the US. Almost all working Americans pay into Social Security and are eligible for benefits upon retirement, whereas pensions are less common now, and savings and assets can vary widely among individuals.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that \"assets\" could include things like home equity, which many retirees might have, and could be a significant source of wealth. However, actually accessing that equity might require selling the home or taking out a reverse mortgage, which not all retirees choose to do.\n\nSavings would likely refer to liquid assets like bank accounts, CDs, bonds, and perhaps investments in stocks or mutual funds. Many retirees have some savings, but the amount can vary greatly.\n\nPensions, on the other hand, are becoming less common, especially among younger workers, as defined benefit plans are being replaced by defined contribution plans like 401(k)s.\n\nGiven all that, I think Social Security is the leg that most retirees have, as it's a government-provided safety net that covers a large portion of the retired population.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up some statistics on this. According to the Social Security Administration, Social Security benefits provide a significant portion of retirement income for many Americans. In fact, for about 60% of retired workers, Social Security makes up at least half of their retirement income.\n\nPensions, or defined benefit plans, are less common now. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, the percentage of private-sector workers participating in a defined benefit plan has declined over the years, while participation in defined contribution plans like 401(k)s has increased.\n\nSavings and assets can vary widely. Some retirees have substantial savings and investments, while others have minimal savings.\n\nTherefore, it seems that Social Security is the most common leg of the retirement stool for most retirees.\n\nSo, I would go with option B, Social Security.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
