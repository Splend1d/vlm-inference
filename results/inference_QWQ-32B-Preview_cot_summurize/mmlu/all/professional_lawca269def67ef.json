                    "text": "So here's this case about a pharmacist who's accused of making synthetic cocaine illegally. The police got a tip about it and decided to put a tracking device on his car without getting a warrant first. They attached it when his car was parked outside his home. For almost a month, they followed his movements using this device, and one day they traced him to a vacant warehouse on the outskirts of town. When he was inside, they looked through the window and saw stuff used for making synthetic cocaine. Based on that, they got a search warrant, went in, arrested the pharmacist, and seized a bunch of synthetic cocaine that had just been made.\n\nNow, at his trial, the pharmacist is trying to get the cocaine suppressed, meaning he wants it not to be used as evidence because he says the way the police got it was illegal. So, we need to figure out whether his motion to suppress will likely be granted or denied, and why.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Granted, because the information upon which the search warrant was based was illegally obtained by means of the tracking device.\n\nB. Granted, because the seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search.\n\nC. Denied, because the police could have discovered the location of the warehouse simply by following the pharmacist's car.\n\nD. Denied, because the electronic surveillance of the pharmacist's car did not exceed 30 days.\n\nOkay, first, we need to think about whether placing the tracking device on the pharmacist's car without a warrant was legal.\n\nI remember that generally, warrantless searches are not allowed, except in certain exceptions like consent, exigent circumstances, etc. Here, there's no mention of any exception applying, so it seems like the police should have gotten a warrant before attaching the device.\n\nBut, attaching a device to someone's car in their driveway might be considered a trespass, which could make it a search under the Fourth Amendment. So, probably, yes, it was a search, and it should have had a warrant.\n\nNow, since it was a warrantless search, and presumably unconstitutional, anything obtained as a result of that search might be suppressible under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\n\nThat doctrine says that evidence obtained from an illegal search or seizure cannot be used in court.\n\nSo, in this case, the information about the warehouse came from the tracking device, which was installed without a warrant. Therefore, the observation of the drug paraphernalia through the window was based on the information from the tracking device.\n\nThen, the search warrant was based on that observation. So, the warrant might be considered invalid because it relied on information obtained illegally.\n\nTherefore, the seizure of the cocaine would be the fruit of the illegal search, which should be suppressed.\n\nSo, options A and B seem plausible.\n\nOption A specifically mentions that the information for the search warrant was illegally obtained, which seems correct.\n\nOption B is more general, saying that the seizure must be suppressed as fruit of an illegal search, which also seems correct.\n\nNow, option C says denied, because the police could have discovered the location of the warehouse simply by following the pharmacist's car.\n\nWait, but the police did follow the pharmacist's car using the tracking device. If they could have discovered it anyway, maybe through regular surveillance, perhaps the evidence wouldn't be suppressed.\n\nI think this is getting at the idea of inevitable discovery, where even if evidence was obtained illegally, it wouldn't be suppressed if it would have been discovered legally anyway.\n\nBut, in this case, the police were tracking the car for almost a month using the device. It's possible that they could have followed him manually for a month and found the same location, but that seems speculative.\n\nCourts might not accept that as a valid reason to avoid suppression, especially if the police didn't actually do it that way.\n\nSo, I'm not sure about option C.\n\nOption D says denied, because the electronic surveillance of the pharmacist's car did not exceed 30 days.\n\nHmm, is there a rule about the duration of electronic surveillance?\n\nI don't recall a specific 30-day rule in general Fourth Amendment law. Maybe in some specific statutes, but not in the general constitutional analysis.\n\nSo, option D seems irrelevant or perhaps incorrect.\n\nTherefore, between A and B, which one is more likely?\n\nBoth seem correct, but A is more specific to the information upon which the search warrant was based being illegally obtained.\n\nB is a broader statement about the seizure being fruit of an illegal search.\n\nI think A might be a better answer because it directly addresses the source of the information used to get the warrant.\n\nBut, in practice, both could be correct.\n\nHowever, since the question is about the motion to suppress the cocaine, and the cocaine was seized pursuant to a warrant that was based on information obtained illegally, it's the warrant that's the key issue here.\n\nSo, if the information for the warrant was illegally obtained, then the warrant might be invalid, and thus the seizure would be based on that illegal search.\n\nTherefore, A seems more directly relevant.\n\nBut, B is also correct in that the seizure is fruit of the illegal search.\n\nPerhaps both could be right, but I think A is more precise.\n\nLet me check if there's any case law that's similar.\n\nI recall that in United States v. Jones, the Supreme Court held that attaching a GPS device to a vehicle constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment, and it generally requires a warrant.\n\nIn that case, the warrantless installation of the GPS device was deemed unconstitutional.\n\nSimilarly, here, the police attached a tracking device without a warrant, which seems analogous.\n\nTherefore, the information obtained from the tracking device would be considered illegally obtained.\n\nThen, any evidence derived from that\u975e\u6cd5\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u89c2\u5bdf\u4ed3\u5e93\u5185\u7684\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u5907\u4ee5\u53ca\u968f\u540e\u7684\u641c\u67e5\u4ee4\u548c\u6bd2\u54c1\u7f34\u83b7\uff0c\u90fd\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6bd2\u6811\u4e4b\u679c\uff0c\u5e94\u88ab\u6392\u9664\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u836f\u5e08\u7684\u52a8\u8bae\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6279\u51c6\uff0c\u7406\u7531\u662f\u641c\u7d22\u4ee4\u6240\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6cd5\u624b\u6bb5\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9009\u9879A\u662f\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\n\n**\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
