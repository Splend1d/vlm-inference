                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I picked up my mom from the doctors five minutes early.\n\nScenario 2: I watched the nurse grab a box of medication and put them in her purse at work.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not, based on common US standards in 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: Picking up my mom from the doctor five minutes early.\n\nHmm, is that morally wrong? Well, picking someone up a few minutes early doesn't seem harmful or unethical. In fact, it might be considerate to be early so that you're ready when the appointment ends. Maybe the doctor's office appreciates punctuality, but being a bit early doesn't hurt anyone. So, I think this is not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Watching a nurse grab a box of medication and put them in her purse at work.\n\nOkay, this sounds more serious. If a nurse is taking medication that doesn't belong to her, that could be theft. Medications are valuable and often regulated, so taking them without permission is probably against the law and ethical standards. Plus, it could lead to shortages or tracking issues for patient care. So, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat matches with option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, being five minutes early to pick up someone isn't typically considered morally wrong. It's more about timing and logistics.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking medication that isn't yours, especially in a professional setting like a hospital or clinic, is likely theft and unethical. Nurses have a responsibility to handle medications properly for patient safety and legal compliance.\n\nTherefore, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
