                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Gauthier's view on the basis of morality. So, David Gauthier is a philosopher known for his work in moral theory, particularly in contractarianism. Contractarianism is an ethical theory that suggests moral principles are based on the agreements rational people would make under certain conditions.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Maximizing the utility of all sentient beings.\n\nThis sounds like utilitarianism, which is a different ethical theory from Gauthier's contractarianism. Utilitarianism holds that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility. So, this doesn't seem to be Gauthier's view.\n\nB. God\u2019s commands.\n\nThis is more aligned with divine command theory, which posits that moral obligations are derived from God's will. Gauthier, being a secular philosopher, doesn't base morality on divine commands. So, this isn't likely.\n\nC. The agreement of rational persons choosing the terms of their interaction.\n\nThis seems to fit with contractarianism. In Gauthier's view, moral principles are based on what rational individuals would agree to under certain hypothetical conditions. He argues that rational agents, seeking to further their own interests, would find it mutually beneficial to constrain their actions according to moral rules. So, this sounds promising.\n\nD. The purposive order of nature.\n\nThis might relate to natural law theory, which holds that morality is derived from the natural order of things. However, Gauthier's contractarianism is more about human agreements and less about the natural order. So, this seems less fitting.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think the correct answer is C. The agreement of rational persons choosing the terms of their interaction.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that in Gauthier's book \"Morals by Agreement,\" he discusses how rational individuals in the \"initial situation\" would agree to constraints on their behavior to achieve mutual benefit, leading to moral rules. This aligns with option C.\n\nSo, I'm confident that C is the right choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
