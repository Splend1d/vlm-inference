I don't remember the exact statistic, but I think it was pretty high. Maybe around 50% or higher. I recall that bullying is a big issue in many places, including Egypt. But I should probably look up some reliable sources to confirm this.\n\nI remember that the World Health Organization (WHO) or UNICEF often publish reports on child welfare, including bullying statistics. Maybe I can find something from them. Alternatively, there might be educational studies or surveys that have looked into this.\n\nLet me consider what I know about bullying in general. Bullying can take many forms, like physical, verbal, or social. In the digital age, cyberbullying is also a concern. I suspect that the statistic might include all these forms of bullying.\n\nThe question specifies \"at least once in the past couple of months,\" which suggests it's a relatively recent occurrence. So, it's not just asking about ever experiencing bullying, but rather, recent experiences.\n\nI think the percentage is likely to be higher than 10% or 30%, maybe around 50% or even 70%. But I need to find a credible source to back this up.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that in some countries, bullying rates can be quite high among teenagers. For example, in the US, I think it's around 20% or so, but I'm not sure about Egypt.\n\nMaybe I should consider cultural factors. In some cultures, bullying might be more prevalent due to societal norms or lack of awareness about its effects.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Egypt has taken steps to address bullying, which could have reduced the rates.\n\nBut according to the question, this is as of 2015. So, I need to find data from around that time.\n\nLet me try to eliminate some options. 10% seems too low, given what I've heard about bullying rates. 70% seems really high, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's that high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 50%. That would mean half of the children in that age group have experienced bullying recently, which seems plausible.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the consequences of such high rates. If 70% of children are being bullied, that's a massive problem that would likely be addressed by the government and other organizations.\n\nBut perhaps in 2015, before more recent anti-bullying initiatives, the rates were higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rate is lower, like 30%.\n\nI need to make an educated guess here.\n\nConsidering that bullying is a significant issue worldwide and that in some studies, rates can be as high as 40-50%, I'm going to guess that in Egypt, it might be around 30%.\n\nSo, I'll go with option B, 30%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
