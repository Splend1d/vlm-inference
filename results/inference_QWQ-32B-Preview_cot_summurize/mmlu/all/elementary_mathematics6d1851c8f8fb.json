                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: Members of the Hiking Club hiked for 2.4 hours covering 2.5 miles each hour. I need to find out how far they hiked in total. The options are A. 4.9 miles, B. 5.8 miles, C. 6.0 miles, and D. 6.3 miles.\n\nOkay, first things first, I know that distance is calculated by multiplying time by speed. So, if they hiked for 2.4 hours at a speed of 2.5 miles per hour, the total distance should be 2.4 hours times 2.5 miles per hour.\n\nLet me write that down: distance = time \u00d7 speed = 2.4 hours \u00d7 2.5 miles/hour.\n\nNow, I need to do the multiplication. I'm a bit rusty on multiplying decimals, but I think I can handle it.\n\nFirst, I can ignore the decimals and multiply 24 by 25, and then adjust for the decimal places later.\n\nSo, 24 \u00d7 25. Let's see, 24 \u00d7 20 is 480, and 24 \u00d7 5 is 120. Adding those together, 480 + 120 = 600.\n\nNow, since 2.4 has one decimal place and 2.5 has one decimal place, the total number of decimal places in the product should be 2.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when multiplying two numbers with one decimal place each, the product should have two decimal places. But in this case, 2.4 \u00d7 2.5 gives us 6.0, because 24 \u00d7 25 is 600, and with two decimal places, it would be 6.00, which is the same as 6.0 miles.\n\nLet me check that again. If I multiply 2.4 by 2.5, I can also think of it as 2.4 \u00d7 2 + 2.4 \u00d7 0.5.\n\nSo, 2.4 \u00d7 2 = 4.8 miles, and 2.4 \u00d7 0.5 = 1.2 miles. Adding those together, 4.8 + 1.2 = 6.0 miles.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. So, the total distance hiked is 6.0 miles.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 6.0 miles is one of them. So, I think the answer is C.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe if they hiked at different speeds or something, but the problem says they covered 2.5 miles each hour consistently for 2.4 hours.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to convert 2.4 hours into hours and minutes. 0.4 of an hour is 24 minutes, since 0.4 \u00d7 60 = 24 minutes. So, they hiked for 2 hours and 24 minutes.\n\nIf they hike at 2.5 miles per hour, in 2 hours, they would cover 2 \u00d7 2.5 = 5 miles. In 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, they would cover 0.4 \u00d7 2.5 = 1.0 mile. Adding those together, 5 + 1 = 6 miles, which again confirms that the total distance is 6.0 miles.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. It seems straightforward once I break it down like this. Sometimes decimals can be tricky, but taking it step by step helps.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
