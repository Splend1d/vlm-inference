                    "text": "The State of Israel was established in 1948. So, the correct answer is B. 1948.\n\nTo provide some context, the establishment of Israel was a result of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which was passed on November 29, 1947. This plan proposed to divide the British Mandate of Palestine into two states: one Jewish and one Arab. However, the plan was not accepted by the Arab leaders, leading to a series of conflicts.\n\nOn May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, declared the establishment of the State of Israel. This declaration was made as the British Mandate over Palestine was due to expire at midnight on that day.\n\nFollowing Israel's declaration of independence, neighboring Arab states invaded the new country, marking the beginning of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, Israel managed to defend its territory and even expand its borders beyond the original UN partition plan.\n\nThe establishment of Israel is a significant event in modern history, with ongoing implications for the region and the world. It is a topic of much debate and discussion, involving issues of politics, religion, and human rights.\n\nSo, to summarize, the correct answer is B. 1948.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine (1947):** This was a plan by the United Nations to resolve the conflict between Jewish and Arab populations in Palestine by dividing the land into two states.\n\n- **David Ben-Gurion:** He was the primary leader of the Zionist movement and the first Prime Minister of Israel.\n\n- **1948 Arab-Israeli War:** Also known as the War of Independence in Israel and the Nakba (\"catastrophe\") in Arab countries, this was a war fought between the newly declared State of Israel and a coalition of Arab states.\n\nUnderstanding these related events can provide a deeper insight into the historical context of Israel's establishment.\n\n**Common Misconceptions:**\n\n- Some people might think that Israel was established in 1947, which is when the UN partition plan was passed. However, the actual declaration of independence occurred in 1948.\n\n- Others might\u8bef\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u662f\u57281949\u5e74\u6210\u7acb\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e1949\u5e74\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u4e0e\u5468\u8fb9\u56fd\u5bb6\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u505c\u6218\u534f\u5b9a\uff0c\u6b63\u5f0f\u7ed3\u675f\u4e861948\u5e74\u7684\u6218\u4e89\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u662fB.1948\u5e74\u3002\n\n**\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e:**\n\n- \"The Birth of Israel: 1945-1949.\" Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n- \"Israel's Declaration of Independence.\" The Knesset.\n\n- \"1948 Arab-Israeli War.\" Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\n**\u5173\u952e\u8bcd:**\n\n- State of Israel\n\n- Establishment\n\n- United Nations Partition Plan\n\n- David Ben-Gurion\n\n- 1948 Arab-Israeli War\n\n**\u7ed3\u675f**\n\n"
