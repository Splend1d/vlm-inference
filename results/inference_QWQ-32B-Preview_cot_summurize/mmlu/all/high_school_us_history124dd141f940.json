During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here that's asking which group in later years would most likely see themselves in Logan's position, based on this address attributed to him. Let me first try to understand what Logan is saying here.\n\nLogan seems to be expressing his initial friendship and peaceful intentions towards white people. He mentions that he remained idle in his cabin during a war, advocating for peace, and that his countrymen recognized him as a friend of the white man. But then, he talks about a personal tragedy: Colonel Cresap murdered all of his relations, including women and children, in cold blood and unprovoked. This act seems to have driven Logan to seek revenge, and he has killed many in response.\n\nNow, the key part is that despite this vengeance, Logan says he rejoices at the beams of peace but makes it clear that his joy is not out of fear; he has never felt fear and would not turn his heel to save his life. He also questions who would mourn for him, suggesting a sense of isolation or that he might not be missed.\n\nSo, Logan's position is one of initial friendship and peace, followed by profound betrayal and loss, leading to vengeance and a solitary stance outside of the mainstream.\n\nNow, the question is asking which group in later years would most likely see themselves in Logan's position. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. An opponent of big government in the 1930s\n\nB. An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s\n\nC. A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s\n\nD. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s\n\nLet's consider each one:\n\nA. Opponent of big government in the 1930s: During the 1930s, the New Deal was implemented, which expanded the role of the federal government significantly. Opponents of big government might feel like they are being betrayed by their own country, much like Logan felt betrayed by the white man after the murder of his family. They might see themselves as standing alone against the mainstream, advocating for smaller government and more individual freedom, similar to Logan's solitary stance.\n\nB. Opponent of consumerism in the 1950s: In the 1950s, consumer culture was booming, with the rise of suburbs and mass consumption. Opponents of consumerism might feel alienated from the mainstream culture that values material possessions over other values. While they might feel isolated, the comparison to Logan isn't as strong because consumerism isn't directly about betrayal or loss in the same way Logan experienced.\n\nC. Supporter of liberalism in the 1960s: The 1960s was a decade of significant social change, with movements for civil rights, anti-war protests, and counterculture. Supporters of liberalism might feel aligned with these movements, pushing for social justice and equality. While they might face opposition, their position is more about advocating for change within the system, which is different from Logan's position of vengeance and isolation.\n\nD. Supporter of feminism in the 1970s: The feminist movement in the 1970s was fighting for gender equality and women's rights. Supporters of feminism might feel like they are battling against entrenched patriarchal systems, facing resistance and sometimes hostility. Their position could be one of standing against the mainstream, much like Logan, but again, the context is different. They are advocating for social change rather than seeking personal vengeance.\n\nComparing all these options, option A seems to align most closely with Logan's position. Both Logan and opponents of big government in the 1930s experienced a sense of betrayal and felt isolated in their stance against the mainstream. Logan was initially a friend of the white man but was betrayed by one man's actions, leading to his vengeance and solitary position. Similarly, opponents of big government might feel that their government has betrayed their trust by expanding its reach, and they stand alone in advocating for smaller government and individual liberties.\n\nOptions B, C, and D involve groups that feel isolated in their opposition to certain aspects of society but lack the personal betrayal and vengeance that characterize Logan's position. Therefore, option A seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
