                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which characteristic is typical for an early-successional plant community. So, first things first, what does \"early-successional\" mean in this context?\n\nWell, ecological succession is the process by which an ecosystem changes and develops over time. Early-successional communities are the initial stages of this process, often appearing after some disturbance or in newly available habitats. These communities are usually characterized by pioneer species that are fast-growing and can quickly colonize the area.\n\nOption A says \"High niche divergence among co-occurring species.\" Niche divergence refers to species evolving to use different resources or habitats to minimize competition. In early-successional communities, you might expect species to have similar requirements since they're all pioneering the area, so maybe niche divergence isn't that high. Perhaps this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B says \"High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass.\" Primary production is the amount of energy produced by plants through photosynthesis, and standing-crop biomass is the total mass of living plants at a given time. In early-successional communities, plants are growing rapidly, so production might be high relative to the existing biomass. This seems plausible.\n\nOption C mentions \"High frequency of K-selected species.\" K-selected species are those that excel in stable environments, have low mortality rates, and produce fewer offspring with higher parental investment. Early-successional environments are usually unstable and changing, so you'd expect more r-selected species, which are opportunistic and produce many offspring. Therefore, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says \"High detrital biomass.\" Detrital biomass refers to the amount of dead organic material in the ecosystem. In early-successional communities, there might not be a lot of accumulated detritus yet because the community is just starting to build up organic matter. So, this might not be the best choice.\n\nComparing these options, option B seems the most fitting for an early-successional plant community. The high ratio of primary production to standing-crop biomass aligns with the rapid growth and colonization typical of these communities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
