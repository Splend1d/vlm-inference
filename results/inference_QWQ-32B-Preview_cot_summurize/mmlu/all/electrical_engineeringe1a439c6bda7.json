                    "text": "So I've got this question about a voltmeter. It's a 0 to 100-volt meter, and it's guaranteed to be accurate within 2% of the full-scale reading. I need to find out the limiting error when it measures 75 volts, and the options are A) 3.33%, B) 2.66%, C) 2%, or D) 1%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"2% of full scale reading\" means. The full scale is 100 volts, so 2% of that is 2 volts. That means the voltmeter can be off by up to 2 volts when reading any value between 0 and 100 volts.\n\nNow, if the voltmeter reads 75 volts, the actual voltage could be as low as 75 - 2 = 73 volts or as high as 75 + 2 = 77 volts. So the error in absolute terms is 2 volts.\n\nBut the question is asking for the limiting error in percentage. I think this means the maximum possible percentage error relative to the measured value.\n\nTo find the percentage error, I should divide the error by the measured value and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, percentage error = (error / measured value) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (2 / 75) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that: 2 divided by 75 is 0.02666..., and multiplying by 100 gives 2.666...%\n\nLooking at the options, B) 2.66% matches this.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to interpret this. Maybe the 2% is of the true value, not the full scale. But the question says \"2% of full scale reading,\" so I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the accuracy is specified differently, but according to the question, it's 2% of full scale, which is 2 volts.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. Is there something about the voltmeter's characteristics that I should consider? For example, is there any non-linearity or other errors besides the full-scale error? The question seems to only mention the full-scale error, so I think sticking with that is appropriate.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes accuracy is specified as a percentage of the reading, not the full scale. But in this case, it explicitly says \"2% of full scale reading,\" so I think my calculation is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the error was 2% of the reading. Then, for 75 volts, the error would be 2% of 75, which is 1.5 volts. But the question says it's 2% of full scale, which is 2 volts, so that doesn't apply here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the limiting error is calculated differently. Perhaps it's the ratio of the full-scale error to the measured value, expressed as a percentage.\n\nYes, that seems to align with what I did earlier: (full-scale error / measured value) * 100 = (2 / 75) * 100 = 2.666...%\n\nSo, I think the answer is B) 2.66%.\n\nBut to make sure, let's see if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose the full-scale error is 2% of 100 volts, which is 2 volts, as I calculated. Then, for a measurement of 75 volts, the relative error would indeed be (2 / 75) * 100 = 2.666...%\n\nAlternatively, if the accuracy was 2% of the reading, then the error would be 2% of 75 volts, which is 1.5 volts, and the percentage error would be (1.5 / 75) * 100 = 2%, but that's not the case here.\n\nThe question specifies \"2% of full scale reading,\" so my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the limiting error is approximately 2.66%, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
