                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about literacy rates in 1950. The options are 36%, 56%, 76%, and 96%. I don't remember the exact statistic, but I know that global literacy rates have been increasing over time. So, I think the percentage in 1950 was probably lower than it is now.\n\nI recall that in some developing countries, literacy rates were quite low in the mid-20th century. For example, in Africa and parts of Asia, access to education was limited, especially for women and girls. So, if a significant portion of the global population lived in these areas, the overall literacy rate would be lower.\n\nOn the other hand, in more developed countries like the United States, Europe, and Japan, literacy rates were likely higher in 1950. But I'm not sure what the average was globally.\n\nMaybe I can eliminate some options. 96% seems too high for 1950, considering the state of education in many parts of the world at that time. 76% also seems a bit optimistic. So, perhaps it was around 56% or 36%.\n\nLet me think about population distribution. In 1950, the world population was around 2.5 billion people. Developed countries had higher literacy rates, but they didn't make up the majority of the global population.\n\nFor instance, in the United States, literacy rates were probably above 90% in 1950. In Europe, it was likely similar. But countries like China and India had large populations with lower literacy rates.\n\nIn China, the literacy rate in the early 1950s was around 20%, and in India, it was around 18%. These two countries alone had a combined population of over 900 million in 1950.\n\nSo, if you have a large population with low literacy rates, it would pull down the global average significantly.\n\nConsidering that, maybe 36% is too high. But looking back, I think I've heard that global literacy rates were around 50% in 1950.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that literacy rates have improved a lot since then. According to UNESCO, global literacy rates are now around 86%. So, if it's 86% now and has been increasing steadily, 56% in 1950 seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to think carefully. If in 1950, many countries had low literacy rates, especially in the developing world, then the global average might be lower than 56%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps by 1950, some progress had been made in education, especially after World War II, which might have boosted literacy rates in some regions.\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe I should look for some clues or recall any historical data I might have come across.\n\nI do remember that the United Nations was established in 1945, and they started collecting data on various indicators, including education. So, there might be some records or estimates from that time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recall that in the 19th century, global literacy rates were in the single digits, and by the mid-20th century, they had increased significantly.\n\nFor example, in the early 1900s, global literacy rates were around 20-25%. So, by 1950, it's possible that it doubled or more.\n\nGiven that, 56% seems reasonable, as it's more than double the rate from 50 years earlier.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I can try to calculate it roughly.\n\nIf I assume that developed countries, say Europe and North America, had literacy rates around 80-90%, and they had a combined population of about 1 billion in 1950, and developing countries had literacy rates around 30-40%, with a population of 1.5 billion, then the global average would be:\n\n(1 billion * 0.85 + 1.5 billion * 0.35) / 2.5 billion = (0.85 + 0.525) / 2.5 = 1.375 / 2.5 = 0.55 or 55%.\n\nSo, around 55%, which is close to 56%.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the assumptions here. Maybe literacy rates in developed countries were higher, and in developing countries, lower.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the developing world had even lower literacy rates, like 20-25%.\n\nIf I adjust the numbers: 1 billion * 0.90 + 1.5 billion * 0.25 = 0.9 + 0.375 = 1.275 / 2.5 = 0.51 or 51%.\n\nStill around 50%.\n\nAlternatively, if developed countries had 95% literacy and developing countries 20%, then:\n\n1 billion * 0.95 + 1.5 billion * 0.20 = 0.95 + 0.3 = 1.25 / 2.5 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nSo, again, around 50%.\n\nGiven these rough calculations, 56% seems plausible.\n\nMoreover, I seem to recall that in the mid-20th century, global literacy rates were around 50%.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. 56%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
