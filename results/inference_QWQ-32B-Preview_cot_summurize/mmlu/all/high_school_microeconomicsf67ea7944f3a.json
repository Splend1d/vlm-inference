                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the free-rider effect. I need to pick the best example from the options given. First, I should make sure I understand what the free-rider effect is.\n\nThe free-rider effect, or free-rider problem, is a situation where individuals benefit from a public good without paying their fair share of the cost to provide it. Public goods are those that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning no one can be prevented from using them, and one person's use doesn't diminish another's. Classic examples include things like national defense or clean air.\n\nSo, in the context of the question, I'm looking for a scenario where someone benefits from something without contributing to its cost.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"You and a friend take a road trip to Florida in your friend's car. You pay for the gas.\" Here, you're contributing to the cost of the trip by paying for gas, which seems like a shared expense. So, this doesn't sound like a free-rider situation because you're paying your part.\n\nOption B: \"In exchange for tutoring your friend in economics, she helps you with your geometry assignment.\" This seems like a barter arrangement where both parties are providing something of value to each other. There's a direct exchange of services, so again, no free-riding involved.\n\nOption C: \"You have ordered a big college football game on pay-per-view, and several of your buddies show up unannounced to watch it at your place.\" Hmm, this is interesting. You paid for the pay-per-view, and now your friends are showing up to watch without contributing to the cost. They're benefiting from your purchase without paying for it. That sounds a lot like the free-rider effect.\n\nOption D: \"You buy your date dinner, but your date insists on leaving a tip for the server.\" In this scenario, your date is contributing to the service by leaving a tip, but the main cost of the dinner is covered by you. However, this is a voluntary act of generosity on your part, and the tip is for the server, not for your date's share of the meal. It's not clearly a free-rider situation because you're choosing to pay for the dinner.\n\nComparing all these options, option C seems to be the best example of the free-rider effect. Your friends are enjoying the football game without bearing any of the cost, which aligns with the definition of free-riding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
