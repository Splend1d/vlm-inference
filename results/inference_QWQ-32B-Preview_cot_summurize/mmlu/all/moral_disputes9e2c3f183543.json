                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about John Stuart Mill and what he thought about evidence for something being desirable. The options are:\n\nA. God has deemed it desirable.\n\nB. Experts on desirability have deemed it desirable.\n\nC. People do actually desire it.\n\nD. Rational insight reveals it to be desirable.\n\nI need to figure out which one Mill would agree with. I remember that Mill was a utilitarian, which means he believed in maximizing happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people. So, his view on what is desirable would probably be connected to what actually makes people happy or satisfies their desires.\n\nLet me think about option A: God has deemed it desirable. Mill was a secular thinker, and utilitarianism is based on human experiences and consequences. So, relying on divine authority might not align with his secular approach.\n\nOption B: Experts on desirability have deemed it desirable. While Mill did value expertise and knowledge, especially in his ideas about liberty and education, I'm not sure if he would place the determination of desirability solely in the hands of experts. It seems a bit removed from the actual experiences of people.\n\nOption C: People do actually desire it. This seems very much in line with utilitarian thought. If people desire something, it probably contributes to their happiness or well-being. So, this evidence would support that it is desirable from a utilitarian perspective.\n\nOption D: Rational insight reveals it to be desirable. Mill did value reason and rationality, but in the context of utilitarianism, the ultimate measure is still the consequences in terms of happiness or utility. So, while rational insight might inform us about what is desirable, it's not the only or the ultimate evidence.\n\nComparing these options, option C seems the most consistent with Mill's utilitarian philosophy. The fact that people do actually desire something is evidence that it contributes to their happiness or satisfaction, which is what utilitarians consider when determining what is desirable.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up what Mill actually said on this topic. I recall that in his work \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill discusses the concept of desirability and what constitutes evidence for something being desirable.\n\nFlipping through \"Utilitarianism,\" in Chapter 4, Mill discusses the proof of utilitarianism and what qualifies as evidence for something being desirable. He argues that the only proof that something is desirable is that people do desire it. He says, \"No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness. This, however, being a fact, we have not only all the proof which the case admits of, but all which it is possible to require, that happiness is a good: that each person's happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness, therefore, a good to the aggregate of all persons.\"\n\nSo, according to Mill, the evidence that something is desirable is that people do actually desire it. He doesn't rely on divine authority, expert opinion, or solely on rational insight; instead, he grounds desirability in actual human desires and their contribution to overall happiness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. People do actually desire it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
