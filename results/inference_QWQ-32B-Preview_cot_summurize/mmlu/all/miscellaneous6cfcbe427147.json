                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which one of these world leaders was assassinated. The options are Indira Gandhi, Ferdinand Marcos, Golda Meir, and Neville Chamberlain.\n\nFirst, Indira Gandhi. She was the Prime Minister of India, right? I think she was assassinated by her own bodyguards in 1984, after the Operation Blue Star incident at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. So, she was definitely assassinated.\n\nNext, Ferdinand Marcos. He was the President of the Philippines. I know he was a controversial figure and eventually exiled to Hawaii in 1986 after the People Power Revolution. I don't recall him being assassinated, though. He died in exile, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nGolda Meir was the Prime Minister of Israel. I believe she died of natural causes in 1978. She wasn't assassinated, was she?\n\nThen there's Neville Chamberlain. He was the British Prime Minister in the lead-up to World War II. He's known for his policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany. He died in 1940, I think, from cancer. So, not assassinated.\n\nWait a minute, but Indira Gandhi was assassinated, right? Let me double-check that. Yes, she was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984.\n\nFerdinand Marcos, as far as I know, died in Hawaii in 1989 due to a heart attack.\n\nGolda Meir passed away in 1978 from cancer.\n\nNeville Chamberlain died in 1940 from cancer as well.\n\nSo, among these options, only Indira Gandhi was assassinated.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any of the others faced assassination attempts that didn't succeed.\n\nFerdinand Marcos was involved in a lot of political turmoil, but I don't think he was assassinated.\n\nGolda Meir faced many threats being the leader of Israel during that time, but I don't think she was ever assassinated.\n\nNeville Chamberlain was a peacetime leader, and I don't think there were any assassination attempts on him.\n\nTherefore, the clear answer is Indira Gandhi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
