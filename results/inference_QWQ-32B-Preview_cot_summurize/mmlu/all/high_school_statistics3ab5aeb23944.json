                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about resistors. The average resistance is 200 ohms, and the standard deviation is 5 ohms. The resistances are normally distributed. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen resistor has a resistance greater than 188 ohms, given that it's already under 194 ohms.\n\nOkay, first things first. I need to understand what's being asked. It's a conditional probability problem. I need to find P(X > 188 | X < 194), where X is the resistance of a resistor.\n\nI remember that for conditional probabilities, the formula is:\n\nP(A | B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B)\n\nSo in this case, A is X > 188, and B is X < 194. So I need to find P(X > 188 and X < 194) divided by P(X < 194).\n\nWait, X > 188 and X < 194 is just X being between 188 and 194 ohms. So it's P(188 < X < 194) / P(X < 194).\n\nAlright, now since X is normally distributed with mean 200 and standard deviation 5, I can standardize X to use the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe standardization formula is Z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where \u03bc is the mean and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nSo, Z = (X - 200) / 5.\n\nFirst, I need to find P(X < 194). Let's find the Z-score for X = 194.\n\nZ = (194 - 200) / 5 = -6 / 5 = -1.2\n\nNow, P(X < 194) = P(Z < -1.2). From the standard normal table, P(Z < -1.2) is approximately 0.1151.\n\nNext, I need P(188 < X < 194). Let's find the Z-scores for X = 188 and X = 194.\n\nFor X = 188:\n\nZ = (188 - 200) / 5 = -12 / 5 = -2.4\n\nFor X = 194:\n\nZ = (194 - 200) / 5 = -6 / 5 = -1.2\n\nSo, P(188 < X < 194) = P(-2.4 < Z < -1.2).\n\nTo find this, I can use the standard normal table to find P(Z < -1.2) and P(Z < -2.4), then subtract them.\n\nP(Z < -1.2) = 0.1151\n\nP(Z < -2.4) = 0.0082\n\nTherefore, P(-2.4 < Z < -1.2) = 0.1151 - 0.0082 = 0.1069.\n\nNow, plug these back into the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(188 < X < 194 | X < 194) = P(188 < X < 194) / P(X < 194) = 0.1069 / 0.1151 \u2248 0.93.\n\nWait, that seems familiar. Looking back at the options, 0.93 is option D.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, P(X < 194) = P(Z < -1.2) = 0.1151. That seems correct.\n\nThen, P(188 < X < 194) = P(-2.4 < Z < -1.2) = P(Z < -1.2) - P(Z < -2.4) = 0.1151 - 0.0082 = 0.1069. That also seems right.\n\nNow, dividing 0.1069 by 0.1151 gives approximately 0.93. So, the probability is about 0.93.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there another way to interpret this problem? Maybe I should consider the conditional probability differently.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that X < 194, we can think of the distribution being truncated at 194, and then find the probability that X > 188 within that truncated range.\n\nBut I think the way I did it is correct. The conditional probability formula should work here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other approach that might be more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the properties of the normal distribution directly.\n\nBut I think the conditional probability approach is the right way to go here.\n\nSo, I think D. 0.93 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
