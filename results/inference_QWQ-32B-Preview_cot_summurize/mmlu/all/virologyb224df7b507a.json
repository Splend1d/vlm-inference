I remember reading somewhere that retroviruses were first discovered in chickens with a specific type of cancer called Rous sarcoma. Is that correct?\n\n**Answer:** A. In chickens as Rous sarcoma\n\n**Explanation:** Retroviruses were first discovered in chickens with Rous sarcoma, a form of cancer. In 1900, American pathologist Francis Peyton Rous discovered that a filtrate from a chicken tumor could induce sarcomas when injected into healthy chickens. This was the first demonstration of a virus causing cancer, and the virus was later named Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). This discovery was pivotal in understanding the role of viruses in cancer development and led to the identification of other retroviruses in different species."
