                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Turkey in 2019. It's asking for the percentage of people who agreed that the state is run for the benefit of all the people. The options are 36%, 51%, 66%, and 81%. I don't remember the exact statistics off the top of my head, so I need to think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that Turkey has a unique political system. It's a republic with a president who has significant powers. In 2019, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was the president, and his party, the AKP, had been in power for many years. So, the government was likely quite influential in shaping public opinion.\n\nI also remember that there were some social and political tensions in Turkey around that time. There were protests, both supporting and opposing the government. So, it's possible that public opinion was divided.\n\nLooking at the options, 36% seems quite low, suggesting that less than half of the population agreed with this statement. On the other hand, 81% seems quite high, implying that nearly everyone believed the state was run for the benefit of all. 51% is just over half, and 66% is two-thirds.\n\nI think that if the state was widely perceived as running for the benefit of all people, the percentage would be higher. But given that there were criticisms and opposition, it might not be as high as 81%. Conversely, if it were only 36%, that would mean the majority disagreed, which might not align with the government's self-perception.\n\nPerhaps 66% is a reasonable estimate. It suggests that a majority agreed, but there was still a significant minority that did not. This seems plausible given the political climate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 51% is more accurate, indicating a narrow majority agreed, with nearly half disagreeing. This could reflect a polarized society.\n\nI need to consider the source of this data. Probably, this comes from a public opinion poll or survey conducted in 2019 in Turkey. Different surveys can have varying results based on methodology and timing.\n\nUnfortunately, without access to specific survey data, I have to make an educated guess based on my general knowledge of Turkey's political landscape in 2019.\n\nGiven that, I would choose 66%. It seems like a plausible majority, acknowledging both support and criticism of the government.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
