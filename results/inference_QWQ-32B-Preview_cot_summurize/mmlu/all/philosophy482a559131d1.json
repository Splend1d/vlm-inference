                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Paley's argument. So, Paley is famous for his watchmaker analogy, right? He used it to argue for the existence of a designer, like a god, based on the complexity and purposefulness of natural things. So, in his analogy, he compares the complexity of a watch to that of living organisms.\n\nThe question is: \"According to Paley, we must conclude that a watch had an intelligent designer if the watch _____.\"\n\nAnd we have options:\n\nA. shows purposefulness\n\nB. has a structure\n\nC. runs well\n\nD. is engraved\n\nI need to think about which of these attributes would lead Paley to conclude that there's an intelligent designer.\n\nFirst, let's recall Paley's argument. He says that if you find a watch on a heath, you wouldn't assume it just happened by chance. The complexity and the clear purpose of the watch\u2014telling time\u2014suggest that it was designed by an intelligent being, a watchmaker.\n\nSo, the key points in his argument are complexity and purposefulness. The watch is complex, and it serves a specific purpose, which is to keep and display time.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. shows purposefulness\n\nThis seems directly in line with Paley's argument. The purposefulness of the watch is what suggests design.\n\nB. has a structure\n\nWell, many things have a structure, even natural objects like rocks or trees. So, just having a structure might not necessarily imply design.\n\nC. runs well\n\nThis could be related to its purpose, but \"runs well\" might not be essential to the argument. A watch could be broken but still show signs of design because of its structure and purpose.\n\nD. is engraved\n\nThis might suggest human craftsmanship, but it's not essential to Paley's argument about design.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is A. shows purposefulness.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf a watch shows purposefulness, that aligns with Paley's emphasis on the purposeful design of complex objects.\n\nHaving a structure is more general and doesn't necessarily imply design.\n\nRunning well might be a consequence of good design, but it's not the primary indicator of design.\n\nBeing engraved might suggest\u4eba\u5de5\u5236\u9020\uff0c\u4f46 again, it's not central to Paley's argument.\n\nTherefore, I'm fairly confident that A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
