                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option best describes the investigation of hedonic consumption of products. Let's see what each option means and how it relates to hedonic consumption.\n\nFirst, what is hedonic consumption? Hedonic consumption refers to the enjoyment or pleasure derived from consuming products or experiences. It's about the sensory, emotional, and experiential aspects of consumption rather than just the functional utility of the product.\n\nOption A: Social interaction perspective. This seems to focus on how people interact with each other through products. For example, using a product might facilitate social bonding or communication. While social interactions can certainly enhance the hedonic aspect of consumption, I'm not sure if this option directly investigates hedonic consumption itself.\n\nOption B: Functional utilization perspective. This sounds like it's about how products are used for their practical functions. For instance, a hammer is used to drive nails into wood. This seems more related to utilitarian consumption rather than hedonic consumption, which is more about enjoyment and pleasure.\n\nOption C: Experiential consumption. This seems closely related to hedonic consumption. Experiential consumption emphasizes the experiences and feelings associated with consuming a product, rather than just its functional attributes. So, this might be a strong candidate.\n\nOption D: Brand management perspective. This likely involves how brands are managed and perceived by consumers. While brand perception can influence the hedonic aspects of consumption, it might not directly investigate the hedonic consumption itself.\n\nComparing these options, experiential consumption (Option C) seems to align most closely with hedonic consumption, as both focus on the experiential and emotional aspects of product consumption.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Experiential consumption.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
