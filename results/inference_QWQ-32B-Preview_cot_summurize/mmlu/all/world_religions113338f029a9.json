                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on my religious studies, but I think I can figure this out. So, the question is asking about the two sacraments that all Christians celebrate. Now, I know that different Christian denominations have varying practices and beliefs when it comes to sacraments, but there must be some common ground.\n\nLet me recall, sacraments are sacred rites or ceremonies that are regarded as outward and visible signs of inward and spiritual grace. In Christianity, they are an essential part of the faith.\n\nOption A is Baptism and Eucharist. I remember that Baptism is generally considered the first sacrament, where a person is initiated into the Christian faith. Eucharist, also known as Communion or the Lord's Supper, is another major sacrament where believers partake in bread and wine as a memorial of Jesus' last meal with his disciples.\n\nOption B mentions Ordination. I know that Ordination is the act of setting someone apart for ministry, like becoming a priest or a pastor. But not all Christians are ordained, so it seems unlikely that this would be a sacrament celebrated by all Christians.\n\nOption C includes Marriage. While many Christians do get married in a religious ceremony, not all Christians are married. So, it wouldn't make sense for Marriage to be a sacrament celebrated by all.\n\nOption D mentions Confession. I know that in some denominations, like Roman Catholicism, Confession is a sacrament where people confess their sins to a priest. However, not all Christian traditions practice Confession in the same way, or at all. So, it's probably not universal.\n\nGiven this, it seems like Option A, Baptism and Eucharist, is the most likely answer. These two sacraments are widely recognized and practiced across different Christian denominations, from Catholics to Protestants to Orthodox Christians.\n\nBut just to double-check, I should consider if there are any Christian groups that don't practice one or both of these sacraments. For example, some Baptistic traditions practice Believer's Baptism, where only adults who have made a personal confession of faith are baptized, whereas in other traditions, like Catholicism, infant baptism is common. However, despite differences in practice, baptism is still recognized as a sacrament in both traditions.\n\nSimilarly, the Eucharist is central to most Christian worship services, even if there are differences in how it's understood theologically, such as transubstantiation in Catholicism versus symbolic representation in some Protestant churches.\n\nTherefore, despite variations in practice and theology, Baptism and Eucharist are the two sacraments that are universally celebrated by all Christians.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is A. Baptism and Eucharist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
