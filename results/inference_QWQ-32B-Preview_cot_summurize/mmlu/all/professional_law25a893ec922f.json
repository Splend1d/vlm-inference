With a seating capacity of 1,500, it is customarily leased for rock concerts, rodeos, sporting events, fashion shows, etc. In January, a rock star held a week-long concert there, drawing a full house each night. Generally, the city leases the auditorium's facilities for a charge of $2,000 per day. In February, a religious sect applied to rent the auditorium for its annual celebration. However, the city council voted 7 to 3 against permitting the group from using the auditorium. When their rental application was denied, the religious sect threatened to take legal action against the city council. They contended unfair discrimination inasmuch as other religious organizations had leased the auditorium in previous months for their religious gatherings. Amid this controversy, the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the rental of the auditorium to any religious group. The ordinance was passed in a \"closed door\" session, which did not permit any debate or hearings on the matter. Is this newly enacted city ordinance likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it violates the due process rights of religious groups by not affording them an opportunity for a hearing.\nB.

                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about whether a city ordinance that prohibits renting an auditorium to any religious group is likely to be considered constitutional. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. There's a civic auditorium owned by the city, which is rented out for various events like concerts, rodeos, and fashion shows. It seems like it's a public space that's available for different organizations to use, with a standard daily rental fee of $2,000.\n\nIn January, a rock concert sold out every night, which suggests that the auditorium is a popular venue for events. Then, in February, a religious sect wanted to rent it for their annual celebration, but the city council voted against allowing them to use it. This led to a threat of legal action from the religious sect, who argued that this was unfair discrimination, especially since other religious organizations had used the auditorium in the past.\n\nAs a result of this controversy, the city council passed an ordinance that bans any religious group from renting the auditorium. This ordinance was passed in a closed-door session without any debate or hearings.\n\nNow, the question is whether this ordinance is likely to be held constitutional. There are four options provided:\n\nA. No, because it violates the due process rights of religious groups by not affording them an opportunity for a hearing.\n\nB. No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\nC. Yes, because the ordinance treats all religious groups equally.\n\nD. Yes, because a city ordinance is not a state action, per se, and therefore is not subject to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\nOption A suggests that the ordinance is unconstitutional because it violates due process rights by not providing a hearing. Due process generally requires that people have a fair opportunity to be heard before their rights are deprived. In this case, the ordinance was passed in a closed-door session without debate or hearings, which might suggest a due process violation. However, the core issue here seems to be the content of the ordinance\u2014prohibiting religious groups from renting the auditorium\u2014rather than the procedural manner in which it was passed. While the process might be problematic, the main constitutional concern appears to be the discrimination based on religion.\n\nOption B argues that the ordinance is unconstitutional because it discriminates against religious groups, violating the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, which is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. This seems like a strong argument. The First Amendment's free exercise clause generally prohibits the government from restricting the free exercise of religion. By banning all religious groups from renting the auditorium, the city is specifically targeting religious activity, which could be seen as a violation of this clause.\n\nOption C states that the ordinance is constitutional because it treats all religious groups equally. While it's true that the ordinance applies equally to all religious groups, equality alone doesn't justify discrimination based on religion. The equal application might satisfy some standards, but when it comes to religious freedom, simply treating all religious groups the same doesn't necessarily overcome the constitutional issues associated with restricting religious exercise.\n\nOption D suggests that the ordinance is constitutional because a city ordinance isn't considered state action per se, and therefore isn't subject to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, this seems incorrect. City governments are considered state actors because they exercise authority derived from the state, and their actions are subject to the constraints of the Fourteenth Amendment, including the due process and equal protection clauses.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B seems to be the most accurate. The ordinance likely violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment by discriminating against religious groups. The fact that other religious organizations had previously been allowed to rent the auditorium makes the sudden ban seem particularly suspicious and potentially discriminatory.\n\nAdditionally, the auditorium appears to be a public forum or at least a limited public forum, depending on how it's been traditionally used. If it's a public forum, the government can't restrict access based on the speaker's message or identity, including their religious affiliation, without a compelling reason.\n\nIn this case, the city's ban on religious groups seems like content-based discrimination, which is generally subject to strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny requires that the government has a compelling interest and that the law is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. It's unclear what compelling interest the city has in banning all religious groups from using the auditorium.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the ordinance was passed in a closed-door session without public input or hearings might also raise due process concerns, as mentioned in option A. However, the primary issue seems to be the discriminatory content of the ordinance rather than the procedural irregularities in its passage.\n\nIn conclusion, the ordinance is likely to be held unconstitutional because it discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
