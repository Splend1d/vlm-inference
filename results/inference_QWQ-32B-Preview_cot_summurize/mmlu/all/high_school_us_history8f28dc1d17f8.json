                    "text": "So I've got this passage attributed to Logan, who was an Indian leader, and it's from 1774. The question is asking for the best expression of Logan's perspective in this passage. The options are:\n\nA. Logan believes the expansion of British settlements must be stopped.\n\nB. Logan laments the loss of his family.\n\nC. Logan opposes a new peace treaty.\n\nD. Logan believes that Indians need to find strength in unity.\n\nFirst, I need to read the passage carefully and understand what Logan is saying.\n\nHe starts by appealing to any white man and asks if they ever entered his cabin hungry and he didn't give them meat, or if they came cold and naked and he didn't clothe them. This seems like he's establishing that he was friendly and helpful to the white people.\n\nThen he mentions that during the last long and bloody war, he remained idle in his cabin, advocating for peace. His countrymen even pointed at him and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" So, it's clear that he had a history of being peaceful and friendly towards the whites.\n\nBut then he says, \"I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man.\" He's referring to Colonel Cresap, who, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked, murdered all of Logan's relations, not sparing even his women and children.\n\nThis personal tragedy seems to be the turning point. He says, \"There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature.\" Meaning, his entire family was wiped out.\n\nBecause of this, he sought revenge and killed many, fully glutting his vengeance.\n\nNow, he says, he rejoices at the beams of peace for his country, but makes it clear that his joy is not out of fear. He declares that he never felt fear and wouldn't turn his heel to save his life.\n\nFinally, he asks, \"Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\"\n\nSo, considering all this, let's look back at the options.\n\nOption A says Logan believes the expansion of British settlements must be stopped. Well, the passage doesn't really talk about expansion of settlements. It's more about his personal experience and reaction to the murder of his family.\n\nOption B says Logan laments the loss of his family. That seems pretty accurate. He talks about how Colonel Cresap murdered all his relations, including women and children, and how there's no one left of his bloodline.\n\nOption C says Logan opposes a new peace treaty. Actually, he says he rejoices at the beams of peace, so it seems like he's in favor of peace, not opposing it.\n\nOption D says Logan believes that Indians need to find strength in unity. While he mentions that his countrymen referred to him as the friend of the white man, he doesn't explicitly talk about unity or the need for it.\n\nSo, between the options, B seems the most fitting. He laments the loss of his family, which is central to his narrative. The murder of his family is what drove him to seek revenge, and now that vengeance is fulfilled, he's rejoicing in peace.\n\nBut wait, is there more to it? He does talk about peace and his lack of fear, which might suggest a broader perspective. However, the core of his speech is about his personal loss and how it led him to revenge, and now, with vengeance satisfied, he's accepting peace.\n\nOption A about stopping the expansion of British settlements isn't directly addressed in the passage. It's more about his personal experiences and feelings.\n\nOption C about opposing a new peace treaty is contrary to what he says; he rejoices in peace.\n\nOption D about unity isn't explicitly mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B: Logan laments the loss of his family.\n\nHowever, to make sure, let's consider the entire passage again.\n\nHe starts by emphasizing his kindness towards whites, then mentions his peaceful stance during the war, and how he was known as a friend to whites. Then comes the tragic event of his family being murdered, which compels him to seek revenge. After satisfying his vengeance, he's happy about peace, but clarifies that it's not out of fear; he's not cowardly.\n\nThe ending is poignant: \"Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\" This could imply that he feels isolated now, with no family left, and perhaps no real place in either the Indian or white communities.\n\nBut despite this, the central theme is his personal loss and how it drove him to revenge, and now, having satisfied that, he accepts peace.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to capture this perspective best.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
