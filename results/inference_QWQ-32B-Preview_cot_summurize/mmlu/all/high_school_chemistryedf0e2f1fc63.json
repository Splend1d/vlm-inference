                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about titrating a weak base with a strong acid, and I need to figure out what happens to the pH during the titration. I have four options to choose from, and I need to pick the one that correctly describes the pH changes.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens when you titrate a weak base with a strong acid. A weak base doesn't fully dissociate in water, so its solution is only slightly basic. When you add a strong acid, which fully dissociates into H+ ions, it reacts with the weak base to neutralize it.\n\nOption A says that initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH below 7 at the equivalence point. Option B says the pH gradually decreases throughout and is below 7 at equivalence. Option C is similar to A but says the pH equals 7 at equivalence. Option D says pH quickly decreases initially, then gradually decreases to equivalence where pOH equals pKb of the base.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the equivalence point first. At the equivalence point, all the weak base has been neutralized by the strong acid. For a weak base and strong acid titration, the resulting solution is acidic because the conjugate acid of the weak base is formed, which can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions.\n\nSo, the pH at equivalence should be below 7, which rules out option D because it says pOH equals pKb at equivalence, which would imply a basic solution, but we know it should be acidic.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, they all suggest that pH decreases throughout the titration, which makes sense because we're adding acid to a basic solution. The question is, what's the nature of this decrease: is it slow initially then rapid, or gradual throughout?\n\nIn titration curves, there's a region called the equivalence point where there's a sharp change in pH. For strong acid titrating a weak base, the pH at equivalence is below 7, and before equivalence, the solution is basic, becoming less basic as acid is added.\n\nSo, initially, when you start adding acid, the pH should decrease slowly because the weak base can buffer the solution, resisting changes in pH. As you get closer to the equivalence point, the buffering capacity decreases, and the pH changes more rapidly. At equivalence, the pH is below 7, and after equivalence, it continues to decrease, but possibly at a different rate.\n\nOption A describes this behavior: initially, slow decrease, then a rapid decrease to pH below 7 at equivalence.\n\nOption B says the pH gradually decreases throughout, which might not account for the sharp change at equivalence.\n\nOption C says pH equals 7 at equivalence, but we know it should be below 7.\n\nSo, option A seems the most accurate.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. In a titration of a weak base with a strong acid, the equivalence point is acidic, not basic. So, pH should indeed be below 7 at equivalence.\n\nThe shape of the titration curve typically shows a slow decrease in pH at the beginning, a rapid decrease around the equivalence point, and then a slower decrease again after equivalence.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly describes this behavior.\n\nOption B says the pH gradually decreases throughout, but \"gradually\" might not capture the sharp drop at equivalence.\n\nOption C says pH equals 7 at equivalence, which isn't correct for a weak base-strong acid titration.\n\nOption D mentions pOH equals pKb at equivalence, which would be true for a strong base-weak acid titration, but not for weak base-strong acid.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
