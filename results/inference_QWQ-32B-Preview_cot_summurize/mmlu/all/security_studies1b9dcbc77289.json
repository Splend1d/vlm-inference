A process of securitization is when an issue not included in the political sphere becomes politicized and is managed within the political system. A securitized issue is part of public policy requiring governmental action; decision-making, resource allocation and even communal governance.\nB. A securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitised when it is outside of the political domain. An existential threat can be made a matter for state attention even when it is not included within public debate. Securitization refers to the recognition of the threat prior to its emergence in the political process.\nC. Securitization refers to the move of issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain of decision-making activities. Once placed above the political sphere it cannot be returned to the public sphere, having been translated into a state interest above normal proceedings.\nD. An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.\n"

                    "text": "I think the correct answer is D. An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.\n\nLet me explain why I think this is the right answer. Securitization is a concept in security studies that describes how certain issues are constructed as security threats, thereby justifying extraordinary measures to address them. The key elements here are the securitizing actor, the audience, and the referent object.\n\nOption A talks about an issue becoming politicized and managed within the political system, but securitization is more about moving beyond normal politics into a security realm where different rules apply.\n\nOption B mentions that a securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitized when it's outside the political domain, and that an existential threat can be made a matter for state attention even if it's not part of public debate. While this has elements of securitization, it doesn't fully capture the process of how an issue is transformed through discourse.\n\nOption C says that securitization refers to moving issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain, and once placed there, it can't be returned to the public sphere. This seems partially correct but implies permanence, which isn't accurate because securitization can be reversed.\n\nOption D aligns closely with the academic understanding of securitization, particularly as conceptualized by Barry Buzan and Ole W\u00e6ver in their Copenhagen School of security studies. According to this framework, securitization involves a speech act where a securitizing actor frames an issue as an existential threat to a referent object (like the state, society, or humanity), and persuades an audience to accept this framing, thereby justifying exceptional measures.\n\nSo, in summary, securitization is about transforming a political issue into a security issue through persuasive discourse, highlighting its urgency and existential nature, and justifying extraordinary responses.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Buzan, B., W\u00e6ver, O., & de Wilde, J.
