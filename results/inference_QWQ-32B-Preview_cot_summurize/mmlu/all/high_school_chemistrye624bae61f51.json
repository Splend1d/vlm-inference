                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"A liquid element that is a dark-colored, nonconducting substance at room temperature is...\" and then there are options: A. mercury, B. bromine, C. iodine, D. bismuth. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these fits all those criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to recall which of these elements are liquid at room temperature. I know that most elements are solids at room temperature, but there are a few that are liquids. Mercury is one of them; it's a silvery liquid metal. Bromine is another one; it's a dark reddish-brown liquid. Iodine is typically a solid, isn't it? It's a dark purple solid that sublimes easily. And bismuth is a solid, right? It's a brittle metal.\n\nSo, from the options, mercury and bromine are liquids at room temperature. Now, the question specifies \"dark-colored, nonconducting substance.\" Let's look at mercury first. Mercury is a silvery liquid, so it's not really dark-colored. Also, it's a metal, which means it should conduct electricity. So, that doesn't match the description.\n\nNext, bromine is a dark reddish-brown liquid, which fits the \"dark-colored\" part. Now, is it a nonconducting substance? Bromine is a nonmetal, and nonmetals generally do not conduct electricity well. So, this seems promising.\n\nIodine is a solid, so it doesn't fit the liquid criterion. And bismuth is also a solid.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check about iodine. I think iodine is a solid at room temperature, but maybe under certain conditions it can be liquid. Let me think. Iodine has a high melting point, around 114\u00b0C, so at room temperature, it should be solid. When heated, it sublimes directly from solid to gas without becoming liquid, unless perhaps under higher pressure.\n\nSimilarly, bismuth has a melting point of about 271\u00b0C, so it's definitely a solid at room temperature.\n\nSo, back to bromine. It's a liquid at room temperature, dark-colored, and nonconducting. That seems to fit all the criteria.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other elements that might fit this description. For example, francium is a metal that has a low melting point, but it's highly radioactive and extremely rare, so it's unlikely to be an option here. Also, it's not listed in the choices.\n\nAnother element to consider is cesium, which is a metal with a low melting point, but it's silvery gold, not dark-colored, and it conducts electricity.\n\nSo, among the options given, bromine seems to be the only one that is a liquid, dark-colored, and nonconducting at room temperature.\n\nI should also confirm the conductivity part. Bromine is a nonmetal, and nonmetals usually do not conduct electricity because they don't have delocalized electrons like metals do. So, that should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. bromine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
