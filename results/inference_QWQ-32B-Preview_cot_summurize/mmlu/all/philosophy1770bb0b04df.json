He argued that when we are alive, death is not present, and when death is present, we are not alive. Therefore, it is irrational to fear something that does not affect us. This view is encapsulated in his letter to Menoeceus, where he states, \"Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us.\" Thus, the wise man, according to Epicurus, is unconcerned with death."
