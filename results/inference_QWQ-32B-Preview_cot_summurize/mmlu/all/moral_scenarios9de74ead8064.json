Brakes are a critical safety feature in vehicles, and disabling them would make the car dangerous to drive. This action could lead to accidents, injuries, or even deaths. From a moral standpoint, putting others at risk without their knowledge is clearly wrong because it demonstrates a lack of concern for their safety and well-being.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character added their name to the back of a check given to them by their granny for their birthday before cashing it. Assuming that the check was intended for the main character and no one else, adding their name to the back (endorsing the check) is a standard procedure for cashing it. This seems like a normal action and doesn't appear to be morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if there's any ambiguity about who the check is intended for or if the main character is adding their name without permission, that could be a different story. But based on the information provided, it seems like the main character is simply cashing a birthday check from their granny, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Not wrong\n\nSo the correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
