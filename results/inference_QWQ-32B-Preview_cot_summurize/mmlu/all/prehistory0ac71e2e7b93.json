                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to answer this question about European Neolithic crops. The question is: \"Virtually all of the crops important in the European Neolithic: A. were domesticated at the same time at communal farms. B. were domesticated before groups became sedentary. C. were independently domesticated in Europe. D. were imported from other regions.\"\n\nOkay, first I need to recall what the Neolithic period was. I think it's also known as the New Stone Age, right? It's when humans started shifting from hunting and gathering to farming and settling down in one place. So, in Europe, this would have been around, I don't remember the exact dates, but maybe between 6,000 and 2,000 BCE or something like that.\n\nNow, the question is about the crops that were important during this time in Europe. I need to think about where these crops came from. Were they domesticated locally, or did they come from other places?\n\nI vaguely remember that many of the plants that were domesticated in Europe were actually brought in from the Fertile Crescent, which is an area that includes modern-day countries like Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and parts of Iraq and Iran. This region is considered one of the earliest centers of agriculture.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option D, \"were imported from other regions,\" might be the correct answer. But I should double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says, \"were domesticated at the same time at communal farms.\" I don't think that's accurate because domestication probably happened over a long period and in different places. Also, the idea of communal farming might not have been uniform across all Neolithic communities.\n\nOption B says, \"were domesticated before groups became sedentary.\" Hmm, domestication usually happens when people settle down and start cultivating plants and animals. So, domestication and sedentism are closely linked. I think domestication occurs as people become sedentary, not necessarily before.\n\nOption C says, \"were independently domesticated in Europe.\" Well, some crops might have been domesticated independently in Europe, but I believe the major staple crops like wheat and barley were introduced from the Fertile Crescent.\n\nLet me think about specific crops. Wheat and barley are classic Neolithic crops, and I'm pretty sure they were domesticated in the Fertile Crescent and then spread into Europe. So, those would have been imported.\n\nMaybe some other crops were domesticated locally in Europe. For example, I've heard of einkorn and emmer wheat being domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, but perhaps some other grains were domesticated in Europe. But I think the major crops came from elsewhere.\n\nAlso, pulses like lentils and peas were important in the Neolithic, and I think they were also originally from the Fertile Crescent.\n\nSo, overall, it seems like most of the important crops in European Neolithic were imported from other regions.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. Were imported from other regions.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there were any crops that were independently domesticated in Europe.\n\nI recall that flax was an important crop in the Neolithic, and it was used for making linen. I'm not sure where it was first domesticated. Maybe it was domesticated independently in Europe, or perhaps it was also introduced from the Fertile Crescent.\n\nAnother crop is poppy, which was cultivated for its seeds. I don't know about its origin.\n\nAlso, there's oats, which are important in northern Europe. I think oats were domesticated later, maybe in the Bronze Age, but in the Neolithic, they might have been gathered wild.\n\nSo, perhaps some secondary crops were domesticated locally, but the major staples came from elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, option D seems the most accurate.\n\nJust to make sure, I should consider if there's any evidence of early farming in Europe that predates the arrival of agriculture from the East.\n\nI think the earliest farming in Europe is associated with the Linearbandkeramik (LBK) culture, which appeared around 5,500 BCE in Central Europe. This culture is believed to have brought farming practices and crops from the Balkans, where agriculture had already been present for a while.\n\nSo, even in the Balkans, agriculture and the associated crops were introduced from the Fertile Crescent.\n\nTherefore, it's safe to say that virtually all of the important crops in the European Neolithic were imported from other regions.\n\nHence, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
