                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an ideal gas. It says that the temperature is increased by a factor of 2 and the volume is increased by a factor of 8. I need to find out what happens to the pressure, P. There are four options: it decreases by factors of 16, 4, or 2, or it increases by a factor of 4. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that for an ideal gas, the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature is given by the ideal gas law, which is PV = nRT. Here, P is pressure, V is volume, T is temperature, n is the number of moles of gas, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nIn this problem, it seems like n and R are constants, so I can think of PV/T being constant. If I have initial conditions P1, V1, T1, and final conditions P2, V2, T2, then P1*V1/T1 = P2*V2/T2.\n\nGiven that the temperature is increased by a factor of 2, so T2 = 2*T1, and the volume is increased by a factor of 8, so V2 = 8*V1.\n\nI need to find P2 in terms of P1.\n\nSo, starting from P1*V1/T1 = P2*V2/T2,\n\nSubstitute V2 and T2:\n\nP1*V1/T1 = P2*(8*V1)/(2*T1)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nP2*(8*V1)/(2*T1) = P2*(4*V1)/T1\n\nSo, P1*V1/T1 = P2*(4*V1)/T1\n\nNow, I can cancel V1 and T1 from both sides:\n\nP1 = P2 * 4\n\nTherefore, P2 = P1 / 4\n\nThat means the pressure decreases by a factor of 4.\n\nLooking back at the options, B says P decreases by a factor of 4, which matches my conclusion.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nStarting again:\n\nInitial: P1*V1 = n*R*T1\n\nFinal: P2*V2 = n*R*T2\n\nDivide the final equation by the initial equation:\n\n(P2*V2)/(P1*V1) = (n*R*T2)/(n*R*T1)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(P2/P1)*(V2/V1) = T2/T1\n\nWe know V2/V1 = 8 and T2/T1 = 2, so:\n\n(P2/P1)*8 = 2\n\nTherefore, P2/P1 = 2/8 = 1/4\n\nSo, P2 = P1/4\n\nYes, that confirms it. Pressure decreases by a factor of 4.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning. So, the correct answer should be B. P decreases by a factor of 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
