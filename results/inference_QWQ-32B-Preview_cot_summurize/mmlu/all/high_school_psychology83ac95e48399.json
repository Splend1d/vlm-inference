A group of thirty fraternity brothers from Penn State.\n\nB. A random sample taken between classes in the business wing of various universities.\n\nC. Sixty male members of each class from Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, and Columbia.\n\nD. Twenty male members of each class from a cross-section of colleges and universities.\n\nOkay, so the key here is to find the most representative sample of male college students. That means the sample should reflect the diversity of all male college students as closely as possible.\n\nOption A is a group of thirty fraternity brothers from Penn State. Now, fraternity brothers might not be representative of all male college students because they might have different characteristics compared to the general male college population. Also, Penn State is just one university, so it's not very broad.\n\nOption B is a random sample taken between classes in the business wing of various universities. This seems better because it's random and from various universities, but it's only from the business wing. That might not be representative because business students could have different characteristics compared to students in other fields.\n\nOption C is sixty male members of each class from Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, and Columbia. These are all prestigious schools, so the students there might not be representative of students at other types of colleges and universities. Also, it's only these five schools, which might not cover the diversity of all colleges.\n\nOption D is twenty male members of each class from a cross-section of colleges and universities. This sounds promising because it's from a variety of institutions, which should help capture the diversity of male college students.\n\nComparing all these options, D seems to be the most representative because it includes students from different types of colleges and universities, not just one institution or a specific group within institutions.\n\nBut let me think again. In option D, they have twenty male members from each class. Does that mean from each year level, like freshmen, sophomores, etc.? If so, that would be even better because it ensures representation across different years.\n\nSimilarly, in option C, they have sixty from each class, but again, only from those five elite schools.\n\nOption B is random but only from the business wing, which might not be representative of all majors.\n\nOption A is very specific to fraternity brothers at one university.\n\nSo, overall, D seems to be the most representative sample of male college students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
