She began looking for a home to purchase in the mountain community. She found one suitable location offered for sale by the owner. The asking price for the home was $100,000. Although the teacher was very interested in purchasing the home, she told the owner that she was not sure it would fit within her budget. The owner the grabbed a piece of paper and wrote the following:\"December 1In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby offer to sell to you my home for $100,000. This offer shall remain open until 4:00 p. m. December 30. \" The owner then signed the paper and handed it to the teacher, who left without paying the $1. On December 15, the owner sent the teacher a letter in which the owner stated, \"Please be advised that I am hereby withdrawing my offer to sell you my home. \" This letter was received and read by the teacher on December 16. The next day, the teacher tendered a cashier's check to the owner in the amount of $100,001 (which included the $100,000 purchase price plus the $1 consideration) and demanded a deed of conveyance to the property. The owner refused to accept the cashier's check. The teacher has now brought suit against the owner for specific performance. In her pleadings, the teacher admits that the recited $1 was not in fact paid to the owner when their written agreement was executed. Assume the teacher lives in a jurisdiction that follows the Restatement of Contracts. As a result, which of the following is the teacher's best argument that such failure of payment does not bar her claim to specific performance?\n\nA. The recited consideration was only a sham pretense of bargained-for consideration, and was therefore de minimis and of no legal significance.\nB. The teacher's inclusion of the $1 in her tendered check on December 17 was a timely cure of an immaterial breach of a bilateral real estate option contract.\nC. By promising to hold the offer open until December 30 in a signed writing, the owner could not revoke the offer prior to December 30.\nD. The written instrument embodied a proposal for a fair exchange within a reasonable time period and was therefore an enforceable option contract, regardless of whether the nominal consideration recited was bargained for or paid.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out the best argument the teacher can make in this situation. So, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the teacher found a house she likes, but she's not sure if it fits her budget. The owner writes her a note saying that for one dollar, she can have the option to buy the house for $100,000, and this offer is open until 4 p.m. on December 30. The teacher takes this note but doesn't pay the dollar right away.\n\nThen, on December 15, the owner sends a letter saying they're withdrawing the offer. The teacher gets this letter on the 16th and the next day, December 17, she tends a cashier's check for $100,001, which includes both the purchase price and the one dollar consideration.\n\nNow, the owner refuses to accept the check, and the teacher is suing for specific performance. The question is, given that the one dollar wasn't paid initially, what's the best argument the teacher can make that this doesn't bar her claim?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The recited consideration was only a sham pretense of bargained-for consideration, and was therefore de minimis and of no legal significance.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky. A sham consideration would mean that the one dollar wasn't really intended as consideration, it was just a formality. But in this case, the owner did specify that the offer required one dollar, and the teacher eventually tendered it. So, it doesn't seem like a sham; it seems like a condition that was meant to be fulfilled.\n\nAlso, de minimis considerations are sometimes accepted in law, meaning that even a small amount like one dollar can be sufficient consideration as long as there's some value exchanged. So, this argument might not hold water because the consideration, though small, was still present.\n\nB. The teacher's inclusion of the $1 in her tendered check on December 17 was a timely cure of an immaterial breach of a bilateral real estate option contract.\n\nThis option suggests that the teacher cured the breach by including the one dollar in her check. But was there a breach in the first place? The owner specified that the offer required one dollar, and the teacher eventually provided it.\n\nHowever, the owner tried to revoke the offer on December 15, before the teacher tendered the check. So, the question is whether the teacher's tender after the revocation is effective to cure any breach.\n\nIn contract law, generally, an offer can be revoked before acceptance, but there are exceptions, especially in option contracts. So, perhaps this argument is getting at the idea that this was an option contract, and therefore the owner couldn't revoke it.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to see if there's a better argument.\n\nC. By promising to hold the offer open until December 30 in a signed writing, the owner could not revoke the offer prior to December 30.\n\nThis seems promising. In many jurisdictions, including those following the Restatement of Contracts, a signed writing that promises to keep an offer open for a certain period constitutes an option contract. This means that during that period, the offer cannot be revoked.\n\nIn this case, the owner wrote and signed a note promising to keep the offer open until December 30. So, according to this argument, the owner couldn't revoke the offer on December 15; it had to remain open until December 30.\n\nIf this is an option contract, then the teacher could argue that the owner's attempt to revoke the offer was invalid, and therefore the offer was still on the table when she tendered the check on December 17.\n\nD. The written instrument embodied a proposal for a fair exchange within a reasonable time period and was therefore an enforceable option contract, regardless of whether the nominal consideration recited was bargained for or paid.\n\nThis argument is similar to option C but adds that the consideration doesn't need to be bargained for or paid for the option to be enforceable.\n\nWait a minute, in this case, the teacher did tender the one dollar consideration on December 17. So, the consideration was provided, even if it was after the owner's attempt to revoke.\n\nBut the key issue is whether the owner's revocation was effective. If the signed writing created an option contract that couldn't be revoked before December 30, then the revocation on December 15 was\u65e0\u6548, and the offer was still open when the teacher tendered the check.\n\nComparing options C and D, option C seems more directly on point because it specifically mentions that a signed writing promising to hold an offer open prevents revocation before the specified date.\n\nOption D is broader and mentions that the consideration doesn't need to be bargained for or paid, but in this case, the teacher did tender the consideration. So, perhaps option C is stronger.\n\nWait, but option B also mentions a bilateral real estate option contract, which seems similar to option C.\n\nHowever, option C is more straightforward and directly references the signed writing keeping the offer open, which aligns well with the Restatement of Contracts provisions on option contracts.\n\nLet me check what the Restatement says about option contracts.\n\nAccording to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, section 25, a purported revocation of an offer is ineffective if the offer is one that purports to commit the offeror to keep it open but does not do so under the rules of the Restatement.\n\nHowever, section 25 also states that an offer that purports to be irrevocable but is not supported by consideration is nevertheless revocable at any time before acceptance.\n\nBut section 25 also mentions that if the offer is supported by a valuable consideration, then it can be irrevocable.\n\nIn this case, the owner provided a signed writing promising to keep the offer open until December 30 in exchange for one dollar.\n\nUnder the Restatement, a signed writing that promises to keep an offer open for a certain period constitutes an option contract, and the consideration can be nominal, like one dollar.\n\nSo, even though the one dollar wasn't paid initially, the teacher did tender it later.\n\nBut the critical point is whether the option contract was formed when the owner signed the note, and therefore the owner was bound to keep the offer open until December 30, despite attempting to revoke it on December 15.\n\nIf that's the case, then the teacher's tender on December 17 would be acceptable because the offer was still valid.\n\nAlternatively, if the one dollar was a condition to the option contract, and it wasn't paid, then perhaps the option didn't come into existence.\n\nBut the teacher did tender the one dollar along with the purchase price on December 17.\n\nSo, perhaps there's an argument that the teacher cured the breach by tendering the one dollar at that time.\n\nWait, but was there a breach? The teacher was supposed to pay the one dollar to accept the option, but she didn't do so until December 17.\n\nHowever, the owner attempted to revoke the offer on December 15, which, if the option contract was formed, would have been\u65e0\u6548.\n\nSo, assuming the option contract was formed when the owner signed the note, then the owner couldn't revoke the offer before December 30.\n\nTherefore, when the teacher tendered the one dollar on December 17, it was a valid acceptance of the option, and the owner should accept it.\n\nAlternatively, if the option contract required the one dollar to be paid when the option was accepted, and the teacher didn't pay it initially, then perhaps the option wasn't accepted until the tender on December 17.\n\nBut since the option period was open until December 30, the tender on December 17 would be within the option period.\n\nTherefore, the teacher's tender of the one dollar and the purchase price should be accepted.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best argument seems to be that by promising to hold the offer open until December 30 in a signed writing, the owner could not revoke the offer prior to December 30.\n\nTherefore, option C is the strongest argument.\n\nOption D is also plausible, but it's a bit more vague and seems to suggest that the consideration doesn't need to be paid, which isn't entirely accurate because the teacher did tender it.\n\nOption B mentions curing an immaterial breach, but it's not entirely clear what breach occurred.\n\nOption A dismisses the consideration as de minimis, which isn't necessary because the consideration, though small, was provided.\n\nHence, option C is the teacher's best argument.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
