                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these organizations isn't an economic union. So first, I should probably understand what an economic union is. An economic union is a type of supranational organization where countries come together to manage their economic policies collectively. This usually involves things like free trade, common tariffs, and sometimes even a shared currency.\n\nOkay, so let's look at each option:\n\nA. EU - That's the European Union. I know that the EU is an economic union. They have the single market, which allows for the free movement of goods, services, people, and capital. They also have a common currency, the euro, used by many member states. So, definitely an economic union.\n\nB. CARICOM - That's the Caribbean Community. I think this is also an economic union. It was formed to promote economic integration and cooperation among Caribbean countries. They have a Caribbean Single Market and Economy, which aims to facilitate trade and economic development in the region. So, yes, an economic union.\n\nC. NAFTA - The North American Free Trade Agreement, which was between the US, Canada, and Mexico. It's an agreement that reduced trade barriers among these countries, promoting free trade. So, it's definitely related to economics and trade, making it an economic union.\n\nD. NATO - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This one seems different. I know NATO is a military alliance focused on defense and security issues among its member countries. It's not primarily about economic matters.\n\nSo, comparing all these, EU, CARICOM, and NAFTA are all about economic cooperation and integration, while NATO is about military and security cooperation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. NATO, as it is not an economic union.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe NATO has some economic aspects too. I recall that sometimes military alliances can have economic components, like joint procurement or something like that. But its primary purpose is military, right?\n\nYes, even if there are some economic elements, its main function is not economic cooperation.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with D. NATO as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
