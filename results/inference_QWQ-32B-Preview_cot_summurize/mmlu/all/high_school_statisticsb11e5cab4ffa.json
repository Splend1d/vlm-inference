                    "text": "So I've got this statistics problem here from a telephone survey. It says that out of 400 registered voters, 256 hadn't made up their minds about who to vote for, one month before the election. The question is asking how sure we can be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were still undecided at that time. And there are four options: A. 2.4%, B. 8.0%, C. 64.0%, and D. 90.4%.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like we're dealing with a confidence interval for a proportion. The sample proportion is the number of undecided voters divided by the total number of voters surveyed. So, 256 out of 400 are undecided. That means the sample proportion, p hat, is 256 divided by 400, which is 0.64, or 64%.\n\nNow, the question is about how sure we can be that the true proportion of undecided voters in the entire electorate lies between 60% and 68%. This sounds like we need to find the probability that the true proportion is within this range, based on our sample.\n\nI think we need to construct a confidence interval for the population proportion and see where this range falls within that interval. Alternatively, maybe we can calculate the z-scores for 60% and 68% and find the area under the standard normal curve between those z-scores.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the standard error of the proportion. The standard error, SE, is the square root of (p hat times (1 minus p hat) divided by n), where n is the sample size.\n\nSo, SE = sqrt( p hat * (1 - p hat) / n )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nSE = sqrt( 0.64 * 0.36 / 400 ) = sqrt( 0.2304 / 400 ) = sqrt(0.000576) = 0.024.\n\nSo, the standard error is 0.024, or 2.4%.\n\nNow, to find the z-scores for 60% and 68%, I need to standardize these proportions using the sample proportion and the standard error.\n\nThe z-score formula is: z = (p - p hat) / SE\n\nFirst, for 60%, which is 0.60:\n\nz1 = (0.60 - 0.64) / 0.024 = (-0.04) / 0.024 = -1.6667\n\nAnd for 68%, which is 0.68:\n\nz2 = (0.68 - 0.64) / 0.024 = (0.04) / 0.024 = 1.6667\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that z is between -1.6667 and 1.6667. This is the area under the standard normal curve between these two z-scores.\n\nI can look this up in a z-table or use a calculator with normal distribution functions.\n\nFirst, find the cumulative probability for z = 1.6667 and for z = -1.6667, then subtract the latter from the former.\n\nLooking up z = 1.6667 in a standard normal table, it's approximately 0.9525.\n\nFor z = -1.6667, it's the same as 1 - 0.9525 = 0.0475.\n\nSo, the probability between z = -1.6667 and z = 1.6667 is 0.9525 - 0.0475 = 0.9050, or 90.5%.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is 90.4%, which is very close to 90.5%.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, sample proportion p hat = 256 / 400 = 0.64.\n\nStandard error SE = sqrt(0.64 * 0.36 / 400) = sqrt(0.2304 / 400) = sqrt(0.000576) = 0.024.\n\nz1 = (0.60 - 0.64) / 0.024 = -0.04 / 0.024 = -1.6667.\n\nz2 = (0.68 - 0.64) / 0.024 = 0.04 / 0.024 = 1.6667.\n\nNow, the area between z = -1.6667 and z = 1.6667 is indeed approximately 90.5%, which rounds to 90.4%.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 90.4%.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a different method or formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the margin of error and then seeing how that relates to the given range.\n\nThe margin of error for a confidence interval is usually z times SE, where z corresponds to the desired confidence level.\n\nBut in this case, we're given a range and asked how sure we can be, which seems like finding the probability that the true proportion falls within that range, based on the sample data.\n\nYes, I think the approach I took is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 90.4%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
