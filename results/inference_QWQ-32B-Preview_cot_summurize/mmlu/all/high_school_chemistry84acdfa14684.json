                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the pKa of a weak, monoprotic acid given the amount dissolved, the volume of the solution, and the resulting pH. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a weak acid only partially dissociates in water. The general dissociation equation for a weak acid HA is:\n\n\\[ \\text{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^+ + \\text{A}^- \\]\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this dissociation is the acid dissociation constant, Ka:\n\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} \\]\n\nThe pKa is related to Ka by:\n\n\\[ \\text{p}K_a = -\\log(K_a) \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Moles of weak acid, n = 0.0025 mol\n- Volume of solution, V = 0.250 L\n- pH = 4.26\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentration of the weak acid initially. The initial concentration [HA]\u2080 is:\n\n\\[ [\\text{HA}]_0 = \\frac{n}{V} = \\frac{0.0025 \\text{ mol}}{0.250 \\text{ L}} = 0.010 \\text{ M} \\]\n\nNext, we know that at equilibrium, the concentration of H\u207a ions is related to the pH:\n\n\\[ [\\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\\text{pH}} = 10^{-4.26} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ [\\text{H}^+] = 10^{-4.26} \\approx 5.495 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M} \\]\n\nAssuming that the dissociation of the acid is the only source of H\u207a ions, we can say that at equilibrium:\n\n\\[ [\\text{H}^+] = [\\text{A}^-] = x = 5.495 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M} \\]\n\nThe concentration of undissociated acid [HA] at equilibrium is:\n\n\\[ [\\text{HA}] = [\\text{HA}]_0 - x = 0.010 \\text{ M} - 5.495 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M} \\approx 0.010 \\text{ M} \\]\n\n(The approximation is valid because x is much smaller than [\\text{HA}]\u2080.)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Ka expression:\n\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{(5.495 \\times 10^{-5})^2}{0.010} \\]\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n\\[ (5.495 \\times 10^{-5})^2 = 3.020 \\times 10^{-9} \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{3.020 \\times 10^{-9}}{0.010} = 3.020 \\times 10^{-7} \\]\n\nNow, to find pKa:\n\n\\[ \\text{p}K_a = -\\log(3.020 \\times 10^{-7}) \\]\n\nCalculating the logarithm:\n\n\\[ \\text{p}K_a \\approx 6.52 \\]\n\nTherefore, the pKa of the weak acid is approximately 6.52.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 4.26\nB. 8.52\nC. 7.92\nD. 6.52\n\nThe correct answer is D. 6.52.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.52} \\]"
