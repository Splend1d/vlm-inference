The given process is:\n\nyt = 1.5 yt-1 - 0.5 yt-2 + ut\n\nFirst, let's write down the characteristic equation for this AR(2) process. The general form of an AR(2) process is:\n\nyt = \u03c61 yt-1 + \u03c62 yt-2 + ut\n\nComparing this with the given equation, we have:\n\n\u03c61 = 1.5\n\n\u03c62 = -0.5\n\nThe characteristic equation for an AR(2) process is:\n\n1 - \u03c61 z - \u03c62 z^2 = 0\n\nPlugging in the values of \u03c61 and \u03c62:\n\n1 - 1.5 z - (-0.5) z^2 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 - 1.5 z + 0.5 z^2 = 0\n\nTo make it easier, let's rearrange the terms:\n\n0.5 z^2 - 1.5 z + 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for z using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = [1.5 \u00b1 sqrt( (1.5)^2 - 4 * 0.5 * 1 )] / (2 * 0.5)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\nD = (1.5)^2 - 4 * 0.5 * 1 = 2.25 - 2 = 0.25\n\nSo, the roots are:\n\nz = [1.5 \u00b1 sqrt(0.25)] / 1\n\nz = [1.5 \u00b1 0.5] / 1\n\nTherefore, the two roots are:\n\nz1 = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2\n\nz2 = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we need to determine the nature of the process based on these roots.\n\nIn time series analysis:\n\n- If both roots lie outside the unit circle (i.e., their absolute values are greater than 1), the process is stationary.\n\n- If one or both roots lie on the unit circle (i.e., their absolute values are equal to 1), the process has a unit root.\n\n- If any root lies inside the unit circle (i.e., its absolute value is less than 1), the process is explosive.\n\nLooking at the roots:\n\nz1 = 2 (|2| > 1)\n\nz2 = 1 (|1| = 1)\n\nSo, one root is outside the unit circle, and one root is on the unit circle.\n\nTherefore, the process has a unit root.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Unit root process\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
