                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Mabel Davis and trying to figure out which statement she would agree with based on the chapter's Senior View. I don't have the exact text in front of me, but I remember some key points from the chapter.\n\nFirst, I recall that Mabel Davis is presented as an elderly woman who shares her insights and experiences about aging. The chapter likely discusses various aspects of aging, such as physical health, mental agility, and personal resilience.\n\nOption A says, \"Time seems to speed up when you grow older.\" I think this is a common perception among older adults. As people age, they often feel that time passes more quickly than it did when they were younger. This could be due to various psychological factors, such as the proportion of time in one's life or the routine nature of daily activities. If Mabel mentions something about how time flies or how quickly years go by, then this could be a statement she agrees with.\n\nOption B is \"Exercise keeps your mind sharp.\" There is substantial evidence supporting the benefits of exercise for both physical and mental health, especially in older adults. Regular physical activity can help maintain cognitive function and may even reduce the risk of dementia. If the chapter includes Mabel discussing her own exercise routine or the importance of staying active, then this would be a likely choice.\n\nOption C states, \"Women are tougher than men.\" This is a more subjective statement, and whether Mabel agrees with it would depend on her personal beliefs and experiences. If the chapter includes anecdotes or opinions from Mabel that suggest she views women as more resilient or capable in certain ways, then this could be a possible answer. However, without specific information, it's harder to confirm this one.\n\nOption D says, \"Glasses and hearing aids should be avoided.\" This seems counterintuitive, as both glasses and hearing aids are assistive devices that can significantly improve quality of life for many older adults. If Mabel is portrayed as someone who values independence and self-reliance, she might have opinions against relying on such aids. However, generally, healthcare professionals recommend using these devices when needed. So, unless the chapter specifically indicates that Mabel avoids or discourages the use of such aids, this might not be the best choice.\n\nConsidering all options, I think Option B, \"Exercise keeps your mind sharp,\" is the most likely statement that Mabel Davis would agree with, based on the general themes associated with healthy aging and the benefits of physical activity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
