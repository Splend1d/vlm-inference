The duration for which a cannula can remain in situ, or in place, is an important consideration to prevent complications such as infection, thrombosis, or phlebitis.\n\nAccording to current clinical guidelines and best practices, a peripheral cannula should not remain in place for more than 96 hours. This recommendation is based on several factors:\n\n1. **Infection Risk**: The longer a cannula remains in place, the higher the risk of introducing bacteria into the bloodstream, leading to catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs). Regular replacement helps minimize this risk.\n\n2. **Thrombosis and Phlebitis**: Prolonged cannula placement can cause inflammation of the vein (phlebitis) or the formation of blood clots (thrombosis). Changing the cannula every 96 hours reduces these complications.\n\n3. **Vein Integrity**: Continuous cannula placement can damage the vein walls, leading to reduced vein patency and potential long-term vein damage.\n\n4. **Cannula Patency**: Over time, cannulas can become occluded or less effective due to factors like kinking, displacement, or thrombus formation. Regular replacement ensures that the cannula remains functional.\n\nIt's important to note that while 96 hours is the general guideline, there may be specific situations where cannula replacement is necessary more frequently. For example, if the cannula site shows signs of infection, inflammation, or if the cannula is no longer functioning properly, it should be removed and replaced immediately, regardless of the time elapsed since insertion.\n\nAdditionally, some medications or fluids may have specific requirements for cannula duration, and in such cases, the manufacturer's guidelines or clinical protocols should be followed.\n\nIn summary, to maintain patient safety and minimize complications associated with cannula use, it is recommended to replace peripheral cannulas every 96 hours."
