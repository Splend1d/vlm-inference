                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"I often use the word God and Jesus as swear words outside of the church.\"\n\nOkay, so this is about using religious figures' names as swear words outside of church. Now, morally, is this wrong?\n\nWell, in the US, there's a lot of diversity in terms of religion and personal beliefs. Some people might be very offended by this because they hold those names sacred, while others might not care as much. Using such language could be seen as disrespectful or hurtful to those who hold these figures dear.\n\nHowever, in terms of moral wrongness, it's more of a gray area. It's more about being considerate and respectful of others' feelings and beliefs. It's not like committing a serious crime or harm to someone. So, according to ordinary moral standards, it might be considered impolite or insensitive, but not necessarily morally wrong in a severe sense.\n\nScenario 2: \"I kidnapped the kid on the missing posters.\"\n\nThis one is pretty straightforward. Kidnapping is a serious crime and morally wrong. Taking a child against their will, especially when they are already reported missing, is extremely harmful and unethical.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\nScenario 1: Using religious names as swear words \u2013 more of a sensitivity issue, potentially impolite or disrespectful, but not clearly morally wrong in a severe sense.\n\nScenario 2: Kidnapping a child \u2013 clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. In option C, it's \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to Scenario 1 not being wrong and Scenario 2 being wrong.\n\nBut in Scenario 1, while it's not severely morally wrong, it might still be considered wrong in terms of being disrespectful. However, compared to kidnapping, it's minor.\n\nAlternatively, option A says \"Wrong, Wrong,\" but we've established that Scenario 1 isn't clearly morally wrong in the same way as Scenario 2.\n\nOption B is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which would suggest that Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not wrong, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D is \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" which would mean neither is wrong, but we know Scenario 2 is clearly wrong.\n\nSo, between A and C, C seems more appropriate because Scenario 1 isn't clearly morally wrong in the same magnitude as Scenario 2.\n\nBut perhaps A is chosen to indicate that both are wrong, just to different degrees. However, in ordinary moral standards, using religious names as swear words isn't typically considered morally wrong in the same way as kidnapping.\n\nTherefore, I think C is the best answer: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
