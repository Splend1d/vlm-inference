                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out when the tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run. So, let's break down the facts here.\n\nWe have a widow who owned a cottage and leased it to a tenant in 1985 for seven years, with monthly rent payments due on the first day of each month. Then, in 1986, the widow died, leaving her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America, although the cottage wasn't specifically mentioned in the will.\n\nOne month after the widow's death, the tenant learned about her death, decided to stay on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts of America didn't know about the cottage until 2009 when they inventoried testamentary gifts.\n\nThe statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years, and I need to determine when that period started for the tenant.\n\nOption A says it started when the widow died. But the widow died in 1986, and the tenant didn't stop paying rent until one month after her death. So, was the adverse possession clock already ticking at that point?\n\nOption B says it started when the tenant discontinued paying rent. That would be around two months after the widow's death, in 1986.\n\nOption C says it started when the tenant's lease with the widow expired. The lease was for seven years from 1985, so it would have expired in 1992.\n\nOption D says it started when the tenant subjectively believed he no longer had permission to possess the cottage. That seems a bit vague, but according to the story, the tenant decided to remain on the property after learning of the widow's death, which suggests he knew he didn't have permission from her anymore.\n\nIn terms of adverse possession, the key elements are that the possession is actual, open, notorious, exclusive, continuous, and hostile for the required statutory period.\n\nIn this case, the tenant was already lawfully in possession under the lease. But after the widow's death and the lease expiration, his possession could be considered adverse if he continued to occupy the property without permission from the new owner.\n\nBut when did his possession become adverse?\n\nLet's think about it.\n\nWhen the widow died, the ownership of the cottage passed to the Boy Scouts of America as part of her estate, since she left her entire estate to them.\n\nThe tenant, knowing the widow had died, decided to stay on the property without paying rent. This suggests that he was aware that the ownership situation had changed, and he was taking possession without the owner's consent.\n\nSo, his possession from that point onward could be considered hostile, which is a requirement for adverse possession.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the adverse possession period started when the tenant discontinued paying rent and decided to stay without permission, which was around one month after the widow's death in 1986.\n\nBut let's consider the lease expiration in 1992. After the lease expired, if the tenant remained on the property without a new lease or permission, that would also be considered holdover tenancy or tenancy at sufferance, which could turn into adverse possession if all the elements are met for the statutory period.\n\nHowever, in this case, the tenant stopped paying rent shortly after the widow's death in 1986, and the lease expired in 1992.\n\nSo, from 1986 to 1992, he was occupying the property without paying rent, knowing that the widow had died, and without permission from the new owner, who was unaware of the situation.\n\nAfter the lease expired in 1992, his possession could be considered adverse possession if all the elements are met.\n\nBut the question is, when did the statutory period begin to run?\n\nOption A says when the widow died, which was in 1986.\n\nOption B says when the tenant discontinued paying rent, which was around one month after the widow's death, so also in 1986.\n\nOption C says when the tenant's lease expired, which was in 1992.\n\nOption D says when the tenant subjectively believed he no longer had permission to possess the cottage, which was when the widow died and he decided to stay without paying rent.\n\nIn adverse possession cases, the period typically begins to run when the possession becomes adverse, meaning without the owner's permission and with the intent to claim the property as one's own.\n\nIn this scenario, the tenant's possession became adverse when he chose to stay on the property without paying rent, knowing that the widow had died and without obtaining permission from the new owner.\n\nTherefore, the statutory period likely began around the time he stopped paying rent, which was one month after the widow's death in 1986.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider that adverse possession requires not just the passage of time but also that the possession meets certain criteria, such as being open, notorious, exclusive, continuous, and hostile.\n\nIn this case, the tenant was openly living in the cottage, not hiding his possession, and he was exclusive in his use of the property.\n\nThe possession was continuous from the time the widow died until at least 2009 when the Boy Scouts became aware of the cottage.\n\nThe hostility element is present because he was occupying the property without the owner's permission.\n\nTherefore, the adverse possession period started when the tenant's possession became adverse, which was when he stopped paying rent and decided to stay without permission, around one month after the widow's death in 1986.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer: the tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when the tenant discontinued paying rent.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the period started when the widow died (option A), that might not be accurate because at that point, the tenant was still lawfully in possession under the lease.\n\nHowever, some jurisdictions might consider the possession adverse from the time of the owner's death if the possessor knows of the death and continues to possess without permission.\n\nOn the other hand, discontinuing rent payments is a clear indication that the tenant is no longer acknowledging the widow's (or the estate's) interest in the property.\n\nTherefore, option B seems more precise.\n\nOption C, the lease expiration in 1992, might be when a new phase of adverse possession begins, but the tenant's adverse possession could have started earlier when he stopped paying rent and continued to occupy the property without permission.\n\nOption D is subjective and depends on the tenant's belief, which might not be relevant in determining the start of the adverse possession period, as adverse possession is based on objective facts of possession.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is likely option B: the tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when the tenant discontinued paying rent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
