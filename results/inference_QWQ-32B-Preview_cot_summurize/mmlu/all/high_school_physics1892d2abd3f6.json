                    "text": "So I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about the forces and accelerations involved when two people of different masses push each other on a frictionless surface. Let's see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, there are two people on an ice-covered pond, which is essentially frictionless. One person is 100 kg, and the other is 50 kg. The heavier person pushes on the lighter one with a force F. I need to understand what happens next.\n\nI remember Newton's third law, which says that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So, if the heavier person pushes the lighter one with a force F, the lighter person should push back on the heavier one with a force of -F, right? The negative sign indicates the opposite direction.\n\nSo, option A says that the force felt by the heavier person is (-1/2)F. Wait, but according to Newton's third law, it should be -F, not (-1/2)F. So, that doesn't make sense to me. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nOption B says the force felt by the person is -2F. Again, that doesn't align with Newton's third law, which suggests it should be -F.\n\nOption C says that the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person. Hmm.\n\nOption D says that the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person.\n\nI think I need to recall Newton's second law, which is F = ma. So, force equals mass times acceleration.\n\nLet me apply that here.\n\nFor the lighter person (50 kg), the force acting on them is F, so their acceleration should be a = F / m = F / 50 kg.\n\nFor the heavier person (100 kg), the force acting on them is -F (according to Newton's third law), so their acceleration should be a = -F / 100 kg.\n\nNow, the magnitudes of the accelerations:\n\nLighter person: |a| = F / 50\n\nHeavier person: |a| = F / 100\n\nSo, the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person is twice that of the heavier person because  F / 50  is twice  F / 100.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check.\n\nLet's say F is 100 N.\n\nLighter person: a = 100 N / 50 kg = 2 m/s\u00b2\n\nHeavier person: a = -100 N / 100 kg = -1 m/s\u00b2\n\nSo, the magnitude of the lighter person's acceleration is 2 m/s\u00b2, and the heavier person's is 1 m/s\u00b2. Indeed, the lighter person accelerates twice as much as the heavier person.\n\nSo, option D seems correct: the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: force felt by the heavier person is (-1/2)F.\n\nAccording to Newton's third law, it should be -F, not (-1/2)F. So, this is incorrect.\n\nOption B: force felt by the person is -2F.\n\nAgain, Newton's third law says it should be -F, so this is also incorrect.\n\nOption C: the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person.\n\nBut we just calculated that it's actually twice as much, so this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D.\n\nI think I've got it. The key here is to remember Newton's third law for the forces and Newton's second law to relate force, mass, and acceleration. The lighter person, having half the mass of the heavier person, will experience twice the acceleration when the same force is applied to both.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
