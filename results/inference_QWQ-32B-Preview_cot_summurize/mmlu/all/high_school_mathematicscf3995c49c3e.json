However, this is not always true. A classic counterexample is the absolute value function \\( f(x) = |x| \\) at \\( x = 0 \\). This function is continuous at \\( x = 0 \\), but it is not differentiable there because the left-hand and right-hand derivatives are not equal. Therefore, statement A is false.\n\n**Statement B: If \\( f'(c) = 0 \\), then \\( f \\) has a local maximum or minimum at \\( (c, f(c)) \\).**\n\nThis statement refers to critical points where the derivative is zero. While it's true that local maxima and minima occur at critical points (where the derivative is zero or undefined), having a derivative of zero does not necessarily mean that there is a local maximum or minimum. For example, consider \\( f(x) = x^3 \\) at \\( x = 0 \\). Here, \\( f'(0) = 0 \\), but there is no local maximum or minimum at \\( x = 0 \\); it's an inflection point. Therefore, statement B is false.\n\n**Statement C: If \\( f''(c) = 0 \\), then the graph of \\( f \\) has an inflection point at \\( (c, f(c)) \\).**\n\nThis statement relates to inflection points, where the concavity of the function changes. While it's true that at an inflection point, the second derivative is often zero, having \\( f''(c) = 0 \\) does not necessarily imply an inflection point. For instance, in \\( f(x) = x^4 \\) at \\( x = 0 \\), \\( f''(0) = 0 \\), but there is no inflection point because the concavity does not change; it remains concave up. Therefore, statement C is false.\n\n**Statement D: If \\( f \\) is differentiable at \\( x = c \\), then \\( f \\) is continuous at \\( x = c \\).**\n\nThis statement is about the relationship between differentiability and continuity. It is a fundamental theorem in calculus that if a function is differentiable at a point, then it must also be continuous at that point. This is because the existence of a derivative at a point requires the limit defining the derivative to exist, which in turn requires the function to be continuous at that point. Therefore, statement D is true.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the correct statement is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
