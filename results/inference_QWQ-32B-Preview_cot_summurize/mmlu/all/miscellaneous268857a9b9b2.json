                    "text": "In a regular Major League Baseball (MLB) game, there are nine innings. So, the correct answer is C. nine.\n\nTo provide more context, each inning in a baseball game is divided into two halves: the top half and the bottom half. In the top half, the visiting team bats while the home team plays defense, and in the bottom half, the home team bats while the visiting team defends. If the score is tied after nine innings, the game proceeds to extra innings until one team emerges as the winner.\n\nIt's worth noting that in some leagues or situations, the number of innings may vary. For example, high school baseball games typically consist of seven innings, and some minor league games or youth leagues may have different inning structures. However, in the context of MLB, nine innings is standard for a regulation game.\n\nAdditionally, due to the nature of the game, some contests might be shortened if the home team is leading after completing its half of the fifth inning or any subsequent inning. This rule applies if the game is called due to weather or other interruptions, but in a complete game, nine innings are played.\n\nIn summary, for a regular MLB game, the standard number of innings is nine, making option C the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
