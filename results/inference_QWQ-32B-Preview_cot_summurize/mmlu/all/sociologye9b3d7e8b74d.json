The 'third age' of the life course is said to involve... hmm, I remember that the life course is often divided into different stages, and each stage has its own characteristics. So, the third age must be one of those stages.\n\nOption A says \"active non-work and independence after retirement.\" That sounds plausible. After people retire, they might have more time for activities they enjoy and maintain their independence. But I'm not entirely sure if that's exactly what the third age is.\n\nOption B says \"full-time employment, family-building, and adult responsibility.\" That seems more like the middle age or adulthood, when people are typically working and raising a family. So, maybe that's the second age.\n\nOption C says \"illness, isolation, and increasing dependence on others.\" That sounds more like old age, perhaps the fourth age, when people might face health issues and need more care.\n\nOption D is \"the transition from education to work, and distinctive youth cultures.\" That seems like adolescence or young adulthood, maybe the first age.\n\nI think the third age is about retirement and what people do after they stop working full-time. So, perhaps it's A, active non-work and independence after retirement.\n\nBut let me think again. I've heard that the third age is a time when people can pursue hobbies, travel, and generally enjoy their free time without the responsibilities of work. It's a stage where they have more control over their time and can choose how to spend it.\n\nOn the other hand, option C sounds more negative, focusing on illness and dependence, which might be more accurate for very old age.\n\nOption D seems too early, more like the beginning of the life course.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is A: active non-work and independence after retirement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
