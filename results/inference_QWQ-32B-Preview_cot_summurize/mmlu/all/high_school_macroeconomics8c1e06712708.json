                    "text": "So I've got this question about the Federal Reserve and how its actions affect the money supply. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, the reserve requirement is five percent. That means banks have to hold five percent of their deposits as reserves and can lend out the other 95 percent. Got it.\n\nNow, the Fed is selling $10 million worth of government securities in an open market operation. I know that when the Fed sells securities, it's taking money out of the banking system because people are paying for those securities with their bank deposits. So, essentially, the banks' reserves decrease by $10 million.\n\nI need to figure out how this affects the money supply. I think there's a money multiplier involved here, which tells us how much the money supply can change based on changes in reserves.\n\nThe formula for the money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve requirement. So, with a five percent reserve requirement, the money multiplier should be 1 / 0.05 = 20.\n\nWait, but is that right? I think I might be confusing it with something else. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, the money multiplier is indeed 1 / reserve requirement. So, 1 / 0.05 = 20. That means that for every dollar decrease in reserves, the money supply can potentially decrease by 20 dollars.\n\nSo, if the Fed sells $10 million worth of securities, reserves decrease by $10 million, and the money supply can potentially decrease by 20 times that, which is $200 million.\n\nBut let me make sure I understand why. When the Fed sells $10 million in securities, it reduces the reserves of the banks by $10 million. Banks then have less to lend out. With a five percent reserve requirement, for every $1 decrease in reserves, banks can't make as many loans, which in turn reduces the money supply.\n\nWait, actually, the money multiplier tells us that the total change in the money supply is the change in reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. So, change in money supply = change in reserves * money multiplier.\n\nIn this case, change in reserves is -$10 million (since reserves are decreasing), and the money multiplier is 20. So, change in money supply = -10 million * 20 = -200 million.\n\nThat means the money supply can potentially decrease by $200 million.\n\nBut I should consider if there are any other factors at play here. Is there something I'm missing about open market operations or the reserve requirements?\n\nI think the key points are:\n\n1. Fed sells $10 million in securities \u2192 reserves decrease by $10 million.\n\n2. Reserve requirement is 5% \u2192 money multiplier is 20.\n\n3. Change in money supply = change in reserves * money multiplier = -10 million * 20 = -200 million.\n\nSo, the money supply can potentially decrease by $200 million.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. increase by $200 million.\n\nB. decrease by $200 million.\n\nC. increase by $50 million.\n\nD. decrease by $50 million.\n\nIt looks like option B is the correct one.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any reason why it might not be B.\n\nMaybe if the Fed sells securities, but banks choose to hold excess reserves, the decrease might not be as much. But the question says \"potentially,\" so it's asking for the maximum possible decrease, assuming banks lend out as much as they can.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula I should be using.\n\nLet me recall: the money multiplier is 1 / reserve requirement, which is correct. And the change in money supply is change in reserves times the money multiplier.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the formula is expressed as change in money supply = change in reserves / reserve requirement. But that would be -10 million / 0.05 = -200 million, which is the same answer.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider what would happen if the Fed buys securities instead of selling them. If the Fed buys securities, it injects reserves into the banking system, which would potentially increase the money supply by the same multiplier effect.\n\nSo, selling securities should have the opposite effect, decreasing the money supply.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. decrease by $200 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
