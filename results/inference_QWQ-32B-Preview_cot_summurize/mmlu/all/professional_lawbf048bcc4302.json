                    "text": "Let's dive into this Establishment Clause conundrum. So, the Establishment Clause is part of the First Amendment, and it's all about keeping the government from getting too cozy with any particular religion. The three-pronged test you're referring to is the Lemon test, named after the case Lemon v. Kurtzman in 1971. This test is used to determine whether a law or government action violates the Establishment Clause.\n\nThe three prongs of the Lemon test are:\n\n1. **Secular Purpose**: The law must have been enacted with a secular (non-religious) purpose.\n\n2. **Primary Effect**: The law must neither advance nor inhibit religion.\n\n3. **Excessive Entanglement**: The law must not result in excessive government entanglement with religion.\n\nSo, the question is asking which of the options won't help a statute or action avoid establishment of religion suspicions. Let's look at each option:\n\n**A. It must have a nonspiritual legislative purpose.**\n\nThis aligns with the first prong of the Lemon test, which requires a secular purpose. So, having a nonspiritual, or secular, purpose is indeed helpful in avoiding establishment suspicions.\n\n**B. The statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.**\n\nThis directly corresponds to the third prong of the Lemon test. Preventing excessive entanglement is crucial to avoid establishment issues.\n\n**C. The statute must prohibit purely secular considerations.**\n\nHmm, this one seems off. If a statute prohibits purely secular considerations, that would likely mean it's favoring religious considerations, which would probably violate the secular purpose prong. So, this wouldn't help avoid establishment suspicions; in fact, it would likely raise red flags.\n\n**D. The statute must have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion.**\n\nThis is the second prong of the Lemon test. Ensuring that the statute doesn't advance or inhibit religion is essential to pass the Establishment Clause test.\n\nGiven that, option C is the one that wouldn't help and would probably make the statute more susceptible to establishment clause challenges. Prohibiting purely secular considerations suggests that the law is biased towards religious interests, which is the opposite of what the Establishment Clause requires.\n\nSo, the answer is C. The statute must prohibit purely secular considerations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
