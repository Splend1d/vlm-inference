We need to find which of the given options follows the same rule.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the skip-counting rule is for the given pattern. Let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- 20 - 5 = 15\n\n- 35 - 20 = 15\n\n- 50 - 35 = 15\n\n- 65 - 50 = 15\n\nSo, the pattern is increasing by 15 each time. That means the skip-counting rule is to add 15 to the previous number to get the next number.\n\nNow, I need to check each option to see which one also follows the same rule of adding 15 each time.\n\nOption A: 5, 20, 25, 30, 35...\n\nLet's check the differences:\n\n- 20 - 5 = 15\n\n- 25 - 20 = 5\n\n- 30 - 25 = 5\n\n- 35 - 30 = 5\n\nThis pattern doesn't consistently add 15. After the first step, it starts adding 5. So, this is not the same rule.\n\nOption B: 13, 18, 23, 28, 33...\n\nDifferences:\n\n- 18 - 13 = 5\n\n- 23 - 18 = 5\n\n- 28 - 23 = 5\n\n- 33 - 28 = 5\n\nThis pattern adds 5 each time, not 15. So, it's not the same rule.\n\nOption C: 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...\n\nDifferences:\n\n- 27 - 12 = 15\n\n- 42 - 27 = 15\n\n- 57 - 42 = 15\n\n- 72 - 57 = 15\n\nThis pattern consistently adds 15 each time, just like the original pattern. So, this seems to follow the same skip-counting rule.\n\nOption D: 15, 30, 40, 55, 65...\n\nDifferences:\n\n- 30 - 15 = 15\n\n- 40 - 30 = 10\n\n- 55 - 40 = 15\n\n- 65 - 55 = 10\n\nThis pattern alternates between adding 15 and adding 10, which is not the same as consistently adding 15.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Option C, as it follows the same skip-counting rule of adding 15 each time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
