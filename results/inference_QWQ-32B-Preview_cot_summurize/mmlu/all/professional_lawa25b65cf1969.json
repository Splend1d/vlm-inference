                    "text": "So I've got this question about a new federal statute that's supposed to stabilize rents across the United States. It applies to all future lease agreements for both residential and commercial properties. The goal is to protect tenants from really high rents and what they call \"profiteering\" by landlords, but without hurting the supply of rental properties or taking away landlords' constitutional rights.\n\nNow, the question is asking where this statute would be most clearly constitutional. It gives four options:\n\nA. Renting a state-owned office building by the state to a private business.\n\nB. Renting residential property in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.\n\nC. Renting an apartment by a real estate company to an individual tenant.\n\nD. Renting an office building to a city by an individual landlord.\n\nI need to figure out in which of these scenarios the federal statute is most clearly constitutional.\n\nFirst, I should remember that the Constitution gives certain powers to the federal government and reserves others to the states. One of the federal government's powers is to regulate interstate commerce, which is pretty broad. But sometimes, especially with property and rental laws, states have traditionally had a lot of control.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Renting a state-owned office building by the state to a private business.\n\nThis seems like a transaction between a state and a private business. I know that the Tenth Amendment reserves powers to the states that aren't delegated to the federal government. So, maybe the federal government doesn't have as much authority here because it's a state acting as a landlord.\n\nOption B: Renting residential property in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.\n\nThe District of Columbia is a special case because it's directly under federal jurisdiction. The federal government has plenary power there, meaning it can make any laws it wants for D.C., subject to the Constitution. So, applying a federal statute here might be very straightforward.\n\nOption C: Renting an apartment by a real estate company to an individual tenant.\n\nThis seems like a regular rental agreement in the private sector. The federal government can regulate this if it affects interstate commerce. Rental properties might involve activities that cross state lines, like the construction materials or management companies, but it's not immediately clear.\n\nOption D: Renting an office building to a city by an individual landlord.\n\nHere, it's a city renting from an individual landlord. It's similar to option A, where it's a government entity being one of the parties to the lease.\n\nConsidering the federal government's power, I think option B is the clearest because D.C. is directly under federal control. The federal government can enact laws there without worrying as much about state authority.\n\nAlso, the statute is designed to make rent stabilization effective throughout the U.S., and D.C. is part of the U.S., of course. So, applying it there aligns with the statute's purpose.\n\nOption A might be more complicated because it involves a state acting in its sovereign capacity, and there are principles like sovereign immunity and the Tenth Amendment that could come into play.\n\nOption C is a private transaction, and while the federal government can regulate it under the Commerce Clause, there might be more room for challenge compared to D.C., where the federal government has direct authority.\n\nOption D is similar to A, with a city government being involved, which might raise issues of municipal authority and state control.\n\nTherefore, I think option B is the most clearly constitutional application of the federal statute.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should consider if there are any specific constitutional provisions that make the federal statute applicable in D.C.\n\nI know that Congress has authority over D.C. through Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to \"exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever\" over the seat of government. So, yeah, that would include the power to enact rental regulations.\n\nIn contrast, for the states, the federal government would need to rely on other powers, like the Commerce Clause, and there might be more constraints.\n\nSo, I feel pretty confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
