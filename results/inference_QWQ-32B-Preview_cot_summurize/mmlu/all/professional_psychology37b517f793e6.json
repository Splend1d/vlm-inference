                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand House's Path-Goal Theory of Leadership, and it says that subordinate satisfaction and motivation are maximized when they believe the leader is helping them. That makes sense. There are different leadership styles in this theory, right? Like Directive, Supportive, Participative, and Achievement-Oriented. The question is about the Instrumental leadership style, but I think it might be a typo or something because I'm more familiar with the terms Directive and Achievement-Oriented.\n\nLet me see. The options are:\n\nA. Establishes supportive relationships with subordinates\n\nB. Includes subordinates in decision-making\n\nC. Provides specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures\n\nD. Sets challenging goals and encourages higher levels of performance\n\nHmm, option A sounds like the Supportive leadership style, where the leader is friendly and shows concern for the subordinates' well-being. Option B sounds like the Participative leadership style, where the leader involves subordinates in the decision-making process. Option C sounds like the Directive leadership style, where the leader provides clear instructions and guidelines. And option D sounds like the Achievement-Oriented leadership style, where the leader sets high standards and challenges the subordinates.\n\nBut the question mentions \"Instrumental leadership style.\" I'm not sure if that's another term for one of these styles or if it's something different. Maybe it's similar to Directive, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me look it up quickly. Okay, according to House's Path-Goal Theory, the leader's role is to assist followers in achieving their goals and to provide the necessary support and direction to ensure that their personal goals are compatible with the group or organizational objectives.\n\nThe four main leadership styles in this theory are:\n\n1. Directive: Providing guidance, structure, and clarity about what needs to be done.\n\n2. Supportive: Showing concern for subordinates' well-being and creating a positive work environment.\n\n3. Participative: Involving subordinates in decision-making and considering their opinions and suggestions.\n\n4. Achievement-Oriented: Setting challenging goals and encouraging subordinates to perform at their best.\n\nNow, \"instrumental\" isn't one of these terms, but it might be related to the Directive style, as instrumental actions are often about providing the means or tools to achieve a goal.\n\nIn management, \"instrumental\" leadership could refer to focusing on the tasks and the tools needed to accomplish them, which aligns with providing specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I would say that the Instrumental leadership style is most similar to option C: provides specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm a bit unsure because the term \"instrumental\" isn't standard in this theory. Maybe it's a way to test if I can infer based on the description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"instrumental\" refers to achieving goals through means or instruments, which could relate to setting challenging goals and encouraging higher performance, which is option D.\n\nWait, but option D sounds more like the Achievement-Oriented style.\n\nMaybe I should consider the context of the question. It says, \"subordinate satisfaction and motivation are maximized when they believe the leader is helping.\" So, the leader's behavior should be perceived as supportive and enabling.\n\nOption A, establishing supportive relationships, seems directly related to the Supportive leadership style, which focuses on creating a positive work environment and showing concern for subordinates' well-being.\n\nOption B, including subordinates in decision-making, is characteristic of the Participative leadership style, which can increase motivation by giving subordinates a sense of ownership and control.\n\nOption C, providing specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures, is the Directive style, which can help subordinates who need structure and clarity.\n\nOption D, setting challenging goals and encouraging higher levels of performance, is the Achievement-Oriented style, which can motivate subordinates who are driven by challenge and excellence.\n\nIf \"instrumental\" means providing the means or tools to achieve goals, then it might align with the Directive style, which provides the necessary structure and guidelines.\n\nAlternatively, setting challenging goals could also be seen as instrumental in achieving higher performance, but that seems more aligned with the Achievement-Oriented style.\n\nPerhaps the key is in the term \"instrumental.\" In psychology and leadership, instrumental behavior is often about achieving goals through specific actions or means.\n\nGiven that, option C seems more directly related to providing the specific guidelines and procedures that subordinates need to achieve their tasks, which is instrumental in the sense that it provides the tools or framework for success.\n\nOn the other hand, option D sets challenging goals, which can be instrumental in driving performance, but it's more about setting the goals rather than providing the means to achieve them.\n\nSo, I think option C is the best fit for an Instrumental leadership style, assuming that it's similar to the Directive style in Path-Goal Theory.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider that \"instrumental\" could refer to the leader's ability to get things done efficiently, which might involve both providing clear guidelines and setting challenging goals.\n\nHowever, since I have to choose one option, and option C directly relates to providing specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures, which aligns with the Directive style and the concept of instrumental actions, I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
