                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a 14-year-old girl who's been experiencing some pretty significant changes in her behavior after her parents separated. Her mom brought her to the doctor because she found out the girl started having sex with multiple partners without using protection, which is obviously a big concern. Before all this, she was doing great in school, sports, and leadership stuff. But since her parents split up, she's become sullen, defiant, and rebellious. She's also started smoking, breaking curfew, and skipping school.\n\nThe question is asking about which defense mechanism this patient is most likely using. The options are:\n\nA. Acting out\n\nB. Displacement\n\nC. Projection\n\nD. Reaction formation\n\nOkay, first, I need to remember what each of these defense mechanisms means.\n\nActing out is when someone expresses their inner feelings or conflicts through actions rather than words. It's like they can't handle their emotions, so they act them out instead of talking about them.\n\nDisplacement is when someone redirects their feelings from the original source to someone or something else, usually something safer. For example, getting angry at your boss but taking it out on your spouse instead.\n\nProjection is when you attribute your own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else. Like, if you're feeling jealous, you might think that everyone else is jealous of you.\n\nReaction formation is when you behave in a way that's completely opposite to how you really feel. For example, if you're attracted to someone but find it unacceptable, you might act overly hostile towards them instead.\n\nNow, looking back at the scenario, the girl's behavior has changed a lot after her parents' separation. She's engaging in risky behaviors like unprotected sex, smoking, breaking rules, and skipping school. These are all actions that seem to be expressing underlying emotional distress.\n\nLet's consider acting out. She's expressing her emotions through her actions rather than talking about them. Maybe she doesn't know how to deal with her parents' separation, the stress at home, and all that, so she's acting out by engaging in these risky behaviors.\n\nDisplacement could be a possibility if she's taking her feelings about her parents' separation and directing them towards something else. But it's not entirely clear what she's displacing her feelings onto.\n\nProjection seems less likely because there's no indication that she's attributing her own feelings to others.\n\nReaction formation might be a stretch here. Maybe if she feels insecure about her parents' separation, she's overcompensating by acting rebellious and independent. But acting out seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, acting out appears to be the most fitting defense mechanism in this scenario. She's acting out her emotional turmoil through risky behaviors and defiance.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it another way. Could displacement be a possibility? Maybe she's angry at her parents for separating, but instead of confronting them, she's taking it out on herself or on other areas of her life, like school and social behavior. That could be a form of displacement.\n\nHowever, acting out seems more directly applicable here because she's expressing her inner conflicts through her actions.\n\nProjection doesn't seem to fit because there's no evidence that she's attributing her own feelings or thoughts to others.\n\nReaction formation might be a bit of a reach, but perhaps she feels a loss of control in her family life, so she's overcompensating by asserting control in other areas, like defying rules and engaging in risky behaviors. But again, acting out seems more straightforward.\n\nTherefore, I think the most likely defense mechanism she's using is acting out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
