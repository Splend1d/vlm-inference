                    "text": "Let's dive into this. So, Lyotard says, \"I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives.\" Okay, first things first, what's a meta-narrative? Meta-narratives are like big stories that try to explain everything, you know, the grand schemes that promise to make sense of the world. Think about ideas like progress, enlightenment, or even religious doctrines that claim to have all the answers.\n\nNow, incredulity means skepticism or disbelief. So, postmodernism, according to Lyotard, is being skeptical of these big, all-encompassing stories. It's questioning whether these meta-narratives really have all the answers or if they're just tools for certain groups to maintain power.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Individual stories are suspect.\n\nWell, this is interesting. Postmodernism does question the idea of a single, objective truth, and it often favors multiple, diverse narratives. But saying that individual stories are suspect might not fully capture Lyotard's point. He's more focused on the disbelief in overarching meta-narratives rather than doubt in personal or individual stories.\n\nB. The law is static.\n\nHmmm, this seems a bit off track. Lyotard's statement is about meta-narratives and skepticism towards them. The law being static isn't directly related to that, unless perhaps in the sense that meta-narratives might propose a static view of law, but that's a stretch.\n\nC. Universal values are meaningless.\n\nThis is closer, I think. Meta-narratives often promote universal values, like equality, justice, or freedom, as universal truths. If you're skeptical of meta-narratives, as postmodernism is, then you might question whether these universal values are truly universal or if they're culturally specific and imposed by certain groups. So, it's not that universal values are meaningless, but that their universal applicability is questionable.\n\nD. Literature reproduces repression.\n\nThis sounds like a Freudian or Marxist idea, where literature might be seen as reinforcing societal norms and oppressions. While postmodernism does critique how narratives can be used to maintain power structures, Lyotard's specific definition is more about disbelief in meta-narratives rather than literature reproducing repression.\n\nSo, none of these options perfectly capture Lyotard's definition, but C comes closest. Postmodernism's skepticism towards meta-narratives does lead to questioning the universality of certain values that these meta-narratives promote.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Perhaps the question is testing whether you understand that postmodernism is about doubting big, overarching stories, and none of these options directly say that. Option A talks about individual stories being suspect, which is different because postmodernism often embraces multiple individual stories rather than doubting them.\n\nOption C mentions universal values being meaningless, which could be a consequence of doubting meta-narratives that promote these values, but it's not exactly the same as defining postmodernism as skepticism towards meta-narratives.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to see if you can connect Lyotard's idea to these specific statements. If that's the case, then C seems the most aligned because doubting meta-narratives would likely lead to questioning the universality of values promoted by those narratives.\n\nHowever, I feel like there might be a better way to interpret this. Let me check Lyotard's actual words to make sure I'm on the right track.\n\nLyotard says, \"Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives.\" So, he's saying that postmodernism is characterized by a lack of belief in meta-narratives.\n\nMeta-narratives are those big stories that provide a comprehensive explanation of the world and guide society toward a perfect state. Examples include the narratives of progress, enlightenment, and Marxism.\n\nPostmodernism, according to Lyotard, is skeptical of these stories, suggesting that they're not reliable guides and may even be oppressive by imposing a single vision of truth and justice.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Individual stories are suspect.\n\nThis seems to contradict postmodern thought, which often values local, particular narratives over universal ones.\n\nB. The law is static.\n\nThis doesn't directly relate to meta-narratives or skepticism towards them.\n\nC. Universal values are meaningless.\n\nThis could be a consequence of rejecting meta-narratives that promote universal values, but it's not the same as defining postmodernism as skepticism towards meta-narratives.\n\nD. Literature reproduces repression.\n\nThis seems more related to how narratives can be used to maintain power, which is a postmodern concern, but it's not directly about meta-narratives.\n\nPerhaps the question is poorly worded, or I'm missing something fundamental.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the correct answer is none of the above, but since that's not an option, I have to choose the closest one. In that case, C seems the most appropriate because it relates to the idea of questioning universal truths, which are often propagated by meta-narratives.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed to test whether you understand that postmodernism is about doubting grand narratives, and therefore, the closest statement is that universal values are meaningless, because universal values are often tied to those grand narratives.\n\nBut, to be honest, I'm not entirely satisfied with any of the options. They seem to misrepresent or only partially capture Lyotard's definition.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to select C, as it's the closest approximation, even if it's not perfect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
