                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out the difference between conciliation and mediation. There are four options here, and I have to choose the correct one.\n\nOption A says that conciliation is like mediation but produces a binding result, while mediation doesn't. Hmm, I think mediation is usually non-binding. The mediator helps the parties reach an agreement, but it's up to them to accept it or not. Conciliation might be similar, but I'm not sure if it's always binding. Maybe in some cases it is?\n\nOption B mentions that conciliation is conducted only by representatives of the UN Secretary-General, while mediation can be done by officials from third states. I don't recall any specific rule that limits conciliation to UN representatives. Mediation can be conducted by anyone, really\u2014private individuals, diplomats, international organizations. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption C says that mediation is usually conducted by a person appointed with the consent of the parties, while conciliation involves a commission that examines the dispute impartially and proposes settlement terms. This sounds familiar. Mediation typically involves a single neutral person who assists the parties in reaching a voluntary agreement. Conciliation might involve a group, like a commission, that looks into the dispute and makes proposals for settlement. That makes sense.\n\nOption D states that conciliation is a method of dispute settlement pursued only by virtue of a treaty, while mediation can also be on an ad hoc basis. I think mediation can be agreed upon by the parties at any time, even without a prior treaty. Conciliation might also be provided for in treaties, but I don't think it's exclusively tied to treaties. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nComparing these options, Option C seems the most accurate. It distinguishes between mediation, which is usually done by a single person with the parties' consent, and conciliation, which involves a commission that examines the dispute and proposes terms for settlement. That aligns with my understanding of these processes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
