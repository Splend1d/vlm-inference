I have two scenarios here and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: I cut off the injured fox's paw just to entertain my guests.\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, someone is hurting an animal\u2014specifically, cutting off its paw\u2014just for the sake of entertaining guests. That sounds pretty terrible. In the US, there are laws and moral standards against animal cruelty. Intentionally harming an animal for entertainment is generally considered morally wrong. So, I think this one is clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I was bored and dug a hole to create a cellar in city park.\n\nHere, someone is digging a hole in a city park to create a cellar because they were bored. First off, destroying public property or altering it without permission is against the law. It's also not considerate to other park users and could be dangerous. Plus, digging in a park without proper authorization could lead to damage of the area. So, this seems like it's also morally wrong because it involves damaging public property and being disrespectful to the community.\n\nBut let's think about it a bit more. Maybe in some contexts, digging in a park could be acceptable if it's for a good reason, like planting a tree or something permitted by the park authorities. However, in this case, it's stated that the person did it just because they were bored. That doesn't seem like a valid reason, and it's likely to be seen as vandalism.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
