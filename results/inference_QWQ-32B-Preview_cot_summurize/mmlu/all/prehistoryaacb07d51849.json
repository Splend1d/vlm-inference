                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the peak population of Teotihuac\u00e1n. The options are 50,000, 200,000, 500,000, or 1,000,000 people. I don't remember the exact number, but I do recall that Teotihuac\u00e1n was a significant city in Mesoamerica during classical times.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what I know about Teotihuac\u00e1n. It's located in what is now Mexico, near Mexico City, and it was an important center of culture, economy, and politics in the pre-Columbian era. The city was established around 100 BCE and fell around 700 CE.\n\nI think the city was one of the largest in the ancient world, and it was even larger than many cities in Europe at that time. So, a population of 200,000 or more seems plausible. But I need to recall the specific estimate.\n\nI remember that there was some debate among archaeologists about the exact population. Some sources suggest that it could have been as high as 200,000, while others propose higher estimates. I think the higher estimates might be around 500,000, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider the size of the city. Teotihuac\u00e1n covered an area of about 20 square kilometers or about 8 square miles. If I think about other ancient cities and their populations, I can try to make a comparison.\n\nFor example, ancient Rome is estimated to have had a population around 1 million at its peak, but that was much later, around 100 CE. However, Teotihuac\u00e1n is said to be one of the largest cities in the ancient Americas, so a population in the hundreds of thousands seems possible.\n\nOn the other hand, some sources might overestimate the population based on the area of the city. But considering the density of housing and the efficiency of ancient cities, maybe the population wasn't as high as 1 million.\n\nI also recall that Teotihuac\u00e1n had a grid layout, with wide avenues and many residential compounds. If each compound housed a certain number of people, perhaps the total population could be estimated based on the number of compounds.\n\nBut without specific numbers, I need to rely on what I've learned before. I think that the most commonly accepted estimate is around 100,000 to 200,000 people. However, some sources might suggest higher numbers.\n\nLooking back at the options, 50,000 seems a bit low, considering the city's importance and size. 1 million seems excessively high, even for a major pre-Columbian city. So, between 200,000 and 500,000, I need to decide which one is more accurate.\n\nI think that 200,000 is more likely. I recall that some archaeological studies have estimated the population to be around 125,000 to 200,000 people. Higher estimates of 500,000 or even more might be outliers or based on less reliable data.\n\nAdditionally, considering the agricultural capabilities and the surrounding environment, supporting a population of over 500,000 might have been challenging. But again, I'm not entirely sure.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the number of pyramids and public buildings in Teotihuac\u00e1n. The Pyramid of the Sun, for example, is one of the largest structures in Mesoamerica. The scale of such constructions might indicate a larger population capable of mobilizing a significant workforce.\n\nHowever, the size of the workforce doesn't necessarily correlate directly with the total population. It could also depend on the labor organization and the duration of construction.\n\nMaybe I should think about the trade and economic activities of Teotihuac\u00e1n. The city was known for its trade networks that extended throughout Mesoamerica, exchanging goods like obsidian, ceramics, and cacao. A larger population would require more resources and could support a more extensive trade network.\n\nBut again, without specific data, it's hard to pinpoint the exact population.\n\nLet me try to recall any specific numbers mentioned in my readings or lectures. I seem to remember that 200,000 was the figure often cited as the peak population. Some sources might go up to 250,000, but I don't think I've seen estimates as high as 500,000 or 1 million in reputable sources.\n\nMoreover, considering that the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, which was much later, had a population estimated around 200,000 to 300,000, it's possible that Teotihuac\u00e1n could have had a similar or slightly higher population.\n\nBut I need to be careful because population estimates can vary greatly depending on the methodology used by archaeologists.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the area of the city again. If Teotihuac\u00e1n covered 20 square kilometers, and assuming a certain density, say 10,000 people per square kilometer, that would give a population of 200,000. Higher densities would lead to higher population estimates.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if that density is accurate for an ancient city. Maybe it was less dense, with more open spaces and smaller dwellings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the density was higher, similar to some ancient cities in the Old World.\n\nGiven all these considerations, I'm leaning towards 200,000 as the most plausible estimate for the peak population of Teotihuac\u00e1n.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should also consider any recent research or consensus among archaeologists.\n\nAfter thinking about it, I don't recall any recent studies that have significantly revised the population estimates upwards beyond 200,000.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option B, 200,000 people, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
