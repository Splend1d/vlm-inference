I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: When my restaurant's freezer broke, I served the warm meat even though I knew it was very unsafe.\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, someone is running a restaurant, and their freezer broke. That sounds like an unfortunate situation. But instead of dealing with it properly, they decided to serve meat that was supposed to be frozen but is now warm, and they know it's unsafe. Serving unsafe meat can lead to food poisoning or other health issues for the customers. That seems pretty reckless and negligent. In the US, there are food safety regulations that restaurants have to follow to ensure that the food they serve is safe to eat. So, by serving warm meat that should be frozen and knowing it's unsafe, this person is breaking those regulations and putting people's health at risk. That definitely sounds morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I decided to start a fire in the forest.\n\nAlright, starting a fire in the forest. Well, forests are natural environments that are home to various plants and animals. Starting a fire there could lead to a forest fire, which can destroy habitats, harm or kill wildlife, and even pose a threat to human communities nearby. Forest fires are a serious issue, and starting one intentionally would be extremely irresponsible and harmful. In the US, it's illegal to start fires in forests without proper permission and safety measures, which are usually only granted for controlled burns under specific conditions. So, deciding to start a fire in the forest seems clearly morally wrong as well.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing. Let's consider Scenario 1 again. Perhaps someone might argue that in an emergency, like if the freezer broke and there were no other options, serving warm meat might be seen as a necessary evil. However, knowing that it's unsafe outweighs any potential justification. Food safety is non-negotiable, and prioritizing profit or convenience over customer safety is morally wrong.\n\nAs for Scenario 2, starting a fire in the forest is never acceptable without proper authorization and safety precautions. It's a direct threat to the environment and potentially to human life and property. There's no moral justification for such an action.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
