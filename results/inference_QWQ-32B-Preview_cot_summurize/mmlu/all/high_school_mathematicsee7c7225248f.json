                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have some relationships between daps, yaps, and baps, and we need to find out how many daps are equal to 42 baps.\n\nFirst, let's write down what we know:\n\n1. 4 daps = 7 yaps\n\n2. 5 yaps = 3 baps\n\nOur goal is to find out how many daps are equal to 42 baps.\n\nTo do this, I think the best approach is to find a common link between daps and baps through yaps. So, we need to relate daps to yaps and yaps to baps, and then combine these relationships to relate daps directly to baps.\n\nLet's start by finding out how many daps are equal to one yap.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n4 daps = 7 yaps\n\nSo, to find out how many daps are in one yap, we can divide both sides by 7:\n\n1 yap = 4 daps / 7\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\n5 yaps = 3 baps\n\nSo, to find out how many yaps are in one bap, we can divide both sides by 3:\n\n1 bap = 5 yaps / 3\n\nBut actually, I think it's better to find out how many yaps are in one bap and then use that to find out how many daps are in one bap.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to find a relationship between daps and baps directly.\n\nLet me see.\n\nWe have:\n\n4 daps = 7 yaps\n\nAnd\n\n5 yaps = 3 baps\n\nI can express yaps in terms of daps from the first equation and then substitute into the second equation to eliminate yaps.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n7 yaps = 4 daps\n\nSo,\n\n1 yap = 4 daps / 7\n\nNow, plug this into the second equation:\n\n5 yaps = 3 baps\n\nSubstitute yaps with daps:\n\n5 * (4 daps / 7) = 3 baps\n\nSimplify:\n\n(20 daps) / 7 = 3 baps\n\nNow, solve for daps in terms of baps:\n\n20 daps / 7 = 3 baps\n\nMultiply both sides by 7:\n\n20 daps = 21 baps\n\nNow, solve for daps:\n\ndaps = (21 baps) / 20\n\nBut wait, this seems off because we want to find out how many daps are in 42 baps, not express daps in terms of baps like this.\n\nMaybe I should instead find out how many daps are equivalent to one bap and then multiply by 42.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n20 daps = 21 baps\n\nThen,\n\n1 bap = 20 daps / 21\n\nTherefore,\n\n42 baps = 42 * (20 daps / 21)\n\nSimplify:\n\n42 * 20 / 21 = (42 / 21) * 20 = 2 * 20 = 40 daps\n\nSo, 42 baps = 40 daps\n\nLooking back at the options, 40 is option C.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ratios or set up proportions.\n\nLet's try using proportions.\n\nFirst, from 4 daps = 7 yaps, the ratio of daps to yaps is 4:7.\n\nSimilarly, from 5 yaps = 3 baps, the ratio of yaps to baps is 5:3.\n\nTo find the ratio of daps to baps, we can combine these two ratios.\n\nTo do that, we need to make the number of yaps the same in both ratios.\n\nSo, the first ratio is daps:yaps = 4:7\n\nThe second ratio is yaps:baps = 5:3\n\nTo combine them, find a common multiple for yaps.\n\nThe least common multiple of 7 and 5 is 35.\n\nSo, adjust the first ratio to have 35 yaps:\n\n4 daps / 7 yaps = x daps / 35 yaps\n\nx = (4 daps * 35 yaps) / 7 yaps = 20 daps\n\nSimilarly, adjust the second ratio to have 35 yaps:\n\n5 yaps / 3 baps = 35 yaps / y baps\n\ny = (3 baps * 35 yaps) / 5 yaps = 21 baps\n\nSo now, the combined ratio is daps:yaps:baps = 20:35:21\n\nTherefore, daps to baps is 20:21\n\nSo, for every 21 baps, there are 20 daps.\n\nTherefore, for 42 baps, which is double 21 baps, the number of daps would be double 20 daps, which is 40 daps.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, we can set up a chain conversion.\n\nFirst, convert baps to yaps, then yaps to daps.\n\nFrom 5 yaps = 3 baps, we can find yaps per bap:\n\n1 bap = 5 yaps / 3\n\nSo, for 42 baps:\n\n42 baps * (5 yaps / 3 baps) = (42 * 5) / 3 yaps = 210 / 3 yaps = 70 yaps\n\nNow, convert yaps to daps.\n\nFrom 4 daps = 7 yaps, we have daps per yap:\n\n1 yap = 4 daps / 7\n\nSo, for 70 yaps:\n\n70 yaps * (4 daps / 7 yaps) = (70 * 4) / 7 daps = 280 / 7 daps = 40 daps\n\nAgain, this confirms that 42 baps = 40 daps.\n\nLet me try one more way to be absolutely sure.\n\nWe can set up the conversion factors and multiply them together.\n\nFirst, the conversion factor from baps to yaps is:\n\n(5 yaps) / (3 baps)\n\nThen, the conversion factor from yaps to daps is:\n\n(4 daps) / (7 yaps)\n\nSo, to convert baps to daps:\n\n(4 daps / 7 yaps) * (5 yaps / 3 baps) = (4 * 5) daps / (7 * 3) baps = 20 daps / 21 baps\n\nSo, 20 daps = 21 baps\n\nTherefore, for 42 baps:\n\n42 baps * (20 daps / 21 baps) = (42 * 20) / 21 daps = 840 / 21 daps = 40 daps\n\nOnce again, this confirms that 42 baps = 40 daps.\n\nI think this is solid. So, the answer should be 40 daps, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
