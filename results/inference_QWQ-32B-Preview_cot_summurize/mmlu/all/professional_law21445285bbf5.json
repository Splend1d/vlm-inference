A man's record showed four prior convictions for nonviolent crimes involving theft or bad checks, each one pertaining to property or cash in excess of $100 but not in excess of $500. On the fifth conviction, after conviction of passing a $100 bad check, the court sentenced him to life without parole under a repeat offender statute. He challenged the sentence and the statute based on the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. Will the Court likely invalidate the sentence on these facts?\n\nA. Yes, because the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, none of which involved bodily injury, and there is no possibility of parole.\nB. Yes, because life imprisonment can never be an appropriate punishment for criminality that does not take human life.\nC. No, because theft and passing bad checks has become a national emergency warranting tough remedial action to protect the economy, institutions and persons being victimized.\nD. No, because it is improper for the courts to attempt to interject their value judgments into a state's ostensibly reasonable legislative sentencing schemes.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about whether the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to invalidate a life sentence without parole for someone who's convicted five times for theft or bad checks, each involving amounts over $100. The guy has four prior convictions for similar nonviolent crimes and now he's got his fifth, which is for passing a $100 bad check. The court sentenced him to life without parole under a repeat offender statute, and he's challenging that based on the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Eighth Amendment means by \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" Generally, it means that the punishment shouldn't be too harsh or severe compared to the crime committed. The Supreme Court has ruled in the past that a punishment can be considered cruel and unusual if it's grossly disproportionate to the crime, especially in cases involving non-homicide offenses.\n\nIn this scenario, the man has been convicted five times for theft or bad checks, none of which involved violence or harm to individuals, and the amounts involved are relatively small, up to $500. Now, he's being sentenced to life without parole, which is a very severe punishment.\n\nOption A says yes, the Court is likely to invalidate the sentence because the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, and there's no possibility of parole. This seems plausible because life without parole is a harsh sentence, and his crimes don't seem to warrant such severity, especially since none involved violence or serious harm.\n\nOption B also says yes, but it's more absolute: life imprisonment can never be an appropriate punishment for criminality that does not take human life. This seems too broad. While it's true that life without parole is very severe, there might be cases where it's appropriate for non-homicide offenses, like maybe serial child abusers or severe drug kingpins. So, perhaps B is too extreme.\n\nOption C says no, because theft and bad checks have become a national emergency, warranting tough action to protect the economy and victims. While it's true that crime is a serious issue, and states have the right to pass laws to protect their citizens, the question is whether this particular punishment is constitutional. Just because there's a perceived emergency doesn't mean that the Constitution can be ignored. So, I don't think this is a strong argument.\n\nOption D says no, because it's improper for courts to interject their value judgments into a state's legislative sentencing schemes. But, actually, that's not entirely accurate. The courts do have a role in ensuring that laws don't violate constitutional protections, including the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. So, courts are supposed to review whether a punishment is disproportionate to the crime.\n\nLooking back at option A, it seems most aligned with Supreme Court precedent. In cases like Solem v. Helm and Ewing v. California, the Court has struck down life sentences without parole for nonviolent crimes, finding them disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nIn Solem v. Helm, the Court invalidated a life sentence without parole for a series of property crimes and writing bad checks, similar to this case. The Court considered three factors: the gravity of the offense, the harshness of the penalty, and the way the penalty compares to penalties in other jurisdictions for the same crime, and for more serious crimes in the same jurisdiction.\n\nIn this case, the offense is a series of nonviolent thefts and bad checks, which are serious but don't involve violence or harm to persons. The penalty is life without parole, which is extremely harsh. Comparing it to other jurisdictions, many states don't impose life without parole for such offenses, and even within the state, more serious crimes might have less severe penalties.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems likely that the Supreme Court would find the sentence cruel and unusual, and invalidate it.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A: Yes, because the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, none of which involved bodily injury, and there is no possibility of parole.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
