                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\nSource 1:\n\"You may well ask: \"Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?\" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.\nAs we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.\"\nGay Liberation Front, Manifesto, 1971\nThe author of Source 1 endorses which of the following tactics as a means of achieving his aims?\n\nA. Violent overthrow of the government\nB. Nonviolent resistance\nC. Appeasement\nD. Legal action\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this question here that refers to three different sources, but the question specifically asks about the author of Source 1 and which tactic they endorse for achieving their goals. Source 1 is a excerpt from Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\" from 1966. I remember studying this in school, but it was a while ago, so I need to refresh my memory.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Martin Luther King Jr. is saying in this letter. From what I recall, he was writing this letter while he was in jail for protesting against segregation. So, the context is the Civil Rights Movement in the United States during the 1960s.\n\nLooking back at the excerpt, he's addressing why he's choosing direct action instead of negotiation. He says that direct action is meant to create a crisis and tension that forces the community to confront the issue and negotiate. He compares it to Socrates creating tension in the mind to lead to growth and understanding.\n\nSo, the key point here is that he endorses creating tension through nonviolent direct action to bring about change. He's not advocating for violent overthrow of the government; in fact, he's opposed to violent tension. He's also not talking about appeasement, which I think means giving in to demands to avoid conflict. And while legal action was part of the Civil Rights Movement, in this specific letter, he's focusing on direct action.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Violent overthrow of the government \u2013 This doesn't match with King's philosophy of nonviolence.\n\nB. Nonviolent resistance \u2013 This aligns perfectly with what he's describing in the letter.\n\nC. Appeasement \u2013 Again, this isn't what he's advocating; he's pushing for confrontation through direct action.\n\nD. Legal action \u2013 While important in the Civil Rights Movement, it's not the focus of this letter.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Nonviolent resistance.\n\nJust to make sure, I should consider if any other options could be possible. For example, maybe he mentions legal action in the letter, but from what I recall, the letter is primarily about why direct action is necessary and how it forces the issue to be addressed.\n\nAlso, I should consider the time period. In 1966, King was indeed focusing on nonviolent protest as a means to achieve civil rights for African Americans.\n\nSo, I think B is the right choice.\n\nNow, just for completeness, I'll glance at the other sources to ensure there's no confusion.\n\nSource 2 is from the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966, stating their purpose to bring women into full participation in American society. They talk about moving beyond discussion to concrete action, which aligns with direct action, but the question is specifically about Source 1.\n\nSource 3 is from the Gay Liberation Front's Manifesto in 1971, discussing the goal of eliminating gender roles and forming an alliance with the women's liberation movement. Again, relevant to understanding the context of social movements in the 1960s and 70s, but not directly related to the question about Source 1.\n\nSo, to reiterate, the author of Source 1 endorses nonviolent resistance as a means of achieving his aims.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
