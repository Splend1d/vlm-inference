Both High Contracting Parties obligate themselves to desist from any act of violence, any aggressive action, and any attack on each other, either individually or jointly with other Powers.\nArticle II. Should one of the High Contracting Parties become the object of belligerent action by a third Power, the other High Contracting Party shall in no manner lend its support to this third Power.\nArticle III. The Governments of the two High Contracting Parties shall in the future maintain continual contact with one another for the purpose of consultation in order to exchange information on problems affecting their common interests.\nArticle IV. Should disputes or conflicts arise between the High Contracting Parties shall participate in any grouping of Powers whatsoever that is directly or indirectly aimed at the other party.\nArticle V.

                    "text": "Let's see what this is about. There's a text from the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, and it mentions a previous Neutrality Agreement from April 1926 between Germany and the USSR. The question is asking what can be inferred about the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union based on this information.\n\nOption A says that they had some degree of a nonaggression agreement since at least 1926. Well, the text mentions a Neutrality Agreement from 1926, and the 1939 pact is building upon that, so it seems like there was a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u52aa\u529b to maintain peace between them since at least 1926. So, A seems plausible.\n\nOption B says they created their first peace agreement in 1926. Well, the 1926 agreement was a Neutrality Agreement, which is a type of peace agreement, so this could be correct. But I need to check if there were any earlier agreements.\n\nOption C says they had technically been in a state of war since 1926, which doesn't make sense because a neutrality agreement is about maintaining peace, not war.\n\nOption D says they previously held a peace agreement that expired in 1926. But the 1926 agreement is mentioned as the basis for the 1939 pact, so it seems like it was still relevant in 1939.\n\nWait, but the 1939 pact is described as strengthening the cause of peace and proceeding from the fundamental provisions of the 1926 Neutrality Agreement. So, it appears that the 1926 agreement was still in place in 1939, and the 1939 pact is building upon it.\n\nSo, option A seems correct because it says they had some degree of a nonaggression agreement since at least 1926, which aligns with the information provided.\n\nOption B says the first peace agreement was in 1926. Maybe there were earlier agreements, but the text only mentions the 1926 agreement, so we can't confirm if it was the first.\n\nOption C is clearly incorrect because a neutrality agreement is about maintaining peace, not war.\n\nOption D says a peace agreement expired in 1926, but the 1939 pact is building upon the 1926 agreement, suggesting it was still in effect.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
