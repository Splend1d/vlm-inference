                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{(x-2)^2 - 9}{3}\\), and we need to find the area of the polygon formed by connecting its x- and y-intercepts.\n\nFirst, I need to find the x-intercepts and y-intercept of the function.\n\n**Finding y-intercept:**\n\nThe y-intercept occurs when \\(x = 0\\). So, plug \\(x = 0\\) into \\(f(x)\\):\n\n\\[f(0) = \\frac{(0-2)^2 - 9}{3} = \\frac{4 - 9}{3} = \\frac{-5}{3}\\]\n\nSo, the y-intercept is at \\(\\left(0, -\\frac{5}{3}\\right)\\).\n\n**Finding x-intercepts:**\n\nThe x-intercepts occur when \\(f(x) = 0\\). So, set \\(f(x) = 0\\) and solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[0 = \\frac{(x-2)^2 - 9}{3}\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n\\[0 = (x-2)^2 - 9\\]\n\nAdd 9 to both sides:\n\n\\[(x-2)^2 = 9\\]\n\nTake square roots:\n\n\\[x - 2 = \\pm3\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = 2 + 3 = 5\\) or \\(x = 2 - 3 = -1\\)\n\nTherefore, the x-intercepts are at \\((5, 0)\\) and \\((-1, 0)\\).\n\nNow, we have three points: \\((0, -\\frac{5}{3})\\), \\((5, 0)\\), and \\((-1, 0)\\). Connecting these points should form a polygon, specifically a triangle.\n\nTo find the area of this triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\nFirst, let's find the base of the triangle. The base can be the distance between the two x-intercepts.\n\nThe distance between \\((5, 0)\\) and \\((-1, 0)\\) is \\(5 - (-1) = 6\\) units.\n\nNow, the height of the triangle is the absolute value of the y-coordinate of the y-intercept, which is \\(\\left| -\\frac{5}{3} \\right| = \\frac{5}{3}\\).\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of the triangle is:\n\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{30}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5\\]\n\nSo, the area of the polygon is 5.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem mentions \"the x- and y-intercepts of the graph are connected to form a polygon.\" In this case, it's a triangle, and the area is 5. But let's check if there are any other intercepts or if there's a mistake in assuming it's only a triangle.\n\nLooking back, the function is a quadratic function, so its graph is a parabola. The x-intercepts are where the parabola crosses the x-axis, and the y-intercept is where it crosses the y-axis. Connecting these three points should indeed form a triangle.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's another way to interpret \"the x- and y-intercepts of the graph are connected to form a polygon.\" Maybe it includes other points or the vertices are connected in a different manner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the area enclosed by the graph and the x-axis, but the problem specifically says \"the x- and y-intercepts are connected to form a polygon,\" which suggests connecting the intercepts directly with line segments.\n\nGiven that, my initial approach should be correct, leading to an area of 5.\n\nBut let's double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, confirming the y-intercept:\n\n\\[f(0) = \\frac{(0-2)^2 - 9}{3} = \\frac{4 - 9}{3} = \\frac{-5}{3}\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNext, confirming the x-intercepts:\n\nSet \\(f(x) = 0\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{(x-2)^2 - 9}{3} = 0 \\implies (x-2)^2 - 9 = 0 \\implies (x-2)^2 = 9 \\implies x-2 = \\pm3 \\implies x = 5 \\text{ or } x = -1\\]\n\nCorrect again.\n\nNow, the base of the triangle is between \\((5, 0)\\) and \\((-1, 0)\\), which is 6 units.\n\nThe height is the distance from the x-axis to the y-intercept, which is \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) units.\n\nArea:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5\\]\n\nSeems solid.\n\nBut why are there other options like \\(\\frac{25}{6}\\), \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2465}}{9}\\), and 2? Maybe there's another interpretation of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the polygon is not a triangle but a quadrilateral or another shape.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the area under the curve between the x-intercepts, but again, the problem says \"the x- and y-intercepts are connected to form a polygon,\" which suggests a polygon formed by straight lines connecting the intercepts.\n\nIn that case, it's definitely a triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are multiple y-intercepts or something, but that doesn't make sense because there's only one y-intercept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function has asymptotes or other features that create a more complex polygon, but this is a quadratic function, which is a parabola, and connecting its intercepts should just form a triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are holes or other discontinuities, but the function is defined everywhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the vertex of the parabola or another point.\n\nLet's consider plotting the function to visualize it.\n\nThe function is \\(f(x) = \\frac{(x-2)^2 - 9}{3}\\), which simplifies to:\n\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{(x-2)^2}{3} - 3\\]\n\nThis is a parabola opening upwards with vertex at \\((2, -3)\\).\n\nThe x-intercepts are at \\(x = 5\\) and \\(x = -1\\), as previously found.\n\nThe y-intercept is at \\((0, -\\frac{5}{3})\\).\n\nConnecting these three points should form a triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the polygon includes the vertex of the parabola, but the problem specifically mentions only the x- and y-intercepts.\n\nTherefore, I think the initial approach is correct, and the area is indeed 5.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another method to calculate the area.\n\nWe can use the shoelace formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices.\n\nFor a triangle with vertices \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), \\((x_3, y_3)\\), the area is:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\\]\n\nPlugging in the points \\((0, -\\frac{5}{3})\\), \\((5, 0)\\), and \\((-1, 0)\\):\n\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left|0(0 - 0) + 5(0 - (-\\frac{5}{3})) + (-1)(-\\frac{5}{3} - 0)\\right|\\]\\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\left|0 + 5(\\frac{5}{3}) + (-1)(-\\frac{5}{3})\\right|\\]\\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\frac{25}{3} + \\frac{5}{3}\\right|\\]\\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\frac{30}{3}\\right|\\]\\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5\\]\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the area of the polygon is 5.\n\nGiven the options, the correct answer is A. 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
