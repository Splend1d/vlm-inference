                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal scenario. So, we've got a company from State A suing a plumber from State B in a federal court in State A. The company says the plumber did a bad job installing pipes, which caused $250,000 in damage to their building. The plumber tries to get out of court by filing a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, but the court says no, you have to stay. After that, the plumber doesn't do anything else; doesn't file an answer or anything. Sixty days later, the company asks the clerk to enter a default, which means since the plumber hasn't responded, they automatically lose. Then, the company asks for a default judgment, which is basically a final decision in their favor. They notify the plumber three days before the hearing about this.\n\nAt the hearing, only the company is there (ex parte), and the court listens to evidence about the damages and decides to grant the full $250,000 judgment. Ten days after that, the plumber suddenly files a motion to set aside the default judgment. Now, the question is, is the court likely to grant this motion?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the court could fix the amount of damages even without hearing the plumber's evidence.\n\nB. No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action.\n\nC. Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\n\nD. Yes, because the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber as a State B citizen.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a default judgment is. It's a judgment entered against a party who hasn't defended themselves properly, like not filing an answer or not showing up to hearings. In this case, the plumber didn't file an answer or any other response after the motion to dismiss was denied.\n\nNow, regarding personal jurisdiction, the court already denied the motion to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction, meaning the court believes it does have jurisdiction over the plumber, despite him being from State B. So, option D seems unlikely to be correct because the court has already established that it has personal jurisdiction.\n\nOption A says no, because the court could fix the amount of damages without hearing the plumber's evidence. Well, in default judgments, courts often consider the plaintiff's evidence without the defendant's input, but that doesn't necessarily mean the default judgment can't be set aside if there are good reasons.\n\nOption B says no, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action. True, the plumber didn't file an answer or appear after the motion to dismiss was denied, but that doesn't preclude the possibility of setting aside the default judgment under certain circumstances.\n\nOption C says yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment. This seems promising. Let's explore this further.\n\nProcedurally, when a party fails to respond to a complaint, the plaintiff can request a default judgment. However, there are rules about how much notice the defaulting party must receive before a default judgment is entered. In federal courts, Rule 55 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs default judgments.\n\nRule 55(b)(2) states that before entering a default judgment, the court must first consider whether the plaintiff's claim is proper for default judgment and whether the amount of damages is certain. It also requires that the defendant be notified of the motion for default judgment.\n\nIn this case, the company notified the plumber three days before the hearing. Is that sufficient notice? In federal courts, Rule 55(b)(2) doesn't specify a exact number of days required for notice, but generally, courts expect that reasonable notice be given to the defaulting party.\n\nThree days might be considered insufficient, especially if the plumber needed time to gather evidence or prepare a response. Given that, option C seems plausible.\n\nMoreover, Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows parties to seek relief from a final judgment for various reasons, including mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. If the plumber can show that the short notice led to them not being able to appear at the hearing, they might have a case for setting aside the default judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, the court did have personal jurisdiction over the plumber, as the motion to dismiss was denied. So, option D isn't likely correct.\n\nAlso, while it's true that in a default judgment, the court can determine damages based on the plaintiff's evidence without the defendant's input, there are limits to this. The court should ensure that the damages are supported by sufficient evidence and that the process was fair.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most compelling reason to set aside the default judgment is the inadequate notice provided to the plumber. Therefore, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nTo sum up, the court is likely to grant the plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
