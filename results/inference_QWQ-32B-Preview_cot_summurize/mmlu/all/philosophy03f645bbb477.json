He's known for his work in emotivism, which is a theory in ethics.\n\nThe question is: According to Stevenson, the word \u201cgood\u201d has a pleasing emotive meaning that fits it for:\n\nA. descriptive use.\n\nB. constructive use.\n\nC. dynamic use.\n\nD. propositional use.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Stevenson said about the word \"good.\" I remember that he thought moral terms like \"good\" have both descriptive and emotive meanings. The descriptive part states a fact, while the emotive part expresses the speaker's attitude or feeling about that fact.\n\nIn this case, the question emphasizes the \"pleasing emotive meaning\" of \"good.\" So, it's focusing on the emotional aspect rather than the factual one.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Descriptive use: This would be using \"good\" to state a fact, like \"This apple is good because it's ripe.\" But the question is about the emotive meaning, which is more about the speaker's approval or disapproval.\n\nB. Constructive use: I'm not sure what this means in this context. Maybe it's about building or constructing something, but that doesn't seem directly related to the emotive meaning of \"good.\"\n\nC. Dynamic use: This might refer to the persuasive or motivational aspect of language. If \"good\" has a pleasing emotive meaning, it could be used to influence others' attitudes or actions.\n\nD. Propositional use: This would involve using \"good\" in a way that makes a proposition or a statement that can be true or false. But again, this seems more related to the descriptive meaning rather than the emotive one.\n\nGiven that, option C, dynamic use, seems the most plausible. The emotive meaning of \"good\" is pleasing, which could be used to persuade or motivate others because it elicits positive feelings.\n\nLet me double-check. Stevenson did discuss the concept of \"persuasive definitions,\" where terms are defined in a way that not only describes but also persuades. So, using \"good\" with a pleasing emotive meaning could be a way to influence others' attitudes dynamically.\n\nOption A, descriptive use, is more about stating facts, which doesn't align with the emotive aspect highlighted in the question.\n\nOption B, constructive use, isn't a term I recall from Stevenson's work, so it might not be the best fit.\n\nOption D, propositional use, is about making statements that can be evaluated as true or false, which again is more descriptive than emotive.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. dynamic use.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
