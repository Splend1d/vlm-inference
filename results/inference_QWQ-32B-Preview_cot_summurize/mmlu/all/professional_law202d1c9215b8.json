                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option isn't an element of common law burglary. So, first things first, I should recall what common law burglary actually entails.\n\nI remember that burglary is generally defined as the unlawful entry into a building or residence with the intent to commit a crime inside, usually a felony or a theft. Now, let's look at each option and see which one doesn't fit into this definition.\n\nOption A is \"a breaking and entry.\" Breaking and entry is a key part of burglary. Breaking doesn't necessarily mean physical force; it can also include tricking someone to let you in or entering through an open door with the intent to commit a crime. So, this seems like it's part of the definition.\n\nOption B is \"of a dwelling, of another.\" A dwelling is someone's home, and \"of another\" means it belongs to someone else. So, burglary typically involves entering someone else's home without permission. This also seems to be in line with the definition.\n\nOption C is \"during the daytime.\" Hmm, this is interesting. I think traditional common law burglary specifies that the offense occurs at night. I believe there's a distinction between burglary committed during the day and at night, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to look deeper into this.\n\nOption D is \"with the intent to commit a felony therein.\" This matches what I recall about burglary requiring the intent to commit a crime inside, usually a felony.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the answer is C, \"during the daytime,\" because traditional common law burglary requires the offense to take place at night. I think that's right. In many legal systems, burglary is defined as breaking and entering into a dwelling at night with the intent to commit a felony. So, if it's during the daytime, it might not meet the traditional definition of burglary.\n\nBut, I should confirm this. Maybe in some jurisdictions, burglary can occur at any time of day. Perhaps the time of day isn't as crucial as it used to be. Still, based on common law principles, I believe burglary traditionally required the offense to take place at night.\n\nLet me consider again. If I'm wrong about option C, maybe it's another option. But A, B, and D all seem to be essential elements of burglary. So, C stands out as the one that might not be an element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"during the daytime\" is still applicable, and my initial thought is incorrect. Maybe the time of day doesn't matter in modern definitions, and therefore, it's not an element.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about it differently. Maybe \"during the daytime\" is always allowed, and it's only illegal at night. But that doesn't make sense because burglary is illegal regardless of the time of day, at least in modern laws.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused now. Maybe I should look back at the options.\n\nOption C says \"during the daytime.\" If this is not an element of common law burglary, it would mean that the time of day isn't a factor, or perhaps that burglary only applies at night.\n\nI think in common law, burglary was specifically at night, and breaking during the day was considered a different offense, maybe robbery or something else.\n\nIn fact, I recall that the original definition of burglary included the time of the offense, requiring it to be at night. So, if that's the case, then \"during the daytime\" would not be an element of common law burglary.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's double-check the other options.\n\nOption A: \"a breaking and entry\" \u2013 yes, that's a fundamental part of burglary.\n\nOption B: \"of a dwelling, of another\" \u2013 again, that's standard.\n\nOption D: \"with the intent to commit a felony therein\" \u2013 that's also a crucial element.\n\nSo, yes, option C seems to be the one that doesn't fit, based on common law definitions.\n\nIt's possible that in some jurisdictions or under modified laws, the time of day is no longer a factor, but since the question is about common law burglary, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
