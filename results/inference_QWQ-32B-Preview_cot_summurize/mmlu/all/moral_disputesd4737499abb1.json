I don't have the exact text or context, but I'll try to reason through the options provided.\n\nOption A says that individualism leads to failures of developing integration and integrality. I'm not entirely sure what \"integration and integrality\" mean in this context, but it seems like it's about not being able to bring things together or have a holistic view.\n\nOption B mentions two specific issues: \"tragedy of the commons\" situations and an atomistic view of persons. The tragedy of the commons is a well-known concept where individual users acting in their own self-interest deplete a shared resource, even when it's clear that it's not in anyone's long-term interest. An atomistic view of persons suggests seeing individuals as separate, independent entities without considering their connections and relationships with others.\n\nOption C talks about increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased consumption of non-recyclable goods. These seem like environmental issues that could be related to individualistic behaviors, but they are more specific outcomes rather than problems or tendencies that individualism leads to.\n\nOption D says that individualism tends to make us think of moral obligations only as personal obligations and that we can only advocate for policy in \"tragedy of the commons\" situations. This seems to be about how individualism affects our perception of morality and policy advocacy.\n\nConsidering these options, I think Option B is the most comprehensive answer. It identifies two key problems: one related to resource management (tragedy of the commons) and another related to how we perceive ourselves and others (atomistic view). These seem like fundamental issues that arise from individualistic attitudes.\n\nOption A is a bit vague, and I'm not sure what \"integration and integrality\" refer to in this specific context. Option C is more about environmental impacts, which might be consequences of individualism but may not capture the core problems that individualism leads to, according to Hourdequin. Option D seems partially correct but maybe too narrow, focusing on moral obligations and policy advocacy.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with Option B: They lead us into \"tragedy of the commons\" situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
