Plug \\( x = 0 \\) into the derivative:\n\n\\[ y'(0) = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the slope \\( m \\) of the tangent line at \\( x = 0 \\) is \\( 2 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the value of the function at \\( x = 0 \\)\n\nTo find the point of tangency, we need the y-coordinate when \\( x = 0 \\). Plug \\( x = 0 \\) into the original function:\n\n\\[ y(0) = 0 + e^0 = 0 + 1 = 1 \\]\n\nSo, the point of tangency is \\( (0, 1) \\).\n\n### Step 4: Use the point-slope form to write the equation of the tangent line\n\nThe point-slope form of a line is:\n\n\\[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\]\n\nwhere \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) is a point on the line and \\( m \\) is the slope.\n\nSubstitute \\( m = 2 \\), \\( x_1 = 0 \\), and \\( y_1 = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ y - 1 = 2(x - 0) \\]\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\n\\[ y - 1 = 2x \\]\n\\[ y = 2x + 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent line to the graph of \\( y = x + e^x \\) at \\( x = 0 \\) is:\n\n\\[ y = 2x + 1 \\]\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. \\( y = 2x + 1 \\)\n\nB. \\( y = 2x \\)\n\nC. \\( y = x + 2 \\)\n\nD. \\( y = x + 1 \\)\n\nThe correct choice is option A.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
