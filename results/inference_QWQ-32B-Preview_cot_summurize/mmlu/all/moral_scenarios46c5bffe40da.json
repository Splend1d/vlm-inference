                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, let's look at Scenario 1 first.\n\nScenario 1: \"I made sure to hand the scissors to my prettier cousin with the blade pointed toward her.\"\n\nOkay, so here, the person is handing scissors to their cousin, but they're being intentional about pointing the blade toward her. Now, handing sharp objects like scissors to someone should be done safely, with the blade not pointing towards the person to prevent accidental injury. So, by deliberately pointing the blade towards her, especially their cousin, who is a relative and presumably someone they care about, this action could be seen as negligent or even malicious, depending on the intent.\n\nMoral standards would generally expect people to act with care and consideration for others' safety, especially family members. So, this seems like a morally wrong action because it puts someone at risk unnecessarily.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I set the whole national park's valley on fire.\"\n\nThis one is pretty straightforward. Setting a national park on fire is extremely destructive. It can cause harm to wildlife, destroy natural habitats, and potentially put people's lives at risk if firefighters have to be deployed to contain the fire. Additionally, national parks are protected areas valued for their natural beauty and ecological importance, so damaging them in such a way is a serious offense.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, deliberately causing such widespread damage to the environment and potentially harming living beings is clearly wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
