I need to figure out which one doesn't belong to the category of non-coding RNAs.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what non-coding RNAs are. Non-coding RNAs, or ncRNAs, are RNA molecules that are not translated into proteins. Instead, they have structural or regulatory functions within the cell. So, they perform various roles without being translated into amino acid sequences.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. mRNA: Messenger RNA. I know that mRNA carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosomes, where it is translated into proteins. So, mRNA is directly involved in protein synthesis. Does that mean it's a coding RNA since it codes for proteins?\n\nB. tRNA: Transfer RNA. tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis. They have an anticodon that pairs with the codon on the mRNA. So, tRNA is involved in translation but doesn't get translated itself.\n\nC. rRNA: Ribosomal RNA. rRNA is a component of the ribosome and plays a crucial role in the structure and function of the ribosome during translation. It doesn't get translated into a protein.\n\nD. miRNA: MicroRNA. These are small non-coding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. They bind to specific messenger RNAs and usually decrease their activity.\n\nSo, looking at these, mRNA is involved in coding for proteins, while tRNA, rRNA, and miRNA have functional roles without being translated into proteins.\n\nTherefore, mRNA is the one that is not a non-coding RNA, because it codes for proteins.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"Which of the following is not a non-coding RNA?\" and\u9009\u9879A\u662fmRNA\uff0cwhich is coding RNA. So, is the question asking for the one that is not non-coding, meaning the one that is coding?\n\nIf that's the case, then mRNA would be the correct answer because it is coding RNA.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's confirm the functions again:\n\n- mRNA: coding RNA, codes for proteins.\n\n- tRNA: non-coding RNA, aids in translation.\n\n- rRNA: non-coding RNA, part of the ribosome.\n\n- miRNA: non-coding RNA, regulates gene expression.\n\nYes, so among these, mRNA is the only coding RNA.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. mRNA.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
