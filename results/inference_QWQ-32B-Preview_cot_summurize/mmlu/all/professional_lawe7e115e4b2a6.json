                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this property law question about tenancy by the entirety and what happens when one spouse conveys their interest without the other's consent. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what tenancy by the entirety is. It's a type of joint ownership available only to married couples, where the property is owned jointly, and both spouses have an undivided interest in the whole property. It has some unique characteristics, like the right of survivorship, which means that when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse automatically inherits the entire property.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the wife secretly conveys her interest in the property to her youngest son from a prior marriage. The husband didn't know about this and now wants to evict the stepson. The question is, according to the majority view among the states, can the stepson keep living there by asserting the deed from his mother?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, the entireties ownership was severed by the valid deed from mother to her son, and son now owns one-half of the property as tenants in common with the husband.\n\nB. Yes, the son became a tenant by the entireties with his mother's husband upon his mother's death.\n\nC. No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\n\nD. No, a mother cannot convey a real estate interest to a son without getting approval from all of her children.\n\nOkay, let's analyze these one by one.\n\nOption A suggests that the entireties ownership was severed by the deed, and now the son owns half as tenants in common with the husband. But I think in tenancy by the entirety, neither spouse can transfer their interest without the other's consent. So, maybe the deed isn't valid.\n\nOption B says the son became a tenant by the entireties with the husband upon the mother's death. That seems unlikely because tenancy by the entirety is specifically for married couples, not between a husband and his stepson.\n\nOption C states that the mother's deed is a nullity because the entireties estate can't be broken without both parties' consent, and thus the husband becomes the sole owner upon the wife's death. This seems plausible because tenancy by the entirety requires both spouses to agree to any transfer or encumbrance of the property.\n\nOption D says the mother cannot convey real estate to her son without approval from all her children. That seems unrelated to the tenancy by the entirety; it's more about parental authority or something, which doesn't directly pertain to the property ownership issue here.\n\nSo, based on what I know about tenancy by the entirety, it's protected against individual disposition by either spouse without the other's consent. Therefore, the wife's secret conveyance might not be valid, and upon her death, the husband should inherit the entire property.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there are exceptions or variations among states.\n\nI recall that tenancy by the entirety is similar to joint tenancy with the added element of the marital relationship. In joint tenancy, the right of survivorship applies, but in tenancy by the entirety, there are also protections against creditors of only one spouse, and the inability to dispose of the property without both spouses' consent.\n\nHowever, if one spouse does convey their interest without the other's consent, in many states, that conveyance is invalid, and the property remains wholly with the surviving spouse upon the death of the conveying spouse.\n\nBut perhaps in some states, the conveyance could sever the tenancy by the entirety, creating a tenancy in common. That would align with option A.\n\nWait, but according to the majority view, how do states handle this situation?\n\nI think the majority view is that tenancy by the entirety cannot be severed without the consent of both spouses. Therefore, the wife's secret deed would be invalid, and upon her death, the husband becomes the sole owner.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider option B again. Could the son become a tenant by the entirety with the husband upon the mother's death? That doesn't make sense because tenancy by the entirety is limited to married couples, and the husband and stepson are not married.\n\nOption D is probably incorrect because it introduces a requirement for parental approval from all children, which isn't a standard legal principle in property transactions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely correct answer is C: No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\n\nI think that's the best choice based on the principles of tenancy by the entirety.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
