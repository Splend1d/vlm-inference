                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Kelsen's pure theory of law. So, Kelsen is a legal philosopher, and he developed this theory that's called the \"pure theory of law.\" The question is asking why it's called \"pure,\" and it gives four options. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that Kelsen purely discussed jurisprudence only. Hmm, that sounds a bit vague. Jurisprudence is the philosophy of law, so if he only talked about that and nothing else, that might be why it's called pure. But I need to think about whether that's accurate.\n\nOption B says he defined law according to morality and purity. Now, I know that Kelsen is associated with separating law from morality, so this seems contradictory. Maybe I need to recall his actual position.\n\nOption C says he separated law from religion, ethics, sociology, and history. That rings a bell. I think Kelsen was trying to make law its own distinct field, not mixing it with other disciplines. That sounds like purity in the sense of keeping it unmixed.\n\nOption D says he discussed law purely in terms of justice. Again, I think Kelsen's theory is more about the structure of law itself rather than its relation to justice.\n\nLet me try to remember. Kelsen is known for his \"pure theory of law,\" which emphasizes the autonomy of law. He wanted to study law as a separate system, independent of moral, social, or historical considerations. So, he was focusing on the legal system itself, its norms, and their hierarchical structure.\n\nIn his theory, the law is a hierarchy of norms, with the constitution at the top, and all other laws deriving their authority from it. He introduced the concept of the \"basic norm,\" which is a hypothetical norm that gives validity to the entire legal system.\n\nNow, considering this, why is it called the \"pure theory of law\"? It's because Kelsen aimed to purify the study of law by separating it from other disciplines and focusing solely on its internal logic and structure. He wanted to avoid mixing legal analysis with moral judgments, sociological data, or historical contexts.\n\nSo, going back to the options:\n\nA. Purely discussed jurisprudence only \u2013 This might be close, but it's a bit too vague.\n\nB. Defined law in accordance with morality and purity \u2013 No, actually, Kelsen separated law from morality.\n\nC. Separated law from religion, ethics, sociology, and history \u2013 This seems spot on.\n\nD. Discussed law purely in terms of justice \u2013 Again, Kelsen's theory is more about the structure of law, not necessarily its relation to justice.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. He separated law from religion, ethics, sociology, and history, making the study of law pure and autonomous.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret \"pure.\" For example, perhaps \"pure\" refers to the idea that law is a closed system of norms, free from external influences. That aligns with option C.\n\nAlternatively, \"pure\" might mean that Kelsen focused purely on the analytical aspects of law, without prescribing how it should be or incorporating normative elements. Again, that would support option C, as he separated the study of law from normative considerations like morality and ethics.\n\nI don't think option A captures the essence accurately. Discussing jurisprudence only could mean he only talked about legal theory, but that doesn't necessarily imply purity in the sense intended here.\n\nOption B is clearly incorrect because Kelsen is known for distinguishing law from morality, not defining it according to morality.\n\nOption D is also not fitting because, while justice is a normative concept, Kelsen's theory is more about the positivist approach to law, focusing on its structure and validity.\n\nHence, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer. Kelsen's pure theory of law involves separating law from other fields like religion, ethics, sociology, and history, to study it as a pure, autonomous system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
