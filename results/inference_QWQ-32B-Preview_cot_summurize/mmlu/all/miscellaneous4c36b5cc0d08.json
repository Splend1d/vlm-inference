Hypnosis: This is a trance-like state where a person has heightened focus and concentration. It's often used in therapy to help with issues like stress, anxiety, or pain management. It's not related to identifying diseases.\n\nB. Prognosis: This refers to the likely course of a disease or the chance of recovery from it. So, once a disease is identified, a prognosis is made about how it will progress.\n\nC. Trichinosis: This is actually a specific disease caused by parasitic roundworms. It's not a term related to identifying diseases in general.\n\nD. Diagnosis: This is the process of identifying a disease or condition by examining a person's symptoms and medical history. It's what doctors do to figure out what's wrong with a patient.\n\nGiven these definitions, it's clear that \"diagnosis\" is the term for a doctor's identification of a disease. So, option D is the correct answer.\n\nTo further solidify this, let's consider how these terms are used in medicine:\n\n- Hypnosis is a technique used in psychology and therapy, not directly for diagnosing diseases.\n\n- Prognosis comes after diagnosis; it's about predicting the outcome of the disease.\n\n- Trichinosis is just one specific disease among many.\n\n- Diagnosis is the fundamental step where a doctor determines what disease or condition a patient has based on their symptoms and other medical tests.\n\nTherefore, the medical term for a doctor's identification of a disease is indeed \"diagnosis.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
