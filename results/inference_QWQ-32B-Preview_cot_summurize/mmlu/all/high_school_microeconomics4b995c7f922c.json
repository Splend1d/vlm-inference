                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this economics question. It's about what happens when the price of a product decreases, and how that affects how much of it a consumer buys, especially compared to a substitute product whose price stays the same. The options are income effect, substitution effect, marginal effect, and supply effect. I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with the income effect: I think this has to do with how changes in income affect what people buy. But in this question, it's about the price of the product changing, not the consumer's income. So, maybe income effect isn't the right answer here.\n\nNext, the substitution effect: This sounds like it might be relevant because it's about how people switch between similar products based on their prices. If one product gets cheaper, people might buy more of it instead of its substitute. That seems pretty close to what the question is describing.\n\nThen there's the marginal effect: I'm not sure exactly what this refers to. I think marginal things in economics deal with changes at the margin, like marginal cost or marginal utility. Maybe this isn't directly related to the scenario in the question.\n\nLastly, the supply effect: This seems to be about how suppliers react to changes in price, maybe by supplying more or less of a product. But the question is from the consumer's perspective, focusing on how much they buy, not on supplier behavior.\n\nSo, between these options, the substitution effect seems to fit best. It's about how consumers substitute one good for another when prices change.\n\nLet me think about it another way. If the price of a product decreases, and the substitute's price stays the same, the relative price of the first product has dropped compared to the substitute. So, consumers might buy more of the cheaper product because it's now a better deal compared to the substitute.\n\nThis definitely sounds like the substitution effect, where consumers substitute towards the good that has become relatively cheaper.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider the income effect again. If the price of a product decreases, that's like the consumer's purchasing power increases\u2014they can buy more with the same amount of money. So, in that sense, it's similar to an increase in income. But the question specifies that the price of the substitute remains constant, and it's about the consumer buying more of this cheaper product specifically, not just buying more in general.\n\nSo, while there might be an income effect component, the primary driver here seems to be the substitution effect, where the consumer is switching from the more expensive substitute to the now-cheaper product.\n\nMoreover, the term \"marginal effect\" isn't standard in this context, at least not that I recall, so I can probably rule that out.\n\nAnd the supply effect is about suppliers, which isn't relevant here since the question is from the consumer's perspective.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. substitution effect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
