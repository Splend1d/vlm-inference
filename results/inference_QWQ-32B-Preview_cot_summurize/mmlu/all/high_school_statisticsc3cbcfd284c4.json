                    "text": "Let's see. So, the student wants to compare the number of contacts that boys and girls have in their phones at their high school. They surveyed 50 boys and 40 girls, asking each to report how many contacts they have.\n\nNow, the question is about which statistical test to use for this situation. Specifically, it's asking about whether a two-sample t-test is appropriate or not, and under what conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a two-sample t-test is used for. It's used to compare the means of two independent groups to see if there's a significant difference between them. In this case, the two groups are boys and girls, and the variable of interest is the number of contacts in their phones.\n\nOption A says: \"Because the population standard deviations are not known and conditions are met, the student should use a two-sample t-test.\"\n\nWell, in most real-world scenarios, population standard deviations are not known, so we do use t-tests instead of z-tests. So, that makes sense. But, we need to check if the conditions are met.\n\nWhat conditions need to be met for a two-sample t-test?\n\n1. Independence: The two groups should be independent of each other. In this case, boys and girls are distinct groups, so that seems fine.\n\n2. Randomness: The samples should be randomly selected from their respective populations. The student randomly sampled 50 boys and 40 girls, so that condition is met.\n\n3. Normality: The data in each group should be approximately normally distributed, especially if the sample sizes are small. However, with larger sample sizes, the Central Limit Theorem kicks in, and the sampling distribution of the mean becomes approximately normal, even if the population distribution isn't.\n\nIn this case, the sample sizes are 50 and 40, which are fairly large. Generally, a sample size of 30 or more is considered large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the conditions are met, and a two-sample t-test would be appropriate.\n\nNow, let's look at the other options to see why they might be incorrect.\n\nOption B says: \"Because the sample sizes are different, the student should not use a two-sample t-test.\"\n\nActually, different sample sizes are okay in a two-sample t-test. The test can handle unequal sample sizes. So, this isn't a valid reason to not use a t-test.\n\nOption C says: \"Because the sample sizes are both greater than 30, the student should not use a two-sample t-test.\"\n\nThis is interesting. Earlier, I thought that larger sample sizes make a t-test more appropriate because of the Central Limit Theorem. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps with large sample sizes, a z-test could be used instead, since the sampling distribution is approximately normal. However, in practice, t-tests are robust and can be used even with large sample sizes. In fact, with large sample sizes, the t-distribution approaches the z-distribution, so there's not much difference.\n\nSo, this doesn't seem like a valid reason to not use a t-test.\n\nOption D says: \"Because the shape of the population distribution is not known, the student should not use a two-sample t-test.\"\n\nWell, that's often the case in real-world data. We rarely know the exact shape of the population distribution. However, as long as the sample sizes are large enough, the Central Limit Theorem allows us to assume that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal, making the t-test still applicable.\n\nTherefore, this isn't a valid reason to avoid using a t-test.\n\nSo, going back to option A, it seems like the correct choice. The population standard deviations are not known, and the conditions for a two-sample t-test are met, so the student should use a two-sample t-test.\n\nWait, but I recall that there are different types of two-sample t-tests, like pooled and unpooled, depending on whether we assume equal variances or not. Maybe that's something to consider.\n\nHowever, the question doesn't provide information about the variances of the two groups, so perhaps we should assume that the variances are not equal, and use the unpooled t-test.\n\nBut, in any case, the general principle remains that a two-sample t-test is appropriate here.\n\nLet me see if there's any other consideration I'm missing.\n\nIs there any assumption about the data being continuous? Yes, the number of contacts is a count, which is discrete, but for large sample sizes, this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlso, is there any concern about outliers? The question doesn't mention anything about outliers, so perhaps we can assume that the data is clean in that regard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the student should consider a non-parametric test, like the Mann-Whitney U test, which doesn't assume normality. But again, with large sample sizes and the Central Limit Theorem, the t-test should be okay.\n\nGiven that, I think option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
