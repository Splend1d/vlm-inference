Salt Flats is at an elevation of negative 55 feet, which means it's 55 feet below sea level, and Talon Bluff is at 620 feet above sea level. I need to find the difference in elevation between these two points.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what difference in elevation means. It's basically how much higher one point is compared to the other. Since Talon Bluff is higher than Salt Flats, the difference should be a positive number representing how much higher Talon Bluff is.\n\nNow, Salt Flats is at -55 feet, and Talon Bluff is at 620 feet. To find the difference, I think I need to subtract the elevation of Salt Flats from the elevation of Talon Bluff. So, it would be 620 - (-55). Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart, right? So, 620 + 55 should give me the difference.\n\nLet me do the math: 620 plus 55 is 675 feet. So, the difference in elevation should be 675 feet.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If Salt Flats is -55 feet, that means it's 55 feet below sea level, and Talon Bluff is 620 feet above sea level. So, from Salt Flats to sea level, that's 55 feet up, and then from sea level to Talon Bluff, that's another 620 feet up. So, total climb would be 55 + 620, which is again 675 feet.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Both methods give me the same answer, which is 675 feet.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 565 feet\n\nB. 575 feet\n\nC. 665 feet\n\nD. 675 feet\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 675 feet.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Could the difference be something else? For example, maybe they mean the straight-line distance instead of the difference in elevation. But the question specifically asks for the difference in elevation, so I think 675 feet is correct.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Both elevations are given in feet, so subtracting them directly is fine.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with D. 675 feet as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
