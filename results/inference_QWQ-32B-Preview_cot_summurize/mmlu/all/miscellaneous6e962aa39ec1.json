I need to recall which airport in these cities has the code ORD.\n\nFirst, I know that New York City has a few major airports like JFK, LaGuardia (LGA), and Newark (EWR). So, ORD doesn't sound like any of those.\n\nNext, Orlando has an airport, and I think its code is MCO or maybe ORL. I'm not sure, but I don't think it's ORD.\n\nPortland has PDX, right? Like, Portland International Airport is PDX.\n\nSo, that leaves Chicago. I seem to remember that Chicago's main airport is O'Hare, and I think its code is ORD. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nLet me double-check though. Maybe Chicago has other airports too, like Midway, which is MDW. So, O'Hare is ORD.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the answer should be Chicago.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider again:\n\n- Chicago: O'Hare (ORD), Midway (MDW)\n\n- Orlando: probably MCO or ORL\n\n- New York City: JFK, LGA, EWR\n\n- Portland: PDX\n\nSo, ORD corresponds to Chicago's O'Hare Airport.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Chicago.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
