Phoenix Mars Lander\n\nThe Phoenix Mars Lander was set to land on May 25, 2008, and its primary mission was to dig trenches in the Martian soil, specifically targeting areas believed to have ice-rich soil. This mission was designed to study the history of water on Mars and to assess whether the environment could have been favorable for microbial life.\n\nLet me provide some more details about the Phoenix Mars Lander and why it was significant:\n\n1. **Mission Overview**: Phoenix was part of NASA's Mars Scout program, which aimed to send smaller, low-cost spacecraft to the Red Planet. It was launched on August 4, 2007, and landed in the northern polar region of Mars on May 25, 2008.\n\n2. **Landing Site**: The landing site was chosen because satellite data suggested the presence of subsurface water ice in the region. The area is similar to the permafrost regions on Earth.\n\n3. **Key Instruments**: Phoenix was equipped with a robotic arm that could dig up to 1.5 meters into the soil. It also had a microscopic imager, a thermal and evolved gas analyzer, and a meteorological station to study the Martian weather.\n\n4. **Scientific Objectives**: The main goals were to:\n   - Determine whether water ice is present in the Martian arctic soil.\n   - Study the history of water in the ice by analyzing its chemical composition.\n   - Determine whether the Martian arctic soil could support microbial life.\n   - Observe the Martian weather from the surface.\n\n5. **Significance**: Phoenix was the first mission to confirm the presence of water ice on Mars from the ground. It also provided valuable data about the Martian climate and soil chemistry.\n\nNow, let's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. **ExoMars**: ExoMars is a joint mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. It consists of several components, including orbiters and rovers, aimed at searching for signs of past or present life on Mars. The first ExoMars mission was launched in 2016, and subsequent missions are planned for future years. Therefore, it was not landing in 2008.\n\nB. **Mars Exploration Rovers (MER)**: The Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, landed in 2004. Their mission was to explore the Martian surface, analyze rocks and soil, and search for signs of past water activity. While they were highly successful, their landing dates do not match the one in the question.\n\nC. **Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)**: MSL, also known as the Curiosity rover, was launched in 2011 and landed on Mars in August 2012. Its mission is to investigate the habitability of Mars, study its climate and geology, and pave the way for human exploration. Again, its landing date does not align with May 25, 2008.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Phoenix Mars Lander.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
