                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about a lab cart moving east at different speeds at two different times. At t1 = 0.10 s, it's moving east at 25 cm/s, and at t2 = 0.20 s, it's moving east at 15 cm/s. The question is asking whether this information is enough to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2. There are four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Newton's second law, which relates net force to acceleration. The net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum. Since momentum is mass times velocity, and mass is constant, the net force is proportional to the acceleration, which is the change in velocity over time.\n\nIn this case, the cart is moving east at both times, but its speed is decreasing from 25 cm/s to 15 cm/s. So, the velocity is changing; it's decreasing in magnitude while keeping the same direction.\n\nLet me calculate the acceleration. Acceleration a is (v2 - v1)/(t2 - t1). Here, v1 = 25 cm/s east, v2 = 15 cm/s east, t1 = 0.10 s, t2 = 0.20 s.\n\nSo, a = (15 - 25)/(0.20 - 0.10) = (-10)/(0.10) = -100 cm/s\u00b2.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the acceleration is in the opposite direction to the initial velocity. Since the initial velocity is east, the acceleration is west.\n\nNow, according to Newton's second law, F_net = m * a. The direction of the net force is the same as the direction of the acceleration, assuming mass is positive.\n\nSo, the net force is in the west direction.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\n\nWait, but momentum change is in the opposite direction of movement because the cart is slowing down. So, if the cart is moving east and slowing down, the change in momentum is westward, and thus the net force is westward.\n\nThis seems consistent with what I calculated.\n\nB. No, because we don\u2019t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\n\nWell, perhaps there are other forces, but based on the information given, we can still determine the direction of the net force. The presence of specific forces like friction or air resistance doesn't change the fact that the net force is in the direction of the acceleration, which we've determined is west.\n\nC. No, because we don\u2019t know the mass of the cart.\n\nMass is needed to calculate the magnitude of the net force, but not its direction. Since the question is only about the direction of the net force, the mass isn't necessary.\n\nD. Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.\n\nThis is incorrect because the cart is slowing down, which means the net force is opposite to the direction of motion.\n\nSo, option A seems correct. We can determine the direction of the net force based on the information given, and it's opposite to the direction of motion because the cart is slowing down.\n\nBut wait, option D says that since the cart keeps moving east, the net force must be in the direction of motion. That's a common misconception. In reality, if the net force is in the direction of motion, the object accelerates; if it's opposite, the object decelerates.\n\nIn this case, the cart is decelerating, so the net force is opposite to the direction of motion, which is west.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect, and option A is correct.\n\nOption B suggests that we don't know about other forces like friction or air resistance, but even if those forces are present, as long as we know the overall velocity change, we can determine the direction of the net force.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the mass isn't needed to determine the direction of the net force.\n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
