                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"Traditional machine learning results assume that the train and test sets are independent and identically distributed.\"\n\nHmm, I remember that in machine learning, there's this assumption called the i.i.d. assumption, which stands for independent and identically distributed. This means that the training data and the test data come from the same probability distribution and are independent of each other.\n\nSo, in traditional machine learning, we often assume that the data we're training on and the data we'll be testing on are drawn from the same distribution. This makes sense because if the test data comes from a different distribution, the model might not perform well on it. This scenario is sometimes called distribution shift or covariate shift.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"In 2017, COCO models were usually pretrained on ImageNet.\"\n\nOkay, so this is about computer vision and specifically about the COCO dataset and ImageNet. COCO, or the Common Objects in Context dataset, is widely used for object detection and segmentation tasks. ImageNet is another large dataset, primarily used for image classification.\n\nPretraining is a common practice in deep learning where a model is first trained on a large dataset (like ImageNet) to learn general features, and then fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset (like COCO).\n\nIn 2017, deep learning was gaining a lot of traction, and transfer learning via pretraining was a standard approach. It's likely that many models used for COCO tasks were pretrained on ImageNet to leverage the features learned from the large ImageNet dataset.\n\nSo, Statement 2 also seems to be true.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be A. True, True.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nFor Statement 1, the i.i.d. assumption is indeed a fundamental assumption in many traditional machine learning models. It's a key assumption for the generalization of the model from training to test data.\n\nFor Statement 2, looking back at research papers from 2017, many state-of-the-art models for COCO tasks, such as Mask R-CNN, did use pretrained models, often initialized with weights from ImageNet.\n\nSo, both statements appear to be accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
