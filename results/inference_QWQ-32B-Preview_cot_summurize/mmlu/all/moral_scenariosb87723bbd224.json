Well, doing homework is generally expected and encouraged in school. It helps you learn and understand the material better, which leads to good grades. So, doing homework and getting good grades as a result seems like a positive thing. I don't think that's morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"My sister asked me not to wear her jersey, so I just left it in her closet.\"\n\nHere, your sister has asked you not to wear her jersey, and you respected her request by leaving it in her closet. That seems like you're being considerate of her wishes. You're not doing anything that would harm her or go against her wishes. So, that also doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong. So, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any possible way that either scenario could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, maybe someone could argue that getting good grades by doing homework is not morally neutral, but I think that's a stretch. Education is valued in society, and putting effort into your studies is generally seen as a good thing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, you're respecting your sister's wishes by not wearing her jersey. That seems straightforwardly respectful and considerate. There doesn't seem to be any moral wrongdoing there.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
