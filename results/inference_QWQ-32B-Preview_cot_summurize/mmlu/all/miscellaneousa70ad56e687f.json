Like when you see cartoon versions of famous people that look similar but with bigger noses or wider eyes.\n\nLet me think about the other options to make sure.\n\nA. Landscape is a type of art that shows natural scenery like mountains, trees, and rivers. It's not about people.\n\nC. Still life is when artists paint inanimate objects like flowers, fruits, or everyday items arranged in a certain way. Again, no people involved.\n\nD. Impressionism is a style of painting where artists try to capture the overall impression or feeling of a scene, often using light and color in a particular way. It's not about exaggerating people's features.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's B. Caricature.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
