                    "text": "I'm looking at this poem by Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo called \"To Roosevelt,\" and it's pretty intense. It's from 1904, so that gives me a clue about what might have been going on at the time. The poem seems to be addressing Theodore Roosevelt, who was the President of the United States back then. Dar\u00edo is essentially telling Roosevelt, and by extension the United States, to back off from interfering in Latin American affairs. He's proud of Latin American culture and history, mentioning figures like Netzahualcoyotl, Montezuma, and the Inca, and he's asserting that their way of life is valuable and should be respected.\n\nSo, the question is, what events might have prompted Dar\u00edo to write this piece? The options are:\n\nA. The discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram\n\nB. The embargo of Cuba after Castro\u2019s revolution\n\nC. U.S. involvement in Panama\u2019s independence\n\nD. U.S. involvement in the Haitian Revolution\n\nFirst off, let's eliminate the options that don't make sense chronologically. The poem is from 1904, so anything that happened after that isn't likely to have prompted the poem.\n\nOption A, the discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram, that was during World War I, which is after 1904.\n\nOption B, the embargo of Cuba after Castro\u2019s revolution, that's in the 1960s, way after 1904.\n\nOption D, U.S. involvement in the Haitian Revolution, that was in the early 19th century, like in the 1800s, so that's before 1904.\n\nSo, those don't fit the timeline. That leaves option C, U.S. involvement in Panama\u2019s independence.\n\nThat makes sense because in 1903-1904, there was significant U.S. involvement in Panama's separation from Colombia and the subsequent construction of the Panama Canal. Theodore Roosevelt played a key role in supporting Panama's independence from Colombia so that the U.S. could build the canal without interference from Colombia.\n\nDar\u00edo, being from Nicaragua and part of the Latin American literary scene, would have been aware of and likely concerned about the expanding influence of the United States in the region, which was part of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. This corollary essentially allowed the U.S. to intervene in Latin American countries to stabilize their economies and politics, which was seen as imperialistic by many Latin Americans.\n\nSo, given that background, it's probable that Dar\u00edo wrote this poem in response to U.S. actions in Panama and the broader context of U.S. interventionism in Latin America during Roosevelt's presidency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
