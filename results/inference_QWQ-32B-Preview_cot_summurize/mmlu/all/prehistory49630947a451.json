                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the option that includes dating techniques based on the half-life of a radioactive isotope and are used to date the age of rocks. So, I need to recall which methods use radioactive isotopes for dating rocks.\n\nFirst, option A has argon/argon and potassium-argon dating. I think both of these are radioactive dating methods. Potassium-argon dating involves the decay of potassium-40 to argon-40, and argon/argon dating is a similar method that measures the ratio of argon isotopes. Both are used for dating rocks, so that seems promising.\n\nOption B has archaeomagnetic and radiocarbon dating. Archaeomagnetic dating is related to changes in the Earth's magnetic field, not radioactive decay. Radiocarbon dating is a radioactive dating method, but it's primarily used for dating organic materials, not rocks. So, this option isn't entirely based on radioactive isotopes for rock dating.\n\nOption C mentions luminescence dating and optically stimulated luminescence. Luminescence dating is used to date sediments, but it's based on the amount of light emitted from minerals after they're heated or exposed to light, not on radioactive decay. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nOption D has X-ray fluorescence and paleomagnetic dating. X-ray fluorescence is a technique used to determine the chemical composition of materials, not for dating. Paleomagnetic dating relies on changes in the Earth's magnetic field over time, again not involving radioactive isotopes.\n\nSo, going back to option A, argon/argon and potassium-argon dating both use the decay of radioactive isotopes to date rocks. Argon-argon dating is a refined version of potassium-argon dating, both based on the known half-life of potassium-40 decaying to argon-40.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Argon/argon and potassium-argon dating.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
