                    "text": "Let's think about this question step by step. So, we have a program that's expressed in a programming language, and we need to figure out which statement about it is true.\n\nOption A says: \"The program can also be expressed as binary code, but will be more easily understood by humans when expressed in a higher-level programming language.\"\n\nWell, I know that computers understand binary code\u2014just ones and zeros. So, any program, no matter what high-level language it's written in, eventually needs to be translated into binary for the computer to execute it. So, the program can indeed be expressed as binary code. Also, it makes sense that higher-level languages are easier for humans to understand because they're more akin to human language and abstract away a lot of the low-level details. So, A seems plausible.\n\nOption B: \"The program can also be expressed as binary code, which will reduce the likelihood of errors.\"\n\nHmm, binary code is just machine language, and while it's what the computer understands, I don't think expressing a program in binary reduces errors. In fact, programming in binary is extremely error-prone and tedious for humans. High-level languages have features like syntax checking, type safety, and more, which actually help reduce errors. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"The program cannot be expressed as binary code, because binary code can only be used to represent data.\"\n\nWait, this is definitely not true. Binary code is used to represent both instructions (the program) and data. In computing, binary encompasses machine code, which consists of instructions that the CPU can execute, as well as data that the program manipulates. So, this option is false.\n\nOption D: \"Some parts of the program can be expressed as binary code, but operations must be expressed using a higher-level programming language.\"\n\nThis seems inconsistent. If a program is to be executed by a computer, all of it needs to be translated into binary code eventually. There aren't parts that can only be expressed in high-level languages for the computer to understand them. Humans might write parts in higher-level languages for ease, but ultimately, everything needs to be in binary for execution.\n\nSo, considering all this, option A seems to be the correct choice. The program can be expressed as binary code, and it's more easily understood by humans in a higher-level language.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
