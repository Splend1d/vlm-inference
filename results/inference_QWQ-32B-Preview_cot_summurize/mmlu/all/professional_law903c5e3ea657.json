                    "text": "So here's this scenario: It's 3 a.m., and a police officer on duty hears breaking glass and a blaring alarm. He sees someone, Stan, running out of a darkened liquor store. Stan runs around the corner, out of the officer's view, and hops into a car. The officer sees Stan drive away, so he turns on his lights and pursues. Stan pulls over, and the officer arrests him. When the officer arrives at the scene, he doesn't see anything in the passenger compartment, but he pops the trunk and finds cash and a baseball bat.\n\nNow, Stan is moving to suppress that cash and baseball bat as evidence. So, we need to figure out whether that motion will likely be denied or granted, and why.\n\nFirst off, let's think about what's happening here. The officer heard breaking glass and an alarm, which probably indicates some kind of burglary or robbery. Then he sees Stan running out of the store at 3 a.m., which is pretty suspicious. Stan runs around the corner and gets into a car, which the officer then pursues and arrests.\n\nSo, was the arrest\u5408\u6cd5\u7684? Well, the officer had probable cause to believe that Stan was involved in a crime, given the circumstances. He heard breaking glass and an alarm, saw someone running out of a store at a weird hour, and that person got into a car and fled. That seems like reasonable suspicion to stop and investigate, and possibly probable cause for an arrest.\n\nNow, regarding the search. The officer arrested Stan and then searched the trunk of the car, finding cash and a baseball bat. The question is whether that search was lawful.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Denied, because the officer had probable cause to search the trunk.\n\nB. Denied, because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk of the automobile.\n\nC. Granted, because the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control.\n\nD. Granted, because the arrest was illegal and therefore the evidence is considered to be fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\nFirst, option D suggests that the arrest was illegal, but from what we've discussed, it seems like the arrest was\u5408\u6cd5\u7684 based on probable cause. So, unless there's more to it, I don't think the arrest was illegal.\n\nOption C says that the trunk area was out of Stan's control. In search incident to arrest cases, officers can search the area within the arrestee's immediate control. That usually includes the passenger compartment of the car but not necessarily the trunk.\n\nWait, but in this case, Stan was arrested and then the officer searched the trunk. So, was the trunk within Stan's control at that point?\n\nProbably not, because he was already arrested and in custody. So, searching the trunk might require another justification beyond just the search incident to arrest.\n\nOption A says denied because the officer had probable cause to search the trunk. But did he? Just because he had probable cause to arrest Stan doesn't necessarily mean he had probable cause to search the trunk specifically.\n\nOption B says that a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk of the automobile. Is that true?\n\nI don't think so. Generally, a search incident to arrest allows officers to search the person and the area within their immediate control to ensure officer safety and prevent destruction of evidence. In the context of a vehicle, that usually means the passenger compartment, but not necessarily the trunk.\n\nIn fact, I recall that the trunk is considered separate from the passenger compartment, and searching it requires either consent, a warrant, or some other exception to the warrant requirement, like exigent circumstances or probable cause to believe there's evidence in the trunk.\n\nSo, in this case, the officer didn't see anything in the passenger compartment, but decided to pop the trunk and found the cash and baseball bat.\n\nWas there probable cause to search the trunk? Maybe, depending on the circumstances. The officer heard breaking glass and an alarm, saw Stan running from the store, and then arrested him. Finding cash and a baseball bat in the trunk might be related to the crime, but did the officer have probable cause to believe that evidence was in the trunk?\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the officer could argue that it was a search incident to arrest, but as I recall, the Supreme Court has held that the scope of a search incident to arrest in a vehicle is limited to the passenger compartment and any containers therein, but not the trunk.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nIn Arizona v. Gant, the Supreme Court held that officers may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it's reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.\n\nSo, in this case, Stan was arrested and presumably was no longer within reaching distance of the passenger compartment. Also, the offense of arrest was probably burglary or robbery, and it might be reasonable to believe that evidence of that crime is in the vehicle.\n\nBut Gant says that officers can search the passenger compartment and any containers within reach, but not necessarily the trunk.\n\nSo, perhaps searching the trunk would require separate justification, like probable cause to believe there's evidence in the trunk.\n\nBut did the officer have that? Let's see.\n\nHe heard breaking glass and an alarm, saw Stan running from the store, and arrested him. That suggests that Stan was involved in a crime at the store, but does that necessarily mean that there's evidence in the trunk?\n\nMaybe, but it's a bit of a stretch. Perhaps the cash and baseball bat are related to the crime, but without specific reason to believe that evidence is in the trunk, it might be a reach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the officer could argue that in burglary cases, it's common for perpetrators to transport stolen goods in their vehicles, so there's probable cause to search the trunk for evidence related to the crime.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that would hold up, because the trunk is a separate area, and the general rule is that a search incident to arrest doesn't extend to the trunk without additional justification.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is that the motion to suppress should be granted because the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control, as per option C.\n\nWait, but option C says \"because the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control.\"\n\nWhile that's true, is that the only reason? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, option A says denied because the officer had probable cause to search the trunk.\n\nBut did he really have probable cause specifically to search the trunk?\n\nOption B says denied because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk of the automobile.\n\nBut that doesn't seem accurate based on Gant and other case law.\n\nOption D says granted because the arrest was illegal, but I don't think the arrest was illegal.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is the best answer, but I'm still a bit unsure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court would find that the officer had probable cause to search the trunk based on the circumstances, in which case option A would be correct.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If the officer had probable cause to believe that the trunk contained evidence related to the crime, then searching the trunk would be justified.\n\nBut was there probable cause here? The officer heard breaking glass and an alarm, saw Stan running from the store, and arrested him.\n\nFrom that, can we infer that there's evidence in the trunk? Well, perhaps Stan was fleeing the scene and had evidence in his car, but it's a bit speculative.\n\nOn the other hand, if the officer had seen Stan place something in the trunk or if there was other evidence linking the trunk to the crime, that would be different.\n\nBut in this scenario, there's no such specific information.\n\nSo, perhaps the search of the trunk was not justified, and therefore the evidence should be suppressed.\n\nTherefore, the motion to suppress should be granted, likely under option C, that the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option D could be considered, but since I think the arrest was\u5408\u6cd5\u7684, I don't think the evidence is fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the best answer.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm a bit uncertain. Maybe I need to look up some case law on this specific point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the officer could argue that the trunk was within Stan's control at the time of the arrest, but that seems unlikely if Stan was already arrested and secured.\n\nIn any case, based on my current understanding, I would lean towards option C, that the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control, and therefore the search of the trunk was not justified as a search incident to arrest.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
