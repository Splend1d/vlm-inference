                    "text": "To determine what will be left in measurable amounts after reacting 1.0 g of rubidium (Rb) with 1.0 g of bromine (Br\u2082), we need to consider the chemical reaction between them and identify the limiting reactant.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rb} + \\text{Br}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{RbBr} \\]\n\nFrom the equation, we see that one mole of rubidium reacts with one mole of bromine to produce one mole of rubidium bromide (RbBr).\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of moles of each reactant:\n\n1. Molar mass of Rb: approximately 85.47 g/mol\n2. Molar mass of Br\u2082: approximately 159.81 g/mol\n\nNow, calculate the moles:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of Rb} = \\frac{1.0 \\, \\text{g}}{85.47 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.0117 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of Br}_2 = \\frac{1.0 \\, \\text{g}}{159.81 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.00626 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, the reaction requires a 1:1 mole ratio of Rb to Br\u2082. However, we have more moles of Rb than Br\u2082, which means Br\u2082 is the limiting reactant.\n\nTherefore, all of the Br\u2082 will react, and some Rb will be left unreacted.\n\nLet's calculate the amount of Rb that reacts with the available Br\u2082:\n\nSince the reaction is 1:1, the moles of Rb that react are equal to the moles of Br\u2082:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of Rb that react} = 0.00626 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the mass of Rb that reacts:\n\n\\[ \\text{mass of Rb that react} = 0.00626 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 85.47 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\approx 0.535 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nTherefore, the mass of Rb left unreacted is:\n\n\\[ \\text{mass of Rb left} = 1.0 \\, \\text{g} - 0.535 \\, \\text{g} = 0.465 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the mass of RbBr produced:\n\nSince the reaction is 1:1, the moles of RbBr produced are equal to the moles of Br\u2082 reacted:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of RbBr} = 0.00626 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nMolar mass of RbBr:\n\n\\[ \\text{molar mass of RbBr} = 85.47 \\, \\text{g/mol} + 79.90 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 165.37 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{mass of RbBr} = 0.00626 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 165.37 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\approx 1.035 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nNow, consider if there is any Br\u2082 left. Since Br\u2082 is the limiting reactant, it should be completely consumed in the reaction. However, we should check if there is any excess Br\u2082 due to side reactions or incomplete reaction, but based on the stoichiometry, it should be zero.\n\nBut in reality, some Br\u2082 might remain if the reaction is not complete or if there are side reactions. However, for this problem, we'll assume the reaction goes to completion as per the stoichiometry.\n\nNow, we need to determine what is left in measurable amounts, defined as more than 0.10 mg (which is 0.0001 g).\n\nWe have:\n\n- RbBr: approximately 1.035 g\n- Rb: approximately 0.465 g\n- Br\u2082: theoretically 0 g\n\nHowever, in practice, there might be some Br\u2082 left due to equilibrium or incomplete reaction, but based on the stoichiometry, it should be zero.\n\nTherefore, the substances left in measurable amounts are RbBr and Rb.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if there is any Br\u2082 left due to the equilibrium of the reaction or other factors. The reaction between rubidium and bromine is highly exothermic and proceeds nearly to completion, but in reality, there might be a slight equilibrium.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of this problem, we'll assume that Br\u2082 is completely consumed.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be RbBr and Rb.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. RbBr only\n\nB. RbBr and Rb only\n\nC. RbBr and Br\u2082 only\n\nD. RbBr, Rb, and Br\u2082\n\nBased on our calculation, the correct answer should be B. RbBr and Rb only.\n\nBut let's double-check if Br\u2082 could be present in measurable amounts.\n\nRubidium and bromine react vigorously to form RbBr, and bromine is a strong oxidizing agent, while rubidium is a strong reducing agent. Therefore, the reaction should proceed nearly to completion, with minimal Br\u2082 left unreacted.\n\nGiven that, the mass of Br\u2082 left should be negligible, probably much less than 0.10 mg.\n\nTherefore, only RbBr and Rb should be present in measurable amounts.\n\nHence, the answer is B. RbBr and Rb only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
