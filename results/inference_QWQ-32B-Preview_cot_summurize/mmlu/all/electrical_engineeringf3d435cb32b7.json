                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking about. It's about a quartz crystal oscillator and its resonant frequencies. The options are:\n\nA. only series resonant frequency.\n\nB. only parallel resonant frequency.\n\nC. both series and parallel frequencies.\n\nD. neither series nor parallel frequency.\n\nI need to recall how quartz crystal oscillators work. I remember that quartz crystals have piezoelectric properties, meaning they can convert mechanical stress into an electric charge and vice versa. In oscillators, they are used because of their high Q-factor and stability.\n\nNow, resonant frequencies in crystals refer to the frequencies at which the crystal naturally oscillates. There are two main types mentioned here: series and parallel resonant frequencies.\n\nSeries resonant frequency is when the crystal appears purely resistive in a series circuit, and parallel resonant frequency is when the crystal appears purely resistive in a parallel circuit.\n\nI think crystals can operate in both modes, depending on how they are connected in the circuit. So, option C seems plausible.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a specific reason why it's only one of them.\n\nOption A says only series resonant frequency, but I know that crystals can be used in parallel resonance as well. So, that might not be entirely accurate.\n\nOption B says only parallel resonant frequency, but again, crystals can be used in series resonance.\n\nOption D says neither, which contradicts the basic functioning of quartz crystals in oscillators.\n\nSo, the most comprehensive answer should be that quartz crystal oscillators consist of both series and parallel resonant frequencies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. both series and parallel frequencies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
