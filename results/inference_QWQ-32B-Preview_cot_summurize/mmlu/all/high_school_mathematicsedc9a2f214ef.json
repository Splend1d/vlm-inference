                    "text": "So I have this problem here: find \\( b \\) if \\( \\log_b 343 = -\\frac{3}{2} \\). The options are 3, \\(\\frac{1}{49}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\), and 7. Hmm, I need to find the base \\( b \\) that makes this logarithmic equation true.\n\nFirst, I recall that a logarithm equation like \\( \\log_b a = c \\) can be rewritten in its exponential form as \\( b^c = a \\). So, in this case, \\( \\log_b 343 = -\\frac{3}{2} \\) means that \\( b^{-\\frac{3}{2}} = 343 \\).\n\nAlright, so I have \\( b^{-\\frac{3}{2}} = 343 \\). Negative exponents can be tricky, but I remember that \\( b^{-n} = \\frac{1}{b^n} \\). So, \\( b^{-\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{1}{b^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\). Therefore, \\( \\frac{1}{b^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = 343 \\), which implies that \\( b^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{1}{343} \\).\n\nWait a minute, but that doesn't seem right because 343 is a positive number, and the base \\( b \\) should also be positive and not equal to 1. Let me double-check that step.\n\nActually, if \\( b^{-\\frac{3}{2}} = 343 \\), then indeed \\( b^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{1}{343} \\). Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( b \\) in the equation \\( b^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{1}{343} \\). To isolate \\( b \\), I can raise both sides of the equation to the power of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), which is the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\). So, \\( \\left( b^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{343} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\).\n\nSimplifying the left side, \\( b^{\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}} = b^1 = b \\). And on the right side, \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{343} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\).\n\nSo, \\( b = \\left( \\frac{1}{343} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\).\n\nNow, I need to simplify \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{343} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\). First, I know that 343 is \\( 7^3 \\), because \\( 7 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 343 \\). So, \\( 343 = 7^3 \\), which means \\( \\frac{1}{343} = 7^{-3} \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{343} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} = (7^{-3})^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\).\n\nWhen raising a power to another power, I multiply the exponents: \\( 7^{-3 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}} = 7^{-2} \\).\n\nSo, \\( b = 7^{-2} \\), which is \\( \\frac{1}{7^2} = \\frac{1}{49} \\).\n\nLooking back at the options, \\(\\frac{1}{49}\\) is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from \\( \\log_b 343 = -\\frac{3}{2} \\), which implies \\( b^{-\\frac{3}{2}} = 343 \\), and then \\( b^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{1}{343} \\), and finally \\( b = \\left( \\frac{1}{343} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 7^{-2} = \\frac{1}{49} \\).\n\nSeems consistent. However, I should check if \\( b = \\frac{1}{49} \\) indeed satisfies the original equation.\n\nLet's plug \\( b = \\frac{1}{49} \\) back into the logarithm: \\( \\log_{\\frac{1}{49}} 343 = -\\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\nTo verify this, I can use the change of base formula or think about it in terms of exponents. If \\( \\log_{\\frac{1}{49}} 343 = -\\frac{3}{2} \\), then \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{49} \\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}} = 343 \\).\n\nSimplifying the left side: \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{49} \\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}} = 49^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\).\n\nNow, 49 is \\( 7^2 \\), so \\( 49^{\\frac{3}{2}} = (7^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 7^{2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}} = 7^3 = 343 \\).\n\nYes, this matches the original equation. So, \\( b = \\frac{1}{49} \\) is indeed the correct answer.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any other possible solutions. Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, there should be only one value of \\( b \\) that satisfies the equation, given that \\( b > 0 \\) and \\( b \\neq 1 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is \\( \\frac{1}{49} \\), which matches our calculation.\n\nHowever, I notice that option C is \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\), which is \\( 7^{-1} \\), and option D is 7. Maybe there's a chance I made a mistake in the exponents.\n\nLet me double-check the step where I simplified \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{343} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\). Since \\( 343 = 7^3 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{343} = 7^{-3} \\), and \\( (7^{-3})^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 7^{-3 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}} = 7^{-2} = \\frac{1}{49} \\). Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem. For example, I could express 343 as a power of 7, and then solve for \\( b \\).\n\nSo, 343 is \\( 7^3 \\), as I already know. So, \\( \\log_b (7^3) = -\\frac{3}{2} \\). Using the logarithm power rule, which says \\( \\log_b (a^c) = c \\log_b a \\), I can write this as \\( 3 \\log_b 7 = -\\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\nThen, dividing both sides by 3, \\( \\log_b 7 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nNow, converting this back to exponential form, \\( b^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = 7 \\), which means \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{b}} = 7 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( \\sqrt{b} = \\frac{1}{7} \\), and squaring both sides, \\( b = \\left( \\frac{1}{7} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{49} \\).\n\nAgain, this confirms that \\( b = \\frac{1}{49} \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the property of logarithms that allows me to switch the base and the argument with a negative sign, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nWait, there's a formula: \\( \\log_b a = \\frac{1}{\\log_a b} \\), but I don't see how that directly helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the change of base formula, but that might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of natural logarithms, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other possible value of \\( b \\) that could satisfy the equation. Suppose \\( b = 7 \\), which is option D. Then, \\( \\log_7 343 = \\log_7 (7^3) = 3 \\), which is not equal to \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\). So, \\( b = 7 \\) is not a solution.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( b = \\frac{1}{7} \\), which is option C, then \\( \\log_{\\frac{1}{7}} 343 = \\frac{\\log 343}{\\log \\frac{1}{7}} = \\frac{\\log 343}{-\\log 7} = -\\frac{\\log 7^3}{\\log 7} = -\\frac{3 \\log 7}{\\log 7} = -3 \\), which is not equal to \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\). So, \\( b = \\frac{1}{7} \\) is not a solution.\n\nOption A is 3. Let's check if \\( b = 3 \\) is a solution. Then, \\( \\log_3 343 = \\frac{\\log 343}{\\log 3} = \\frac{\\log 7^3}{\\log 3} = \\frac{3 \\log 7}{\\log 3} \\), which is not equal to \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\). So, \\( b = 3 \\) is not a solution.\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is B, \\( \\frac{1}{49} \\).\n\nWait a second, but I recall that in some logarithmic equations, there might be multiple solutions or extraneous solutions, so I should make sure that there are no other possible values of \\( b \\) that could satisfy the equation.\n\nGiven that the logarithm function is one-to-one for a fixed base, and considering the domain restrictions for the base \\( b \\) (which must be positive and not equal to 1), it seems that there is only one solution, which is \\( b = \\frac{1}{49} \\).\n\nAdditionally, I can consider the graph of \\( y = \\log_b x \\) and see how it behaves for different values of \\( b \\). For \\( 0 < b < 1 \\), the logarithmic function is decreasing, which aligns with our solution since \\( b = \\frac{1}{49} \\) is between 0 and 1, and \\( \\log_b 343 \\) is negative, as expected.\n\nAlternatively, for \\( b > 1 \\), \\( \\log_b 343 \\) would be positive, which doesn't match our equation where \\( \\log_b 343 = -\\frac{3}{2} \\), a negative number. Therefore, \\( b \\) must be between 0 and 1, which confirms that \\( b = \\frac{1}{49} \\) is the only valid solution.\n\nMoreover, I can check if there are any restrictions or special cases I might have missed. For example, if \\( b \\) were negative, but logarithms with negative bases are not typically defined, especially in standard real-number logarithms. Therefore, sticking to positive \\( b \\) not equal to 1 is appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, after verifying through multiple methods, I am confident that the correct answer is \\( b = \\frac{1}{49} \\), which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{49}} \\]"
