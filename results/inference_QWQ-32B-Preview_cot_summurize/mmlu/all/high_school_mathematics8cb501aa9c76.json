                    "text": "Let's see. I have this sequence where the first term is 1, and each next term is the sum of all the previous terms. I need to find the first term that's bigger than 5000. Let's try to understand how this sequence works.\n\nSo, the first term is 1. That's easy.\n\nNow, the second term is the sum of all previous terms, which is just 1. So the second term is also 1.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if each successive term is the sum of all previous terms, then:\n\n- First term: 1\n\n- Second term: sum of first term = 1\n\n- Third term: sum of first and second terms = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Fourth term: sum of first, second, and third terms = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n\n- Fifth term: 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8\n\n- Sixth term: 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 16\n\n- And so on.\n\nHmm, this seems like it's doubling each time after the second term. Let me check:\n\n- First term: 1\n\n- Second term: 1\n\n- Third term: 2\n\n- Fourth term: 4\n\n- Fifth term: 8\n\n- Sixth term: 16\n\n- Seventh term: 32\n\n- Eighth term: 64\n\n- Ninth term: 128\n\n- Tenth term: 256\n\n- Eleventh term: 512\n\n- Twelfth term: 1024\n\n- Thirteenth term: 2048\n\n- Fourteenth term: 4096\n\n- Fifteenth term: 8192\n\nOkay, so the sequence goes like this. Now, I need to find the first term that exceeds 5000. Let's see:\n\n- Fourteenth term: 4096\n\n- Fifteenth term: 8192\n\n4096 is less than 5000, and 8192 is greater than 5000. So, the first term that exceeds 5000 is 8192.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there aren't any terms between 4096 and 8192 that might be greater than 5000. From the pattern, it looks like each term after the second is double the previous term. So, after 4096 comes 8192. There are no terms in between.\n\nTherefore, the first term that exceeds 5000 is 8192.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10240\n\nB. 5001\n\nC. 5002\n\nD. 8192\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 8192.\n\nBut, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to look at this sequence.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If each term is the sum of all previous terms, that means that the nth term is equal to the total sum up to the (n-1)th term.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as a recursive formula.\n\nLet S_n be the sum of the first n terms.\n\nThen, the nth term a_n = S_{n-1}\n\nBut also, S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n\n\nSubstituting a_n = S_{n-1} into the equation:\n\nS_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-1} = 2 S_{n-1}\n\nSo, S_n = 2 S_{n-1}\n\nThis means that the sum of the sequence doubles each time.\n\nGiven that S_1 = 1\n\nS_2 = 2 * S_1 = 2\n\nS_3 = 2 * S_2 = 4\n\nS_4 = 2 * S_3 = 8\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait a minute, this seems different from what I did earlier.\n\nIn this case, S_n = 2^{n-1}\n\nBut earlier, I had:\n\n- First term: 1 (S_1 = 1)\n\n- Second term: 1 (S_2 = 1 + 1 = 2)\n\n- Third term: 2 (S_3 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4)\n\n- Fourth term: 4 (S_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8)\n\n- Fifth term: 8 (S_5 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 16)\n\n- And so on.\n\nWait, but in this pattern, S_n = 2^{n-1}, which matches what I have:\n\n- S_1 = 1 = 2^0\n\n- S_2 = 2 = 2^1\n\n- S_3 = 4 = 2^2\n\n- S_4 = 8 = 2^3\n\n- S_5 = 16 = 2^4\n\n- etc.\n\nSo, the sum S_n = 2^{n-1}\n\nThen, the nth term a_n = S_{n-1} = 2^{n-2}, for n >= 2\n\nBut wait, for n=2, a_2 = S_1 = 1, which matches.\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = S_2 = 2\n\nFor n=4, a_4 = S_3 = 4\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 2^{n-2}, for n >= 2\n\nAnd a_1 = 1\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\n1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, ...\n\nNow, I need to find the first term greater than 5000.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\n4096 is less than 5000\n\n8192 is greater than 5000\n\nSo, 8192 is the first term that exceeds 5000.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 8192\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's any mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second term is not 1, but something else.\n\nWait, according to the problem: the first term is 1, and each successive term is the sum of all the previous terms.\n\nSo, first term: 1\n\nSecond term: sum of previous terms, which is 1\n\nThird term: sum of first and second terms, which is 1 + 1 = 2\n\nFourth term: sum of first, second, and third terms, which is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n\nFifth term: 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the sequence is indeed 1,1,2,4,8,16,32,...\n\nTherefore, the terms are:\n\na1: 1\n\na2:1\n\na3:2\n\na4:4\n\na5:8\n\na6:16\n\na7:32\n\na8:64\n\na9:128\n\na10:256\n\na11:512\n\na12:1024\n\na13:2048\n\na14:4096\n\na15:8192\n\nSo, a15 = 8192 > 5000\n\nAnd a14 = 4096 < 5000\n\nTherefore, the first term to exceed 5000 is 8192.\n\nBut looking at the options, 10240 is also greater than 5000, but it comes after 8192.\n\nSo, the first one is 8192.\n\nWait, but perhaps there is a mistake in the sequence.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\na1:1\n\na2: sum of previous terms = a1 =1\n\na3: sum of a1 and a2 =1+1=2\n\na4: sum of a1,a2,a3=1+1+2=4\n\na5:1+1+2+4=8\n\na6:1+1+2+4+8=16\n\na7:1+1+2+4+8+16=32\n\na8:1+1+2+4+8+16+32=64\n\na9:128\n\na10:256\n\na11:512\n\na12:1024\n\na13:2048\n\na14:4096\n\na15:8192\n\na16:16384\n\nSo, yes, a15=8192 is the first term greater than 5000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 8192\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's see if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the sum of all previous terms\" is exclusive of the current term, but according to the problem, it's the sum of all previous terms, so my interpretation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first term is not included in the sum for the second term.\n\nWait, the problem says: the first term is 1, and each successive term is the sum of all the previous terms.\n\nSo, for the second term, there's only one previous term, which is a1=1, so a2=1\n\nThen, a3= a1 + a2 =1+1=2\n\na4= a1 + a2 + a3=1+1+2=4\n\nAnd so on.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 8192\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8192} \\]"
