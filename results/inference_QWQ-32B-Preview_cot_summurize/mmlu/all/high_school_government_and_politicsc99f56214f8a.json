Let's see, there was a lot going on with the federal budget back then, with deficits piling up. I think the main aim was to tackle that issue.\n\nOption A says \"strengthen the military.\" Hmm, in the 1980s, there was definitely a buildup in military spending under President Reagan, but I don't recall Gramm-Rudman being directly about that. It seems more related to budget deficits.\n\nOption B is \"increase funding for social programs.\" Again, that doesn't sound right. If anything, I think Gramm-Rudman was about cutting spending, not increasing it.\n\nOption C is \"reduce the federal deficit.\" That rings a bell. The Gramm-Rudman Acts were supposed to set targets for reducing the deficit over time. They established mandatory spending cuts if the targets weren't met through other means. So, this seems likely.\n\nOption D says \"limit the president's ability to conduct foreign policy.\" I don't think that was the primary goal. Gramm-Rudman was more about domestic budget issues rather than restricting presidential powers in foreign affairs.\n\nLet me double-check. Gramm-Rudman was named after its sponsors, Senators Phil Gramm and Warren Rudman. It was enacted in 1985 and then amended in 1987. The key feature was to set declining deficit targets for the federal government, with automatic across-the-board spending cuts (called sequestration) to take effect if Congress and the president didn't bring the deficit under control through other measures.\n\nSo, the primary goal was indeed to reduce the federal deficit by setting targets and imposing penalties if those targets weren't met. It was an attempt to force fiscal discipline on the government.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Reduce the federal deficit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
