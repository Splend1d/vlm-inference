                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is: \"Which equation represents 36 less than a number, y, is equal to 13?\" and we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"36 less than a number, y\" means. If I have a number y, and I subtract 36 from it, that should give me something. According to the problem, that something is equal to 13.\n\nSo, in mathematical terms, that would be y minus 36 equals 13. That sounds like option A: y - 36 = 13.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The phrase \"less than\" can sometimes be tricky. For example, \"5 less than x\" is x - 5, not 5 - x. So, in this case, \"36 less than y\" should indeed be y - 36.\n\nNow, let's look at the other options to see why they might not be correct.\n\nOption B: 36 - y = 13. This would mean \"36 minus y equals 13.\" That's different from what the problem is saying. The problem says \"36 less than y,\" which is y - 36, not 36 - y.\n\nOption C: 13 - y = 36. This says \"13 minus y equals 36.\" That doesn't match the problem statement at all. The problem says that 36 less than y is equal to 13, not that 13 minus y is equal to 36.\n\nOption D: 36 + y = -13. This says \"36 plus y equals negative 13.\" Again, this doesn't align with the problem's statement about \"36 less than y\" being equal to 13.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option A seems to be the correct equation that represents the statement \"36 less than a number, y, is equal to 13.\"\n\nWait a minute, let me think again. Maybe I should try plugging in a value for y to see which equation makes sense.\n\nSuppose y is 49. Then, 36 less than 49 is 49 - 36 = 13, which matches the problem's statement. Now, let's see which equation holds true for y = 49.\n\nOption A: 49 - 36 = 13 \u2192 13 = 13, which is correct.\n\nOption B: 36 - 49 = 13 \u2192 -13 = 13, which is not true.\n\nOption C: 13 - 49 = 36 \u2192 -36 = 36, which is not true.\n\nOption D: 36 + 49 = -13 \u2192 85 = -13, which is not true.\n\nSo, only option A holds true for y = 49.\n\nAlternatively, I can solve each equation for y and see which one makes sense.\n\nOption A: y - 36 = 13 \u2192 y = 13 + 36 \u2192 y = 49.\n\nOption B: 36 - y = 13 \u2192 y = 36 - 13 \u2192 y = 23.\n\nOption C: 13 - y = 36 \u2192 y = 13 - 36 \u2192 y = -23.\n\nOption D: 36 + y = -13 \u2192 y = -13 - 36 \u2192 y = -49.\n\nNow, which of these values for y makes the original statement true?\n\nThe original statement is \"36 less than y is equal to 13.\" Let's test y = 49:\n\n49 - 36 = 13 \u2192 13 = 13, which is correct.\n\nFor y = 23:\n\n23 - 36 = -13, which is not equal to 13.\n\nFor y = -23:\n\n-23 - 36 = -59, which is not equal to 13.\n\nFor y = -49:\n\n-49 - 36 = -85, which is not equal to 13.\n\nTherefore, only y = 49 satisfies the original statement, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the phrase \"36 less than y.\" This directly translates to y minus 36. Setting that equal to 13 gives y - 36 = 13.\n\nIn contrast, \"36 less than y\" does not mean 36 - y, which would be \"36 minus y.\" The order matters in subtraction.\n\nSo, to summarize, the correct equation is y - 36 = 13, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
