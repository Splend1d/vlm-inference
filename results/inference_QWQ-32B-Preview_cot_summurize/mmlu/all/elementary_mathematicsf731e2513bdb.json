Start with 1 and 42 (since 1 \u00d7 42 = 42)\n2. 2 and 21 (since 2 \u00d7 21 = 42)\n3. 3 and 14 (since 3 \u00d7 14 = 42)\n4. 6 and 7 (since 6 \u00d7 7 = 42)\n\nSo, the factors of 42 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.\n\n**Factors of 84:**\n1. Start with 1 and 84 (since 1 \u00d7 84 = 84)\n2. 2 and 42 (since 2 \u00d7 42 = 84)\n3. 3 and 28 (since 3 \u00d7 28 = 84)\n4. 4 and 21 (since 4 \u00d7 21 = 84)\n5. 6 and 14 (since 6 \u00d7 14 = 84)\n6. 7 and 12 (since 7 \u00d7 12 = 84)\n\nSo, the factors of 84 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84.\n\nNext, we identify the common factors of 42 and 84 by looking for numbers that appear in both lists.\n\nCommon factors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.\n\nAmong these common factors, the greatest one is 42.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common factor of 42 and 84 is 42.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42} \\]"
