The options are:\n\nA. insufficiently involved in the international capitalist economy\n\nB. reluctant to surrender their traditional ways of life\n\nC. economically dependent on the wealthy countries that exploited them\n\nD. the 'metropoles' to which 'satellite' countries were attached\n\nI need to figure out which one Frank was claiming about underdeveloped societies. First, I should probably understand what Frank was arguing in 1967. I think he was talking about dependency theory, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall.\n\nDependency theory suggests that the underdevelopment of some countries is a result of their exploitation by more developed countries. So, it's kind of like a relationship where richer countries benefit at the expense of poorer ones.\n\nOption A says they're insufficiently involved in the international capitalist economy. That sounds like maybe they need more integration into the global economy to develop, which is more like the neoliberal perspective. But Frank was probably arguing something different.\n\nOption B mentions reluctance to give up traditional ways of life. That seems more related to cultural factors and resistance to change, which might be a factor, but I don't think that's the main point Frank was making.\n\nOption C says they're economically dependent on wealthy countries that exploit them. That sounds a lot like dependency theory. So, maybe this is the one.\n\nOption D talks about 'metropoles' and 'satellite' countries. I think in dependency theory, metropoles are the developed countries that control and exploit the satellite countries, which are the underdeveloped ones. So, this might be related, but it's phrased differently.\n\nWait a minute, option D says that underdeveloped societies are the 'metropoles' to which 'satellite' countries are attached. Hmm, that seems backwards to what I know about dependency theory. Usually, metropoles are the developed countries, and satellites are the underdeveloped ones.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is incorrect in its wording, or maybe I'm misremembering. Let me double-check.\n\nIn dependency theory, metropoles are the central, developed countries that exploit the peripheral, less developed countries. So, underdeveloped societies would be the satellites, not the metropoles.\n\nTherefore, option D seems wrong.\n\nGoing back to option C, it says underdeveloped societies are economically dependent on wealthy countries that exploit them. That aligns well with dependency theory, which Frank was associated with.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that underdeveloped societies need more involvement in the capitalist economy, which is more in line with modernization theory or neoliberal approaches, not dependency theory.\n\nOption B is about cultural resistance, which isn't directly related to Frank's economic arguments.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is C. Underdeveloped societies were economically dependent on wealthy countries that exploited them.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider again.\n\nIf Frank was arguing that underdeveloped societies were insufficiently involved in the international capitalist economy, that would imply that they need more integration, which isn't typically the dependency theory perspective.\n\nReluctance to surrender traditional ways of life might be a factor, but it's not the core of dependency theory.\n\nEconomic dependence and exploitation are central to dependency theory.\n\nAnd option D seems misstated, as underdeveloped societies are usually considered the satellites, not the metropoles.\n\nTherefore, C is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
