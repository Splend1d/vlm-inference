So, a production possibility frontier, or PPF, is a graph that shows the different combinations of two goods that an economy can produce given its resources and technology. Usually, it's bowed out, meaning it's concave to the origin, but sometimes it can be a straight line. The question is asking when the PPF will be a straight line.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Efficiency is achieved.\n\nWell, efficiency is important in production, but achieving efficiency doesn't necessarily mean the PPF is a straight line. Efficiency just means that the economy is producing at its full potential, without waste. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nB. The goods on the axes are perfect substitutes in consumption.\n\nHmm, perfect substitutes in consumption means that consumers view the two goods as interchangeable, and they don't care which one they get, as long as it satisfies their want. But does that affect the shape of the PPF? I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about how the production of these goods relates to each other.\n\nC. Utility is maximized.\n\nUtility maximization is about consumers getting the most satisfaction from their choices, given their preferences and budget constraints. Again, this seems more related to consumption than to production possibilities. So, probably not the answer.\n\nD. Resources are not specialized.\n\nThis one sounds interesting. If resources are not specialized, that means that the factors of production can be used equally efficiently in producing both goods. In other words, the same resources can be used to produce either good without any loss in efficiency. Maybe that's why the PPF would be a straight line.\n\nLet me think about it differently. When the PPF is bowed out, it's because of increasing opportunity costs. That happens when resources are not equally efficient in producing both goods. For example, some resources are better suited for producing one good over the other. So, as you produce more of one good, you have to use less efficient resources for it, which increases the opportunity cost.\n\nBut if resources are not specialized, meaning they're equally efficient in producing both goods, then the opportunity cost should be constant. That would result in a straight-line PPF.\n\nSo, option D seems to make the most sense.\n\nLet me double-check by eliminating the other options.\n\nOption A: Efficiency is achieved. Efficiency is about producing on the PPF rather than inside it, but it doesn't determine the shape of the PPF.\n\nOption B: Perfect substitutes in consumption. This is about consumer preferences, not about production possibilities.\n\nOption C: Utility is maximized. Again, this is about consumption and consumer satisfaction, not about production.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: resources are not specialized.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
