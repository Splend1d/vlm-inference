The contract provided the following:\"The cost is $2,500 per deck, to be paid upon completion of the decks in each of the eight beach houses. \"On the morning of March 25, the man went to one of the beach houses as the contractor and his assistants were completing the work on the fourth deck. The man said to the contractor, \"I'm very pleased with your progress to date. If you are willing, I would like you to build the same kind of decks on four identical beach houses that I own in a neighboring town, on the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 20. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time. \" The contractor replied, \"Agreed. Let's shake hands on it. \" They shook hands. The contractor completed the work on the beach houses located in the city by April 15 and immediately started the construction of the decks on the four beach houses located in the town. On April 22, a hurricane totally destroyed four of the man's beach houses in the city. In addition, the hurricane demolished a beach house in the town on which the contractor had completed 85 percent of the deck work. Two of the contractor's assistants were seriously injured, and all of his equipment was washed away. The man then received a letter from the contractor, which stated:\"The hurricane destroyed my equipment, worth $4,000. I am dead broke and cannot complete the work on the three remaining beach houses in the town. Please pay me $20,000 for the work I did in the city, and please send me $2,500 for the deck I built on the beach house in the town. \"What is the maximum amount that the contractor may recover from the man for the construction that he completed prior to the hurricane?\n\nA. $10,000. 00\nB. $10,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the completed work on the town beach house.\nC. $20,000. 00\nD. $20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this contract problem. There's a man who owns some beach houses and a contractor who's supposed to build decks on them. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an original contract where the contractor is to build two-level redwood decks on eight specified beach houses in a city. The work was supposed to be completed by May 1, and the cost is $2,500 per deck, paid upon completion of each deck.\n\nThen, on March 25, after completing four decks, the man approaches the contractor and asks him to build similar decks on four more beach houses in a neighboring town, under the same terms and conditions, with work to be completed by May 20, and he'll pay $10,000 at that time.\n\nThey shake hands on it, so it seems like a new agreement for the four additional decks in the neighboring town.\n\nThe contractor finishes the eight decks in the city by April 15 and starts working on the four decks in the town. But on April 22, a hurricane hits, destroying four beach houses in the city and partially destroying one deck in the town (85% completed), injuring two assistants, and washing away all equipment.\n\nAfter the hurricane, the contractor sends a letter asking for $20,000 for the work completed in the city and $2,500 for the deck built on the beach house in the town.\n\nNow, the question is: What is the maximum amount that the contractor may recover from the man for the construction completed prior to the hurricane?\n\nLet's analyze the contracts and the events.\n\nOriginal Contract:\n\n- 8 decks in the city, $2,500 each, paid upon completion.\n\n- Work to be completed by May 1.\n\nAdditional Agreement:\n\n- 4 decks in a neighboring town, same terms and conditions.\n\n- Work to be completed by May 20.\n\n- Payment of $10,000 at that time.\n\nFirst, for the original contract:\n\n- Contractor completed all eight decks in the city by April 15.\n\n- Payment should be upon completion, so $2,500 per deck, totaling $20,000.\n\nBut, the hurricane destroyed four of the beach houses in the city on April 22, after the work was completed.\n\nSo, does the destruction of the houses affect the contractor's right to payment?\n\nGenerally, once work is completed and accepted, the contractor is entitled to payment, regardless of subsequent events unless otherwise specified in the contract.\n\nBut, I need to check if the contract has any clauses regarding destruction or force majeure.\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any such clauses, so I'll assume standard contract principles apply.\n\nTherefore, the contractor should be entitled to the full $20,000 for the eight completed decks in the city.\n\nNow, for the additional agreement for four decks in the neighboring town:\n\n- Payment was to be $10,000 upon completion by May 20.\n\n- Contractor started working and completed 85% of one deck before the hurricane.\n\n- The hurricane destroyed one beach house in the town, but only partially, as 85% of the deck was completed.\n\nSo, what is the contractor entitled to for the work done in the town before the hurricane?\n\nIn contract law, if a contractor has partially completed work and the project is terminated or becomes impossible due to no fault of the contractor, the contractor may be entitled to quantum meruit, which is payment for the value of the work performed.\n\nIn this case, the hurricane is a force majeure event, and it's not the fault of either party.\n\nSo, the contractor may be entitled to payment for the work done on the decks in the town up to the point of the hurricane.\n\nSpecifically, one deck was 85% completed.\n\nAssuming each deck is $2,500 (same as the original contract), then 85% of $2,500 would be $2,125.\n\nAdditionally, if any work was started on the other three decks, the contractor might be entitled to payment for that work as well.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any work on the other three decks beyond starting work on the one deck.\n\nIt says \"immediately started the construction of the decks on the four beach houses located in the town,\" but doesn't specify how much work was done on each.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems only one deck was partially completed.\n\nTherefore, the contractor may be entitled to $2,125 for the partially completed deck in the town.\n\nNow, adding that to the $20,000 for the completed decks in the city, the total would be $22,125.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. $10,000.00\n\nB. $10,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the completed work on the town beach house.\n\nC. $20,000.00\n\nD. $20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house.\n\nOption D seems to match what I've calculated: $20,000 for the completed city decks plus $2,125 for 85% of one town deck.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if the additional agreement for the town decks was a separate contract or an addition to the original contract.\n\nLooking back, they shook hands on it, but it's referred to as \"our existing contract,\" meaning it might be an addition to the original contract.\n\nBut for payment purposes, it's specified as $10,000 at completion by May 20.\n\nSo, perhaps the payment structure is different for the town decks.\n\nMaybe the $10,000 is for all four town decks, instead of $2,500 per deck.\n\nIf that's the case, then the per-deck cost in the town might be different from the city decks.\n\nBut the problem states: \"the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 20. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time.\"\n\nSo, the terms and conditions are the same as the original contract, which was $2,500 per deck, paid upon completion.\n\nBut here, it's $10,000 at completion of the four town decks.\n\nSo, perhaps the payment structure is different for the town decks.\n\nMaybe instead of $2,500 per deck, it's $2,500 times four decks, totaling $10,000, paid upon completion.\n\nTherefore, for the town decks, it's a lump sum of $10,000 for all four decks upon completion.\n\nGiven that, if the contractor has only completed one deck (85% of it), he may be entitled to partial payment proportional to the work done.\n\nSo, if $10,000 is for four decks, that's $2,500 per deck.\n\n85% of one deck would be $2,125.\n\nAssuming no work was done on the other three decks, the contractor would be entitled to $2,125 for the partially completed deck.\n\nAdding that to the $20,000 for the completed city decks, total recovery would be $22,125.\n\nBut the options don't include that exact amount.\n\nOption D is $20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house, which seems to match $20,000 + $2,125 = $22,125.\n\nBut let's verify if there's any reason why the contractor couldn't recover that amount.\n\nPerhaps the contractor's request for $20,000 plus $2,500 for the town deck is\u4e0d\u5408\u7406, since only 85% was completed.\n\nSo, $2,500 for 100% completion, therefore 85% would be $2,125.\n\nTherefore, option D seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the additional agreement for the town decks is separate, and the $10,000 is for all four decks, and since only one deck was partially completed, the contractor may be entitled to proportionate payment.\n\nBut calculating that:\n\nTotal contract value for town decks: $10,000 for four decks.\n\nEach deck is therefore worth $2,500.\n\n85% of one deck is $2,125.\n\nSo, total recovery would be $20,000 (city decks) + $2,125 (partial town deck) = $22,125.\n\nBut options don't include that exact amount, but option D says \"$20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house,\" which seems to align with this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there are any other factors that might limit the contractor's recovery.\n\nFor example, the destruction of the beach houses due to the hurricane might affect the contractor's right to payment.\n\nBut since the work was already completed before the hurricane, the contractor should still be entitled to payment for the work performed, even if the work was destroyed afterward.\n\nIn contract law, payment is for the work done, not for the preservation of the work after completion.\n\nSo, the destruction shouldn't affect the contractor's right to payment for completed work.\n\nTherefore, the maximum recovery should be $20,000 for the city decks plus $2,125 for the partially completed town deck, totaling $22,125.\n\nThus, option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) $20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house."
