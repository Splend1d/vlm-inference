                    "text": "B. by contracting, changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy.\n\nJupiter, being a gas giant, doesn't have a solid surface like Earth. It's mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to the Sun. One of the key ways Jupiter generates internal heat is through a process called \"contraction.\" As Jupiter formed from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust, it shrank in size over time, converting some of its gravitational potential energy into thermal energy.\n\nThis process is different from nuclear fusion, which powers stars like the Sun. While Jupiter's core is extremely hot and dense, it's not hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion. So, option A is not correct in this context.\n\nOption C, internal friction due to its high rotation rate, does play a role in Jupiter's heat generation, but it's not the primary source. Jupiter has a very fast rotation, which causes internal turbulence and friction, contributing to its heat output. However, the main source is still the gravitational contraction.\n\nOption D, chemical processes, isn't a significant factor in Jupiter's heat generation. The planet's atmosphere does have complex chemistry, but these processes don't generate enough heat to account for Jupiter's observed internal heat.\n\nSo, while there are multiple factors contributing to Jupiter's internal heat, the primary mechanism is the contraction of the planet, transforming gravitational potential energy into thermal energy.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- de Pater, I., & Lissauer, J. J. (2015). *Planetary Sciences* (Cambridge Planetary Science). Cambridge University Press.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The book provides a comprehensive overview of planetary sciences, including detailed discussions on the energy sources and internal structures of gas giants like Jupiter.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- Jupiter's rapid rotation causes it to bulge at the equator, which can lead to internal friction and heat generation due to differential rotation layers within the planet.\n\n- The planet's heat flux, which is the rate of heat loss per unit area, is higher than what would be expected from just radiating primordial heat left over from its formation. This suggests that additional processes, like the ones mentioned, contribute to its internal heat budget.\n\n**Further Reading:**\n\n- Guillot, T.
