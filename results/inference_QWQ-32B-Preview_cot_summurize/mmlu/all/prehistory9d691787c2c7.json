The options are:\n\nA. 95,000 BP, at Dolni Vestonice.\n\nB. 77,000 BP, at Blombos Cave.\n\nC. 50,000 BP, at Des Moines, IA.\n\nD. 36,000 BP, at Wharton Hill.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unequivocal evidence for art as symbolic expression\" means. It's asking for the earliest confirmed evidence of art that clearly serves a symbolic purpose, not just functional or decorative.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nOption A: 95,000 BP, at Dolni Vestonice.\n\nDolni Vestonice is a Paleolithic site in the Czech Republic known for its Venus figurines and other artifacts. The Venus figurines are often considered symbolic, representing fertility or mother goddesses. However, the dates for Dolni Vestonice are around 26,000 to 24,000 years ago, which is much younger than 95,000 BP. So, there might be a mistake here with the date.\n\nOption B: 77,000 BP, at Blombos Cave.\n\nBlombos Cave is a South African archaeological site that has yielded some of the oldest evidence of symbolic behavior, including ochre stones with engraved patterns and shell beads. These findings are considered to represent symbolic thinking and possibly early forms of art. 77,000 BP seems plausible for such evidence.\n\nOption C: 50,000 BP, at Des Moines, IA.\n\nDes Moines is in Iowa, USA. I don't recall any significant Paleolithic sites in North America that old. The earliest human presence in North America is generally thought to be around 15,000 to 20,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age, when people crossed the Bering land bridge from Siberia. So, 50,000 BP seems too old for any human activity in Des Moines.\n\nOption D: 36,000 BP, at Wharton Hill.\n\nWharton Hill is a site in New Mexico, USA, known for its Clovis culture artifacts, which date to around 13,000 to 12,800 years ago. Again, 36,000 BP is much older than the established dates for the Clovis culture. There seems to be an inconsistency in the date provided.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B, 77,000 BP at Blombos Cave, seems to be the most accurate choice among the options provided. It aligns with known archaeological findings of symbolic expression at that site.\n\nHowever, I should note that there is ongoing research and debate in the field of archaeology about the earliest evidence of symbolic behavior and art. Some claims push back the dates even further, but in terms of widely accepted evidence, Blombos Cave is one of the earliest sites with clear signs of symbolic activity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
