Toward the end of the first millennium BCE\n\nB. Towards the middle of the first millennium BCE\n\nC. Toward the end of the second millennium BCE\n\nD. Toward the middle of the second millennium BCE\n\nI need to recall when the standard version of the Gilgamesh epic was compiled. I remember that the Old Babylonian version is one of the earliest known versions, and there was a later standard version that was more widely circulated.\n\nI think the standard version was created during the Neo-Assyrian or Neo-Babylonian periods. Let me think about the timelines here. The first millennium BCE starts around 1000 BCE, and the second millennium BCE is before that, ending around 1000 BCE.\n\nI recall that the Neo-Assyrian Empire was around the 10th to 7th centuries BCE, which would be the first millennium BCE. The Neo-Babylonian Empire was around the 7th to 6th centuries BCE, also in the first millennium BCE.\n\nI think the standard version of Gilgamesh was compiled during the Neo-Assyrian period, perhaps around the 7th century BCE. That would be toward the end of the first millennium BCE.\n\nBut let me double-check. I know that the library of Ashurbanipal, which dates to the 7th century BCE, contains tablets of the Gilgamesh epic, and this is considered the standard version.\n\nSo, if Ashurbanipal's library has the standard version around 600 BCE, that would be toward the end of the first millennium BCE.\n\nWait, but the first millennium BCE includes from 1000 BCE to 1 BCE. So, the 7th century BCE is toward the end of the first millennium BCE?\n\nActually, the first millennium BCE starts at 1000 BCE and goes to 1 BCE, so the 7th century BCE is in the middle of the first millennium BCE.\n\nWait, no. The first millennium BCE is from 1000 BCE to 1 BCE, so the 7th century BCE is 700-601 BCE, which is closer to the beginning of the first millennium BCE.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nThe first millennium BCE starts at 1000 BCE and ends at 1 BCE. So, the early first millennium BCE is around 1000-500 BCE, and the late first millennium BCE is around 500-1 BCE.\n\nThe 7th century BCE would be 700-601 BCE, which is in the early first millennium BCE.\n\nBut looking at the options, option A is toward the end of the first millennium BCE, and option C is toward the end of the second millennium BCE.\n\nI think I need to clarify the timeline.\n\nThe second millennium BCE is from 2000-1001 BCE.\n\nThe first millennium BCE is from 1000-1 BCE.\n\nSo, the 7th century BCE is 700-601 BCE, which is in the first millennium BCE, and it's toward the end of the first millennium BCE if we consider that the first millennium BCE ends at 1 BCE.\n\nBut actually, 700-601 BCE is toward the beginning of the first millennium BCE, not the end.\n\nWait, no. The first millennium BCE starts at 1000 BCE and ends at 1 BCE. So, the 7th century BCE is 700-601 BCE, which is closer to the start of the first millennium BCE.\n\nTherefore, if the standard version was compiled in the 7th century BCE, it would be toward the middle of the first millennium BCE, not the end.\n\nWait, but the first millennium BCE is from 1000 to 1 BCE, so the middle would be around 500 BCE.\n\nThe 7th century BCE is from 700-601 BCE, which is closer to the beginning than the end.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is correct: toward the middle of the first millennium BCE.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the standard version was compiled later, in the Neo-Babylonian period, around the 6th century BCE, which would still be in the first millennium BCE.\n\nBut even 600 BCE is still in the first millennium BCE, and it's toward the end of it.\n\nWait, but 600 BCE is still closer to the start of the first millennium BCE than to its end.\n\nThe first millennium BCE ends at 1 BCE, so toward the end would be like 100-1 BCE.\n\nTherefore, 7th or 6th century BCE would be toward the middle of the first millennium BCE.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's any information about when the standard version was compiled.\n\nI recall that the standard version was compiled by Sin-liqe-unninni, who was an Assyrian scribe around the 7th century BCE.\n\nSo, if it was compiled in the 7th century BCE, that would be toward the middle of the first millennium BCE.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option B: toward the middle of the first millennium BCE.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other versions or modifications that occurred later.\n\nI know that the epic continued to be copied and circulated into the Hellenistic period, but the standard version is attributed to Sin-liqe-unninni in the 7th century BCE.\n\nSo, I think option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
