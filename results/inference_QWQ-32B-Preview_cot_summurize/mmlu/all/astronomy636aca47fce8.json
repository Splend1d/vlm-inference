                    "text": "So I've got this question about spectral lines and stars. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I know that spectral lines are like fingerprints of elements. When elements emit light, they do so at specific wavelengths, and these wavelengths can tell us a lot about what's going on with the element and the source of light.\n\nIn this case, we have hydrogen, and there's a specific spectral line for it that's measured in a lab at 486.1 nanometers. That's our reference point. Now, when we look at a star, we see the same hydrogen line, but it's at 485.9 nanometers. So, it's shifted a tiny bit to a shorter wavelength.\n\nI recall that when light sources move towards or away from the observer, there's a phenomenon called Doppler shift that affects the wavelengths we observe. If the source is moving towards us, the wavelengths get shorter, which is called blueshift. If it's moving away, the wavelengths get longer, which is redshift.\n\nIn this case, the observed wavelength is 485.9 nm, which is shorter than the lab measurement of 486.1 nm. So, it's blueshifted. That should mean the star is moving towards us.\n\nWait, but the question is about what we can conclude from this observation. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The star is getting hotter.\n\nB. The star is getting colder.\n\nC. The star is moving toward us.\n\nD. The star is moving away from us.\n\nSo, based on the Doppler shift interpretation, it seems like C is the correct answer. The star is moving towards us.\n\nBut just to make sure, I should consider if there are other factors that could cause a shift in the spectral line. For example, temperature changes in the star could affect the spectral lines, but I think the Doppler shift is the primary effect here, especially since the question is about movement.\n\nAlso, I should remember that the Doppler shift is relative to the motion along the line of sight. So, if the star is moving towards us, we see the lines shifted towards the blue end of the spectrum.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer should be C. The star is moving toward us.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
