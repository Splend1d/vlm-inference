                    "text": "Let's see which of these animals has the longest lifespan. I have a gorilla, a blue whale, a dog, and a queen honey bee to compare.\n\nFirst, I know that gorillas can live quite a long time. In the wild, they might live around 35 to 40 years, but in captivity, they can live longer, maybe up to 50 or more years. So, that's a good starting point.\n\nNext, blue whales\u2014are they the largest animals on the planet? I think so. I've heard that they can live a long time too, possibly over 80 years. But I'm not entirely sure about that figure.\n\nThen there's the dog. Now, dogs vary a lot in lifespan depending on the breed. Some small dogs can live up to 15 or even 20 years, while larger breeds might not live as long, maybe 10 to 12 years. So, on average, maybe around 12 to 15 years.\n\nLastly, the queen honey bee. I think queen bees can live for several years, maybe up to 5 or 6 years, but I'm not positive about that.\n\nComparing these, it seems like the blue whale might have the longest lifespan, possibly over 80 years, followed by the gorilla at around 50 years, then the dog at about 12 to 15 years, and finally the queen honey bee at around 5 to 6 years.\n\nBut I should double-check these figures to be sure.\n\nStarting with the gorilla: in the wild, their lifespan is typically 35 to 40 years, but in captivity, they can live into their 50s. So, 50 years is a reasonable estimate for the maximum lifespan of a gorilla.\n\nBlue whales: I've read that their lifespan is estimated to be between 80 and 90 years, though some sources suggest they could live up to 100 years or more. So, definitely longer than gorillas.\n\nDogs: As I mentioned, their lifespan varies by breed. Smaller dogs often live longer than larger dogs. For example, a Chihuahua might live up to 20 years, while a Great Dane might only live 8 to 10 years. So, on average, maybe 12 to 15 years, but it can range widely.\n\nQueen honey bees: They usually live for about 2 to 5 years, sometimes up to 7 years. So, compared to the other options, that's relatively short.\n\nTherefore, among the options given\u2014gorilla, blue whale, dog, and queen honey bee\u2014the blue whale has the longest lifespan.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any exceptions or if I'm missing something. For example, are there any dogs that live longer than 20 years? While rare, there are reports of dogs living into their 20s, but that's still shorter than the lifespan of a blue whale.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if the lifespan of blue whales is indeed over 80 years. After a quick search, it seems that blue whales can live up to 70 to 90 years, with some estimates suggesting even longer. So, yes, that's consistent with what I initially thought.\n\nGorillas, as I recall, have a lifespan in the wild of around 35 to 40 years, but in captivity, they can live into their 50s or even early 60s in some cases.\n\nQueen honey bees typically don't live more than a few years, so they have the shortest lifespan among these options.\n\nTherefore, the animal with the longest lifespan among the choices is the blue whale.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
