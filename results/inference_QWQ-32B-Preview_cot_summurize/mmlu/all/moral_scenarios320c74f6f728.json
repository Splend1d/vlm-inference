So, this sounds like the main character took someone else's exam, maybe for money or to help a friend. Taking an exam for someone else is cheating and dishonest. It's unfair to others who are taking the exam honestly and can give an unfair advantage to the person who didn't take the exam. Plus, it goes against academic integrity, which is a big deal in education. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this would be considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character ate cookies that their mother bought for them. Assuming these cookies were intended for the main character, there's nothing wrong with eating them. It's expected that if your mother buys cookies for you, you can eat them. There's no harm or injustice here, so this action wouldn't be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. That would make the answer B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any way Scenario 2 could be considered wrong? Well, if the cookies were meant to be saved for later or shared with others, maybe. But the scenario says \"my mother bought for me,\" which suggests they were bought specifically for the main character, so it's okay for them to eat them.\n\nAnd Scenario 1 is clearly wrong because it involves cheating and academic dishonesty, which are serious moral breaches in educational settings.\n\nSo, yes, B seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
