So, there's a cab driver who picks up a passenger who turns out to be his former girlfriend and an undercover police officer working in the sex crimes unit. They go to her house, and things get a bit intimate\u2014kissing and holding hands. The cab driver is about to kiss her again when she goes to answer the phone. Then, he's arrested for attempted rape. Yikes, that's a tricky situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what attempted rape means legally. Attempted rape is when someone intends to commit rape but doesn't complete it. So, in this case, the cab driver was making sexual advances, and they were kissing, but no actual rape occurred because she went to answer the phone.\n\nOption A says \"not guilty.\" That could be possible if there was no intent to rape or if it was consensual. But they were kissing and holding hands, which seems consensual, but then he was about to kiss her again. Maybe he didn't intend to rape her, but the officer might think otherwise.\n\nOption B says \"not guilty, solely because he was entrapped.\" Entrapment is when the police induce someone to commit a crime they wouldn't have otherwise committed. Here, the officer is undercover and engaged in consensual activities like kissing and holding hands. But did she induce him to attempt rape? That seems extreme. Maybe he was predisposed to it, given his past relationship, but it's unclear.\n\nOption C says \"not guilty, if he raises the proper alibi defense.\" An alibi defense is when you prove you were somewhere else when the crime happened. But in this case, he was clearly at her house. So, that doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nOption D says \"not guilty, if he was predisposed to commit the crime.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. If he was predisposed, that might indicate he was likely to commit the crime anyway, which could negate entrapment. But in this case, if he was predisposed, it might not be entrapment, but that doesn't necessarily make him not guilty of attempted rape.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think differently. Was there actually an attempt to rape her? They were kissing, which can be consensual, but perhaps his advances crossed the line into non-consensual behavior. But according to the scenario, she was kissing him back and holding his hand. So, it seems like consent was present up to that point.\n\nMaybe the issue is that he was about to kiss her again when she went to answer the phone. Did he intend to force himself on her? There's no indication of that in the scenario. It just says he was about to kiss her again, and she got up to answer the phone.\n\nPerhaps the officer interpreted his actions as an attempt to rape her, but based on the information given, it seems more like a consensual interaction. So, maybe he should be found not guilty because there was no attempt to rape, just consensual kissing and holding hands.\n\nBut option A is \"not guilty,\" and option B is \"not guilty, solely because he was entrapped.\" Entrapment might be a factor if the officer induced him to attempt rape, but again, it doesn't seem like she did anything to induce that. They were engaging in consensual activities, and he was about to kiss her again.\n\nMaybe option A is the best answer\u2014not guilty because there was no attempt to rape, just consensual activities.\n\nOption C doesn't make sense because an alibi defense wouldn't apply here since he was present at the scene.\n\nOption D is confusing because being predisposed might relate to entrapment, but it doesn't directly relate to guilt or innocence in this context.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Not guilty, because there was no attempt to rape; it was a consensual interaction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
