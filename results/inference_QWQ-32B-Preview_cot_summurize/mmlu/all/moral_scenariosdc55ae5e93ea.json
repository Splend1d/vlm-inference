                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I taught my children to play with matches.\n\n2. I deleted some raunchy photos of my sister from Facebook.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Teaching children to play with matches.\n\nWell, matches are dangerous. They can cause fires, which can be very harmful or even deadly. As a parent, it's important to teach children about safety and to avoid behaviors that could lead to accidents or harm. So, teaching kids to play with matches seems like a bad idea. It could be seen as negligent or irresponsible because you're encouraging behavior that has a high risk of causing injury or damage.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Deleting raunchy photos of my sister from Facebook.\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. First, raunchy photos could be interpreted as inappropriate or sexually suggestive images. If these photos were posted on Facebook without your sister's consent or knowledge, that would be a serious invasion of her privacy and could be considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, it's you deleting the photos, not posting them. So, if the photos were there without her knowledge or consent, deleting them could be seen as a positive action to protect her reputation and privacy.\n\nBut, maybe she posted them herself. If that's the case, deleting them without her consent could be interfering with her choices and potentially violating her rights to control her own content.\n\nWait, but it's your sister, so maybe you have a closer relationship, and there might be family dynamics at play.\n\nIn general, though, respecting someone's autonomy and their choices is important. If your sister posted the photos herself, even if you disagree with her choices, it might not be morally justifiable to delete them without her consent.\n\nOn the other hand, if the photos were posted without her knowledge or consent, deleting them could be seen as the right thing to do to protect her.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify whether she posted them or someone else did. It just says \"some raunchy photos of my sister from Facebook.\"\n\nGiven that, it's a bit ambiguous. But perhaps, in the context of ordinary moral standards, interfering with someone's online presence without their consent is generally considered wrong, unless it's to prevent harm.\n\nHmm.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, teaching children to play with matches seems clearly risky and potentially harmful, so that would likely be considered morally wrong.\n\nAs for deleting the photos, it's more nuanced. Without knowing the context, it's harder to judge. If the photos were posted without her consent, deleting them might be the right thing to do. But if she posted them herself, deleting them without her consent could be wrong.\n\nGiven that, maybe the first scenario is clearly wrong, and the second one is not clearly wrong without more information.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that Option B makes sense: the first scenario is wrong, and the second one is not clearly wrong, at least not without more information.\n\nBut wait, maybe according to ordinary moral standards, both could be seen as wrong in different ways.\n\nTeaching children to play with matches is wrong because it's dangerous and irresponsible.\n\nDeleting your sister's photos from Facebook without her consent is wrong because it interferes with her autonomy and rights over her own content.\n\nSo, perhaps both are wrong, making Option A the correct choice.\n\nBut, I'm a bit unsure about the second scenario because it depends on the context. If the photos were posted without her knowledge, deleting them might be the right thing to do.\n\nHowever, the scenario says \"some raunchy photos of my sister from Facebook,\" which might imply that they are embarrassing or inappropriate, but it doesn't specify whether she posted them or someone else did.\n\nGiven that ambiguity, perhaps the safest assumption is that deleting them without her consent is wrong, as it interferes with her rights.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios could be considered wrong, making Option A the answer.\n\nBut I'm still a bit uncertain about the second scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first scenario is clearly wrong, and the second one is more debatable, making Option B more appropriate.\n\nI need to consider what ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 would likely consider.\n\nTeaching children to play with matches: This seems clearly wrong because it endangers children and goes against safety norms.\n\nDeleting your sister's photos from Facebook: This interferes with her digital property and could be seen as a violation of her rights, even if the photos are embarrassing.\n\nSo, both actions could be considered morally wrong for different reasons.\n\nTherefore, Option A might be the correct answer.\n\nBut the question is about ordinary moral standards, and perhaps in some contexts, deleting embarrassing photos of someone you care about could be seen as protective, even if it's without consent.\n\nHowever, in general, respecting someone's autonomy and consent is important, so deleting their photos without permission would likely be considered wrong.\n\nThus, both scenarios could be seen as morally wrong, making Option A the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
