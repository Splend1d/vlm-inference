The options are:\n\nA. general purpose map.\n\nB. thematic map.\n\nC. reference map.\n\nD. mental map.\n\nHmm, let's see. I think I remember that thematic maps are used to display specific data or information about a particular theme or topic. So, if it's presenting a single class of statistics, that sounds like a thematic map.\n\nWait, what's a general purpose map? I think that's more like a basic map that shows geographic features like roads, cities, and bodies of water, without focusing on any specific data. So, that probably isn't it.\n\nA reference map is similar, right? It's meant to provide geographic references like boundaries, places, and physical features. Not really about statistics.\n\nAnd a mental map is more like a cognitive map that people have in their minds based on their experiences and knowledge of an area. That doesn't involve statistics at all.\n\nSo, going back, thematic maps are designed to illustrate specific data or information, like population density, climate data, election results\u2014things like that. That sounds exactly like presenting a single class of statistics.\n\nLet me make sure. Is there any other type of map that could fit this description? Well, general purpose and reference maps are more about providing a general geographic overview, not about displaying statistics. Mental maps are more about personal perception and aren't really maps in the traditional sense.\n\nTherefore, the best answer should be B. thematic map.\n\nI'm pretty confident about that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
