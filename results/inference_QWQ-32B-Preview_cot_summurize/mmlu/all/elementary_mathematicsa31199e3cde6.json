                    "text": "So I've got this question about sampling for a survey at a shopping mall. The goal is to find out which method would give the most representative sample of the people who shop there. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Conducting the survey at one shoe store.\n\nB. Conducting the survey at all shoe stores.\n\nC. Conducting the survey at the entrance to the mall.\n\nD. Conducting the survey a mile away from the mall.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a representative sample means. It's about getting a group that reflects the diversity of the entire shopping mall's visitors. So, it should include people of different ages, interests, shopping purposes, and so on.\n\nOption A is surveying at one shoe store. That seems pretty limited. People who visit a single shoe store probably have similar interests or needs, like maybe they're all into athletic shoes or formal wear. That wouldn't represent the whole mall population, which includes people shopping for clothes, electronics, food, and more.\n\nOption B is surveying at all shoe stores. That's better because it covers more people across different shoe stores, but still, it's only focusing on shoppers who are interested in shoes. There are plenty of other shoppers in the mall who don't go to shoe stores, so this still isn't fully representative.\n\nOption C is surveying at the entrance to the mall. This seems promising because it's likely to catch a broad cross-section of shoppers as they arrive. Assuming that the entrance is where most people come in, this could potentially capture a diverse group of people heading to different stores for various purposes.\n\nOption D is surveying a mile away from the mall. That seems way off. People a mile away might not even be going to the mall; they could be going elsewhere. This doesn't seem relevant to the mall's shopping population at all.\n\nComparing these options, conducting the survey at the entrance to the mall (Option C) seems like it would give the most representative sample. It's more likely to include a diverse range of shoppers compared to focusing on just shoe stores or surveying people far away from the mall.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something I'm missing. Is there a chance that not all shoppers pass through the main entrance? Perhaps there are multiple entrances, and maybe some people enter through parking garages or other access points. If that's the case, surveying only at one entrance might still bias the sample.\n\nHowever, assuming that the mall has a main entrance where the majority of shoppers pass through, Option C still seems like the best choice among the given options.\n\nOption A and B are both limited to shoe stores, which is a specific subset of the mall's offerings. Option D is entirely outside the mall's influence, surveying people who may not even be shoppers there.\n\nTherefore, the most representative sample would probably be obtained by conducting the survey at the entrance to the mall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
