                    "text": "To determine how many distinct diagonals can be drawn in a convex hexagon, we can use a general formula for finding the number of diagonals in any convex polygon. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{n(n - 3)}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of sides (or vertices) of the polygon.\n\nIn the case of a hexagon, \\( n = 6 \\). Plugging this value into the formula gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{6(6 - 3)}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 3}{2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct diagonals that can be drawn in a convex hexagon is 9.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it by considering that each vertex connects to every other vertex except itself and its two adjacent vertices. So, for each vertex, there are \\( n - 3 \\) diagonals. Since there are \\( n \\) vertices, this would initially suggest \\( n(n - 3) \\) diagonals. However, this counts each diagonal twice (once from each end), so we must divide by 2 to get the correct number of unique diagonals.\n\nFor a hexagon:\n\n- Each vertex connects to 3 other vertices with diagonals (since it can't connect to itself and its two adjacent vertices).\n\n- With 6 vertices, this would be \\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\) endpoints.\n\n- Since each diagonal has two endpoints, the total number of unique diagonals is \\( \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\).\n\nAnother way to visualize this is to list out all possible connections between vertices and exclude the sides of the hexagon.\n\nA convex hexagon has vertices labeled, say, A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nThe sides are AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA.\n\nThe diagonals would be:\n\n- From A: AC, AD, AE\n\n- From B: BD, BE, BF\n\n- From C: CE, CF, CA (but CA is already counted as AC)\n\n- From D: DF, DA (DA is AD), DB (DB is BD)\n\n- From E: EA (EA is AE), EB (EB is BE), EC (EC is CE)\n\n- From F: FA (FA is already a side), FB (FB is BF), FC (FC is CF)\n\nSo, listing unique diagonals: AC, AD, AE, BD, BE, BF, CE, CF, and DE.\n\nCounting these, we have 9 distinct diagonals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
