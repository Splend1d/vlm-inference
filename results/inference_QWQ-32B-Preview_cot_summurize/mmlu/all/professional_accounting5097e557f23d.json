The options are variable sampling, discovery sampling, attribute sampling, and random-number sampling. I think I need to understand what each of these methods is used for to pick the right one.\n\nFirst, variable sampling sounds like it's used when you're dealing with numerical data, like dollar amounts. So, if an auditor wants to estimate the dollar value of inventory, this might be the right choice. Variable sampling helps in estimating the total value of a population based on a sample, and it can also detect if there are material misstatements in the financial statements related to that value.\n\nDiscovery sampling, on the other hand, seems more about finding out if a particular condition exists in the population. It's often used when the auditor is looking for specific instances of errors or irregularities, not necessarily to estimate a total value. So, this might not be the best fit for estimating inventory value.\n\nAttribute sampling is typically used when the auditor is interested in estimating the rate of occurrence of a particular attribute in the population, like the rate of errors in a process. It's more about qualities or characteristics rather than quantitative measurements. Therefore, it doesn't seem directly applicable to estimating the dollar value of inventory.\n\nRandom-number sampling is a method of selecting a sample where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, based on random numbers. This is a general sampling technique that can be used in various types of sampling, including attribute and variable sampling. So, it's more of a selection method rather than a specific type of audit sampling for estimation purposes.\n\nGiven these explanations, it seems like variable sampling is the most appropriate method for estimating the dollar value of inventory because it deals directly with numerical measurements and estimating totals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
