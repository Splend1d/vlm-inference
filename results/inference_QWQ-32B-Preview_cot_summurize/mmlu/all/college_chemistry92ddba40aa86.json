                    "text": "To determine which 0.1 M aqueous solution has the lowest pH among the given options, we need to consider the nature of the salts and how they affect the pH of the solution. The salts provided are Na2CO3, Na3PO4, Na2S, and NaCl. These are all salts of strong bases (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) and weak acids (carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrochloric acid, respectively).\n\nFirst, let's recall that the pH of a solution is a measure of its acidity or basicity. A lower pH indicates a more acidic solution, while a higher pH indicates a more basic solution. Since all the salts are sodium salts, they will dissociate completely in water, producing Na+ ions and the respective anions: CO3^2-, PO4^3-, S^2-, and Cl-.\n\nNow, let's analyze each salt one by one:\n\nA. Na2CO3 (Sodium carbonate):\n\nCarbonate ions (CO3^2-) are the conjugate base of a weak acid (carbonic acid, H2CO3). Therefore, in water, they will hydrolyze to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nCO3^2- + H2O \u21cc HCO3- + OH-\n\nB. Na3PO4 (Sodium phosphate):\n\nPhosphate ions (PO4^3-) are the conjugate base of a weak acid (phosphoric acid, H3PO4). They will also hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nPO4^3- + H2O \u21cc HPO4^2- + OH-\n\nC. Na2S (Sodium sulfide):\n\nSulfide ions (S^2-) are the conjugate base of a weak acid (hydrogen sulfide, H2S). They will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nS^2- + H2O \u21cc HS- + OH-\n\nD. NaCl (Sodium chloride):\n\nChloride ions (Cl-) are the conjugate base of a strong acid (hydrochloric acid, HCl). Since HCl is a strong acid, Cl- will not hydrolyze in water to any significant extent. Therefore, the solution will be neutral, with a pH of approximately 7.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that options A, B, and C will produce basic solutions, while option D will produce a neutral solution. Since we are asked to find the solution with the lowest pH, we need to identify which of the basic solutions is the least basic, as a less basic solution would have a higher pH compared to more basic solutions.\n\nTo compare the basicity of the solutions from A, B, and C, we need to look at the strength of the conjugate acids of their respective anions. The weaker the conjugate acid, the stronger the base, and thus the more basic the solution.\n\nLet's consider the conjugate acids:\n\n- For CO3^2-: H2CO3 (carbonic acid)\n\n- For PO4^3-: H3PO4 (phosphoric acid)\n\n- For S^2-: H2S (hydrogen sulfide)\n\nNow, let's compare the acidity of these conjugate acids:\n\n- Carbonic acid (H2CO3) is a weak acid with Ka1 = 4.3 \u00d7 10^-7 and Ka2 = 5.6 \u00d7 10^-11.\n\n- Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is also a weak acid with Ka1 = 7.5 \u00d7 10^-3, Ka2 = 6.2 \u00d7 10^-8, and Ka3 = 4.2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n- Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a weak acid with Ka1 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-7 and Ka2 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-19.\n\nFrom these Ka values, we can see that phosphoric acid is the strongest acid among the three, followed by carbonic acid, and then hydrogen sulfide.\n\nSince the conjugate base's strength is inversely related to the acidity of its conjugate acid, the order of basicity of the anions will be:\n\nS^2- > CO3^2- > PO4^3-\n\nWait, this seems counterintuitive at first glance because hydrogen sulfide is a weaker acid than carbonic acid, which in turn is weaker than phosphoric acid. However, the basicity of the conjugate base increases as the acidity of the conjugate acid decreases. Therefore, the correct order of basicity should be:\n\nS^2- (from H2S, weakest acid) > CO3^2- (from H2CO3, stronger acid) > PO4^3- (from H3PO4, strongest acid)\n\nWait, no. Actually, the basicity of the conjugate base decreases as the acidity of the conjugate acid increases. So, the correct order is:\n\nPO4^3- < CO3^2- < S^2-\n\nMeaning, S^2- is the strongest base, followed by CO3^2-, and then PO4^3- is the weakest base among the three.\n\nTherefore, the solution with Na2S will be the most basic, followed by Na2CO3, and then Na3PO4 will be the least basic among the three.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the weaker the acid, the stronger the base. So, since H2S is a weaker acid than H2CO3, which is weaker than H3PO4, their conjugate bases should follow:\n\nS^2- (strongest base) > CO3^2- (medium base) > PO4^3- (weakest base)\n\nBut actually, phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid, and its conjugate base PO4^3- is less basic than CO3^2- and S^2-. So, perhaps my initial assessment is incorrect.\n\nLet me check the Ka values again:\n\n- H2CO3: Ka1 = 4.3 \u00d7 10^-7, Ka2 = 5.6 \u00d7 10^-11\n\n- H3PO4: Ka1 = 7.5 \u00d7 10^-3, Ka2 = 6.2 \u00d7 10^-8, Ka3 = 4.2 \u00d7 10^-13\n\n- H2S: Ka1 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-7, Ka2 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-19\n\nComparing Ka1 values:\n\nH3PO4 (7.5 \u00d7 10^-3) > H2CO3 (4.3 \u00d7 10^-7) > H2S (1.0 \u00d7 10^-7)\n\nSo, H3PO4 is the strongest acid, followed by H2CO3, and then H2S is the weakest acid.\n\nTherefore, their conjugate bases' strengths would be:\n\nS^2- (strongest base) > CO3^2- > PO4^3- (weakest base)\n\nSo, S^2- is the strongest base, meaning that Na2S will produce the most basic solution, followed by Na2CO3, and then Na3PO4 will be the least basic.\n\nWait, but this seems contradictory to the general understanding. Perhaps I need to consider the multi-step hydrolysis for polyprotic acids.\n\nFor PO4^3-, since it's the conjugate base of H3PO4, a triprotic acid, its hydrolysis would be:\n\nPO4^3- + H2O \u21cc HPO4^2- + OH-\n\nHPO4^2- + H2O \u21cc H2PO4^- + OH-\n\nH2PO4^- + H2O \u21cc H3PO4 + OH-\n\nBut the first step is the most significant, and since H3PO4 is a relatively strong acid, PO4^3- is a moderate base.\n\nSimilarly, CO3^2- is the conjugate base of H2CO3, a diprotic acid:\n\nCO3^2- + H2O \u21cc HCO3^- + OH-\n\nHCO3^- + H2O \u21cc H2CO3 + OH-\n\nAgain, the first step is most significant.\n\nS^2- is the conjugate base of H2S:\n\nS^2- + H2O \u21cc HS^- + OH-\n\nHS^- + H2O \u21cc H2S + OH-\n\nGiven that H2S is a weaker acid than H2CO3, which is weaker than H3PO4, their conjugate bases should follow the order of increasing basicity.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look up the Kb values for these anions to compare their basicity more directly.\n\nThe Kb for the anion can be calculated using the relationship:\n\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\nWhere Ka is the acid dissociation constant of the conjugate acid.\n\nWait, more precisely, for the general case of a conjugate base An^-:\n\nKb = Kw / Ka_of_HAn\n\nBut for polyprotic acids, it's a bit more complex, as each step has its own Ka.\n\nFor simplicity, let's consider the major hydrolysis step for each anion.\n\nFor CO3^2-:\n\nThe first hydrolysis step is:\n\nCO3^2- + H2O \u21cc HCO3^- + OH-\n\nThe Kb for this step is Kb1 = Kw / Ka2_of_H2CO3\n\nGiven Ka2_of_H2CO3 = 5.6 \u00d7 10^-11\n\nSo, Kb1 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 / 5.6 \u00d7 10^-11 = 1.79 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nFor PO4^3-:\n\nThe first hydrolysis step is:\n\nPO4^3- + H2O \u21cc HPO4^2- + OH-\n\nThe Kb for this step is Kb1 = Kw / Ka3_of_H3PO4\n\nGiven Ka3_of_H3PO4 = 4.2 \u00d7 10^-13\n\nSo, Kb1 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 / 4.2 \u00d7 10^-13 = 2.38 \u00d7 10^-2\n\nFor S^2-:\n\nThe first hydrolysis step is:\n\nS^2- + H2O \u21cc HS^- + OH-\n\nThe Kb for this step is Kb1 = Kw / Ka2_of_H2S\n\nGiven Ka2_of_H2S = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-19\n\nSo, Kb1 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 / 1.0 \u00d7 10^-19 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^5\n\nWait, this seems off. Kb values are usually less than 1 for weak bases. Perhaps I misidentified the Ka values.\n\nWait, Ka2 for H2S is indeed 1.0 \u00d7 10^-19, which is extremely small, meaning that HS^- is a very weak acid, and therefore S^2- is a very strong base.\n\nSimilarly, for CO3^2-, Kb1 = 1.79 \u00d7 10^-4, which is larger than that of PO4^3- (2.38 \u00d7 10^-2), indicating that PO4^3- is a stronger base than CO3^2-.\n\nWait, but Kb = 2.38 \u00d7 10^-2 for PO4^3- seems unusually high for a polyprotic acid's conjugate base.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that PO4^3- can undergo multiple steps of hydrolysis, and the overall basicity might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the major species in solution and their respective Kb values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look up the pH of these solutions directly or find a reliable source for their relative basicities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that among these salts, NaCl is the only one that does not hydrolyze, producing a neutral solution, while the others produce basic solutions.\n\nTherefore, comparing the basicity of the solutions from A, B, and C, the one with the lowest pH would be the least basic, which is Na3PO4, followed by Na2CO3, and then Na2S being the most basic.\n\nTherefore, the order of pH from lowest to highest would be:\n\nNaCl (neutral, pH=7) < Na3PO4 (basic, but least basic) < Na2CO3 (more basic) < Na2S (most basic)\n\nTherefore, the solution with the lowest pH is NaCl.\n\nBut wait, the question is to choose among A, B, C, D, which have the lowest pH.\n\nGiven that NaCl has a pH of 7, which is neutral, and the other solutions are basic, having pH > 7, therefore, NaCl has the lowest pH among the options.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. NaCl.\n\nHowever, I feel like there might be some confusion here regarding the relative basicity of the anions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH for each solution to compare them quantitatively.\n\nLet's attempt that.\n\nFirst, for NaCl:\n\nNaCl dissociates into Na+ and Cl-.\n\nNa+ does not hydrolyze, and Cl- does not hydrolyze because it is the conjugate base of a strong acid (HCl).\n\nTherefore, the solution remains neutral, pH = 7.\n\nNext, for Na2CO3:\n\nCO3^2- hydrolyzes as follows:\n\nCO3^2- + H2O \u21cc HCO3^- + OH-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction is Kb = Kw / Ka2_of_H2CO3 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 / 5.6 \u00d7 10^-11 = 1.79 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the concentration of CO3^2- is 0.1 M (since it's a 0.1 M solution of Na2CO3).\n\nLet x be the concentration of HCO3^- and OH- at equilibrium.\n\nThen, Kb = [HCO3^-][OH-] / [CO3^2-] = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.1, then Kb \u2248 x^2 / 0.1\n\nSo, x^2 = Kb \u00d7 0.1 = 1.79 \u00d7 10^-4 \u00d7 0.1 = 1.79 \u00d7 10^-5\n\nThus, x = sqrt(1.79 \u00d7 10^-5) \u2248 4.23 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nTherefore, [OH-] \u2248 4.23 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\npOH = -log[OH-] \u2248 2.37\n\npH = 14 - pOH \u2248 11.63\n\nNext, for Na3PO4:\n\nPO4^3- hydrolyzes as follows:\n\nPO4^3- + H2O \u21cc HPO4^2- + OH-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction is Kb = Kw / Ka3_of_H3PO4 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 / 4.2 \u00d7 10^-13 = 2.38 \u00d7 10^-2\n\nAgain, assuming the concentration of PO4^3- is 0.1 M.\n\nLet x be the concentration of HPO4^2- and OH- at equilibrium.\n\nThen, Kb = [HPO4^2-][OH-] / [PO4^3-] = x^2 / (0.1 - x)\n\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.1, then Kb \u2248 x^2 / 0.1\n\nSo, x^2 = Kb \u00d7 0.1 = 2.38 \u00d7 10^-2 \u00d7 0.1 = 2.38 \u00d7 10^-3\n\nThus, x = sqrt(2.38 \u00d7 10^-3) \u2248 0.0488 M\n\nTherefore, [OH-] \u2248 0.0488 M\n\npOH = -log[OH-] \u2248 1.31\n\npH = 14 - pOH \u2248 12.69\n\nWait, this suggests that Na3PO4 has a higher pH than Na2CO3, which contradicts my earlier assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the Kb value for PO4^3-.\n\nKb = Kw / Ka3_of_H3PO4 = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 / 4.2 \u00d7 10^-13 = 0.0238\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, x^2 = 0.0238 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.00238\n\nx = sqrt(0.00238) \u2248 0.0488 M\n\npOH = -log(0.0488) \u2248 1.31\n\npH = 14 - 1.31 = 12.69\n\nSimilarly, for Na2CO3:\n\nKb = 1.79 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nx^2 = 1.79 \u00d7 10^-4 \u00d7 0.1 = 1.79 \u00d7 10^-5\n\nx = sqrt(1.79 \u00d7 10^-5) \u2248 4.23 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\npOH = 2.37\n\npH = 11.63\n\nTherefore, Na3PO4 has a higher pH (12.69) compared to Na2CO3 (11.63), meaning Na3PO4 is more basic.\n\nWait, but according to the Kb values, PO4^3- has a larger Kb (0.0238) compared to CO3^2- (0.000179), indicating that PO4^3- is a stronger base, which should result in a more basic solution, i.e., higher pH.\n\nBut according to the calculations, Na3PO4 has a higher pH (12.69) than Na2CO3 (11.63), which aligns with PO4^3- being a stronger base.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that a stronger base would produce a more basic solution, which would have a higher pH.\n\nBut in reality, a stronger base would produce more OH-, leading to a higher pH.\n\nSo, in this case, Na3PO4 should have a higher pH than Na2CO3, which is consistent with the calculations.\n\nWait, but in my initial reasoning, I thought that Na3PO"
