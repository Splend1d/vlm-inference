                    "text": "In the force-voltage analogy, also known as the mechanical-electrical analogy, we map mechanical elements to electrical elements to analyze and understand the behavior of mechanical systems using electrical circuit theory. One common analogy is between mechanical translational systems and electrical circuits.\n\nIn this analogy:\n\n- Force (F) is analogous to voltage (V).\n\n- Velocity (V) is analogous to current (I).\n\n- Mass (M) is analogous to inductance (L).\n\n- Damping coefficient (C) is analogous to resistance (R).\n\n- Spring constant (K) is analogous to the reciprocal of capacitance (1/C).\n\nLet's see why this is the case.\n\nFirst, consider Hooke's Law for a spring:\n\nF = Kx\n\nwhere F is the force applied to the spring, K is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nIn the force-voltage analogy, force (F) is analogous to voltage (V), and displacement (x) is analogous to charge (Q). Therefore, we can write:\n\nV = (K/Q) * Q\n\nThis seems a bit circular, but let's think differently. In electrical circuits, the relationship between voltage and charge on a capacitor is:\n\nV = Q/C\n\nwhere C is the capacitance.\n\nComparing this with Hooke's Law:\n\nF = Kx\n\nWe can see that F corresponds to V, and x corresponds to Q. Therefore, K corresponds to 1/C.\n\nAlternatively, consider the mechanical impedance of a spring. The impedance of a spring is given by:\n\nZ_spring = K/s\n\nwhere s is the Laplace variable.\n\nIn electrical circuits, the impedance of a capacitor is:\n\nZ_capacitor = 1/(sC)\n\nAgain, we see that K corresponds to 1/C.\n\nTherefore, in the force-voltage analogy, the spring constant K is analogous to 1/C, where C is the capacitance.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1/C\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
