                    "text": "So here's this scenario: A driver and a passenger are heading to work, driving at 20 mph, which is within the speed limit. Suddenly, the passenger points out an overturned car on the side of the highway and says, \"Look at that car upside down.\" The driver looks over to see what's happening, but in doing so, fails to notice an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire about 200 feet ahead. Before he can react, he crashes into the rear of the abandoned car and gets injured.\n\nNow, the jurisdiction has a comparative negligence statute in effect. The driver is considering suing the owner of the abandoned car. We need to figure out what's likely to happen in this situation. The options are:\n\nA. The driver recovers all of his damages because the defendant created a dangerous condition.\n\nB. The driver recovers only a portion of the damages because the abandoned auto was in plain view.\n\nC. The driver recovers nothing because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.\n\nD. The driver recovers nothing because the passenger's act was a supervening cause.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what's comparative negligence? It's a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to recover damages even if they are partially at fault for the accident. The damages are reduced by the percentage of their fault. So, if the plaintiff is 30% at fault, they can still recover 70% of the damages.\n\nNow, in this case, the driver is claiming against the owner of the abandoned car. The abandoned car is in the highway with a flat tire, which presumably shouldn't be there. So, the owner might be liable for leaving the car in a hazardous position.\n\nBut the driver was also distracted by looking at the overturned car on the side of the road, thanks to the passenger pointing it out. So, the driver wasn't paying full attention to the road ahead.\n\nOption A says the driver recovers all damages because the defendant created a dangerous condition. Well, the abandoned car certainly is a dangerous condition, but the driver was also negligent by not paying attention. So, pure liability might not hold here because of the driver's own negligence.\n\nOption B suggests the driver recovers only a portion of the damages because the abandoned auto was in plain view. This seems plausible. If the abandoned car was visible and the driver should have seen it but didn't because he was distracted, then the driver shares some fault. So, comparative negligence would apply, and the damages would be reduced based on the driver's percentage of fault.\n\nOption C says the driver recovers nothing because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. The \"last clear chance\" doctrine is a bit tricky. It generally allows the plaintiff to recover if they can show that the defendant had the last opportunity to avoid the accident. But in this case, the driver had the opportunity to see the abandoned car and avoid it, but didn't because he was looking elsewhere. So, it might apply here, meaning the driver can't recover anything.\n\nOption D says the driver recovers nothing because the passenger's act was a supervening cause. A supervening cause is an event that occurs after the defendant's action and contributes to the harm. Here, the passenger pointing out the overturned car might be considered a supervening cause. However, in many jurisdictions, voluntary actions by third parties might not break the chain of causation if the defendant's conduct created an unsafe condition.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option B is the most likely outcome. The driver can recover only a portion of the damages because both parties are at fault: the owner for leaving the car in the highway, and the driver for not paying attention. Comparative negligence would apportion damages based on each party's degree of fault.\n\nOption C is also tempting, but the last clear chance doctrine can be complex and isn't uniformly applied. In some jurisdictions, if the plaintiff was negligent but the defendant had the last opportunity to avoid the accident, the plaintiff can still recover.\n\nOption D might not hold because the passenger's action, while contributing to the distraction, doesn't necessarily absolve the owner of the abandoned car from liability.\n\nSo, my best guess is B: the driver recovers only a portion of the damages due to comparative negligence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
