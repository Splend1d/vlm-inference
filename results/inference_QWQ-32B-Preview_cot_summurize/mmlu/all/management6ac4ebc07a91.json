So, Ansoff's matrix is a tool that helps businesses decide on their growth strategies based on existing or new markets and existing or new products. The four main strategies are market penetration, market development, product development, and diversification.\n\nThe question is asking about increasing market share with existing products in existing markets. Let me think about this. Market penetration sounds like it involves selling more of what you already have in the markets you already serve. That seems to fit.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nA. Product development: This is about developing new products to sell in existing markets. So, that's different because it's about new products, not existing ones.\n\nC. Diversification: This is about entering new markets with new products. That's not what the question is asking for, since it's about existing markets and products.\n\nD. Market development: This involves introducing existing products into new markets. Again, the question is about existing markets, so this doesn't fit.\n\nSo, back to B. Market penetration: This strategy focuses on increasing the market share for existing products in existing markets. Companies might do this by increasing their marketing efforts, improving their distribution channels, or offering promotions and discounts to attract more customers.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But to be thorough, let me make sure I understand why the other options don't fit.\n\nProduct development (A) is about creating new products to sell to your current customer base. For example, if you sell smartphones and you develop a new model, that's product development.\n\nDiversification (C) is when a company moves into a completely new market with new products. This could be a totally different industry, and it's often done to spread risk or to take advantage of new opportunities.\n\nMarket development (D) is about finding new markets for your existing products. For example, if you make a product that's popular in one country and you want to expand it to another country, that's market development.\n\nSo, none of these match the scenario described in the question, which is about increasing market share with what you already have in the markets you already serve.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Market penetration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
