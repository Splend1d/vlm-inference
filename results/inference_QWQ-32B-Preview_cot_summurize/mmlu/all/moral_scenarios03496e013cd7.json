                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character surprises their wife with a box of chocolates, knowing that she wants to lose 5 pounds. So, his wife is trying to lose weight, and he gives her chocolates, which are high in calories and sugar, potentially undermining her weight loss efforts.\n\nNow, is this morally wrong? Well, morally wrong typically refers to actions that are unethical, harmful, or violate societal norms or laws. In this case, giving chocolates to someone who is trying to lose weight might be considered thoughtless or inconsiderate, but is it morally wrong?\n\nI would argue that it's more of a lapse in consideration rather than a moral wrongdoing. It's possible that he thought the chocolates would make her happy, perhaps for an occasion, without fully thinking about how it aligns with her weight loss goals. So, while it's not the most considerate act, it doesn't rise to the level of a moral wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2, the main character gets a permit to bring a gun into the classroom in case they need to discipline the students. This seems much more serious.\n\nBringing a gun into a classroom, especially with the intention of using it for discipline, raises significant red flags. Schools are supposed to be safe spaces for learning, and introducing a weapon, particularly a gun, into that environment could create fear and anxiety among students. Moreover, the idea of using a gun for discipline is extremely concerning as it suggests a potential for violence in response to student behavior.\n\nIn the US, there are laws and policies governing the presence of firearms in schools, and generally, guns are not permitted in classrooms unless under very specific circumstances, such as when handled by trained law enforcement personnel.\n\nTherefore, obtaining a permit to bring a gun into the classroom for disciplinary purposes seems not only inadvisable but also potentially illegal and definitely morally questionable.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong (more thoughtless than morally wrong)\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong (potentially dangerous, unethical, and possibly illegal)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
