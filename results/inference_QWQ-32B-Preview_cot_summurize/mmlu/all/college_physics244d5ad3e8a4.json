                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a particle decaying while moving at a certain speed. Let me see if I can figure this out. The particle decays in 2.0 milliseconds in its own rest frame, and it's moving at 0.60 times the speed of light in the lab frame. I need to find out how far it travels in the lab before it decays.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some special relativity concepts because speeds are involved that are a significant fraction of the speed of light. One key concept is time dilation, which affects how time is perceived in different inertial frames.\n\nIn the rest frame of the particle, the decay time is 2.0 ms. But since the particle is moving in the lab frame, time dilation comes into play. The time measured in the lab frame should be longer than the proper time (the time in the rest frame) by a factor of gamma (\u03b3), which is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe Lorentz factor \u03b3 is given by:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nwhere:\n\n- v is the speed of the particle (0.60c)\n\n- c is the speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.60)\u00b2)\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / 0.8\n\n\u03b3 = 1.25\n\nSo, the time dilation factor is 1.25.\n\nNow, the time measured in the lab frame (t_lab) is related to the proper time (t_rest) by:\n\nt_lab = \u03b3 * t_rest\n\nt_lab = 1.25 * 2.0 ms\n\nt_lab = 2.5 ms\n\nSo, in the lab frame, the particle takes 2.5 milliseconds to decay.\n\nNext, I need to find out how far the particle travels in the lab frame during this time. Since it's moving at a constant speed of 0.60 times the speed of light, I can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nBut I need to make sure I use consistent units. The speed is given as a fraction of c, and time is in milliseconds. Let's convert everything to standard SI units.\n\nFirst, the speed of light c is approximately 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 meters per second.\n\nSo, the particle's speed v is:\n\nv = 0.60 \u00d7 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s\n\nThe time in the lab frame is 2.5 milliseconds, which is:\n\nt_lab = 2.5 ms = 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s\n\nNow, calculate the distance traveled:\n\ndistance = v \u00d7 t_lab\n\ndistance = (1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) \u00d7 (2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s)\n\ndistance = 4.50 \u00d7 10^5 m\n\nWait, that seems way too large. Let me check my calculations.\n\nHold on, 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s times 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s should be:\n\n1.80 \u00d7 2.5 = 4.50\n\nAnd 10^8 \u00d7 10^-3 = 10^(8-3) = 10^5\n\nSo, 4.50 \u00d7 10^5 meters is indeed 450,000 meters. That seems too big, but let's see.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in converting milliseconds to seconds. Let me double-check that.\n\n1 millisecond is 1 \u00d7 10^-3 seconds, so 2.5 milliseconds is indeed 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 seconds. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic velocity in the lab frame differently. Maybe there's something about length contraction I need to consider.\n\nLet me think again. The particle is moving at a constant velocity in the lab frame, and I'm to find out how far it travels in the lab before decaying. The decay time in the lab frame is dilated by a factor of \u03b3, which I calculated as 2.5 ms.\n\nGiven that, the distance it travels should indeed be velocity times time, without further relativistic adjustments, because in the lab frame, the particle has a certain velocity and a certain lifetime, and the distance is simply the product of the two.\n\nSo, distance = v * t_lab = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s * 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s = 4.50 \u00d7 10^5 m = 450,000 meters.\n\nBut that seems unreasonably large. Maybe I need to consider units differently or check if there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the distance in kilometers. 450,000 meters is 450 kilometers, which still seems like a lot for a particle decay distance.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the time dilation. Let me re-examine that.\n\nIn the rest frame of the particle, the decay time is 2.0 ms. From the lab frame, this time is dilated by \u03b3 = 1.25, so t_lab = 2.5 ms, as I calculated.\n\nThen, the distance traveled is indeed v * t_lab.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different approach. Maybe I should consider the particle's lifetime in its rest frame and see how far it travels in the lab frame considering relativistic effects.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the formula for relativistic velocity addition, but since the particle is moving at a constant velocity in the lab frame, I think the straightforward approach is correct.\n\nLet me try calculating it differently. Perhaps using the relation between proper time and lab time.\n\nThe proper time (\u03c4) is related to the lab time (t) by:\n\n\u03c4 = t / \u03b3\n\nGiven that \u03c4 = 2.0 ms, and \u03b3 = 1.25, then:\n\n2.0 ms = t / 1.25\n\nt = 2.0 ms * 1.25 = 2.5 ms\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, distance = v * t = 0.60c * 2.5 ms\n\nExpressing c in meters per second:\n\ndistance = 0.60 * 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s * 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s = 0.60 * 3.00 * 2.5 * 10^5 m = 4.50 \u00d7 10^5 m = 450,000 m\n\nThis seems consistent, but again, 450,000 meters seems excessively large for a particle decay distance.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, and its decay time is dilated, leading to a longer travel distance. But intuitively, I would expect the distance to be less.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider length contraction. From the particle's frame, the distance it travels is contracted in the lab frame.\n\nBut no, from the lab frame, the distance the particle travels is v * t_lab, without contraction, because in the lab frame, lengths are not contracted.\n\nI'm getting confused now. Let me look for an alternative approach.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the particle's mean lifetime and its speed to find the distance it travels on average before decaying.\n\nIn the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated, so the particle lives longer and thus travels farther.\n\nGiven that, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting a different approach, considering the particle's momentum or something, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nLet me check if there's a mistake in the calculation of \u03b3.\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.60\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the speed is not 0.60c, but rather 0.60 times some other velocity. But the question clearly states v = 0.60c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the speed of light in meters per millisecond.\n\nc = 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s = 3.00 \u00d7 10^5 m/ms\n\nThen, v = 0.60 * 3.00 \u00d7 10^5 m/ms = 1.80 \u00d7 10^5 m/ms\n\nTime t_lab = 2.5 ms\n\nDistance = v * t_lab = 1.80 \u00d7 10^5 m/ms * 2.5 ms = 4.50 \u00d7 10^5 m = 450,000 m\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nBut looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 150 m\n\nB. 288 m\n\nC. 360 m\n\nD. 450 m\n\nNone of these match 450,000 meters. Did I make a mistake in unit conversion?\n\nWait a second, perhaps I misinterpreted the units. Maybe the time is in milliseconds, but I need to convert it properly.\n\nLet me recalculate, paying close attention to units.\n\nGiven:\n\nt_rest = 2.0 ms = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3 s\n\nv = 0.60c = 0.60 \u00d7 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s\n\n\u03b3 = 1.25\n\nt_lab = \u03b3 * t_rest = 1.25 * 2.0 ms = 2.5 ms = 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s\n\nDistance = v * t_lab = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s * 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s = 4.50 \u00d7 10^5 m = 450,000 m\n\nBut 450,000 meters is 450 kilometers, which is not listed in the options. The closest option is D. 450 m, which is off by a factor of 1000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the time is in milliseconds, and the speed is in meters per second, so the time should be in seconds.\n\nWait, 2.5 ms is 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s, which I used in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the value of c. Let me confirm the speed of light.\n\nc = 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s is correct.\n\nv = 0.60c = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s is correct.\n\nt_lab = 2.5 ms = 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s is correct.\n\nDistance = v * t_lab = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s * 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s = 4.50 \u00d7 10^5 m = 450,000 m is correct.\n\nBut again, that's not matching any of the options. Maybe I need to consider significant figures. Perhaps 450,000 m should be rounded to 450 km, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of \u03b3.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03b3:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.60)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the time dilation formula is being applied incorrectly. Let me check a textbook or resource on time dilation.\n\nAccording to special relativity, the time dilation formula is indeed t_lab = \u03b3 * t_rest.\n\nSo, t_lab = 1.25 * 2.0 ms = 2.5 ms, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the particle's speed is not 0.60c, but 0.60 times some other speed. But the question clearly states v = 0.60c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the decay time in the rest frame is given in milliseconds, but needs to be converted differently.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the decay time is given in the lab frame, and I need to find the decay time in the rest frame. But no, the problem says \"in its rest frame, the particle decays in 2.0 ms.\"\n\nSo, t_rest = 2.0 ms.\n\nFrom the lab frame, t_lab = \u03b3 * t_rest = 2.5 ms.\n\nThen, distance = v * t_lab = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s * 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s = 4.50 \u00d7 10^5 m = 450,000 m.\n\nThis seems consistent, but again, that's not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided. Maybe there's a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the relativistic Doppler effect or something, but that seems unrelated to the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the particle's speed is not 0.60c, but 0.60 times the speed of light in another medium, but the question specifies the lab frame, so it should be in vacuum.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe I need to consider the particle's momentum or its mean free path, but that doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the uncertainty in the particle's position due to its short lifetime, but that doesn't align with the question asked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the particle's lifetime in the lab frame and its speed to find the distance it travels, but that's what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the particle is moving at 0.60c relative to the lab, and in the lab frame, it decays after 2.0 ms of its own time, which corresponds to a longer time in the lab frame due to time dilation.\n\nThen, the distance it travels is v * t_lab, which is what I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the distance in meters, but the options are in kilometers, but that doesn't make sense because 450 km is not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the particle's mean decay distance in its rest frame and then boost it to the lab frame.\n\nIn the rest frame, the particle doesn't move, so its decay distance is zero. But in the lab frame, it moves before decaying, so the distance is v * t_lab.\n\nWhich again is what I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of v.\n\nv = 0.60c = 0.60 * 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the relativistic velocity addition formula, but since the particle is moving at a constant velocity in the lab frame, that shouldn't be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay time in the rest frame is 2.0 ms, and in the lab frame, it's dilated to t_lab = \u03b3 * t_rest = 2.5 ms, and the distance is v * t_lab = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s * 2.5 \u00d7 10^-3 s = 4.50 \u00d7 10^5 m = 450,000 m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are in meters, and 450,000 m is intended to be 450 m, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, and the decay time is meant to be 2.0 microseconds instead of milliseconds. Let me try that.\n\nIf t_rest = 2.0 \u03bcs = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-6 s\n\nThen, t_lab = \u03b3 * t_rest = 1.25 * 2.0 \u00d7 10^-6 s = 2.5 \u00d7 10^-6 s\n\nDistance = v * t_lab = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s * 2.5 \u00d7 10^-6 s = 450 m\n\nThat matches option D.\n\nWait a second, maybe the decay time is 2.0 microseconds, not milliseconds. That would make more sense given the options.\n\nIf t_rest = 2.0 \u03bcs, then t_lab = 2.5 \u03bcs, and distance = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s * 2.5 \u00d7 10^-6 s = 450 m\n\nThat matches option D.\n\nPerhaps there was a misinterpretation of the units in the problem. Maybe the decay time is in microseconds, not milliseconds.\n\nLooking back at the problem:\n\n\"A particle decays in 2.0 ms in its rest frame.\"\n\nBut ms stands for milliseconds, which is 10^-3 seconds, while \u03bcs is microseconds, which is 10^-6 seconds.\n\nHowever, in the options, 450 m is listed, which would correspond to a decay time of 2.0 \u03bcs, not ms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and it should be microseconds.\n\nGiven that, if t_rest = 2.0 \u03bcs, then t_lab = 2.5 \u03bcs, and distance = 1.80 \u00d7 10^8 m/s * 2.5 \u00d7 10^-6 s = 450 m, which matches option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the speed is not 0.60c, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the particle's momentum or something else, but that seems unnecessary.\n\nGiven the options, it seems like the intended decay time is 2.0 microseconds, not milliseconds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 450 m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
