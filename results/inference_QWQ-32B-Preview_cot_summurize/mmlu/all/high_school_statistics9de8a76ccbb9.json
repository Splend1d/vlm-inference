                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. We're given P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.2, and we need to find the probability of the union P(A \u222a B) under three different conditions: when A and B are mutually exclusive, when they are independent, and when B is a subset of A. Then, we have to match our answers to one of the provided options.\n\nFirst, let's recall the general formula for the union of two events:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B)\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding how P(A \u2229 B) changes under the different conditions given.\n\n**1. Mutually Exclusive Events**\n\nWhen two events are mutually exclusive, it means they cannot occur at the same time. Therefore, the probability of both A and B happening together is zero:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = 0\n\nPlugging this into the general formula:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0 = 0.5\n\nSo, under mutual exclusivity, P(A \u222a B) is 0.5.\n\n**2. Independent Events**\n\nWhen two events are independent, the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. The probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06\n\nNow, plug this back into the general formula:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.06 = 0.44\n\nSo, when A and B are independent, P(A \u222a B) is 0.44.\n\n**3. B is a Subset of A**\n\nIf B is a subset of A, it means every time B occurs, A also occurs. Therefore, the intersection of A and B is just B:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = P(B) = 0.2\n\nUsing the general formula again:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.2 = 0.3\n\nSo, when B is a subset of A, P(A \u222a B) is 0.3.\n\nNow, let's summarize our findings:\n\n- Mutually exclusive: P(A \u222a B) = 0.5\n\n- Independent: P(A \u222a B) = 0.44\n\n- B is a subset of A: P(A \u222a B) = 0.3\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.44, 0.5, 0.2\n\nB. 0.44, 0.5, 0.3\n\nC. 0.5, 0.44, 0.2\n\nD. 0.5, 0.44, 0.3\n\nOur answers match option D: 0.5, 0.44, 0.3.\n\nWait a minute, but in option D, the first value is 0.5 (mutually exclusive), the second is 0.44 (independent), and the third is 0.3 (B is a subset of A). That aligns perfectly with what we calculated.\n\nHowever, let's double-check to make sure we didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, for mutually exclusive events, P(A \u2229 B) = 0, leading to P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.5. That seems correct.\n\nSecond, for independent events, P(A \u2229 B) = P(A)*P(B) = 0.06, so P(A \u222a B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.06 = 0.44. That also seems right.\n\nThird, if B is a subset of A, then P(A \u222a B) should indeed be P(A) = 0.3, since all elements of B are already in A. So, 0.3 is correct here as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. 0.5, 0.44, 0.3.\n\nBut wait, in option A, there's a 0.44, 0.5, 0.2. That would suggest that for B being a subset of A, P(A \u222a B) is 0.2, which is not correct because P(A) is 0.3.\n\nOption B has 0.44, 0.5, 0.3, which matches our calculations.\n\nOption C has 0.5, 0.44, 0.2, which has the subset part wrong.\n\nOption D has 0.5, 0.44, 0.3, which matches our calculations.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nBut the initial answer provided was A, which seems incorrect based on our calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question or in the options.\n\nLet me re-examine the question:\n\n\"what is the probability of the union P(A \u222a B) if A and B are mutually exclusive? If A and B are independent? If B is a subset of A?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. 0.44, 0.5, 0.2\n\nB. 0.44, 0.5, 0.3\n\nC. 0.5, 0.44, 0.2\n\nD. 0.5, 0.44, 0.3\n\nOur calculations show:\n\n- Mutually exclusive: 0.5\n\n- Independent: 0.44\n\n- B subset of A: 0.3\n\nSo, the correct sequence is 0.5, 0.44, 0.3, which is option D.\n\nHowever, the initial answer suggested option A, which is 0.44, 0.5, 0.2, which doesn't match our calculations.\n\nPerhaps there was a misinterpretation in the order of the answers in the options.\n\nLet me check again:\n\n- Option A: 0.44, 0.5, 0.2\n\n- Option B: 0.44, 0.5, 0.3\n\n- Option C: 0.5, 0.44, 0.2\n\n- Option D: 0.5, 0.44, 0.3\n\nOur sequence is 0.5 (mutually exclusive), 0.44 (independent), 0.3 (subset).\n\nSo, option D matches.\n\nBut the initial answer said A, which is incorrect based on our calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nWait, maybe the question is presented in a different order.\n\nLet me read the question again:\n\n\"Given the probabilities P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.2, what is the probability of the union P(A \u222a B) if A and B are mutually exclusive? If A and B are independent? If B is a subset of A?\n\nA. 0.44, 0.5, 0.2\n\nB. 0.44, 0.5, 0.3\n\nC. 0.5, 0.44, 0.2\n\nD. 0.5, 0.44, 0.3\"\n\nSo, the question asks for three scenarios in this order:\n\n1. A and B are mutually exclusive\n\n2. A and B are independent\n\n3. B is a subset of A\n\nAnd our calculations give:\n\n1. 0.5\n\n2. 0.44\n\n3. 0.3\n\nWhich matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nPerhaps there was a mistake in the initial answer provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
