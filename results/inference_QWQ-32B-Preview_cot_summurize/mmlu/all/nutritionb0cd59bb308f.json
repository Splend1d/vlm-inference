                    "text": "So I have this question here about food allergens. It says that theoretically, any food protein could cause an allergy, but there are eight major food allergens in Europe and North America that cause most of the allergic reactions in kids. The question is asking which pairing of allergens includes one that isn't part of these eight major allergens.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Cow's milk, egg\n\nB. Mustard seeds, lamb\n\nC. Soy, peanuts\n\nD. Fish, shellfish\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the eight major food allergens are. I remember that cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish are commonly considered the big eight. Let me confirm if that's accurate for Europe and North America.\n\nSo, option A: cow's milk and egg. Both of these are part of the eight major allergens, so this can't be the answer.\n\nOption B: mustard seeds and lamb. Hmm, mustard seeds are sometimes considered an allergen, but I'm not sure if they are one of the top eight. Lamb, on the other hand, isn't typically listed among the major allergens. So, perhaps lamb is the one that isn't part of the eight.\n\nOption C: soy and peanuts. Again, both of these are part of the eight major allergens, so this isn't the answer.\n\nOption D: fish and shellfish. Both of these are also part of the eight major allergens.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option B has lamb, which isn't part of the eight major allergens. But just to make sure, let me double-check the list of eight major allergens.\n\nThe eight major allergens are:\n\n1. Cow's milk\n\n2. Eggs\n\n3. Peanuts\n\n4. Tree nuts\n\n5. Soy\n\n6. Wheat\n\n7. Fish\n\n8. Shellfish\n\nYes, that's correct. Lamb isn't listed here, so in option B, lamb is not part of the eight major allergens, whereas mustard seeds might be an allergen but are not part of the top eight. However, the question is which pairing contains an allergen that is not part of the eight major allergens, so lamb would be that allergen in option B.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"which of the allergens pairings contains an allergen which is not part of the group of eight major allergens.\" So, it's assuming that both items in the pairing are allergens, but one of them is not part of the top eight.\n\nBut in option B, lamb is not part of the top eight, but is lamb even considered an allergen? I think lamb can cause allergic reactions, but it's not as common as the top eight. Maybe the question is trying to point out that lamb is not among the top eight, even if it's still an allergen for some people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mustard seeds are not part of the top eight, but I thought mustard was considered a common allergen in some regions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look up the exact list of major food allergens in Europe and North America.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that in the EU, the following are considered major allergens: celery, cereal containing gluten, crustaceans, eggs, fish, lactose, milk, molluscs, mustard, nuts, peanuts, sesame seed, soybeans, sulphur dioxide and sulphites.\n\nSo, in the EU, mustard is definitely a major allergen, and lamb isn't specifically listed. Similarly, in North America, the big eight include milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish. Lamb isn't typically included in that list.\n\nTherefore, in option B, lamb is the allergen that is not part of the eight major allergens.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Mustard seeds, lamb.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option again:\n\nA. Cow's milk and egg: both are in the top eight.\n\nB. Mustard seeds and lamb: mustard is in the EU top allergens, but lamb is not.\n\nC. Soy and peanuts: both are in the top eight.\n\nD. Fish and shellfish: both are in the top eight.\n\nTherefore, option B contains an allergen (lamb) that is not part of the eight major allergens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
