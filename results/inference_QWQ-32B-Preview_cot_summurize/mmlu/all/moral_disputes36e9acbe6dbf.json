                    "text": "Let's see what Ross is saying about utilitarianism. He thinks the main problem with it is that it overlooks something important. The options are:\n\nA. the value of pleasure.\n\nB. autonomy.\n\nC. epistemological responsibility.\n\nD. the personal character of duty.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what utilitarianism is all about. Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory that says the best action is the one that maximizes utility, usually defined as happiness or pleasure. So, it's all about the outcomes and making sure that the greatest number of people are happy.\n\nNow, Ross is critiquing this approach. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. The value of pleasure. But wait, utilitarianism is all about maximizing pleasure. So, it seems odd that Ross would say it ignores the value of pleasure. In fact, it seems like the opposite\u2014that utilitarianism focuses too much on pleasure.\n\nB. Autonomy. Autonomy is about people's ability to make their own choices and govern themselves. Immanuel Kant, for example, emphasized the importance of autonomy in moral decision-making. Maybe Ross is saying that utilitarianism doesn't respect individual autonomy because it might require sacrificing individual freedoms for the greater good.\n\nC. Epistemological responsibility. This sounds a bit tricky. Epistemology is the study of knowledge, so epistemological responsibility might refer to the duty to seek and use knowledge responsibly. Maybe Ross is arguing that utilitarianism doesn't take seriously the responsibilities we have in terms of knowledge and understanding in our moral decisions.\n\nD. The personal character of duty. This seems related to the idea that moral duties are personal and relate to the character of the individual. Perhaps Ross is suggesting that utilitarianism overlooks the importance of personal duty and character in moral decision-making, focusing only on the outcomes.\n\nLet me think about this some more. Utilitarianism is often criticized for potentially justifying actions that are intuitively wrong if they lead to greater overall happiness. For example, sacrificing one person to save five others. This kind of utilitarian calculus is problematic because it might override individual rights and duties.\n\nRoss was a deontologist, which means he believed in rules and duties that should be followed regardless of the consequences. So, he likely valued things like individual rights, duties, and perhaps the goodness of character over just maximizing happiness.\n\nGiven that, option D seems most plausible. The personal character of duty aligns with deontological ethics, where duties are personal and must be followed based on moral rules, not just outcomes.\n\nOption B, autonomy, is also important in deontology. Kant, for instance, placed great emphasis on autonomy. So, that could be a possible answer as well.\n\nBut option A seems unlikely because utilitarianism is all about pleasure. It wouldn't make sense for Ross to say it ignores pleasure's value when that's precisely what it's trying to maximize.\n\nOption C, epistemological responsibility, is interesting, but it's not immediately clear how that relates to utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is more about consequences than about knowledge or epistemology.\n\nBetween B and D, I think D is a better fit because it directly relates to duties and personal morality, which is a central concern for deontologists like Ross.\n\nSo, I would go with D. The personal character of duty.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
