                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out who the career hit leader is among players who were never elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The options are Steve Garvey, Jim Rice, Pete Rose, and Ken Griffey Jr. I need to determine which one of these players has the most career hits and hasn't been inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nFirst, I need to check the career hit totals for each of these players. I know that Pete Rose has the most career hits in MLB history, but I'm not sure if he's in the Hall of Fame. Similarly, Ken Griffey Jr. is a well-known player with a lot of hits, but I don't recall if he's in the Hall of Fame or not. Steve Garvey and Jim Rice are also notable players, but I'm less familiar with their career statistics.\n\nLet me start by looking up the career hit totals for each player.\n\nPete Rose: I believe he has around 4,256 hits, which is the all-time record, but I need to confirm that. Also, I know there's some controversy surrounding his eligibility for the Hall of Fame due to betting on games.\n\nKen Griffey Jr.: He had a prolific career, and I think he has over 3,000 hits. I believe he was recently inducted into the Hall of Fame, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nSteve Garvey: He played for many years, primarily with the Dodgers, and I think he has around 3,000 hits as well. I don't think he's in the Hall of Fame, but I'm not sure.\n\nJim Rice: He was a powerful hitter for the Red Sox, known for his home runs, but I'm not sure about his total hits. Again, I don't think he's in the Hall of Fame.\n\nAlright, let's verify these facts one by one.\n\nFirst, Pete Rose. According to my knowledge, he has 4,256 hits, which is the most in MLB history. However, he's banned from the Hall of Fame due to his involvement in betting on games while managing the Cincinnati Reds. So, he's definitely not in the Hall of Fame.\n\nNext, Ken Griffey Jr.: He retired with 3,080 hits, which is still impressive, but less than Rose. I believe he was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2016 or 2017, so he should be in.\n\nWait, no. Actually, Ken Griffey Jr. was elected in 2016 and inducted in 2016. So, he is in the Hall of Fame.\n\nThat means he doesn't qualify for this question since he is in the Hall of Fame.\n\nNow, Steve Garvey: He had a 20-year career, mainly with the Los Angeles Dodgers. I think he has around 3,100 hits. I don't recall seeing him in the Hall of Fame, so probably not.\n\nJim Rice: He played for the Boston Red Sox and was known for his power hitting. I believe he has around 2,900 hits. Again, I don't think he's in the Hall of Fame.\n\nWait, actually, Jim Rice was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2009. So, he is in the Hall of Fame.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check that. I might be mistaken.\n\nUpon checking, Jim Rice was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2009. So, he is in the Hall of Fame.\n\nThat means the options are Pete Rose, who is not in the Hall of Fame, and Steve Garvey, who I believe is also not in the Hall of Fame.\n\nWait, but Ken Griffey Jr. is in the Hall of Fame, and Jim Rice is as well. So, only Pete Rose and Steve Garvey are not in the Hall of Fame among the options provided.\n\nNow, between Pete Rose and Steve Garvey, who has more career hits?\n\nPete Rose has 4,256 hits, and Steve Garvey has around 3,142 hits, I believe.\n\nSo, Pete Rose has significantly more hits than Steve Garvey.\n\nBut, there might be other players who have more hits than Steve Garvey who aren't in the Hall of Fame. However, since the question provides specific options, I have to choose among A, B, C, and D.\n\nGiven that, Pete Rose has the most career hits among players not in the Hall of Fame, based on the options given.\n\nBut, I should consider if there are any other players not in the Hall of Fame with more hits than Steve Garvey.\n\nFor example, I know that Derek Jeter has over 3,000 hits and was recently inducted into the Hall of Fame. So, he's not an option.\n\nSimilarly, Rickey Henderson has over 3,000 hits and is in the Hall of Fame.\n\nBut, among the options provided, Pete Rose has the most career hits by a wide margin.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Pete Rose.\n\nHowever, I recall that Pete Rose is banned from the Hall of Fame, so he's never going to be elected. That makes him eligible for this category.\n\nSteve Garvey, on the other hand, was never elected to the Hall of Fame, but he doesn't have as many hits as Pete Rose.\n\nSo, the career hit leader among players never elected to the Hall of Fame is Pete Rose.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Pete Rose.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
