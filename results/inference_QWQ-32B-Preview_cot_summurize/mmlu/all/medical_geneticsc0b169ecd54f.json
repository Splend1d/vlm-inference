                    "text": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia is caused by mutations in the gene which encodes the low density lipoprotein receptor. So, the correct answer is D. Low density lipoprotein receptor.\n\nTo understand this better, let's delve into what familial hypercholesterolaemia is and how it relates to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor.\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia is an inherited disorder characterized by high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol, in the blood. This condition increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis and suffering from cardiovascular diseases at an early age.\n\nThe disorder is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the LDL receptor. The LDL receptor is a protein found on the surface of cells, and its primary function is to remove LDL particles from the bloodstream by binding to them and facilitating their uptake into the cell through a process called endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the LDL particles are broken down, and the cholesterol is either used by the cell or stored.\n\nIn individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia, the LDL receptors may be defective or present in reduced numbers due to genetic mutations. This impairment leads to a decreased ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood, resulting in elevated levels of LDL-C. Over time, this can lead to the buildup of cholesterol in arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease.\n\nIt's important to note that while options A, B, and C are related to cholesterol metabolism, they are not directly encoded by the gene mutated in familial hypercholesterolaemia:\n\n- Option A: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is often referred to as \"good\" cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from the bloodstream and transport it to the liver for excretion or recycling. However, it is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of familial hypercholesterolaemia.\n\n- Option B: HMG-CoA reductase is an enzyme critical in the synthesis of cholesterol within cells. Statins, a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol, work by inhibiting this enzyme. While important in cholesterol metabolism, mutations in the gene encoding HMG-CoA reductase are not associated with familial hypercholesterolaemia.\n\n- Option C: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the primary carrier of cholesterol in the blood. In familial hypercholesterolaemia, the issue is not with the LDL particles themselves but with the receptors responsible for their removal from the bloodstream.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Low density lipoprotein receptor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
