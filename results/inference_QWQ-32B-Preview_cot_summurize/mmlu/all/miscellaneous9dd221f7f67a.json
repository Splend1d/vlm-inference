These states were:\n\n1. South Carolina\n2. Mississippi\n3. Florida\n4. Alabama\n5. Georgia\n6. Louisiana\n7. Texas\n8. Virginia\n9. Arkansas\n10. North Carolina\n11. Tennessee\n\nThese states formed their own government in opposition to the Union, which consisted of the remaining 20 free states and five border states that did not secede. The Civil War lasted from 1861 to 1865 and resulted in the defeat of the Confederacy and the preservation of the United States as a single nation.\n\nOption B, 13, might be confusing because there were originally 13 colonies that formed the United States, but in this case, it's not relevant to the number of Confederate states.\n\nOption C, 16, and Option D, 22, do not correspond to any standard counts related to the Confederate States of America.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
