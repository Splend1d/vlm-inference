The options are:\n\nA. duties of fair dealing, like not exploiting others.\n\nB. cosmopolitan egalitarian duties, like making sure everyone has equal wealth.\n\nC. duties of rectification and redress, like fixing wrongs done to oppressed people.\n\nD. humanitarian duties, like stopping serious human rights abuses.\n\nI need to figure out which one Macedo doesn't mention as a duty towards non-members.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Macedo says about duties to non-members. I think he discusses different kinds of obligations that societies have towards people who are not part of their society. Maybe he talks about fair trade practices, correcting historical injustices, and helping to protect human rights.\n\nOption A is about fair dealing and non-exploitation. I think Macedo probably mentions that societies should treat non-members fairly and not take advantage of them. So, that seems likely to be included.\n\nOption B is about cosmopolitan egalitarian duties, specifically ensuring equal wealth for everyone. This sounds a bit extreme. Cosmopolitanism is about treating all humans equally, but does Macedo go as far as saying societies should ensure everyone has equal wealth? That seems like a strong claim.\n\nOption C is about rectification and redress, which means fixing past wrongs and compensating those who were oppressed. I can see Macedo mentioning that societies should address historical injustices towards non-members.\n\nOption D is about humanitarian duties, like preventing serious human rights violations. That seems aligned with the idea of societies having responsibilities to protect the rights of people outside their borders.\n\nComparing these options, option B stands out as potentially not being mentioned by Macedo. Ensuring equal wealth for everyone sounds like a very strong obligation, and maybe Macedo doesn't go that far. Perhaps he thinks societies have duties to avoid exploitation and support basic human rights, but not to equalize wealth globally.\n\nOption A, duties of fair dealing, seems plausible.\n\nOption C, duties of rectification and redress, also seems likely.\n\nOption D, humanitarian duties, aligns with protecting human rights.\n\nBut option B, ensuring equal wealth, might be too ambitious or not directly addressed by Macedo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Macedo does discuss cosmopolitan egalitarian duties, but perhaps in a different way. I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, maybe Macedo discusses duties to promote equality, but not necessarily ensuring equal wealth. Maybe he talks about equality of opportunity or something less drastic than equal wealth.\n\nGiven that, perhaps ensuring equal wealth is not specifically mentioned, making option B the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Macedo does mention cosmopolitan egalitarian duties, and equal wealth is part of that. In that case, option B would be mentioned, and I need to choose another option.\n\nLet me consider the other options again.\n\nOption A, duties of fair dealing, is probably mentioned.\n\nOption C, duties of rectification and redress, likely mentioned.\n\nOption D, humanitarian duties, almost certainly mentioned.\n\nSo, if I have to choose one that is not mentioned, it might be option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Macedo doesn't discuss cosmopolitan egalitarian duties at all, focusing more on specific duties like fair dealing and humanitarian aid.\n\nGiven the options, I think the answer is B, cosmopolitan egalitarian duties, specifically ensuring equal wealth.\n\nIt's possible that Macedo doesn't address that particular duty, or perhaps he doesn't consider it a primary obligation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
