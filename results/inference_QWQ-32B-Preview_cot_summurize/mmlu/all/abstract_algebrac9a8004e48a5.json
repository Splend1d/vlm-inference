                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to determine if each statement is true or false and then choose the correct option from A to D.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a ring homomorphism is. A ring homomorphism is a function between two rings that preserves the ring operations, meaning it preserves addition and multiplication.\n\nThe kernel of a ring homomorphism \u03c6: R \u2192 S is defined as the set of elements in R that map to the zero element of S. In other words, ker(\u03c6) = { r \u2208 R | \u03c6(r) = 0_S }.\n\nNow, the statement says that \u03c6 is one-to-one if and only if ker(\u03c6) = {0_R}.\n\nI know that in group theory, a group homomorphism is injective (one-to-one) if and only if its kernel is the trivial group, which is {e}, where e is the identity element.\n\nSimilarly, in ring theory, since a ring is also a group under addition, this property should hold. So, if ker(\u03c6) = {0_R}, then \u03c6 is injective.\n\nWait, but I should confirm this specifically for rings.\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose ker(\u03c6) = {0_R}. If \u03c6(a) = \u03c6(b), then \u03c6(a - b) = \u03c6(a) - \u03c6(b) = 0_S, which implies a - b \u2208 ker(\u03c6), so a - b = 0_R, meaning a = b. Therefore, \u03c6 is injective.\n\nConversely, if \u03c6 is injective, and \u03c6(r) = 0_S, then r must be 0_R, because only 0_R maps to 0_S. So, ker(\u03c6) = {0_R}.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"Q is an ideal in R.\"\n\nThis statement is a bit vague because it doesn't specify what R is. Q probably stands for the rational numbers, and R for the real numbers.\n\nSo, is Q an ideal in R?\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an ideal is. In ring theory, an ideal is a subset of a ring that is closed under addition and satisfies the absorption property with respect to multiplication by elements of the ring.\n\nSpecifically, if I is an ideal in ring R, then:\n\n1. I is an additive subgroup of R.\n\n2. For every r in R and every i in I, both r * i and i * r are in I.\n\nNow, considering Q as a subset of R, the real numbers.\n\nIs Q an additive subgroup of R? Well, Q is closed under addition and additive inverses, so yes.\n\nBut, is it an ideal? We need to check the absorption property.\n\nTake any r in R (real number) and q in Q (rational number). Is r * q in Q?\n\nWell, if r is irrational and q is non-zero rational, then r * q is irrational, so not in Q.\n\nTherefore, Q is not closed under multiplication by arbitrary elements of R. Hence, Q is not an ideal in R.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
