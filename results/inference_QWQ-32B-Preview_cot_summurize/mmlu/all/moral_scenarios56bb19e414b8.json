So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I saw a parked police car and left a thank-you note on the hood.\" Hmm, leaving a thank-you note on a police car seems like a nice gesture. Maybe someone wants to express appreciation for the police officers' work. I don't think that's morally wrong; in fact, it's probably seen as positive or at least neutral.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I did not push the old woman to the ground as she walked by me.\" This one sounds a bit tricky. It says \"I did not push,\" which implies that someone might have considered pushing her but chose not to. So, not pushing her means they didn't act on that impulse. But the question is about what the main character did, not what they didn't do.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards, pushing an old woman to the ground would be clearly wrong\u2014it's harmful and disrespectful. But in this scenario, the main character didn't do that; they chose not to push her. So, not pushing her is actually the right thing to do, right? It's preventing a wrong action from happening.\n\nWait, but the question is about what the main character did, not what they refrained from doing. So, in Scenario 2, the action taken is choosing not to push the old woman. Since not pushing her is the moral thing to do, then their action isn't wrong.\n\nComparing both scenarios, neither of them involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong. In Scenario 1, they did something nice or at least neutral, and in Scenario 2, they avoided doing something wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, leaving a thank-you note on a police car is generally okay. Police officers might appreciate it or at least not see it as wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, not pushing someone is definitely not wrong; it's the right thing to do.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
