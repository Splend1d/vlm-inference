                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about care ethics as presented by Collins, and I need to pick the correct key claim from the options given. Let me read them again to make sure I understand each one.\n\nOption A says: \"Deliberation should include sympathy and direct attendance to concrete particulars.\" That sounds like it's emphasizing the importance of both emotional empathy, through sympathy, and paying close attention to specific details of a situation.\n\nOption B says: \"Deliberation should only include sympathy and direct attendance to concrete particulars.\" This is similar to A but uses \"only,\" which means that according to B, deliberation should exclusively focus on sympathy and concrete particulars, excluding other factors.\n\nOption C states: \"Deliberation should only include general principles and exclude considerations of sympathy.\" This seems to be advocating for a more rule-based approach, where general principles are the sole guide, and sympathy is not considered at all.\n\nOption D says: \"Deliberation should include sympathy but not consider concrete particulars.\" This option includes sympathy, like A and B, but excludes the consideration of concrete particulars, which is different from A and B.\n\nNow, I need to recall what Collins says about care ethics. Care ethics, as I remember, is a feminist ethical theory that challenges traditional ethical theories like Kantianism and utilitarianism. It emphasizes the importance of care, relationships, and context in moral decision-making.\n\nOne of the key aspects of care ethics is that it values the particularity of moral situations. It argues that moral decisions should take into account the specific context and relationships involved, rather than applying universal principles blindly. So, it seems like concrete particulars are important in care ethics.\n\nAlso, care ethics places a strong emphasis on emotions, particularly sympathy or empathy, as a guide in moral deliberation. It suggests that understanding and sharing the feelings of others can lead to more ethical actions.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to align well with care ethics, as it includes both sympathy and attention to concrete particulars.\n\nOption B, however, says that deliberation should only include sympathy and concrete particulars. This might be too restrictive because care ethics might also consider other factors, such as responsibilities, relationships, and the needs of the individuals involved. So, \"only\" might not be accurate.\n\nOption C is clearly contrary to care ethics because it excludes sympathy, which is a central element in care ethics.\n\nOption D includes sympathy but excludes concrete particulars, which contradicts care ethics' emphasis on the importance of context and specific situations.\n\nTherefore, between A and B, A seems more appropriate because it includes both sympathy and concrete particulars without excluding other possible considerations.\n\nI think the key claim of care ethics, according to Collins, is that deliberation should include sympathy and direct attendance to concrete particulars, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
