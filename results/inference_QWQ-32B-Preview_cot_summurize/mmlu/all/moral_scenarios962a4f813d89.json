Breaking open a piggy bank to access the money inside is a common action, especially if someone has saved money in it and now wants to use it for a purchase. There's nothing inherently wrong with wanting to buy something you've saved for. So, in this case, it seems like the action is not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person wipes the soap out of the tub because their grandma could slip when she steps into it. This action is about preventing a potential hazard. Soap can make surfaces slippery, which could lead to someone falling and getting hurt. By removing the soap, the person is taking a precaution to ensure their grandma's safety. This seems like a responsible and caring action, not a morally wrong one.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of the actions appears to be morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
