                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this scenario where a motorist was going pretty slow, only 5 miles per hour, and she tap-tapped the car in front because she was distracted. And unfortunately, there was a passenger in that front car who had this really rare medical condition that makes her super sensitive to even the slightest bump or touch. So, from what I understand, this passenger just lightly bumped her shoulder against the door during the tap, and that triggered her rare disease to act up, and now she's permanently incapacitated. She's suing the motorist for all her injuries, and there's a doctor's report saying that the collision was a substantial factor in causing the disability.\n\nThe question is, has the plaintiff stated a claim for relief under prevailing legal principles? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nOption A says yes, because in the law of negligence, the defendant takes the plaintiff \"as he finds her.\" Okay, that sounds familiar. I think this relates to the concept of \"eggshell skull\" in law, where you take your victim as you find them, meaning that even if the injury seems minor, but because of some pre-existing condition, it leads to more severe consequences, the defendant is still liable for those consequences. So, in this case, even though the tap was minor, the passenger had this rare condition, so the motorist is liable for all the injuries that resulted from it.\n\nOption B says no, because the motorist is only liable for foreseeable injuries that are not of psychological origin. Hmm, foreseeability is important in negligence. But in this case, the injury isn't psychological; it's a physical reaction due to a medical condition triggered by a physical impact. So, maybe this isn't applicable here.\n\nOption C says no, because the victim's psychosomatic reaction is usually held to be malingering under the law. Wait, but the reaction here is physical, not psychological. The passenger actually bumped her shoulder and it triggered a medical condition. It's not like she's imagining injuries; there's a real medical issue at play. So, I don't think malingering applies here.\n\nOption D says yes, because the victim in this case is called a \"predictably unpredictable plaintiff.\" I'm not sure what that means exactly. Maybe it's referring to the idea that some plaintiffs have conditions that make their reactions to injuries unpredictable, but still, the defendant is liable for those reactions.\n\nLooking back, option A seems the most straightforward. The \"eggshell skull\" rule means that defendants must take their victims as they find them, meaning they're responsible for all consequences of their actions, even if those consequences are more severe due to a pre-existing condition.\n\nIn this case, the motorist was negligent by being distracted and tapping the rear of another vehicle. The passenger had a rare medical condition that made even a slight impact harmful. The doctor's report says the collision was a substantial factor in causing the disability, which suggests causation.\n\nSo, under the eggshell skull rule, the motorist would be liable for all the injuries, even though the impact was minor and the condition was rare.\n\nOption B mentions foreseeable injuries, but in negligence, liability extends to unforeseeable consequences if they are a direct result of the negligent act.\n\nOption C is about malingering, which doesn't seem relevant here because the injury is physical and due to a medical condition, not psychological.\n\nOption D is unclear, but option A seems more standard and directly applicable.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. Yes, because in the law of negligence, the defendant takes the plaintiff \"as he finds her.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
