                    "text": "Let's see. Elizabeth has some stickers, and she divides them equally among herself and two friends. So, that means there are three people in total: Elizabeth and her two friends.\n\nEach person gets 4 stickers. So, if we think about it, the total number of stickers should be the number of people multiplied by the number of stickers each person gets.\n\nNumber of people is 3, and each gets 4 stickers, so total stickers s should be 3 times 4, which is 12. But the question is asking for an equation that represents the total number of stickers, s.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. s + 3 = 4\n\nB. s - 3 = 4\n\nC. s/3 = 4\n\nD. 3s = 4\n\nHmm. If s is the total number of stickers, and they are divided equally among 3 people, each getting 4 stickers, then s divided by 3 should equal 4.\n\nSo, s/3 = 4.\n\nThat makes sense. Let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A: s + 3 = 4. That would mean that if you add 3 to the total number of stickers, you get 4. But that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption B: s - 3 = 4. That would mean that if you subtract 3 from the total number of stickers, you get 4. Again, doesn't fit the scenario.\n\nOption C: s/3 = 4. Yeah, that matches what I thought. Total stickers divided by 3 equals 4.\n\nOption D: 3s = 4. That would mean 3 times the total number of stickers equals 4, which doesn't make sense here.\n\nSo, the correct equation is s/3 = 4.\n\nTo double-check, if s/3 = 4, then s = 4 * 3 = 12. And if there are 12 stickers divided among 3 people, each gets 4 stickers, which matches the problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. s/3 = 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
