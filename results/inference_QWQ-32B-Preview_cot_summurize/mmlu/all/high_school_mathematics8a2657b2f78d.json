                    "text": "So I have these functions: f(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 2 and g(f(x)) = x\u00b2 + x + 1. I need to find the sum of all possible values of g(25). The options are 13, 25, 9, and 20.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what g(25) means in this context. Since g is defined in terms of f(x), I need to find x such that f(x) = 25, and then find g(25) based on those x values.\n\nSo, starting with f(x) = 25:\n\n3x\u00b2 - 2 = 25\n\nAdding 2 to both sides:\n\n3x\u00b2 = 27\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\nx\u00b2 = 9\n\nTaking square roots:\n\nx = 3 or x = -3\n\nNow, I need to find g(f(x)) for these x values. But g(f(x)) is given as x\u00b2 + x + 1. So, g(25) corresponds to x\u00b2 + x + 1 for x = 3 and x = -3.\n\nLet's calculate x\u00b2 + x + 1 for x = 3:\n\n(3)\u00b2 + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13\n\nNow for x = -3:\n\n(-3)\u00b2 + (-3) + 1 = 9 - 3 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, the possible values of g(25) are 13 and 7. The sum of these is 13 + 7 = 20.\n\nWait a minute, 20 is one of the options. But let's double-check if there are any other x values that satisfy f(x) = 25.\n\nWe had x\u00b2 = 9, which only has solutions x = 3 and x = -3 in the real numbers. Assuming we're working with real numbers, these are the only solutions.\n\nSo, the sum of all possible values of g(25) is 13 + 7 = 20.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe there's a relationship between the values of g(f(x)) for different x that can give another value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express g(y) in terms of y, where y = f(x).\n\nGiven that y = f(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 2, and g(f(x)) = x\u00b2 + x + 1, I could try to express x in terms of y and substitute.\n\nStarting with y = 3x\u00b2 - 2:\n\nSolving for x\u00b2:\n\ny + 2 = 3x\u00b2\n\nx\u00b2 = (y + 2)/3\n\nNow, g(y) = x\u00b2 + x + 1\n\nBut x can be positive or negative sqrt((y + 2)/3), so I need to consider both cases.\n\nSo, g(y) = (y + 2)/3 + x + 1, but x = \u00b1sqrt((y + 2)/3)\n\nThis seems a bit messy. Maybe it's better to stick with the first approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a different method to find g(25) directly without finding x.\n\nLet me consider that g(f(x)) = x\u00b2 + x + 1, and f(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 2.\n\nIs there a way to express g(y) in terms of y alone?\n\nLet me try to find a general expression for g(y).\n\nGiven y = f(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 2, and g(y) = x\u00b2 + x + 1.\n\nFrom y = 3x\u00b2 - 2, we have x\u00b2 = (y + 2)/3.\n\nSubstitute x\u00b2 into g(y):\n\ng(y) = (y + 2)/3 + x + 1\n\nBut x can be positive or negative sqrt((y + 2)/3), so g(y) depends on x, which is not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express x in terms of y and substitute back.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps the first approach is better.\n\nGiven that, I have g(25) = 13 for x = 3 and g(25) = 7 for x = -3, summing to 20.\n\nBut let's check if there's another value of x that could give another value for g(25).\n\nIs there any other x such that f(x) = 25 besides x = 3 and x = -3?\n\nFrom x\u00b2 = 9, x = 3 or x = -3 are the only real solutions.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of g(25) are 13 and 7, summing to 20.\n\nLooking back at the options, 20 is option D.\n\nBut the question says \"the sum of all possible values of g(25)\", which matches exactly with my calculation.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I got sum as 20, which is option D, but the initial post says the answer is 20, which seems correct based on my calculation.\n\nHowever, the initial post mentions that the answer is 20, but then there's confusion about whether it's option D or not.\n\nBut in the options provided, D is 20, which matches my calculation.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of g(25) is 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
