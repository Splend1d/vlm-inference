                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about the declaratory theory of recognition in international law, especially regarding statehood. There are a few options here, and I need to understand which one correctly describes this theory.\n\nOption A says that recognition is determinate for the existence of statehood. Does that mean that a state only exists if other states recognize it? That sounds like the constitutive theory, where recognition by other states is what brings a state into existence internationally.\n\nOption B says that recognition is simply declaratory of statehood but not determinate. This sounds more like the declaratory theory, where a state exists as soon as it meets certain objective criteria, such as having a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. Recognition by other states is just a formal acknowledgment of that existence, not what creates it.\n\nOption C mentions that recognition is merely a declaration of interest. This seems a bit different. It might be related to the political dimension of recognition, where states recognize new states based on their own interests, but it doesn't directly address the relationship between recognition and statehood.\n\nOption D says that recognition requires a declaration by the newly-created state. This seems to suggest that the new state itself must declare its existence before it can be recognized, which makes sense, but it doesn't specify the role of recognition in determining statehood.\n\nGiven these options, I think the correct answer is B: recognition is simply declaratory of statehood but not determinate. This aligns with the declaratory theory, which holds that statehood is a factual matter based on certain criteria, and recognition is just a way for other states to acknowledge that fact.\n\nTo confirm, I should recall that the declaratory theory is contrasted with the constitutive theory. The constitutive theory holds that a state doesn't exist internationally until it is recognized by other states. That sounds more like option A, which I think is incorrect for the declaratory theory.\n\nAlso, I remember that the Montevideo Convention of 1933 outlines the criteria for statehood, stating that a state exists when it has a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. According to the declaratory theory, once these criteria are met, the state exists, and recognition is merely a formality.\n\nSo, if a entity meets these criteria, it is a state under international law, whether or not other states recognize it. Recognition simply acknowledges that reality and may have practical implications, such as allowing diplomatic relations and other interactions.\n\nTherefore, the declaratory theory of recognition is that recognition is declaratory of statehood, not determinative. That matches option B.\n\nI should also consider why the other options are incorrect. Option A is wrong because, under the declaratory theory, recognition doesn't determine statehood; it merely acknowledges it. Option C seems to focus on the interests of recognizing states, which is a separate issue from the theory of statehood. Option D is about the requirement for the new state to declare itself, which is part of establishing statehood, but it doesn't address the role of recognition in determining statehood.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is B: recognition is simply declaratory of statehood but not determinate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
