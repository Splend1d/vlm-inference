Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Appeal to indignation - I think that's when someone tries to win an argument by making the other person feel guilty or indignant. Not sure if that fits here.\n\nB. Appeal to spite - That's when someone tries to use the other person's feelings of spite or jealousy to win the argument. Maybe, but I'm not sure.\n\nC. Horse laugh - I've heard of this, it's like when someone dismisses an argument with a laugh or a sneer without actually addressing the points. That sounds a lot like what's happening here.\n\nD. Tu quoque - That's the \"you too\" fallacy, where someone dismisses a criticism by pointing out that the critic has done the same thing. Doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nSo, the person is responding to my argument with a sarcastic statement that basically dismisses what I'm saying without actually providing any counterarguments. It's more about the tone and the mockery rather than logical reasoning. That sounds a lot like a horse laugh.\n\nLet me make sure. A horse laugh is a fallacy where someone ridicules an argument instead of refuting it with logic. In this case, \"Yeah, right. Like that's ever going to happen\" seems to be mocking the idea without providing any substantive critique.\n\nComparing it to the other options:\n\n- Appeal to indignation is more about evoking feelings of indignation.\n\n- Appeal to spite is about evoking feelings of spite.\n\n- Tu quoque is about turning the criticism back on the accuser.\n\nNone of these seem to fit as well as the horse laugh, which is all about dismissing an argument through ridicule or laughter.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Horse laugh.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
