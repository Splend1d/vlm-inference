                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to consider the timeline of human occupation in these regions: New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, and Timor. Let's look at each one and see when humans are believed to have first arrived there.\n\nStarting with Australia and New Guinea: These two landmasses were connected during the last ice age, forming a single landmass known as Sahul. The earliest evidence of human presence in this region dates back to around 65,000 years ago. So, both Australia and New Guinea were inhabited relatively early in human prehistory.\n\nNext, Timor: Timor is an island near Australia and is part of present-day Indonesia. The history of human occupation on Timor is a bit more complex due to its location and the changing sea levels over time. However, it's generally accepted that Timor was inhabited by around 42,000 years ago, possibly even earlier. So, while still ancient, it's a bit later than Australia and New Guinea.\n\nFinally, New Zealand: New Zealand is located farther south and was one of the last major landmasses to be settled by humans. The first settlers were Polynesians who arrived in several waves, with the earliest evidence of settlement dating back to around 1250-1300 CE. This is significantly more recent compared to the other options.\n\nGiven this information, it's clear that New Zealand was settled much later than Australia, New Guinea, and Timor. Therefore, the correct answer is C. New Zealand.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Australia and New Guinea: around 65,000 years ago\n\n- Timor: around 42,000 years ago\n\n- New Zealand: around 1250-1300 CE\n\nSo, New Zealand is the last among these options to be occupied by human beings."
