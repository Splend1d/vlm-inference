It helps protect the cells from damage caused by free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can harm cellular components such as DNA, proteins, and lipids. By neutralizing these free radicals, vitamin E plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and functionality of cell membranes.\n\nWhile vitamins A, D, and K are also fat-soluble vitamins, they have different primary functions:\n\n- **Vitamin A** is essential for vision, immune function, and cell growth.\n\n- **Vitamin D** is important for calcium absorption and bone health, as well as immune function.\n\n- **Vitamin K** is crucial for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, vitamin E is the one primarily recognized for its antioxidant properties in cell membranes."
