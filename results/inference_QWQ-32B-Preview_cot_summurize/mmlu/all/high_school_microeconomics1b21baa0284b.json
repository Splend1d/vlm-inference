                    "text": "Let's see. So, the price of firm A's cell phone service goes up by 5 percent, and as a result, the quantity demanded for firm B's cell phone service increases by 10 percent. I need to figure out what this tells me about the relationship between firm A and firm B.\n\nFirst, I should recall what cross-price elasticity is. Cross-price elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded of good B divided by the percentage change in the price of good A.\n\nSo, in this case, the percentage change in price of good A is +5%, and the percentage change in quantity demanded of good B is +10%. Therefore, the cross-price elasticity (\u03b5) is:\n\n\u03b5 = (% change in Qd of B) / (% change in P of A) = 10% / 5% = 2\n\nNow, the value of cross-price elasticity can tell us about the relationship between the two goods:\n\n- If \u03b5 > 0, the goods are substitutes. That means when the price of one good increases, the demand for the other good also increases.\n\n- If \u03b5 < 0, the goods are complements. That means when the price of one good increases, the demand for the other good decreases.\n\n- If \u03b5 = 0, the goods are independent; a change in the price of one doesn't affect the demand for the other.\n\nIn this scenario, \u03b5 = 2, which is greater than 0. So, firm A and firm B are substitutes.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Demand for firm B is price elastic.\n\nWell, price elasticity of demand refers to how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in its own price, not to the price of another good. So, this option is about price elasticity, not cross-price elasticity. We don't have information here about how firm B's quantity demanded changes in response to its own price changes. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nB. Supply for firm B is price elastic.\n\nSimilarly, price elasticity of supply refers to how much the quantity supplied responds to a change in its own price. Again, that's not what's being measured here. We're looking at how the quantity demanded of firm B changes in response to a change in the price of firm A. So, this option isn't relevant to the given information.\n\nC. Firms A and B are substitutes because the cross-price elasticity is greater than zero.\n\nThis seems to align with what I've just calculated. Since \u03b5 = 2 > 0, firm A and firm B are substitutes.\n\nD. Firms A and B are complements because the cross-price elasticity is less than zero.\n\nBut our calculation shows \u03b5 = 2, which is greater than zero, so this option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Firms A and B are substitutes because the cross-price elasticity is greater than zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
