She wants to know which statements are true based on this interval.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a confidence interval for the slope means. The slope of the regression line tells us about the linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables. If the slope is zero, that means there's no linear relationship. If it's not zero, there is a linear relationship.\n\nSo, in this case, the confidence interval is (0.45, 0.80), which doesn't include zero. That suggests that the true slope is probably not zero, meaning there is a linear relationship between the variables.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nI. She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables.\n\nWell, since the confidence interval doesn't include zero, that means the slope is likely not zero, which supports the idea that there is a linear relationship. So, I think this is true.\n\nII. It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables.\n\nCorrelation and slope are related in linear regression. The slope is proportional to the correlation coefficient r, given that both variables are measured in standard units. So, if the slope is not zero, the correlation should also not be zero. Therefore, this seems true as well.\n\nIII. It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0.\n\nBut wait, the confidence interval is (0.45, 0.80), which doesn't include zero. That means it's unlikely that the true slope is zero. So, this statement seems false.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, statements I and II are true, while III is false. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. I and II only.\n\nLet me double-check. The confidence interval doesn't include zero, which means we can reject the null hypothesis that the slope is zero. That gives us evidence of a linear relationship, which supports I. Since the slope is related to the correlation coefficient, a non-zero slope suggests a non-zero correlation, supporting II. And III is clearly contradicted by the confidence interval not including zero.\n\nYeah, I think A is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
