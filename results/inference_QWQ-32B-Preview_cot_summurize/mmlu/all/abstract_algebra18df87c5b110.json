                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to determine if each statement is true or false, and then choose the correct option from A to D.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"A homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a homomorphism is. A homomorphism is a function between two algebraic structures that preserves the operations of those structures. In the context of group theory, it's a function \\( f: G \\rightarrow H \\) between two groups \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) such that for all \\( a, b \\) in \\( G \\), \\( f(a \\cdot b) = f(a) * f(b) \\), where \\( \\cdot \\) and \\( * \\) are the operations in \\( G \\) and \\( H \\), respectively.\n\nThe kernel of a homomorphism \\( f \\), denoted \\( \\ker(f) \\), is the set of all elements in \\( G \\) that map to the identity element in \\( H \\). So, \\( \\ker(f) = \\{ g \\in G \\mid f(g) = e_H \\} \\), where \\( e_H \\) is the identity element in \\( H \\).\n\nNow, the statement says that a homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if the kernel consists only of the identity element of \\( G \\). Let's break this down.\n\n- If \\( f \\) is one-to-one, then distinct elements in \\( G \\) map to distinct elements in \\( H \\). That means only the identity element of \\( G \\) can map to the identity element of \\( H \\), because if any other element mapped to \\( e_H \\), it would mean that two different elements (the identity and that other element) both map to \\( e_H \\), which would violate the one-to-one property.\n\n- Conversely, if the kernel consists only of the identity element, meaning only \\( e_G \\) maps to \\( e_H \\), then no two distinct elements in \\( G \\) can map to the same element in \\( H \\). This is because if \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), then \\( f(a \\cdot b^{-1}) = e_H \\), which implies \\( a \\cdot b^{-1} \\) is in the kernel. If the kernel only contains \\( e_G \\), then \\( a \\cdot b^{-1} = e_G \\), so \\( a = b \\). Therefore, \\( f \\) is one-to-one.\n\nSo, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements.\"\n\nThis statement is about the possible sizes of the image of a group under a homomorphism. The image of a homomorphism \\( f: G \\rightarrow H \\) is the set \\( f(G) = \\{ f(g) \\mid g \\in G \\} \\), which is a subgroup of \\( H \\).\n\nGiven that \\( G \\) has 6 elements, I need to determine if it's possible for \\( f(G) \\) to have 4 elements.\n\nFirst, recall that by the first isomorphism theorem for groups, \\( G / \\ker(f) \\) is isomorphic to \\( f(G) \\). This means that the order of \\( f(G) \\) is equal to the index of \\( \\ker(f) \\) in \\( G \\), or equivalently, \\( |f(G)| = |G| / |\\ker(f)| \\).\n\nSo, if \\( |G| = 6 \\), then \\( |f(G)| = 6 / |\\ker(f)| \\). Since \\( |\\ker(f)| \\) must be a divisor of \\( |G| \\) (by Lagrange's theorem), the possible values for \\( |\\ker(f)| \\) are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nTherefore, the possible orders for \\( f(G) \\) are:\n\n- If \\( |\\ker(f)| = 1 \\), then \\( |f(G)| = 6 \\).\n\n- If \\( |\\ker(f)| = 2 \\), then \\( |f(G)| = 3 \\).\n\n- If \\( |\\ker(f)| = 3 \\), then \\( |f(G)| = 2 \\).\n\n- If \\( |\\ker(f)| = 6 \\), then \\( |f(G)| = 1 \\).\n\nNotice that 4 is not among these possible orders for \\( f(G) \\). So, it seems that the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism cannot have 4 elements.\n\nWait a minute, but this assumes that \\( G \\) is a finite group and \\( H \\) is also a group, which it is, since homomorphisms are between groups. But maybe there's a loophole here that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose \\( G \\) is a group of order 6, and \\( H \\) is some group that has a subgroup of order 4. Could there be a homomorphism from \\( G \\) to \\( H \\) whose image has order 4?\n\nFrom the first isomorphism theorem, as I mentioned earlier, \\( f(G) \\) is isomorphic to \\( G / \\ker(f) \\), so \\( |f(G)| = |G| / |\\ker(f)| \\). As \\( |G| = 6 \\), and \\( |\\ker(f)| \\) must divide \\( |G| \\), the possible orders of \\( f(G) \\) are only 1, 2, 3, and 6, as calculated before.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for \\( f(G) \\) to have order 4, because 4 does not divide 6. In other words, there is no divisor \\( n \\) of 6 such that \\( 6 / n = 4 \\). The only possible indices are those that divide 6.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Statement 1: True\n\n- Statement 2: False\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
