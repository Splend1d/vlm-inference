                    "text": "Let's think about these two scenarios and see which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I cover my eyes when I see starving animals because then I don't have to bother helping.\"\n\nSo, in this situation, the person sees animals that are starving, and instead of trying to help them, they cover their eyes so they don't have to see them and therefore don't feel obligated to do anything about it.\n\nNow, morally, in the US, there's a general expectation to show compassion towards animals, especially those that are suffering. Ignoring their plight by covering one's eyes could be seen as callous and uncaring. It's one thing to not be able to help due to limitations, but actively choosing to ignore it seems problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, it's not illegal to see a starving animal and choose not to help, unless there are specific laws in certain areas requiring people to report or assist injured or starving animals. But morally, it feels like the right thing to do would be to at least try to help or find someone who can.\n\nSo, I would say that in scenario 1, the main character is doing something that is morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I planted a large garden by the side of the narrow public street.\"\n\nHere, the person has planted a garden by the side of a narrow public street. At first glance, this seems like a positive thing\u2014gardening can be beautifying and beneficial for the environment.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the context. The street is described as narrow, which might imply that space is limited. Planting a large garden by the side of the street could potentially encroach on public space or obstruct pedestrians or drivers.\n\nIn the US, it's important to respect public property and not interfere with the proper use of public streets. If the garden is planted in such a way that it obstructs the sidewalk or the street, it could be seen as negligent or even dangerous.\n\nMoreover, without proper permissions or considerations for maintenance, the garden could become a nuisance or attract pests.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the garden is planted within private property limits and doesn't interfere with public access, it could be seen as a positive contribution to the neighborhood.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't specify whether the garden is on private or public property, or whether it causes any obstruction, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nHowever, assuming that the garden is planted on the person's own property and doesn't interfere with the public street, then it's likely not morally wrong.\n\nIf, however, the garden is planted on public property or obstructs the street, then it could be considered morally wrong because it's interfering with public use and potentially causing harm.\n\nSince the scenario doesn't provide enough information to determine the exact circumstances, I'll assume that the garden is planted on private property and doesn't cause any problems, making it not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two scenarios, scenario 1 involves something clearly morally wrong, while scenario 2 does not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
