                    "text": "So I've got these two statements to evaluate, and I need to determine if they're true or false. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** If A is connected, the closure of A must be connected.\n\nHmm, connectedness is a topological property, and closure refers to adding limit points to a set. I need to recall what connected means: a set is connected if it cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open subsets. Now, when you take the closure of a set, you're including all its limit points. I wonder if adding limit points can somehow disconnect the set.\n\nLet me think of some examples. Suppose A is an open interval in the real line, say (0,1). This is connected. Its closure is [0,1], which is also connected. So in this case, it holds.\n\nWhat about a more complicated set? How about the rational numbers in (0,1), denoted as A = (0,1) \u2229 Q. This set is not connected because the rationals are disconnected in the real line. Wait, but the statement assumes A is connected, so this isn't a relevant example.\n\nLet me think of a connected set whose closure might not be connected. Hmm, maybe in a different topological space. What if I consider the topologist's sine curve? That's a classic example of a connected set whose closure has interesting properties.\n\nThe topologist's sine curve is defined as A = { (x, sin(1/x)) : x \u2208 (0,1] } in the plane. This set is connected, and its closure adds the vertical segment {0}\u00d7[-1,1]. The closure is not connected because it consists of two separate pieces: the curve and the vertical segment.\n\nWait, is that correct? Actually, the topologist's sine curve is known to be connected, and its closure is also connected. In fact, the closure is often used as an example of a connected set that is not path-connected.\n\nHmm, so in that case, the closure remains connected. Maybe I need to think of another example.\n\nWhat about considering A = (0,1) in the lower limit topology, where the basis consists of half-open intervals [a,b). In this topology, (0,1) is connected, and its closure is [0,1). Is [0,1) connected in this topology?\n\nWait, is [0,1) connected in the lower limit topology? Let's see. Suppose we try to write [0,1) as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets in this topology. It's not immediately obvious, maybe I need to recall some properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a counterexample in a different space. What if A is a connected subset of a discrete space? In a discrete space, every set is both open and closed, so the only connected sets are singletons. The closure of a singleton is itself, which is connected. So in this case, it holds.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the statement is true in general. Let's try to prove it.\n\nSuppose A is connected, and suppose its closure, denoted by cl(A), is not connected. Then cl(A) can be written as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets U and V in cl(A). Since U and V are open in cl(A), there exist open sets U' and V' in the whole space such that U = U' \u2229 cl(A) and V = V' \u2229 cl(A).\n\nNow, since A is connected, it cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets. Therefore, A cannot be entirely contained in U or V. Wait, no: if A were entirely in U or V, that would be fine, but since cl(A) is not connected, A must intersect both U and V, but not be entirely in either.\n\nBut A is connected, so it cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets. Therefore, A must be entirely contained in either U or V. Suppose A \u2286 U. Then, since cl(A) is the smallest closed set containing A, and U is open and contains A, cl(A) is contained in U, because V is disjoint from U. This would imply that V is empty, which contradicts the assumption that V is non-empty.\n\nTherefore, cl(A) must be connected.\n\nWait, but this seems like a valid proof. So, is Statement 1 true?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a flaw in my reasoning. Let me double-check.\n\nAssuming cl(A) is not connected, I supposed it can be divided into U and V, open in cl(A). Since A is connected, it can't be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets, so it must be entirely in U or V, say U. Then, since cl(A) is the closure of A, and U is open and contains A, cl(A) must be contained in U, making V empty, which is a contradiction. Therefore, cl(A) is connected.\n\nThis seems correct. So, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** Every continuous function f : (0,1) \u2192 (0,1) has a fixed point.\n\nA fixed point of a function f is a point x such that f(x) = x. So, the statement claims that any continuous function from the open interval (0,1) to itself must have at least one fixed point.\n\nLet me think about this. I know that for continuous functions on closed intervals, there are fixed point theorems, like Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, but that applies to compact convex sets, which (0,1) is not compact.\n\nIs there a similar theorem for open intervals? Maybe I can find a counterexample, a continuous function from (0,1) to (0,1) that doesn't have any fixed points.\n\nConsider f(x) = x/2. This function maps (0,1) to (0,1/2), which is subset of (0,1). Does it have a fixed point? Set x = x/2, which implies x = 0, but 0 is not in (0,1). So, no fixed point in this case.\n\nAh, perfect. So, f(x) = x/2 is a continuous function from (0,1) to (0,1) with no fixed points. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nWait, but I should check if f maps (0,1) into itself. For x in (0,1), f(x) = x/2 is in (0,1/2), which is indeed in (0,1). So, yes, it's a valid counterexample.\n\nIs there any continuous function from (0,1) to (0,1) that does have a fixed point? Sure, for example, f(x) = x has every point as a fixed point. Or f(x) = x^2 has a fixed point at x=0, but 0 is not in (0,1). Wait, x^2 in (0,1) has a fixed point at x=0, but since 0 is not in (0,1), it doesn't count. Actually, solving x = x^2 in (0,1) gives x=0 and x=1, neither of which are in (0,1). So, no fixed points in this case.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = x/2 + 1/4. This maps (0,1) to (1/4, 3/4), which is in (0,1). Does it have a fixed point? Set x = x/2 + 1/4, which gives x - x/2 = 1/4, so x/2 = 1/4, hence x = 1/2. Indeed, f(1/2) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2, so x=1/2 is a fixed point. So, in this case, there is a fixed point.\n\nSo, sometimes there is a fixed point, sometimes not. Therefore, the statement that every continuous function from (0,1) to (0,1) has a fixed point is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
