New Year's Day\n\nC. Thanksgiving\n\nD. Christmas\n\nOkay, so first, what does it mean for a holiday to have a \"specific date\"? I think it means that it's fixed on the calendar every year, like July 4th for Independence Day in the U.S.\n\nLet's start with Independence Day. In the U.S., that's July 4th every year. So, that has a specific date.\n\nNew Year's Day is January 1st. That's also a specific date.\n\nChristmas is December 25th. Again, a specific date.\n\nNow, Thanksgiving. In the U.S., Thanksgiving is always on the fourth Thursday of November. So, it changes every year depending on what day of the week November 1st falls on, but it's still tied to a specific day of the week within a month.\n\nWait a minute, is that considered a specific date? It's not a fixed calendar date like the others, but it's still determined by a rule that pins it to a particular day each year.\n\nMaybe the question is getting at whether the holiday is moveable or fixed.\n\nIn that case, perhaps Thanksgiving is the one that isn't attached to a specific date, because it moves around within November.\n\nBut, actually, in the U.S., Thanksgiving is always the fourth Thursday in November, which is a specific rule that assigns it a specific date each year.\n\nComparatively, Easter is a holiday that doesn't have a fixed date and can move around the calendar, but it's not listed here.\n\nLooking back at the options, all of them have specific dates or specific rules that assign them a date each year.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about whether the holiday is tied to a calendar date or to a day of the week.\n\nIndependence Day is on July 4th, regardless of what day of the week that is.\n\nThanksgiving is specifically on a Thursday.\n\nSimilarly, in some countries, Mother's Day or Father's Day are on a specific Sunday in a month.\n\nBut in this list, only Thanksgiving specifies the day of the week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about whether the holiday is tied to a solar or lunar calendar.\n\nBut in the U.S., all these holidays are on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stumped here. Let's consider the options again.\n\nA. Independence Day - July 4th\n\nB. New Year's Day - January 1st\n\nC. Thanksgiving - Fourth Thursday in November\n\nD. Christmas - December 25th\n\nMaybe the difference is that Thanksgiving is the only one defined by a day of the week within a month, rather than a specific calendar date.\n\nSo, perhaps Thanksgiving doesn't have a specific date in the sense that it's not tied to a numerical day like the others.\n\nFor example, July 4th is always July 4th, whether it's a Monday, Tuesday, etc.\n\nThanksgiving, however, is always a Thursday, but the date can be any day from the 22nd to the 28th of November.\n\nSo, in that sense, it's not attached to a specific date, but rather to a specific day of the week within a month.\n\nComparatively, the other holidays are attached to specific dates.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be C. Thanksgiving.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other holidays that might fit this description.\n\nFor example, in some countries, Easter is based on the lunar calendar and moves around the solar calendar.\n\nBut Easter isn't listed here.\n\nSimilarly, Halloween is October 31st, which is a specific date.\n\nSo, among the options given, Thanksgiving seems to be the only one that isn't strictly tied to a numerical date.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Thanksgiving.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
