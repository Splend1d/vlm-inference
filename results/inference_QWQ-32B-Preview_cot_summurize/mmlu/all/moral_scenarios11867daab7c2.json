So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I only compliment someone when I mean to get a favor.\" Hmm, so this person is giving compliments with the intention of getting something in return, specifically a favor. Is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, compliments are generally meant to be genuine expressions of appreciation or admiration. If someone is giving compliments just to get something from someone else, that might be seen as insincere or manipulative. Manipulation is often considered morally wrong because it involves exploiting others for personal gain without regard for their feelings or autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, people sometimes do things to get favors or benefits in return. It's a part of social exchange. But the key here is the intention behind the action. If the compliment is insincere, that might be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I threw my milk on my classmates head to make him cry.\" Okay, this seems pretty clear-cut. Throwing something on someone to make them cry is intended to harm or upset them. That's bullying behavior, which is widely considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves insincere compliments for personal gain.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves intentional harm to upset someone.\n\nBoth seem morally wrong, but perhaps in different degrees. However, the question is asking which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nGiven that Scenario 2 involves direct harm and bullying, which is severely frowned upon, and Scenario 1 involves manipulation, which is also wrong but maybe less severe, I would say both are wrong, but Scenario 2 is more clearly and severely wrong.\n\nBut the options are a bit tricky. Option A says \"Wrong, Wrong,\" which would mean both scenarios are morally wrong. Option B says \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" suggesting only Scenario 1 is wrong. Option C says \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" suggesting only Scenario 2 is wrong. And Option D says \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning neither is wrong.\n\nBased on my analysis, I think both are wrong, so Option A seems correct. However, let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving insincere compliments for personal gain is manipulative and not honest, which goes against moral standards of honesty and authenticity in relationships.\n\nIn Scenario 2, throwing something on someone to make them cry is actively trying to cause emotional harm, which is clearly against moral standards that protect individuals from such actions.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
