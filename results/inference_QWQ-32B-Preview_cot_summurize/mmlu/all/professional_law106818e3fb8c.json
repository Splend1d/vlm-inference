                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the federal court should do in this situation. So, there's a state statute that requires license fees for shrimp boat owners, and the fees are different depending on whether the owner is a resident or a nonresident. A nonresident fisherman was denied a license because he refused to pay the higher fee, and he's suing in federal court to challenge the constitutionality of this statute.\n\nFirst, I need to think about whether the federal court has the authority to hear this case. Since the suit is challenging the constitutionality of a state statute, it seems like a federal court would have jurisdiction under diversity of citizenship or perhaps under federal question jurisdiction, because it involves a federal issue\u2014the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nOption A says the court should hear the case on its merits. That means the court should proceed to decide whether the statute is constitutional or not. But before getting to that, the court needs to make sure it has the power to hear the case in the first place.\n\nOption B suggests dismissing the suit because the resident lacks standing. Standing is about whether the plaintiff has a sufficient connection to the case and has been harmed by the defendant's actions. In this case, the nonresident was denied a license because he refused to pay the higher fee, which directly affects his ability to operate his shrimp boat. So, it seems like he does have standing since he's personally affected by the statute.\n\nOption C says to dismiss the suit because it involves a question of state law. But the suit is challenging the constitutionality of the state statute, which is a federal question. Federal courts have jurisdiction over cases that raise federal questions, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D suggests that the federal court should abstain from jurisdiction and let a state court decide the constitutional issue first. This is something federal courts sometimes do to avoid rushing into decisions on state law issues, especially to give state courts the first chance to interpret their own laws. However, in cases where the plaintiff is challenging the constitutionality of a state statute, federal courts typically go ahead and decide the issue.\n\nLet me think about the Equal Protection Clause. The statute charges higher fees to nonresidents, which could be seen as discriminatory. Generally, state laws that discriminate against nonresidents must satisfy the \"privileges and immunities\" clause of the Constitution, which is part of the Article IV and affects citizens' rights to travel and pursue livelihoods across state lines.\n\nIn this case, the fee for residents is $25 per boat, and for nonresidents, it's $2,500 per boat. That's a significant difference. The state might argue that it has interests in regulating its waters and raising revenue, but the difference in fees could be seen as burdensome to nonresidents.\n\nGiven that the suit is challenging the constitutionality of the statute, and considering that federal courts have jurisdiction over federal questions, it seems like the court should hear the case on its merits. The plaintiff has standing because he's directly affected by the statute, and the issue is a federal one.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A: hear the case on its merits.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any reason the federal court shouldn't hear the case? Abstention doctrines, like the Pullman abstention, suggest that federal courts might stay their hand when a state constitutional issue is involved to allow state courts to interpret their own constitution first. However, here the challenge is to the federal constitution, so that might not apply.\n\nAlso, the Supreme Court case of Martin v. Texas, involving licensing fees for fishermen, might be relevant. In that case, the Court struck down a state law that required nonresidents to pay higher fees than residents for fishing licenses, finding it violated the privileges and immunities clause.\n\nGiven that precedent, it seems even more likely that the federal court should hear the case and decide the constitutional issue.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A: hear the case on its merits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
