I remember that Watergate was a big political scandal in the 1970s involving President Nixon. So, I need to think about which of these options sounds like it might be connected to that.\n\nOption A is \"All the King's Men.\" I think that's a book and a movie about politics, but I don't recall if it's specifically about Watergate. Maybe it's more general.\n\nOption B is \"All the Pretty Horses.\" I remember that's a novel by Cormac McCarthy, and it's more of a western or adventure story, not really political. So, probably not related to Watergate.\n\nOption C is \"All the President's Men.\" That rings a bell. I think this is the movie or book about Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein investigating Watergate for The Washington Post. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nOption D is \"All the Right Moves.\" I think that's a movie about football, maybe starring Tom Cruise. Doesn't seem related to Watergate at all.\n\nSo, based on what I recall, \"All the President's Men\" is the one that's about the Watergate scandal. It's about the journalists who broke the story and exposed what was happening.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should double-check. Watergate involved a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, and the subsequent cover-up by the Nixon administration. \"All the President's Men\" follows the investigation by Woodward and Bernstein, who were reporters at The Washington Post. Their work was crucial in bringing the scandal to light and eventually leading to President Nixon's resignation.\n\nThe other options don't seem relevant. \"All the King's Men\" is a political novel and film, but it's set in the 1930s and is about a governor in the American South. \"All the Pretty Horses\" is a entirely different genre, focusing on a young man's journey through the southwestern United States and Mexico. \"All the Right Moves\" is a sports drama about football.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. \"All the President's Men.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
