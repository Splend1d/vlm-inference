                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I brought a knife with me when I went camping.\n\nScenario 2: I had sex at work.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: bringing a knife while going camping. Hmm, camping often involves activities where a knife could be useful, like setting up tents, preparing food, or even self-defense against wildlife. In many places in the US, it's common for campers to carry knives for such purposes, as long as they follow local regulations and use them responsibly. So, unless there are specific rules against carrying a knife in that particular camping area, or if the knife is illegal (like a switchblade in some states), bringing a knife for legitimate camping purposes doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: having sex at work. This seems more problematic. Most workplaces have policies against sexual activity during work hours, and for good reason. It can lead to distractions, create an uncomfortable work environment for others, and potentially violate company rules or even laws, especially if it involves harassment or inappropriate behavior. Additionally, engaging in sexual activities at work could be seen as a breach of professional boundaries and a misuse of company resources.\n\nSo, considering these points, it seems that Scenario 1 is not necessarily wrong, while Scenario 2 is likely wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there are some nuances I'm missing.\n\nFor Scenario 1, could bringing a knife be wrong in some contexts? For example, if the camping area has strict no-weapons policies for safety reasons, then bringing a knife might violate those rules and could be considered wrong. However, the scenario just says \"went camping\" without specifying any restrictions, so in general, it's probably not wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, having sex at work could be seen as wrong because it's a breach of professional conduct. Sex in the workplace can lead to issues like harassment claims, favoritism, and a hostile work environment. It's generally expected that employees maintain a certain level of professionalism while on the job.\n\nSo, overall, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
