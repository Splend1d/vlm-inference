                    "text": "The Hebrew word \"mashiach\" (\u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7) primarily means \"anointed one.\" In Hebrew, the term is derived from the root \"m-sh-h\" (\u05de-\u05e9-\u05d7), which means to anoint or smear with oil. Historically, in ancient Israel, kings, priests, and prophets were anointed with oil as a symbol of their consecration and investiture into their respective roles.\n\nIn the context of Judaism, \"mashiach\" refers to a future Jewish king from the Davidic line who is expected to rule wisely, bring about peace and prosperity, and usher in a messianic era of global harmony and spiritual renewal. Therefore, while \"anointed one\" is the literal translation, the concept encompasses much more, including the ideas related to the line of David and a future prophetic figure, but it is not synonymous with God himself.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Anointed one\n\nB. God\n\nC. Prophet\n\nD. The line of David\n\nThe most accurate direct translation is A. Anointed one. However, it's important to understand that in Jewish eschatology, the mashiach is a human figure, not divine, and is expected to be a descendant of King David. So, while \"the line of David\" is a related concept, it's not the direct meaning of the word \"mashiach.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
