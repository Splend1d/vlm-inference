So, they must be related to some kind of smooth, extensive deposits.\n\nOption A says \"ancient heavily cratered highlands.\" I think the highlands on the Moon are the lighter areas, and they are indeed ancient and heavily cratered. But the maria are darker, so that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B mentions \"dark lavas inside volcanic calderas.\" That sounds interesting because lavas would be dark, and calderas are volcanic features. However, I'm not sure if the maria are inside calderas or if they cover larger areas.\n\nOption C says \"dark lavas filling older impact basins.\" Hmm, I recall that the maria are thought to be large plains formed by ancient volcanic eruptions that filled in big impact craters or basins. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D is \"the bright regions on the Moon.\" But as I mentioned earlier, the maria are dark areas, not bright ones. So, that can't be right.\n\nBetween options B and C, C seems more accurate because the maria are associated with large impact basins, not just individual volcanic calderas. Also, the term \"maria\" refers to the vast plains, not small calderas.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C: dark lavas filling older impact basins.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
