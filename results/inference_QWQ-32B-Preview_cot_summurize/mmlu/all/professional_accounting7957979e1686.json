                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a U.S. manufacturer with a production operation in Mexico. The product costs 116.50 pesos to produce and ship to Europe, where it sells for 20 euros. We need to find out the profit in U.S. dollars.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the exchange rates given:\n\n- 0.1099 U.S. dollars per 1 Mexican peso.\n\n- 0.8928 U.S. dollars per 1 euro.\n\nOur goal is to find the profit in U.S. dollars, so we need to convert both the cost in pesos and the revenue in euros to U.S. dollars, then subtract the cost from the revenue.\n\nLet's start by converting the cost from pesos to U.S. dollars.\n\nCost in pesos: 116.50 pesos\n\nExchange rate: 0.1099 U.S. dollars per peso\n\nCost in U.S. dollars = 116.50 pesos * 0.1099 U.S. dollars/peso\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n116.50 * 0.1099 = 12.80 U.S. dollars (approximately)\n\nNext, let's convert the revenue from euros to U.S. dollars.\n\nRevenue in euros: 20 euros\n\nExchange rate: 0.8928 U.S. dollars per euro\n\nRevenue in U.S. dollars = 20 euros * 0.8928 U.S. dollars/euro\n\nCalculating that:\n\n20 * 0.8928 = 17.856 U.S. dollars\n\nNow, to find the profit in U.S. dollars, we subtract the cost in U.S. dollars from the revenue in U.S. dollars.\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nProfit = 17.856 - 12.80 = 5.056 U.S. dollars\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's $5.06.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $5.06\n\nB. $6.11\n\nC. $7.20\n\nD. $9.60\n\nIt seems like option A is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, converting the cost:\n\n116.50 pesos * 0.1099 U.S./peso = 12.80 U.S. dollars\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNext, converting the revenue:\n\n20 euros * 0.8928 U.S./euro = 17.856 U.S. dollars\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nThen, profit = 17.856 - 12.80 = 5.056, which rounds to $5.06.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. $5.06.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe I need to consider the exchange rates differently.\n\nWait, the exchange rates are given as U.S. dollars per foreign currency. Is there a possibility that I should be using the inverse of these rates?\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- 0.1099 U.S. dollars are required to buy one Mexican peso.\n\n- 0.8928 U.S. dollars are required to buy one euro.\n\nSo, to buy one peso, you need 0.1099 U.S. dollars, which means the peso is worth 0.1099 U.S. dollars.\n\nSimilarly, one euro is worth 0.8928 U.S. dollars.\n\nSo, when converting pesos to U.S. dollars, multiplying by 0.1099 makes sense because that's the value of one peso in U.S. dollars.\n\nSimilarly, for euros to U.S. dollars, multiplying by 0.8928 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes exchange rates are given as how much foreign currency you get per U.S. dollar, but in this case, it's explicitly stated as U.S. dollars per foreign currency.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the cost in U.S. dollars and the revenue in U.S. dollars, then find the difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the profit in foreign currencies first and then convert, but that might be more complicated.\n\nLet me try that to verify.\n\nFirst, find the profit in pesos and euros.\n\nWait, but the cost is in pesos and the revenue is in euros, so it's not straightforward to find a profit in both currencies.\n\nNo, better to stick with converting both to U.S. dollars first, which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use cross-multiplication with multiple exchange rates, but that seems unnecessary here.\n\nI think my initial method is the most straightforward and correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the profit is $5.06, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
