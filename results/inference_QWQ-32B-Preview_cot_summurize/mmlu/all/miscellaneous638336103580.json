They were also known as the American Party and were primarily composed of native-born white Protestants who were opposed to immigration, particularly from Ireland and Germany, and to the influence of Catholicism in American politics. The name \"Know-Nothings\" came from the secrecy surrounding their activities; members were instructed to say \"I know nothing\" if asked about the party's affairs.\n\nThe Know-Nothings gained significant political power in the 1850s, electing several governors and congressmen, and even running a presidential candidate in 1856. However, the party's focus on nativist and anti-Catholic sentiments alienated many voters, and it began to decline in the late 1850s, eventually dissolving by the mid-1860s.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. a political party."
