I remember something about the NSA getting into trouble around that time, but I need to think carefully about which option is correct.\n\nOption A says that there were revelations about the NSA monitoring American citizens' communications without warrants. I think I've heard about something like that. Wasn't there a program where the NSA was spying on phone calls and emails without going through the proper channels to get warrants? That seems plausible.\n\nOption B mentions a leaked memo linking September 11, 2001, with the Democratic National Committee. Hmm, that sounds a bit far-fetched. I don't recall any major uproar about that. Maybe it's a distractor.\n\nOption C talks about the NSA torturing prisoners in Guantanamo, Cuba. I know there were controversies about treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo, but I thought that was more related to the military and not specifically the NSA. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't remember the NSA being directly involved in torture.\n\nOption D is about a report criticizing the George W. Bush administration for building a case for the Iraq war on a \"quicksand foundation.\" I think there were definitely criticisms of the Bush administration's justification for the Iraq war, but I don't recall that leading to a specific uproar involving the NSA in 2005.\n\nLet me think back to what I know about the NSA and 2005. I believe that around that time, there was a scandal involving warrantless wiretapping. President George W. Bush authorized the NSA to monitor international communications of American citizens without getting warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\nThis program was revealed in some newspaper articles, I think around 2005, and it caused a big controversy because it raised questions about privacy rights and whether the NSA was overstepping its authority. There were debates about whether this was legal and whether it was an invasion of privacy.\n\nSo, based on that, I think option A is the correct answer. The public uproar was caused by revelations that the NSA was monitoring communications without warrants.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider the other options again. Option B about a leaked memo linking 9/11 with the DNC\u2014 I don't recall anything like that causing a major uproar involving the NSA. It might be a red herring.\n\nOption C about the NSA torturing prisoners in Guantanamo\u2014 again, I don't think the NSA was directly involved in torture. That was more related to CIA and military interrogations.\n\nOption D about a report criticizing the justification for the Iraq war\u2014 while that was certainly a issue, I don't see a direct connection to the NSA.\n\nTherefore, I'm fairly confident that option A is the correct answer. The public uproar involved revelations about the NSA monitoring communications without warrants.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
