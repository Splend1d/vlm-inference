                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: there are 230 calories in 4 ounces of a type of ice cream, and I need to find out how many calories are in 6 ounces of the same ice cream. The options are A. 232, B. 236, C. 345, and D. 460. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the amount of ice cream and the calories. It seems like the calories are proportional to the ounces. So, if I have more ounces, I should have more calories, right? Okay, so it's a proportion problem.\n\nI know that 4 ounces have 230 calories. I need to find out how many calories are in 6 ounces. Maybe I can set up a proportion equation to solve for the unknown calories. Let's denote the unknown number of calories as x.\n\nSo, the proportion would be:\n\n4 ounces / 230 calories = 6 ounces / x calories\n\nWait, actually, that might not be the best way to set it up. Maybe I should think of it in terms of calories per ounce.\n\nIf 4 ounces have 230 calories, then one ounce would have 230 divided by 4 calories. Let me calculate that.\n\n230 divided by 4 is:\n\n230 \u00f7 4 = 57.5 calories per ounce.\n\nOkay, so each ounce has 57.5 calories. Now, to find out how many calories are in 6 ounces, I can multiply the calories per ounce by 6.\n\nSo, 57.5 calories/ounce \u00d7 6 ounces = ?\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n57.5 \u00d7 6.\n\nWell, 50 \u00d7 6 is 300, and 7.5 \u00d7 6 is 45, so adding them together is 345.\n\nSo, 57.5 \u00d7 6 = 345 calories.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 345 is one of them.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm. Maybe using the proportion I thought of earlier.\n\nSo, setting up the proportion:\n\n4 ounces is to 230 calories as 6 ounces is to x calories.\n\nIn mathematical terms:\n\n4/230 = 6/x\n\nWait, actually, that's the same as what I did earlier, but inverted. Maybe I should set it up as:\n\n230 calories / 4 ounces = x calories / 6 ounces\n\nThat makes more sense because both sides are in calories per ounce.\n\nSo:\n\n230/4 = x/6\n\nNow, solving for x:\n\nx = (230/4) \u00d7 6\n\nWe already know 230/4 is 57.5, and 57.5 \u00d7 6 is 345.\n\nSo, again, we get x = 345 calories.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of ratios. The ratio of ounces is 6 to 4, which simplifies to 3 to 2.\n\nSo, if 4 ounces have 230 calories, then 6 ounces would have (3/2) times the calories.\n\nSo, 230 \u00d7 (3/2) = ?\n\n230 \u00d7 1.5 = 345 calories.\n\nAgain, the same answer, 345 calories.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using cross-multiplication in the proportion.\n\nStarting with:\n\n230/4 = x/6\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n230 \u00d7 6 = 4 \u00d7 x\n\nSo, 1380 = 4x\n\nNow, solving for x:\n\nx = 1380 \u00f7 4 = 345 calories.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, it seems consistent that 6 ounces of ice cream have 345 calories.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 345 is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A. 232: That's only a slight increase from 230, which doesn't make sense because increasing the ounces from 4 to 6 should increase the calories proportionally, which is more than just 2 calories.\n\nOption B. 236: Similar to A, this is only a small increase from 230, which isn't proportional for increasing the ounces by 50%.\n\nOption D. 460: This is double the original 230 calories, which would correspond to 8 ounces (since 4 ounces are 230, 8 would be 460), but we only have 6 ounces, which is less than 8.\n\nTherefore, the only logical and mathematically consistent answer is C. 345 calories.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
