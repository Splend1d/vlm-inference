I think I remember something about truth tables, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this.\n\nFirst, I know that a truth table lists all possible combinations of inputs and their corresponding outputs for a logical gate. For a NAND gate, the output is the negation of the AND operation. So, for three inputs, say A, B, and C, the output is NOT (A AND B AND C).\n\nNow, to determine the number of entries, I need to find out how many different combinations of inputs there are. Each input can be either 0 or 1, right? So for three inputs, it should be 2^3, which is 8.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of entries = 2^number of inputs\n\nHere, number of inputs is 3, so 2^3 = 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For one input, say a NOT gate, there are 2 possible inputs: 0 and 1.\n\nFor two inputs, like an AND gate, there are 4 possible combinations: 00, 01, 10, 11.\n\nSo, for three inputs, it should be 8 combinations: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111.\n\nThat makes sense. So, the truth table should have 8 entries.\n\nBut let's see why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A is 3, which is the number of inputs, not the number of combinations.\n\nOption B is 6, which is 3 factorial, but that doesn't apply here.\n\nOption D is 9, which is 3^2, but again, not relevant for determining truth table entries.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be 8.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer is C. 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
