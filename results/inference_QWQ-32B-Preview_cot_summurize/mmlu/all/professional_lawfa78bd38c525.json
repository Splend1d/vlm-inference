The widower lived in a farmhouse on the lemon grove and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. The antebellum mansion was accessible by a little- used road that ran west to east from the farmlgrove border to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove. The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently. In order for the farmer to reach the daughter's house, it was necessary for him to travel over the little-used road across the lemon grove. Many years later, the farmer, who was still having an affair with the daughter, met her father at a Rotary Club meeting. They struck up a conversation, and the widower asked the farmer, \"Have you been driving your pickup along that little-used back road on my property?\" The farmer, who was afraid to tell the widower about his love affair with the daughter, responded with a half-truth, \"Yes, I've been using it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway. \" Unaware that the farmer was also using the path to get to the antebellum mansion to see the daughter, the widower said, \"No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road. \"Thereafter, the widower found out about his daughter's relationship with the farmer. Infuriated, the widower confronted the farmer and told him, \"Listen, you lying sneak, if I catch you on my property again, I'm going to have you arrested for trespass. \" The farmer replied, \"Sorry, Pops, but I've acquired an easement over that roadway, and I'll continue to use it anytime I want. \"Then, the widower institutes an appropriate action to enjoin the farmer from using the roadway across the lemon grove. If the widower prevails, it will be because the farmer's use was\n\nA. fraudulent.\nB. permissive.\nC. not continuous.\nD. not open and notorious.\n"

                    "text": "So here's this scenario involving a widower, his daughter, and a farmer, all with properties adjacent to each other and a little-used road in between. It's a bit tangled, but I'll try to sort it out.\n\nFirst, there's this widower who owns a 30-acre lemon grove in a suburb. He lives in a farmhouse on the property and uses it to grow produce. Next door to the west is a 10-acre farm owned by a farmer. To the east of the lemon grove is a four-lane highway.\n\nThe widower decides to gift his daughter an antebellum mansion that's located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. He deeds it to her and her heirs, and she records the deed and takes possession immediately.\n\nNow, the daughter and the farmer start having an affair and see each other frequently. To get to her house, the farmer has to use this little-used road that runs from the western border of the lemon grove (adjacent to the farm) eastward to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove.\n\nA few years down the line, at a Rotary Club meeting, the widower confronts the farmer, asking if he's been driving his pickup on that little-used road on his property. The farmer, trying to cover up his affair, half-truths that he's been using it as a shortcut to the highway. The widower, unaware of the affair, doesn't seem too bothered, saying there's no problem as long as it's the farmer using it.\n\nBut later, the widower finds out about the affair and gets furious. He confronts the farmer and threatens to have him arrested for trespass if he's caught on the property again. The farmer retorts that he's acquired an easement over the roadway and will continue to use it whenever he wants.\n\nSo, the widower decides to sue for an injunction to stop the farmer from using the roadway across the lemon grove. The question is, if the widower prevails, it will be because the farmer's use was:\n\nA. fraudulent.\n\nB. permissive.\n\nC. not continuous.\n\nD. not open and notorious.\n\nOkay, so this seems to be about easements, specifically easement by prescription or possibly easement by implication. I need to recall the elements required for someone to establish an easement by prescription.\n\nGenerally, to establish an easement by prescription, the use must be:\n\n1. Continuous and uninterrupted for the statutory period (which varies by jurisdiction, but often 10, 15, or 20 years).\n\n2. Open and notorious, meaning the use is obvious and not secretive.\n\n3. Adverse to the true owner's interests, meaning without permission.\n\n4. Sometimes, the user must pay taxes on the property, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nIn this case, the farmer has been using the road across the lemon grove to reach the daughter's mansion. The widower initially didn't seem to mind, thinking it was just a shortcut to the highway. But once he found out about the affair, he changed his stance.\n\nFirst, let's consider if the farmer's use was permissive or adverse.\n\nWhen the widower asked the farmer if he was using the road and the farmer said he was using it as a shortcut to the highway, the widower responded, \"No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road.\" This seems to indicate that the widower was okay with the farmer using the road, at least initially.\n\nHowever, after finding out about the affair, the widower changed his mind and threatened to have the farmer arrested for trespass.\n\nSo, was the farmer's use permissive or adverse?\n\nIf the widower gave implicit permission by not objecting and even acknowledging the use, then the farmer's use might be considered permissive, not adverse.\n\nEasements by prescription require adverse use, meaning without the owner's permission. If the use was permissive, meaning the owner allowed it, then the farmer cannot later claim an easement by prescription.\n\nSo, option B, permissive, might be the reason the widower prevails.\n\nBut let's look at the other options.\n\nOption A is fraudulent. While there is deception involved, in that the farmer was hiding his affair and only partially truthfully explaining his use of the road, I'm not sure if fraud is directly relevant to the establishment of an easement.\n\nOption C is not continuous. The problem says the farmer has been using the road for many years, so it seems like the use has been continuous.\n\nOption D is not open and notorious. The road is described as little-used, but the farmer was using it frequently to see his lover. If his use was obvious and noticeable, it was likely open and notorious.\n\nSo, going back to option B, permissive.\n\nIf the farmer's use was permissive, meaning he had the widower's permission to use the road, then he cannot establish an easement by prescription, which requires adverse use without permission.\n\nTherefore, if the widower prevails, it would be because the farmer's use was permissive, not adverse.\n\nBut wait, after the widower found out about the affair and threatened to have the farmer arrested for trespass, does that change the nature of the farmer's use?\n\nOnce the owner revokes permission and expressly forbids further use, any subsequent use would be adverse, not permissive.\n\nHowever, the widower sues to enjoin the farmer from using the roadway, implying that the farmer continues to use it despite the threat.\n\nSo, if the farmer continues to use the road after being told not to, his use would then be adverse.\n\nBut for the period before the widower found out about the affair and gave permission, the use was permissive.\n\nEasements by prescription typically require continuous use for the entire statutory period under adverse conditions.\n\nIf part of that period was permissive, it might not count towards the statutory period.\n\nTherefore, the farmer may not have met the requirement of continuous adverse use for the entire prescribed period.\n\nHence, the widower could prevail on the grounds that the farmer's use was permissive, not adverse.\n\nOption B seems correct.\n\nBut let's consider if fraud plays a role.\n\nThe farmer was deceitful about the true nature of his use, hiding his affair with the daughter.\n\nHowever, fraud isn't typically an element in establishing an easement by prescription.\n\nThe key is whether the use was adverse or permissive.\n\nSo, even if there was fraud involved in concealing the affair, it doesn't directly affect the legal status of the easement.\n\nTherefore, option A, fraudulent, is less likely to be the reason the widower prevails.\n\nOption C, not continuous, doesn't seem applicable since the farmer has been using the road for many years.\n\nOption D, not open and notorious, also seems unlikely since the road was being used frequently, and the widower was aware of the farmer's use.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is B, permissive.\n\nThe farmer's use was permissive, not adverse, which is a requirement for establishing an easement by prescription.\n\nHence, the widower would prevail in enjoining the farmer from using the roadway.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
