                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Grady and his little brother Noah riding their bikes. Grady rides 60% faster than Noah, and in two hours, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah. We need to find out how fast Noah rides in miles per hour.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for Grady to ride 60% faster than Noah. If Noah's speed is, say, \\(n\\) miles per hour, then Grady's speed is \\(n\\) plus 60% of \\(n\\). Mathematically, that's:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Grady's speed} = n + 0.6n = 1.6n \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nNow, both of them ride for two hours. So, the distance each one covers can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time}\n\\]\n\nFor Noah, the distance is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Noah's distance} = n \\times 2 = 2n \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nFor Grady, it's:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Grady's distance} = 1.6n \\times 2 = 3.2n \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah in those two hours. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Grady's distance} = \\text{Noah's distance} + 12\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions we have:\n\n\\[\n3.2n = 2n + 12\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\(n\\):\n\nSubtract \\(2n\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3.2n - 2n = 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1.2n = 12\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.2:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nSo, Noah rides at 10 miles per hour.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIf Noah rides at 10 mph for 2 hours, he covers:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 2 = 20 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nGrady rides 60% faster, so his speed is:\n\n\\[\n10 + 0.6 \\times 10 = 16 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nIn 2 hours, Grady covers:\n\n\\[\n16 \\times 2 = 32 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nIndeed, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah:\n\n\\[\n32 - 20 = 12 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nSo, our solution checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]\n"
