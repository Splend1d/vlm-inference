                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about voting populations. I need to pick the most accurate statement from the options given. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Individuals are less likely to vote in a closely contested race.\" Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. You'd think that in a close race, people would be more motivated to vote because their vote might make a difference. But maybe there's a twist here. I recall that sometimes in very close races, people might feel like their vote doesn't matter because it's so divided, or perhaps there's some other factor at play. But generally, I think people are more likely to vote when the race is close because it's more exciting and the outcome is uncertain. So, I'm leaning towards thinking this statement might not be accurate.\n\nOption B: \"Voters are more likely to vote at age 18 than they are at age 65.\" This one seems off too. Traditionally, voter turnout is higher among older age groups, including seniors, compared to younger voters. Young people, especially those just turning 18, often have lower voting rates due to various reasons like being new to the process, less established in their lives, or perhaps less interested in politics. So, this statement appears to be incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"An individual with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than an individual who has only a high school diploma.\" This seems plausible. Education level is often correlated with voting behavior. People with higher education levels tend to have more knowledge about politics, feel more confident in their voting decisions, and may have a stronger sense of civic duty. So, it makes sense that someone with a graduate degree would be more likely to vote than someone with just a high school diploma.\n\nOption D: \"Affluent individuals are less likely to vote than impoverished individuals.\" This one surprises me. Generally, affluent individuals have more resources, stability, and possibly more at stake in electoral outcomes, which might motivate them to vote. On the other hand, impoverished individuals might face more barriers to voting, such as lack of transportation, ID issues, or simply being less engaged in the political process due to feeling disconnected from it. So, this statement seems contrary to what I believe is true.\n\nBased on my initial thoughts, option C seems to be the most accurate. But let's double-check.\n\nFirst, confirm about education level and voting. Yes, studies consistently show that higher education levels are associated with higher voting rates. So, C seems solid.\n\nNow, about age. Option B suggests that 18-year-olds are more likely to vote than 65-year-olds, which contradicts general trends where older adults have higher voting rates. So, B is likely incorrect.\n\nRegarding closely contested races, option A, it's generally believed that closer races increase voter turnout because every vote counts more. So, A seems inaccurate.\n\nFinally, option D about affluence and voting. Actually, affluent individuals tend to vote at higher rates than less affluent individuals. Voting rates increase with income levels. So, D is not accurate.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is likely option C: \"An individual with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than an individual who has only a high school diploma.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
