                    "text": "Let's see. I have these premises in propositional logic:\n\n1. A \u2283 (B \u2022 C)\n\n2. ~(B \u2022 C)\n\n3. A \u2228 (D \u2228 B)\n\nAnd I need to find which of the options is an immediate consequence of these premises. The options are:\n\nA. A\n\nB. ~A\n\nC. B\n\nD. ~B\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what an \"immediate consequence\" means. I think it means something that can be directly inferred from the premises with just one step of logical reasoning.\n\nAlright, let's look at premise 1: A \u2283 (B \u2022 C). This means that if A is true, then both B and C must be true.\n\nPremise 2: ~(B \u2022 C). This means that it's not the case that both B and C are true. So, at least one of B or C is false.\n\nPremise 3: A \u2228 (D \u2228 B). This is a bit more complex. It says that either A is true, or D is true, or B is true.\n\nOkay, let's see what I can get from premises 1 and 2.\n\nFrom premise 1: A \u2283 (B \u2022 C)\n\nAnd premise 2: ~(B \u2022 C)\n\nIf A were true, then according to premise 1, (B \u2022 C) would have to be true. But premise 2 says that ~(B \u2022 C), meaning (B \u2022 C) is false. So, if A were true, it would lead to (B \u2022 C) being true, but premise 2 says (B \u2022 C) is false. Therefore, A can't be true. So, A must be false.\n\nWait, that sounds like denying the consequent. In logic, denying the consequent is a valid argument form: If P \u2283 Q, and ~Q, then ~P.\n\nSo, from A \u2283 (B \u2022 C), and ~(B \u2022 C), we can infer ~A.\n\nSo, ~A is an immediate consequence.\n\nLooking at the options, B is ~A, so that seems to be the answer.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are other immediate consequences.\n\nLooking at premise 3: A \u2228 (D \u2228 B)\n\nSince we've concluded that ~A, meaning A is false, then for the disjunction A \u2228 (D \u2228 B) to be true, (D \u2228 B) must be true.\n\nSo, D \u2228 B is true.\n\nBut from premise 2: ~(B \u2022 C), which is equivalent to ~B \u2228 ~C (by De Morgan's law).\n\nBut I'm not sure if I can get more information from this immediately.\n\nLooking back, the question asks for an immediate consequence, and I think ~A is directly inferable from premises 1 and 2.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. ~A.\n\nBut let's see if there's a way to get to another option.\n\nOption C is B. Can I determine anything about B directly?\n\nFrom premise 2: ~(B \u2022 C), which means that either B is false or C is false.\n\nBut I don't have information about C, so I can't directly conclude anything about B alone.\n\nOption D is ~B. But again, from ~(B \u2022 C), it could be that B is true and C is false, or B is false and C is true, or both are false.\n\nSo, I can't immediately conclude ~B.\n\nOption A is A, but we've already inferred ~A, so that can't be.\n\nTherefore, the only immediate consequence seems to be ~A.\n\nI think the answer is B. ~A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
