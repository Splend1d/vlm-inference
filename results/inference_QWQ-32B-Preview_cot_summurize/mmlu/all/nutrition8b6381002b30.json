                    "text": "The correct answer is D. 32.\n\nLet me explain how we arrive at this number. The complete oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and water involves several steps, primarily occurring through glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle), and the electron transport chain.\n\n1. **Glycolysis:** This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and breaks down glucose into two pyruvate molecules. During glycolysis, there is a net gain of 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule.\n\n2. **Pyruvate Oxidation:** Each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle. This step does not directly produce ATP but is necessary for the cycle to proceed.\n\n3. **Krebs Cycle:** For each acetyl-CoA that enters the cycle, the cell gains 3 NADH molecules and 1 FADH2 molecule, and 1 ATP is produced directly through substrate-level phosphorylation. Since there are two acetyl-CoA molecules per glucose, this results in 2 ATP, 6 NADH, and 2 FADH2.\n\n4. **Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxidative Phosphorylation:** The NADH and FADH2 molecules produced earlier donate their electrons to the ETC, which generates a proton gradient used to produce ATP. Generally, each NADH molecule can generate about 2.5 ATP, and each FADH2 can generate about 1.5 ATP. Therefore, with 10 NADH (from glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, and the Krebs cycle) and 2 FADH2, the ETC can produce approximately 32 ATP.\n\nAdding up all the ATP produced:\n\n- Glycolysis: 2 ATP\n\n- Krebs Cycle: 2 ATP\n\n- ETC: 32 ATP\n\nTotal: 36 ATP\n\nHowever, in the context of cellular respiration, some ATP is used in the process, such as the transport of NADH from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria. Therefore, the net yield is often considered to be 32 ATP per glucose molecule.\n\nIt's worth noting that different sources may give slightly different numbers due to variations in how ATP production is accounted for, but 32 is the most commonly accepted value.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
