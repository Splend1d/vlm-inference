                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the biotic factor that affects the growth rate of a population from these options. So, first things first, I should know what a biotic factor is.\n\nBiotic factors are living things or things that were once living that can influence an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. That means they include things like predators, parasites, competitors, and even the organisms of the same species.\n\nOn the other hand, abiotic factors are non-living things that can affect an organism, like temperature, water, sunlight, and soil.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Volcanic eruption - That's a natural disaster caused by geological processes. It's not a living thing, so it's abiotic.\n\nB. Glacier melting - This is related to climate change and is also an abiotic factor because it's a physical process.\n\nC. Destruction of the ozone layer - This is an environmental issue caused by chemicals released into the atmosphere. Again, it's not a living thing, so it's abiotic.\n\nD. Sudden reduction in the animal food resource - Now, this one sounds interesting. If there's a reduction in food resources, that could be due to overconsumption by the population itself or maybe competition from other species. Food is essential for growth and reproduction, so a reduction in food could slow down population growth.\n\nBut is \"animal food resource\" a biotic or abiotic factor? Well, food comes from other living organisms, like plants or other animals, so it's related to living things. Therefore, it's a biotic factor.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, A, B, and C are abiotic factors, while D is a biotic factor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Sudden reduction in the animal food resource.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
