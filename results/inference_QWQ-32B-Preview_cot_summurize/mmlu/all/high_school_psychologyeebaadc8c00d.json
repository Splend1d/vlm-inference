                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about supervision in school psychology, guided by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) position statement. The question is asking about the accuracy of statements regarding school psychologists who will be supervising in a school district. We have four options, and we need to determine which one is most accurate based on NASP's guidelines.\n\nFirst, let's understand what supervision in school psychology entails. Supervision is a critical component in the training and professional development of school psychologists, ensuring that they provide effective and ethical services to students, families, and schools. NASP has established standards and guidelines for supervision to maintain quality and professionalism in the field.\n\nOption A states: \"They need provide supervision only to school psychologists who are not fully certified or licensed and to any school psychology interns.\" This suggests that supervision is required only for those who are not yet fully credentialed. However, supervision is important not only for trainees but also for practicing school psychologists to support their professional growth and ensure compliance with best practices. Therefore, this option might be too narrow.\n\nOption B says: \"They should provide professional but not administrative supervision.\" This differentiates between professional and administrative supervision. Professional supervision focuses on the psychological services and interventions, professional development, and ethical considerations. Administrative supervision, on the other hand, deals with organizational and managerial aspects. NASP likely emphasizes the importance of professional supervision in maintaining quality services. However, in school settings, there might be overlap between professional and administrative roles, so this distinction is important to consider.\n\nOption C claims: \"They are eligible to serve as supervisors after one year of experience as a school psychologist.\" This seems rather brief for someone to take on a supervisory role. Supervision is a specialized skill that requires not only experience but also specific training in supervision techniques, ethics, and professional standards. NASP probably has more stringent requirements for who can serve as a supervisor.\n\nOption D states: \"They should hold the Nationally Certified School Psychologist credential or the state school psychologist credential.\" This option is focusing on the qualifications and credentials required for supervisors. Holding a nationally certified or state-issued credential indicates that the individual has met certain educational and professional standards. It makes sense that supervisors should have these credentials to ensure they have the necessary knowledge and skills to guide others.\n\nConsidering these points, let's think about which option is most accurate according to NASP's position statement.\n\nFirst, NASP likely requires that supervisors have substantial experience and specific training in supervision beyond just one year of practice. Therefore, option C might not align with NASP's standards.\n\nOption A's limitation of supervision only to those not fully certified or licensed seems too restrictive, as ongoing supervision can benefit all school psychologists, regardless of their certification status.\n\nOption B distinguishes between professional and administrative supervision, which is important, but it doesn't directly address the qualifications or responsibilities of supervisors in a way that seems to be the primary focus of the question.\n\nOption D emphasizes the importance of holding the Nationally Certified School Psychologist (NCSP) credential or the state school psychologist credential. This aligns with ensuring that supervisors have met rigorous standards in their field, making them qualified to guide others.\n\nGiven this analysis, option D appears to be the most accurate statement concerning the qualifications of school psychologists who will be supervising in a school district, as per NASP's position.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, it's essential to consider if NASP has specific requirements for supervisors beyond holding the NCSP or state credential.\n\nNASP likely has additional standards for supervisors, such as:\n\n1. Advanced training in supervision.\n\n2. Demonstrated competence in school psychology practices.\n\n3. Understanding of ethical and legal issues in supervision.\n\n4. Experience in providing supervision.\n\nTherefore, while holding the NCSP or state credential is important, it might not be the sole requirement for serving as a supervisor.\n\nBut among the given options, D seems to be the most accurate, as it highlights the necessary credentialing, which is fundamental for any supervisory role in school psychology.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the National Association of School Psychologists' position statement on supervision in school psychology, the most accurate statement concerning school psychologists who will be supervising in a school district is that they should hold the Nationally Certified School Psychologist credential or the state school psychologist credential.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
