                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about when Greek philosophers started rejecting the anthropomorphic view of the divine. The options are:\n\nA. Early Third Century BCE\n\nB. Second and First Century BCE\n\nC. Late Sixth Century BCE\n\nD. Fourth and Third Century BCE\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"anthropomorphic view of the divine\" means. Anthropomorphic means attributing human characteristics or forms to non-human things, like gods. So, the anthropomorphic view of the divine is when gods are depicted with human-like bodies and emotions.\n\nNow, I need to think about when Greek philosophers began to reject this idea. I remember that in early Greek religion, gods like Zeus, Athena, and Apollo were all depicted with human forms and personalities. But as philosophy developed, some thinkers started to question this view.\n\nLet me think about the pre-Socratic philosophers in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE. For example, Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes were more interested in natural explanations for the world, but I'm not sure if they directly rejected the anthropomorphic view of gods.\n\nThen there's Socrates in the late fifth and early fourth centuries BCE. He was more focused on ethics and the idea of a divine being, but I don't recall if he rejected the anthropomorphic view.\n\nPlato, Socrates' student, had a more abstract concept of the divine in his theory of Forms, where the highest form is the Form of the Good. This seems more removed from human characteristics.\n\nAristotle, Plato's student, also had a more abstract view of God as the \"unmoved mover,\" which doesn't have a human form.\n\nSo, it seems like by the fourth century BCE, some philosophers were moving away from the anthropomorphic view.\n\nBut let's consider the Hellenistic period, which is the third century BCE and onwards. There were schools like Stoicism and Epicureanism that had their own views on divinity.\n\nEpicurus, for example, believed in gods but thought they were indifferent to human affairs and didn't interfere in the world. Stoics had a more pantheistic view, seeing God as pervading all of nature.\n\nBoth of these views seem to move away from the traditional anthropomorphic gods.\n\nSo, was there a major shift in the early third century BCE? Or perhaps in the second and first centuries BCE?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was in the late sixth century BCE, with some of the early philosophers.\n\nWait, the late sixth century BCE was around the time of Heraclitus and Parmenides, who were more focused on natural philosophy and the nature of reality, but I don't recall them explicitly rejecting anthropomorphic gods.\n\nPerhaps it was in the fourth and third centuries BCE, with Plato and Aristotle leading the way towards more abstract concepts of the divine, and then the Hellenistic philosophers further developing these ideas.\n\nGiven that, option D, Fourth and Third Century BCE, seems plausible.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn the early third century BCE, that's around the time of Zeno of Citium, who founded Stoicism. Stoicism did have a more abstract view of God.\n\nIn the second and first centuries BCE, Epicureanism was influential, and their view of gods was also not anthropomorphic in the traditional sense.\n\nHowever, I think the shift towards rejecting the anthropomorphic view started earlier, in the fourth century BCE with Plato and Aristotle.\n\nSo, maybe option D is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is about when this rejection became more widespread or mainstream, perhaps it was in the Hellenistic period, which is the third, second, and first centuries BCE.\n\nBut since the question specifies \"major shift,\" I think it's referring to when this change began to occur significantly.\n\nGiven that, I would go with D. Fourth and Third Century BCE.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
