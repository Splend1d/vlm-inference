                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to recall the structure of adenovirus. I remember that viruses have different shapes, and adenoviruses have a specific structure that makes them unique.\n\nOption A says \"Icosahedron.\" I know that an icosahedron is a shape with 20 triangular faces. Many viruses have this kind of symmetry, like poliovirus and rhinovirus. So, maybe adenoviruses also have an icosahedral shape, but I think there's more to it.\n\nOption B is \"Icosahedron with slender fibers.\" That sounds familiar. I think adenoviruses have some sort of fibers protruding from their surface. Maybe these are used for attaching to host cells.\n\nOption C says \"'Complex' structure not yet fully explored.\" Hmm, that seems a bit vague. If this were the case, I'd expect more specific information in my studies. I don't think this is the correct answer.\n\nOption D is \"Flexuous lipid-containing structure.\" I know that some viruses have flexible, thread-like shapes, and some contain lipids in their envelopes. But I don't recall adenoviruses being described this way.\n\nLet me think again. Adenoviruses are known for causing respiratory infections and other diseases. Their structure must be distinctive to help them infect cells effectively.\n\nI think the key here is the presence of those slender fibers. I believe these are called spike glycoproteins or simply spikes, which help the virus attach to specific receptors on the host cell surface.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I would go with option B: \"Icosahedron with slender fibers.\" This seems to match what I recall about adenovirus structure.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption A, \"Icosahedron,\" might be partially correct because the adenovirus likely has an icosahedral capsid, which is the protein shell that encases the viral genome. However, the presence of the fibers seems like a unique feature that sets it apart from other icosahedral viruses.\n\nOption C, \"'Complex' structure not yet fully explored,\" doesn't seem right because adenoviruses have been studied quite extensively, and their structure is well characterized.\n\nOption D, \"Flexuous lipid-containing structure,\" doesn't sound right for adenoviruses. I think this description might fit enveloped viruses like influenza or HIV, which have lipid envelopes and may have a more flexible shape. Adenoviruses, however, are non-enveloped, meaning they don't have a lipid envelope; they're more stable and have a protein capsid.\n\nTherefore, based on my reasoning, I'll stick with option B: \"Icosahedron with slender fibers.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
