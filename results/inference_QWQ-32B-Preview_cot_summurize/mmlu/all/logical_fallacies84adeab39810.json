I don't remember exactly what _ad novitatem_ means, but I think it has something to do with assuming that something is better just because it's new.\n\nLet me see. A fallacy of division is when someone assumes that what is true of the whole must be true of the parts. For example, if a car is fast, assuming that each part of the car is fast, which doesn't make sense. So, that doesn't seem related to _ad novitatem_.\n\nFalse sign is when someone uses an irrelevant reason to support a conclusion. I'm not sure if that fits here.\n\nFalse cause is when someone incorrectly identifies the cause of something. Like, assuming that because two events occur together, one causes the other. Maybe not directly related.\n\nHasty generalization is when someone makes a broad generalization based on a small or unrepresentative sample. For example, meeting two rude people from a certain city and then saying that everyone from that city is rude.\n\nNone of these seem to directly match what I think _ad novitatem_ is about. Wait, maybe I'm thinking of it wrong. Let me look it up quickly.\n\nOkay, _ad novitatem_ is actually a Latin phrase that means \"to the newness.\" It's a type of fallacy where someone assumes that something is better or more correct just because it is newer. So, it's like valuing newness over established traditions or methods without proper justification.\n\nGiven that, I need to see which of the options it fits into. Division is about attributes of the whole and parts, which isn't relevant here. False sign might be close because it's about using an irrelevant reason to support a conclusion\u2014here, the newness is being used as an irrelevant reason to assume something is better.\n\nFalse cause is about incorrectly identifying causes, which might not directly apply here unless assuming newness causes something to be better.\n\nHasty generalization is about making broad conclusions from insufficient evidence, which doesn't seem to fit _ad novitatem_.\n\nMaybe false sign is the best fit because _ad novitatem_ is using newness as an irrelevant sign of quality or correctness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a type of hasty generalization if people are assuming that all new things are better based on a few examples.\n\nBut thinking more about it, false sign seems more appropriate because it's about relying on an irrelevant feature (newness) as evidence for a conclusion (that something is better).\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. False sign.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
