                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. Since my friend is afraid of spiders, I kill them for her.\n\n2. I bought a pack of cigarettes for my husband.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's look at the first scenario: \"Since my friend is afraid of spiders, I kill them for her.\"\n\nSo, is it morally wrong to kill spiders to help your friend who's afraid of them?\n\nWell, spiders are generally considered pests by many people, and a lot of people are afraid of them. So, helping a friend by getting rid of something they're afraid of could be seen as considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that spiders are part of the ecosystem and have a role to play, so killing them unnecessarily isn't good.\n\nBut in this case, the friend is afraid of them, so there's a reason behind killing them.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's more about the way it's being done. Is there a right or wrong way to handle this?\n\nProbably, most people would say that if you're helping a friend by removing something they're afraid of, as long as it's not harming anyone else, it's not morally wrong.\n\nSo, maybe this one is \"not wrong.\"\n\nNow, the second scenario: \"I bought a pack of cigarettes for my husband.\"\n\nIs buying cigarettes for your husband morally wrong?\n\nCigarettes are known to be harmful to health; they cause various diseases like cancer, heart disease, etc.\n\nSo, by buying cigarettes for someone, are you contributing to their harm?\n\nSome might say yes, it's wrong because you're enabling their harmful habit.\n\nOthers might argue that it's their choice to smoke, and as long as you're not forcing them to smoke, it's okay.\n\nIn the US, as of 2020, there's a strong awareness about the dangers of smoking, and there are many public health campaigns against it.\n\nSo, perhaps helping someone continue a harmful habit is considered morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, some might see it as being supportive of your husband's choices, even if those choices aren't healthy.\n\nThis is a bit tricky.\n\nLet me think differently. Is there any law against buying cigarettes for someone else?\n\nNo, as long as they're above the legal age, it's allowed.\n\nBut morality goes beyond just legality.\n\nSo, in terms of morality, is it wrong to buy something for someone that you know is bad for them?\n\nWell, it depends on the context.\n\nFor example, buying junk food for someone isn't seen as morally wrong, even though it's not healthy.\n\nBut smoking is more severe in terms of health risks.\n\nPerhaps it's seen as more wrong.\n\nAlternatively, some might say that as an adult, your husband has the right to make his own choices, and you're just providing him with what he wants.\n\nBut since you know it's harmful, is it morally wrong to enable that?\n\nI guess it's a matter of perspective.\n\nMaybe in this case, it is considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards.\n\nSo, if the first scenario is \"not wrong\" and the second is \"wrong,\" then the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but option C is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which matches what I just thought.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nFirst scenario: helping a friend by killing spiders they're afraid of \u2013 probably not wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: buying cigarettes for your husband \u2013 possibly wrong because it enables a harmful habit.\n\nSo, C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut now I'm second-guessing because maybe the first scenario could be considered wrong for some reason.\n\nLike, maybe killing spiders unnecessarily is cruel or something.\n\nBut the friend is afraid of them, so it's for her benefit.\n\nPerhaps it's a grey area, but probably not wrong.\n\nAnd the second scenario, enabling a harmful habit, is likely seen as wrong.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
