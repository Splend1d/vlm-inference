Let me think about this.\n\nOption A is Aristotle. He was a student of Plato and wrote a lot about ethics and philosophy. Maybe he said something like that.\n\nOption B is John Locke. He's more of a modern philosopher, known for his work on political theory and empiricism. I don't think he's the one who said that.\n\nOption C is Socrates. He was Plato's teacher and is famous for his method of questioning to seek truth. He placed a lot of emphasis on knowledge and self-examination.\n\nOption D is Plato. He was a student of Socrates and founded the Academy in Athens. He wrote a lot about philosophy, politics, and ethics.\n\nNow, I recall that Socrates valued wisdom and knowledge above material possessions and power. He believed that the unexamined life was not worth living, meaning that one should constantly question and reflect on their beliefs and actions.\n\nIn fact, I think this quote comes from Plato's Apology, which is a record of Socrates' defense speech at his trial. In that text, Socrates says, \"The unexamined life is not worth living for men or for beasts.\" So, it seems like Socrates is the one who made this statement.\n\nAristotle, on the other hand, focused more on ethics and virtue, but I don't recall him saying exactly that. John Locke is more associated with social contract theory and the idea of tabula rasa in epistemology. Plato wrote about many philosophical concepts, but the specific quote about the unexamined life is attributed to Socrates.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Socrates.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
