Dynamite is often used in mining operations to break up rock and extract minerals. If setting off dynamite is part of the person's job and they are following safety protocols and regulations, then it's likely not morally wrong. In fact, it's their professional responsibility. However, if they set off dynamite in an unsafe manner or without proper authorization, that could be morally wrong due to the potential harm to themselves and others.\n\nGiven that the scenario simply states \"during my work at the mine,\" it seems like this is part of their job, and thus not morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"Hank said he could help me with my essay so I told him to help me think of a title.\"\n\nHere, someone is asking for help with their essay, and Hank offers to assist. The main character then asks Hank to help think of a title. This seems like a collaborative effort or seeking assistance, which is generally acceptable.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's any misconduct here. For instance, if this is an academic setting and the main character is seeking help in a way that constitutes plagiarism or cheating, that would be morally wrong. But based on the information provided, it just sounds like asking for help with a title, which is probably within acceptable boundaries.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario appears to involve morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
