A defined specified outcome to be achieved in the long-term\n\nB. A clear set of goals to be attained given a set number of resources\n\nC. A clearly defined and measurable outcome to be achieved over a specified timeframe\n\nD. A set standard of performance agreed by workers and managers\n\nHmm, I need to pick the best definition among these. Let's think about what an objective really is.\n\nFirst, an objective is something you aim to achieve. It's a goal, but more specific and often measurable. So, option A says \"a defined specified outcome to be achieved in the long-term.\" That sounds like a goal, but is it specifically an objective?\n\nWell, in management and planning, objectives are usually more specific and have measurable criteria, whereas goals can be broader. So, maybe A is a bit too vague.\n\nOption B says \"a clear set of goals to be attained given a set number of resources.\" This seems to mix goals and resources. It sounds more like a project plan or something. Maybe not the best definition for an objective.\n\nOption C says \"a clearly defined and measurable outcome to be achieved over a specified timeframe.\" Hmm, this sounds promising. Objectives are indeed supposed to be clear, measurable, and time-bound. That sounds like a good definition.\n\nOption D says \"a set standard of performance agreed by workers and managers.\" This sounds more like performance standards or maybe even Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), but not exactly an objective.\n\nWait a minute, maybe D is trying to refer to something like performance objectives, but I think C is more comprehensive.\n\nLet me recall what I've learned about objectives. In project management and business planning, objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. That's the SMART criteria. So, a good objective should have all these characteristics.\n\nLooking back at the options, C aligns best with the SMART criteria: clearly defined (specific), measurable, and over a specified timeframe (time-bound).\n\nOption A mentions long-term, but objectives can be short-term or long-term. It's not necessarily defined by the time frame, but by the clarity and measurability.\n\nOption B talks about a set of goals, which seems a bit vague and also introduces the element of resources, which isn't directly related to the definition of an objective.\n\nOption D mentions a set standard of performance agreed by workers and managers. While agreement is important for objectives, this seems more like a performance metric or target.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: \"a clearly defined and measurable outcome to be achieved over a specified timeframe.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if any other option could be correct.\n\nOption A is close, but it emphasizes long-term, which isn't a necessary characteristic of an objective. Objectives can be short-term or long-term.\n\nOption B is too broad and introduces resources, which isn't central to the definition of an objective.\n\nOption D seems more related to performance standards than to objectives per se.\n\nSo, yes, C seems to be the most accurate definition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
