                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a type of attack where a cyber-criminal or even a penetration tester uses extra data with specific instructions in memory to crack a system. The options are phishing, MiTM, buffer-overflow, and clickjacking. I need to figure out which one fits the description.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these attacks is about.\n\nPhishing is when someone tries to trick you into giving away sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers, often through emails or messages that look legitimate but aren't.\n\nMiTM stands for Man-in-the-Middle. It's when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties to eavesdrop or alter the messages.\n\nBuffer-overflow is when an attacker sends more data to a program than it can handle, causing it to overflow beyond the intended buffer and potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.\n\nClickjacking is a technique where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on a button or link that is invisible or disguised as something else, often leading to unauthorized actions.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it mentions \"extra data that holds some specific instructions in the memory for actions.\" This sounds like the attacker is trying to execute code in the memory of a program.\n\nPhishing doesn't really involve manipulating memory or executing code; it's more about social engineering to get you to reveal information.\n\nMiTM is about intercepting communications, not necessarily about executing code in memory.\n\nClickjacking is about tricking you into clicking on something you didn't intend to, but again, it's not directly about memory manipulation.\n\nThat leaves buffer-overflow. This type of attack specifically involves sending more data than a program can handle, which can lead to overwriting parts of memory and potentially executing arbitrary code.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is C. Buffer-overflow.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nThe question says the extra data holds \"specific instructions in the memory for actions.\" In a buffer-overflow attack, the attacker not only overflows the buffer but also injects malicious code that gets executed when the overflow occurs.\n\nThis matches the description perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Buffer-overflow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
