The options are:\n\nA. Research and evaluation\n\nB. Strategy and evaluation\n\nC. Strategy and implementation\n\nD. Objectives and implementation\n\nFirst, I need to recall or look up what each of these planning models entails. Since I don't have immediate access to the specific details of each model, I'll try to think generally about what key elements are typically included in planning models, especially in the context of public relations or organizational planning, assuming that's the field we're dealing with.\n\nGenerally, planning models in public relations include steps like situation analysis, objective setting, strategy development, tactic selection, implementation, and evaluation. So, common elements across different models might include strategy, implementation, and evaluation.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Research and evaluation: Research could be part of the situation analysis or planning phase, but it might not be a central element in all models.\n\nB. Strategy and evaluation: Strategy is likely to be a key element in most planning models, and evaluation is important for assessing the success of the plan.\n\nC. Strategy and implementation: Again, strategy is key, and implementation is crucial for putting the plan into action.\n\nD. Objectives and implementation: Setting objectives is fundamental, and implementation is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n\nGiven that all these options include important elements, I need to determine which two are common across all four planning models mentioned.\n\nSince I don't have specific information about each model, I'll make some general assumptions based on typical planning models.\n\nMerston (1963) is one of the earliest models, and it might be more straightforward, including elements like objective setting, strategy, and implementation.\n\nKendall (1999) is likely to be more developed, including elements like situation analysis, strategy, tactics, implementation, and evaluation.\n\nHendrix (2002) might include similar elements, with perhaps more emphasis on research and evaluation.\n\nParkinson and Ekachai (2006) could be even more contemporary, possibly incorporating elements like stakeholder analysis, strategic planning, implementation, and evaluation.\n\nGiven this, it seems that strategy and implementation are likely to be common elements across all these models. Evaluation might also be common, but older models like Merston (1963) might not emphasize evaluation as much as newer models.\n\nHowever, considering that evaluation is a crucial component for learning and improvement, it's possible that all these models include evaluation, even if to varying degrees.\n\nBut to choose the two elements that are common across all, I think strategy and implementation are the most likely candidates.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider option D: Objectives and implementation. Objectives are indeed fundamental in any planning model; without objectives, there's no clear direction. Implementation is also crucial as it's about putting the plan into action. So, these are both essential elements.\n\nComparing options C and D, both include implementation, but one has strategy and the other has objectives.\n\nI need to think about whether all these planning models include strategy as a separate element from objectives.\n\nIn some models, objectives might be considered part of the strategy, or strategy might be derived from objectives.\n\nAlternatively, strategy could be seen as the means to achieve the objectives.\n\nGiven that, it's possible that all models include objectives and implementation, whereas strategy might be present but perhaps integrated differently across models.\n\nConsidering that, option D might be a safer choice.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps strategy and evaluation are common across all models, making option B correct.\n\nEvaluation is important for assessing the success of the plan, and strategy is about how to achieve the objectives.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure if all models include evaluation.\n\nGiven that Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) is a newer model, it's likely to include evaluation, but Merston (1963) might not emphasize it as much.\n\nTherefore, perhaps strategy and implementation are the most consistently present elements across all these models.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe research and evaluation are common, but research might not be a central element in all planning models.\n\nFor example, some models might incorporate research into the situation analysis phase but not treat it as a separate element.\n\nTherefore, option A might not be the best choice.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering all options, I think the two elements that are common across the planning models of Hendrix (2002), Kendall (1999), Merston (1963), and Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) are strategy and implementation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Strategy and implementation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
