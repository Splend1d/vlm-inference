                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. Terri has opened a fast food restaurant, and we need to find an expression that represents her total cost after having the restaurant open for \"D\" days.\n\nFirst, there's the initial cost to open the restaurant, which is a one-time expense. That's $800,000. So, no matter how many days the restaurant is open, she's already spent that amount.\n\nNext, there are daily operational costs and labor costs that she has to pay every day the restaurant is open. The daily operational costs are $250, and the labor costs are $400. So, every day, she's spending $250 + $400 = $650.\n\nNow, if the restaurant is open for D days, then the total daily costs would be $650 multiplied by D, which is 650D.\n\nTo find the total cost, we need to add the initial cost to the total daily costs. So, the total cost should be the initial cost plus the daily costs over D days.\n\nThat means the expression should be: 800,000 + 650D.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 800,000 + 150D\n\nB. 800,000 + 650D\n\nC. 800,000 \u2212 650D\n\nD. 650 + 800,000D\n\nOption B matches the expression we derived: 800,000 + 650D.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nThe initial cost is $800,000, which is a one-time fee.\n\nDaily operational costs are $250 per day.\n\nLabor costs are $400 per day.\n\nTotal daily costs: 250 + 400 = 650 per day.\n\nOver D days, the total daily costs are 650D.\n\nTotal cost = initial cost + total daily costs = 800,000 + 650D.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nOption C has a subtraction sign, which doesn't make sense because costs should be adding up, not decreasing.\n\nOption A has only $150 per day, but we calculated $650 per day.\n\nOption D has the daily cost and the initial cost switched, which doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option B: 800,000 + 650D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
