                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what \"functional recognition\" means in the context of international relations, particularly regarding state and government recognition. The options provided seem to offer different interpretations of this concept, and I need to determine which one accurately defines functional recognition.\n\nOption A suggests that recognition is a function as opposed to a power. This seems a bit abstract. In international law, recognition is often discussed in terms of a state's sovereign power to acknowledge the existence and status of another state or government. If recognition is considered a function, it might refer to the practical aspects or roles that recognition serves in diplomatic relations, rather than being purely a manifestation of power.\n\nOption B states that recognition is reciprocal between two states. Reciprocity is indeed an important aspect of international relations, where actions and recognitions are often exchanged mutually. However, recognition isn't always reciprocal; a state might recognize another unilaterally for various political or strategic reasons.\n\nOption C says that recognition is only afforded to particular administrative acts, not to the entity's declared statehood. This seems to suggest a limited form of recognition, where certain actions or functions of a government are acknowledged without fully recognizing the state itself. This could be similar to recognizing a government's ability to issue passports or conduct trade, without accepting its overall claim to statehood.\n\nOption D proposes that recognition is only afforded to the government, not the state. This distinction is crucial in international law. Recognizing a government typically means acknowledging its authority to represent the state in international affairs, whereas recognizing a state involves accepting its existence as a sovereign entity. Sometimes, states may recognize a new government without necessarily recognizing the state it claims to represent, or vice versa.\n\nConsidering these options, functional recognition might best be described as a form of recognition that is limited to specific functions or capacities of a state or government, rather than a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8ba4\u53ef\u5176\u4e3b\u6743\u6216\u653f\u6743\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0e\u9009\u9879C\u548cD\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u8ba4\u8bc6\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4ec5\u4ec5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u653f\u5e9c\u6216 statehood \u7684\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002\n\nPerhaps functional recognition refers to the acknowledgment of a state's or government's ability to perform certain functions, such as entering into treaties, conducting diplomacy, or managing international trade, without necessarily endorsing its overall claim to statehood or governmental legitimacy. This approach focuses on the practical aspects of interaction rather than making a broad, principled recognition.\n\nIn international practice, functional recognition can be seen in situations where states engage with entities in specific areas without fully recognizing their sovereignty or governmental authority. For example, states might allow an entity to participate in international organizations or engage in trade agreements without formally recognizing it as a sovereign state.\n\nGiven this understanding, option C seems closest to the mark, as it mentions that recognition is only afforded to particular administrative acts, not to the entity's declared statehood. This aligns with the idea of functional recognition focusing on specific capacities or functions rather than overall statehood.\n\nHowever, option D also has some relevance, as it distinguishes between recognizing a government and recognizing a state. Functional recognition might involve recognizing certain functions performed by a government without necessarily recognizing the government itself or the state it claims to represent.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is a combination of C and D, but since only one option can be chosen, I would select C, as it directly refers to recognizing particular administrative acts without endorsing the entity's claim to statehood. This captures the essence of functional recognition as a limited form of acknowledgment focused on specific functions or actions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
