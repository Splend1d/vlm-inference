                    "text": "So I've got this logic problem here, and I need to symbolize this sentence: \"Either England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds.\" Yikes, that's a mouthful. Okay, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the sentence. It says \"either... or...\", which suggests that the overall structure is a disjunction. So, there are two main parts connected by \"or\", and each part needs to be symbolized separately.\n\nThe first part is \"England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\" Okay, sufficient condition. I remember that in logic, \"A is a sufficient condition for B\" translates to \"If A, then B\", or A \u2283 B. So, in this case, A is \"England's importing beef\" (let's call that E) and B is \"France's subsidizing agriculture\" (F). So, this part should be E \u2283 F.\n\nThe second part is a bit more complicated: \"China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds.\" Hmm, \"when and only when\" sounds like a biconditional. A biconditional is \"A if and only if B\", or A \u2261 B. But here, it's \"doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds.\" So, A is \"China doesn't promote human rights\" (~C) and B is \"South Africa supplies diamonds\" (S). So, this seems like ~C \u2261 S.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the whole sentence is \"Either (E \u2283 F) or (~C \u2261 S)\". Looking at the options:\n\nA. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2283 S)\n\nB. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 ~C)\n\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 ~(S \u2261 C)\n\nD. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2261 S)\n\nOkay, so option D matches exactly what I have: (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2261 S). But wait, let's double-check if there's any misinterpretation.\n\nIs \"China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds\" correctly symbolized as ~C \u2261 S? Let's see:\n\n- \"When and only when\" is indeed a biconditional, so ~C \u2261 S seems right.\n\n- Alternatively, could it be interpreted differently? Maybe as a conditional? But \"when and only when\" strongly suggests a biconditional.\n\nAlso, in the first part, \"sufficient condition\" is correctly symbolized as E \u2283 F.\n\nOption A has (~C \u2283 S) instead of (~C \u2261 S), which is incorrect because it's a conditional instead of a biconditional.\n\nOption B has (F \u2283 E) which would be \"France's subsidizing agriculture is a sufficient condition for England's importing beef\", which is the opposite of what was stated, and similarly (S \u2283 ~C) which is \"South Africa supplying diamonds is a sufficient condition for China not promoting human rights\", which again is not the biconditional stated.\n\nOption C has ~(S \u2261 C), which is \"It is not the case that South Africa supplies diamonds if and only if China promotes human rights.\" Wait, that's not quite the same as \"China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds.\" Because ~C \u2261 S is equivalent to ~(C \u2261 S), but I think directly using ~C \u2261 S is more accurate.\n\nSo, upon closer inspection, option D seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nAnother way to look at \"China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds\" could be to distribute the negation. So, ~C \u2261 S is the same as C \u2261 ~S, because if not C if and only if S, that's the same as C if and only if not S.\n\nBut in the options, none of them present it that way, so maybe it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, option C has ~(S \u2261 C), which is not the same as ~C \u2261 S.\n\nBecause ~(S \u2261 C) is equivalent to S \u2261 ~C, which is the same as ~C \u2261 S.\n\nWait a minute, so ~(S \u2261 C) is equivalent to ~C \u2261 S.\n\nSo, option C: (E \u2283 F) \u2228 ~(S \u2261 C) is equivalent to (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2261 S), which is option D.\n\nSo, both C and D are logically equivalent.\n\nBut in terms of best symbolization, perhaps option D is more straightforward because it directly matches the structure of the sentence.\n\nOption C has a negated biconditional, which might be less clear.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the best symbolization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
