                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which option is correct here. So, there's a city that has two types of excise taxes: one is $200 per year for commercial artists' studios in the city, and the other is $100 per year for itinerant commercial figure drawers who use the streets and sidewalks. There's also a credit for the $100 tax if the drawer or their employer pays the $200 studio tax.\n\nNow, there's a gallery in a neighboring state that sends two itinerant artists into the city. These artists draw pictures of pedestrians, ask them to order finished paintings, collect $2.00, and then the drawings are sent to a studio, framed, and mailed to the customer. The neighboring state doesn't tax artists' studios.\n\nThe gallery is challenging the constitutionality of the $100 per year excise tax imposed on its itinerant artists in the city. I need to decide which option the court will most likely choose.\n\nOption A says the tax is constitutional as a valid ad valorem tax on interstate commerce. Ad valorem taxes are based on the value of the item being taxed. But here, the tax is a flat $100 per year for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. It doesn't seem to be based on the value of the items sold or services provided, so maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B says it's constitutional because the tax was levied not on the commercial art business as a whole but on the local activity of drawing pictures. So, the city is taxing the activity that takes place within its boundaries. That seems plausible, but I need to consider if there are any constitutional issues with that.\n\nOption C says it's unconstitutional because a state or municipality may not impose a license tax on orders for goods or services to be performed in another state. Here, the artists are in the city drawing pictures, but the actual production and mailing of the finished paintings happen in another state. So, is the city trying to tax activities that are happening outside its jurisdiction?\n\nOption D says it's unconstitutional as a discriminatory privilege tax. Discriminatory taxes are those that favor local businesses over out-of-state businesses. Is that the case here? The city is imposing a tax on itinerant artists, including those from out of town, but there's a credit if they have a studio in the city. So, it might be favoring local studios.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the city is imposing a tax on itinerant commercial figure drawers for using the streets and sidewalks. This seems like a tax on the activity of drawing in public spaces within the city. The gallery is from a neighboring state and is sending its artists into the city to perform this activity.\n\nNow, the gallery is challenging the tax's constitutionality. What constitutional principles are relevant here?\n\nWell, there are issues related to taxation of interstate commerce. The Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, and it also imposes limitations on state taxation of interstate commerce.\n\nOne key principle is that states cannot impose taxes that unduly burden or discriminate against interstate commerce. So, if the city's tax is seen as a burden on the gallery's interstate business or if it discriminates against out-of-state businesses, it could be unconstitutional.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Constitutional as a valid ad valorem tax on interstate commerce. But as I thought earlier, this isn't an ad valorem tax; it's a flat fee.\n\nB. Constitutional because it's taxing a local activity. This might be a strong argument because the activity of drawing is taking place within the city's boundaries.\n\nC. Unconstitutional because it's a license tax on orders for goods or services performed in another state. This seems relevant because the actual production and mailing of the paintings are happening in another state.\n\nD. Unconstitutional as a discriminatory privilege tax. This could be applicable if the tax favors local studios over out-of-state ones.\n\nLet me consider option C in more detail. The artists are in the city, drawing pictures, and collecting payments. The customers are ordering finished paintings, which are then produced and mailed from a studio in another state. So, the city is taxing the activity that leads to orders for goods and services to be performed outside the city.\n\nIs it permissible for the city to tax activities that generate business for out-of-state entities? Well, generally, states have the power to tax activities within their borders, but they can't discriminate against interstate commerce or impose undue burdens on it.\n\nIn this case, the tax is imposed on the local activity, but the revenue from that activity is going to an out-of-state business. So, the city might be trying to tax the privilege of generating business in the city, even if the business is performed elsewhere.\n\nThere's a precedent in Supreme Court cases that states cannot impose taxes that are a direct burden on interstate commerce. For example, in Complete Auto Transit v. Brady, the Court established a four-part test for determining the validity of a state tax applied to interstate commerce:\n\n1. The tax must apply to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state.\n\n2. The tax must be fairly apportioned.\n\n3. The tax must not discriminate against interstate commerce.\n\n4. The tax must be fairly related to services provided by the state.\n\nIn this case, the activity of drawing in the city has a substantial nexus with the city, so the first criterion is met. The tax is a flat $100 per year, which might be considered fairly related to the services provided by the city, such as the use of public spaces. However, I need to think about whether the tax discriminates against interstate commerce.\n\nThe gallery is from a neighboring state, and the productions and mailings are happening in that state. If the city is taxing the activity that generates business for out-of-state entities, is that discriminatory? Well, it's not explicitly favoring in-state businesses over out-of-state ones, but it might be argued that the tax is a burden on the out-of-state gallery's business.\n\nAdditionally, there's a credit for the $100 tax if the drawer or employer pays the $200 studio tax. So, if the gallery had a studio in the city, they could get a credit for the $100 tax. This might be seen as an incentive for the gallery to establish a studio in the city, which could be viewed as discriminatory against out-of-state businesses.\n\nLooking at option D, which says the tax is unconstitutional as a discriminatory privilege tax, this seems relevant. If the tax favors local studios by providing a credit, it might be seen as discriminating against out-of-state businesses that don't have a local studio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tax is justified as a tax on the use of public spaces for commercial activity, regardless of where the final product is produced. In that case, it might be considered a valid exercise of the city's police power.\n\nI need to weigh these arguments.\n\nOn one hand, the city has the right to regulate and tax activities within its boundaries, especially those that use public resources like streets and sidewalks. The itinerant artists are conducting commercial activities in the city, and the city can reasonably require them to pay a fee for that privilege.\n\nOn the other hand, the tax has an impact on the gallery's out-of-state business, as the artists are generating orders for paintings that are produced and mailed from another state. If the tax is seen as a burden on interstate commerce, it could be unconstitutional.\n\nMoreover, the credit for the studio tax might be seen as favoring local studios over out-of-state ones, which could be considered discriminatory.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most likely outcome is that the court will declare the tax unconstitutional as a discriminatory privilege tax, which is option D.\n\nOption B might also have some merit, as the tax is on a local activity, but the discrimination aspect seems more significant in this case, given the credit for the studio tax.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option D: unconstitutional, as a discriminatory privilege tax.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) unconstitutional, as a discriminatory privilege tax."
