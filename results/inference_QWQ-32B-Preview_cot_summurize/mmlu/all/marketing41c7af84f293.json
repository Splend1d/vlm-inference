                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"These goods are bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve a reasonably high level of consumer risk:\n\nA. Impulse goods.\nB. Luxury goods.\nC. Non-durable goods.\nD. Durable goods.\"\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one of these options best fits the description given. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the goods are bought infrequently. That means people don't purchase them very often. Next, they're used repeatedly, so once you buy them, you use them multiple times over a period. And finally, they involve a reasonably high level of consumer risk. That probably means that if something goes wrong with the product, it could be costly or cause significant problems for the consumer.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nA. Impulse goods. These are items that people buy on the spot, without much planning. Things like candy, magazines, or maybe a cute toy. They're usually inexpensive and don't involve much risk. So, this doesn't seem to match the description. Impulse goods are bought frequently, not infrequently, and they don't involve high consumer risk.\n\nB. Luxury goods. These are high-end items like designer clothes, expensive jewelry, or luxury cars. They are bought infrequently because they're pricey, and people might use them repeatedly. But do they involve a high level of consumer risk? Well, a luxury car could be risky if it has defects, but overall, luxury goods are often well-made and come with good warranties. So, maybe not the best fit.\n\nC. Non-durable goods. These are items that are used up quickly, like food, toiletries, or light bulbs. They're bought frequently, not infrequently, and don't involve much risk because they're replaced often. So, this doesn't match the description at all.\n\nD. Durable goods. These are items that last a long time, like appliances, furniture, or electronics. People don't buy them very often\u2014they're purchased infrequently. They're used repeatedly over many years. And if something goes wrong with a durable good, it can be a big problem because of the investment involved. For example, if your new refrigerator breaks down, that's a significant inconvenience and financial risk.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, durable goods seem to fit the description best: bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve a reasonably high level of consumer risk.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. Impulse goods are bought frequently and don't involve much risk. Luxury goods might be bought infrequently and could involve some risk, but they're not necessarily used repeatedly in the same way as durable goods. Non-durable goods are used up quickly and bought often. Durable goods fit all the criteria mentioned in the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Durable goods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
