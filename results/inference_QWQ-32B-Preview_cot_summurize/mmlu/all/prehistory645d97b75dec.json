                    "text": "Let's see. The question is about the relationship between anatomically modern humans up to 50,000 years ago and us. So, anatomically modern humans are basically humans who look like us, right? I think the key here is understanding what \"anatomically modern\" means and how that relates to cognitive abilities.\n\nOption A says they looked and thought like us. That seems plausible, but I need to recall when exactly anatomically modern humans appeared and what was known about their cognitive abilities at that time.\n\nI remember that anatomically modern humans, or Homo sapiens, first appeared around 200,000 to 300,000 years ago in Africa. So, up to 50,000 years ago would still be within that timeframe.\n\nNow, regarding thinking like us, that might refer to their cognitive abilities, language, culture, and technology. I think that around 50,000 years ago, there was a significant leap in human culture and technology, often referred to as the \"cognitive revolution\" or \"upper paleolithic revolution.\" This period saw a flowering of art, more complex tools, and possibly the development of language.\n\nBut were humans thinking like us before that? Some scholars argue that the capabilities were there earlier, but maybe not fully expressed or developed. Others think that there was a significant change around that time.\n\nOption B says they looked like us but did not think like us. That might suggest that their anatomy was modern, but their cognition was not fully developed.\n\nOption C is the opposite: they thought like us but did not look like us, which doesn't make sense because anatomically modern refers to their physical appearance.\n\nOption D says they did not look or think like us, which contradicts the definition of anatomically modern humans.\n\nSo, between A and B, which one is correct? Anatomically modern humans did look like us, but did they think like us up to 50,000 years ago?\n\nI think the consensus is that their physical appearance was similar to ours, but their cultural and cognitive developments might have been different or less advanced in some aspects.\n\nFor example, the archaeological record shows that before 50,000 years ago, human cultures had simpler tools and less evidence of symbolic thought, art, and complex social structures.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that some groups had more advanced capabilities earlier, and the archaeological record is incomplete.\n\nPerhaps a better way to think about this is that anatomically modern humans had the potential to think like us, but the full expression of that potential became more evident around 50,000 years ago.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a genetic change or some other factor that enhanced their cognitive abilities around that time.\n\nI'm not entirely sure, but based on what I've read, I\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u9009\u9879B\uff1a\u4ed6\u4eec\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u50cf\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u6837\u601d\u8003\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5bf9\u201c\u601d\u8003\u50cf\u6211\u4eec\u201d\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6307\u7684\u662f\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6587\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4e5f\u8bb8\u572850,000\u5e74\u524d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u5b8c\u5168\u8fbe\u5230\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6709\u4e9b\u5b66\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7a81\u7136\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6700\u597d\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u662fA\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u548c\u601d\u8003\u90fd\u50cf\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6587\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u8fd8\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u3002\n\n\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\n\n**\u6700\u7ec8\u9009\u62e9\uff1aA. \u4ed6\u4eec\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u548c\u601d\u8003\u90fd\u50cf\u6211\u4eec\u3002**\n\n**\u7406\u7531\uff1a** anatomically modern humans \u6307\u7684\u662f\u5728\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7269\u79cd\uff0c\u5373 Homo sapiens\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6587\u5316\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5927\u8111\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u751f\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u572850,000\u5e74\u524d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6587\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u540e\u6765\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u5148\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u601d\u8003\u65b9\u5f0f\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9009\u62e9A\u66f4\u4e3a\u5408\u9002\u3002"
