They are acts that States perform as practice in the context of custom.\n\nB. They are acts creating unilateral legal obligations to the acting State.\n\nC. Unilateral acts are simply political acts of State devoid of any legal effect.\n\nD. Unilateral acts are those that State perform in order to be bound by a treaty.\n\nI think option A might be related to how customs are formed, but I'm not sure if that's what unilateral acts are. Option B sounds plausible because it mentions creating legal obligations, but I'm not entirely clear on that. Option C suggests they have no legal effect, which contradicts B. And option D seems similar to how states accept the terms of a treaty, but I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should look up what unilateral acts are in international law. From what I recall, unilateral acts are actions taken by a single state without any obligation or requirement from another state or international law. But I need to confirm that.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A says they are acts that States perform as practice in the context of custom. I know that customs in international law are formed by the consistent practice of states over time, accompanied by the belief that they are obligated to follow that practice (opinio juris). So, unilateral acts might be part of that practice, but I'm not sure if that's the best definition.\n\nOption B says they are acts creating unilateral legal obligations to the acting State. This sounds more accurate. Unilateral acts could be statements or actions by a state that create legal obligations for itself, even without a corresponding agreement from other states.\n\nOption C says they are simply political acts of State devoid of any legal effect. But if option B is correct, then unilateral acts do have legal effects. So, this might not be accurate.\n\nOption D says unilateral acts are those that State perform in order to be bound by a treaty. I think this might be referring to actions like ratification or accession to a treaty, which are indeed unilateral acts that bind the state to the treaty. But is that the only context for unilateral acts?\n\nMaybe unilateral acts can be broader than just treaty-related actions. For example, a state might make a unilateral declaration to abstain from nuclear weapons, which would create a legal obligation for itself without any reciprocal agreement.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is the most comprehensive, as it acknowledges that unilateral acts can create legal obligations for the acting state, regardless of whether they are related to treaties or customs.\n\nBut let me think about option D again. If unilateral acts are specifically those performed to be bound by a treaty, that seems too narrow. There must be other types of unilateral acts in international law.\n\nAlso, option C seems too dismissive, as it suggests unilateral acts have no legal effect, which contradicts what I'm starting to believe about option B.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is option B: unilateral acts are acts creating unilateral legal obligations to the acting State.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
