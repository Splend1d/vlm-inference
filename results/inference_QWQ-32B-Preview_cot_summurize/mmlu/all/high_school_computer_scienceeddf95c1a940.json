                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about Python, and I need to choose the correct option among A, B, C, or D. The question is:\n\n\"Which of the following is correct about Python?\n\nA. It supports automatic garbage collection.\n\nB. It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.\n\nC. Both of the above.\n\nD. None of the above.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to think about what Python is capable of and see which of these statements are true.\n\nFirst, option A says \"It supports automatic garbage collection.\" I know that garbage collection is a feature in many programming languages where the language automatically manages memory by deallocating memory that is no longer in use. I think Python does have automatic garbage collection. I recall that Python uses a garbage collector to manage memory, specifically to deal with cyclic references where objects refer to each other and wouldn't be cleaned up otherwise.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nNow, option B says \"It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.\" I know that Python is designed to be portable and extensible, and it does have mechanisms to integrate with code written in other languages. For example, there's CPython, which is the reference implementation of Python, and it's written in C, so integrating with C should be straightforward. Also, there are tools and packages that allow Python to work with C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.\n\nFor instance, ctypes and cffi are modules that allow Python to call C functions and handle C data types. For C++, there's Boost.Python or Cython, which can be used for integration. For Java, there's Jython, which is an implementation of Python that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and allows integration with Java code. Similarly, for COM and ActiveX, there are modules like pythoncom and win32com.\n\nSo, option B also seems correct.\n\nGiven that both A and B seem correct, option C \"Both of the above\" would be the right choice.\n\nBut, to be thorough, I should make sure that there isn't any misinformation here or if there's any scenario where these statements might not hold true.\n\nRegarding option A, automatic garbage collection is a fundamental feature of Python's memory management. It uses a combination of reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to manage memory automatically. So, it's safe to say that Python supports automatic garbage collection.\n\nFor option B, while Python does provide mechanisms to integrate with other languages and technologies like C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java, the ease of integration can vary depending on the specific use case and the tools used. However, overall, Python is known for its ability to integrate with code written in other languages, so saying it can be easily integrated with these technologies is generally accurate.\n\nTherefore, since both A and B are correct, the best answer is C. Both of the above.\n\nI don't think D is correct because both statements A and B are accurate.\n\nSo, my final answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
