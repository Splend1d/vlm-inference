It says that this has become a hot topic because of changes in work intensity and technology in recent years. The options are presenteeism, absenteeism, work-play balance, and work-life balance. I think the answer is work-life balance, but let me make sure I understand why.\n\nFirst, I need to know what each term means. Presenteeism is when employees show up to work even when they're sick or not feeling well. Absenteeism is when employees don't show up for work when they're supposed to. Work-play balance sounds like balancing work with leisure activities, which seems similar to work-life balance. Work-life balance is about managing time and energy between work demands and personal life.\n\nThe question is talking about a preferred ratio between work and non-work activities, which sounds a lot like work-life balance. Work-life balance is a broad concept that includes not just leisure time but also time for family, personal pursuits, and other non-work aspects of life. It's been a big issue recently because of things like remote work, always-on communication, and higher work intensities due to technology.\n\nWork-play balance might be similar, but it seems more focused on leisure activities specifically, whereas work-life balance encompasses a wider range of non-work activities. So, work-life balance seems more comprehensive and aligns better with the description in the question.\n\nAlso, presenteeism and absenteeism are related to attendance and productivity, but they don't directly address the balance between work and non-work activities. So, they don't seem to fit the description.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. Work-life balance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
