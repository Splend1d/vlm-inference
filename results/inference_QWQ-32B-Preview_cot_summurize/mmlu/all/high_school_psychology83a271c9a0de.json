                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the characteristic of formal operational thinking from this list. I remember that formal operational thinking is the highest stage of cognitive development, according to Piaget. It's when people can think abstractly and reason logically about abstract concepts.\n\nOption A says \"simple motor responses to sensory stimuli.\" That sounds more like the earliest stage of cognitive development, maybe sensorimotor stage, where infants learn about the world through their senses and actions. So, that doesn't seem right for formal operational thinking.\n\nOption B says \"failure to understand reversibility.\" Reversibility is understanding that actions can be reversed, like knowing that if you pour water from one container to another, the amount of water stays the same. This is something that children learn in the concrete operational stage, I think. So, failing to understand reversibility would be characteristic of an earlier stage, not formal operational thinking.\n\nOption C says \"capacity to deal well with concrete objects, but not with hypothetical situations.\" Again, that sounds like the concrete operational stage, where children can think logically about concrete events but have trouble with abstract and hypothetical ideas. Formal operational thinking is beyond that, involving the ability to handle hypotheses and abstract concepts.\n\nOption D says \"logical reasoning and systematic planning.\" That sounds exactly like what formal operational thinking is all about. It's the ability to think logically about abstract ideas, to consider hypotheses, and to plan systematically to solve problems.\n\nSo, based on what I know about Piaget's stages of cognitive development, I think the correct answer is D. Logical reasoning and systematic planning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
