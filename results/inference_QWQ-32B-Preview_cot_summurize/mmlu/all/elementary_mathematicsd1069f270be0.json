Let's find the GCD of 60 and 72.\n\nFirst, I'll list the factors of each number:\n\nFactors of 60: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60\n\nFactors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n\nNow, identifying the common factors:\n\nCommon factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nThe greatest common factor is 12.\n\nNow, I'll divide both the numerator and the denominator by 12:\n\n60 \u00f7 12 = 5\n\n72 \u00f7 12 = 6\n\nSo, 60/72 simplifies to 5/6.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 4 over 6\n\nB. 10 over 12\n\nC. 15 over 17\n\nD. 5 over 6\n\nThe correct answer is D. 5 over 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could have checked each option to see if it equals 60/72.\n\nLet's verify option D:\n\n5/6 = 5 \u00f7 6 \u2248 0.8333...\n\nNow, 60/72 = 60 \u00f7 72 \u2248 0.8333...\n\nThey are equal.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check option A: 4/6 = 4 \u00f7 6 \u2248 0.6667, which is not equal to 0.8333.\n\nOption B: 10/12 = 10 \u00f7 12 \u2248 0.8333, which is equal to 60/72, but wait, 10/12 can be simplified further to 5/6. So, it's equivalent, but not in simplest form.\n\nOption C: 15/17 = 15 \u00f7 17 \u2248 0.8824, which is not equal to 0.8333.\n\nOption D: 5/6 = 5 \u00f7 6 \u2248 0.8333, which matches 60/72.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 5 over 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
