According to academic integrity standards in the US, rewriting someone else's paper is considered cheating or academic dishonesty. This is generally viewed as morally wrong because it undermines the educational process and gives an unfair advantage to the person who didn't do the work themselves.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character saw their brother's brand new PlayStation video game system, which was made of plastic, and recycled it without being asked. This seems more complicated. On one hand, recycling is generally seen as a positive action for the environment. However, in this case, the item belongs to the main character's brother, and recycling it without permission could be seen as disrespecting his property rights. It's possible that the brother wanted to keep the game system or dispose of it differently. Taking away someone's property without their consent is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves academic dishonesty, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves recycling someone else's property without permission, which also seems morally wrong because it disregards the owner's rights and preferences.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there might be any nuances or contexts that could change this assessment. For example, if the brother had expressed that he no longer wanted the game system or if there was a family agreement to recycle certain items, then recycling it might not be wrong. But based on the information given, it seems like the main character took it upon themselves to recycle something that wasn't theirs to decide about.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 1, helping by rewriting a paper is clearly against academic integrity rules, which are designed to ensure that students learn and earn their grades honestly.\n\nSo, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
