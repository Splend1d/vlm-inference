                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this multiple-choice question about IBS. So, IBS stands for Irritable Bowel Syndrome, right? It's a common digestive disorder that affects the large intestine. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation. It's important to note that IBS is a chronic condition, meaning it persists over a long period, though symptoms may come and go.\n\nOption A says, \"Is primarily a psychological problem.\" Hmm, I've heard that IBS might be related to stress and anxiety, but is it primarily psychological? Well, while psychological factors can exacerbate IBS symptoms, the condition itself is considered a functional gastrointestinal disorder. That means it's related to how the muscles and nerves in the bowel work, rather than being purely psychological. So, I don't think this is the best answer.\n\nOption B says, \"Is a contra-indication to colonoscopy.\" Contra-indication means a reason why a particular treatment or procedure should not be used. So, is having IBS a reason not to perform a colonoscopy? I don't think so. In fact, colonoscopies are often used to help diagnose IBS by ruling out other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says, \"May be associated with constipation.\" Yeah, I know that IBS can present in different ways, and one of the subtypes is IBS-C, which stands for Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation. So, yes, constipation can be associated with IBS. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D says, \"Always resolves with a gluten-free diet.\" Now, some people with IBS may find relief from symptoms by avoiding certain triggers, and gluten is a common trigger for some. However, saying that it always resolves with a gluten-free diet is too absolute. Not everyone with IBS has sensitivity to gluten, and for those who do, a gluten-free diet may help manage symptoms but doesn't necessarily resolve the condition entirely. So, this doesn't seem accurate.\n\nBetween the options, C seems to be the most correct. IBS can indeed be associated with constipation. But just to make sure, let me think again. Option A is incorrect because IBS isn't primarily psychological, even though psychological factors can influence it. Option B is wrong because IBS isn't a reason to avoid colonoscopies; in fact, it's often investigated with one. Option D is too broad, as a gluten-free diet isn't a universal cure for IBS.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: May be associated with constipation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
