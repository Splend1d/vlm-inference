                    "text": "Let's see what Descartes says about an evil demon. I remember that in his Meditations, Descartes considers the possibility of an evil demon that might be deceiving him. So, maybe option C is the right one: \"could possibly be deceiving him.\" But let's think about it carefully.\n\nFirst, Descartes is trying to find a foundation of knowledge that is beyond all doubt. He employs methodic doubt, where he questions the certainty of all his beliefs. He doubts his senses, his memories, and even the basic arithmetic truths initially, to see what remains indubitable.\n\nAt one point, he considers the possibility that there is an evil demon, supremely powerful and deceptive, who is responsible for misleading all his beliefs. This is a thought experiment to test the limits of his knowledge. So, he entertains the idea that such a demon might exist and be deceiving him.\n\nHowever, Descartes doesn't conclude that the evil demon undoubtedly exists (option A). Instead, he uses it as a hypothetical scenario to push his doubt to the extreme. So, option A seems too strong.\n\nOption B says \"could not possibly exist.\" But Descartes doesn't rule out the possibility entirely; he just considers it as a hypothetical possibility. So, B doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D says \"must exist if God exists.\" I don't recall Descartes suggesting that the existence of God necessitates the existence of an evil demon. In fact, later in the Meditations, Descartes argues for the existence of a benevolent God who would not deceive him, which contrasts with the idea of an evil demon.\n\nSo, going back to option C, \"could possibly be deceiving him,\" this aligns with Descartes' method of doubt, where he considers the possibility that even his most fundamental beliefs could be mistaken if there's an evil demon deceiving him.\n\nBut let's make sure. In Meditation I, Descartes writes about the evil demon hypothesis, considering it as a conceivable scenario, not as something he believes undoubtedly exists. So, it's about possibility, not certainty.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be C: \"could possibly be deceiving him.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
