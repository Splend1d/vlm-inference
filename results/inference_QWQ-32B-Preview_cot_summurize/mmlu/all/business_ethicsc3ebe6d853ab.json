                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about the ISO 26000 standard. I remember that ISO 26000 is related to social responsibility, so I think the first blank should be \"social responsibility.\" That narrows it down to options A and B.\n\nNow, the question mentions trends emerging within the shared global governance space, and it talks about more deliberation and something else. Looking at option A, it says \"collaboration,\" and option B says \"individualism.\" I think in global governance, collaboration is more prominent because it's about shared responsibilities and working together across different nations and organizations. So, I'll go with \"collaboration.\"\n\nNext, it says greater focus on something rather than outcomes. Option A says \"process,\" and option B says \"process\" as well. Wait, no, option B says \"individualism\" for the second blank. But I think in global governance, there's a shift towards focusing on the process of how decisions are made, not just the outcomes. So, \"process\" makes sense here.\n\nThen, it says more something rather than specific norms. Option A says \"frameworks,\" and option B says \"legislation.\" In global governance, frameworks are often preferred because they provide guidelines without being too prescriptive, allowing for flexibility across different contexts. Specific norms or legislation can be too rigid for global applications where there's a lot of diversity.\n\nAlso, looking back, option C and D mention \"environmental responsibility,\" but I'm fairly sure ISO 26000 is about social responsibility, not environmental responsibility. So, I can eliminate options C and D.\n\nBetween A and B, I think A makes more sense: social responsibility, collaboration, process, and frameworks.\n\nJust to double-check, let's see what ISO 26000 is actually about. ISO 26000 provides guidance on social responsibility. It's a standard that helps organizations understand and implement social responsibility practices. It emphasizes that social responsibility is about how organizations interact with society and the environment, and it encourages a process-oriented approach rather than focusing solely on outcomes.\n\nMoreover, global governance trends do emphasize collaboration among different stakeholders, including governments, businesses, and civil society organizations. The standard promotes multi-stakeholder engagement, which is a form of collaboration.\n\nAlso, there's a growing recognition that the process of decision-making is as important as the outcomes, especially in global governance where legitimacy and acceptance are crucial.\n\nFinally, frameworks are preferred over specific norms or legislation because they allow for adaptability and take into account the diverse contexts in which organizations operate.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I believe the correct answer is A: social responsibility, collaboration, process, and frameworks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
