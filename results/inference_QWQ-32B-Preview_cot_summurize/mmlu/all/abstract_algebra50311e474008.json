                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to determine whether the polynomial \\(x^2 - 12\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\) satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). The options are A. Yes, with \\(p=2\\); B. Yes, with \\(p=3\\); C. Yes, with \\(p=5\\); D. No.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Eisenstein criterion is. Eisenstein's criterion is a way to determine if a polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers. The general statement is: for a polynomial \\(f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0\\) with integer coefficients, if there exists a prime number \\(p\\) such that:\n\n1. \\(p\\) divides each \\(a_i\\) for \\(i < n\\),\n\n2. \\(p\\) does not divide \\(a_n\\),\n\n3. \\(p^2\\) does not divide \\(a_0\\),\n\nthen \\(f(x)\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nSo, for my polynomial \\(x^2 - 12\\), which is \\(1 \\cdot x^2 + 0 \\cdot x + (-12)\\), I have \\(a_2 = 1\\), \\(a_1 = 0\\), and \\(a_0 = -12\\).\n\nI need to check for each prime \\(p\\) given in the options whether these three conditions hold.\n\nLet's start with option A: \\(p = 2\\).\n\n1. Check if \\(p\\) divides each \\(a_i\\) for \\(i < n\\). Here, \\(i < 2\\), so \\(i = 1\\) and \\(i = 0\\).\n\n- \\(a_1 = 0\\), and \\(2\\) divides \\(0\\).\n\n- \\(a_0 = -12\\), and \\(2\\) divides \\(-12\\) because \\(-12 = -6 \\times 2\\).\n\n2. Check if \\(p\\) does not divide \\(a_n\\). Here, \\(a_2 = 1\\), and \\(2\\) does not divide \\(1\\) because \\(1\\) is not a multiple of \\(2\\).\n\n3. Check if \\(p^2\\) does not divide \\(a_0\\). Here, \\(p^2 = 4\\), and \\(a_0 = -12\\). Does \\(4\\) divide \\(-12\\)? Yes, because \\(-12 = -3 \\times 4\\). So, \\(4\\) divides \\(-12\\), which means \\(p^2\\) divides \\(a_0\\).\n\nWait a minute, the third condition says that \\(p^2\\) should not divide \\(a_0\\). But in this case, \\(p^2 = 4\\) does divide \\(a_0 = -12\\). Therefore, the Eisenstein criterion is not satisfied for \\(p = 2\\).\n\nSo, option A is incorrect.\n\nNext, option B: \\(p = 3\\).\n\n1. Check if \\(p\\) divides each \\(a_i\\) for \\(i < n\\).\n\n- \\(a_1 = 0\\), and \\(3\\) divides \\(0\\).\n\n- \\(a_0 = -12\\), and \\(3\\) divides \\(-12\\) because \\(-12 = -4 \\times 3\\).\n\n2. Check if \\(p\\) does not divide \\(a_n\\). Here, \\(a_2 = 1\\), and \\(3\\) does not divide \\(1\\).\n\n3. Check if \\(p^2\\) does not divide \\(a_0\\). Here, \\(p^2 = 9\\), and \\(a_0 = -12\\). Does \\(9\\) divide \\(-12\\)? Well, \\(-12\\) divided by \\(9\\) is \\(-1.333...\\), which is not an integer. So, \\(9\\) does not divide \\(-12\\).\n\nTherefore, all three conditions are satisfied for \\(p = 3\\): \\(3\\) divides \\(0\\) and \\(-12\\), does not divide \\(1\\), and \\(9\\) does not divide \\(-12\\). So, Eisenstein's criterion applies, and the polynomial is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nWait, but I know that \\(x^2 - 12\\) can be factored as \\((x - \\sqrt{12})(x + \\sqrt{12})\\), but since \\(\\sqrt{12}\\) is not rational, this polynomial should be irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). So, Eisenstein's criterion confirms this for \\(p = 3\\).\n\nBut let's check option C just to be thorough: \\(p = 5\\).\n\n1. Check if \\(p\\) divides each \\(a_i\\) for \\(i < n\\).\n\n- \\(a_1 = 0\\), and \\(5\\) divides \\(0\\).\n\n- \\(a_0 = -12\\), and \\(5\\) divides \\(-12\\)? Well, \\(-12\\) divided by \\(5\\) is \\(-2.4\\), which is not an integer. So, \\(5\\) does not divide \\(-12\\).\n\nSince the first condition fails (because \\(p\\) does not divide \\(a_0\\)), Eisenstein's criterion does not apply for \\(p = 5\\).\n\nSo, only for \\(p = 3\\) does the Eisenstein criterion hold for this polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Yes, with \\(p=3\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
