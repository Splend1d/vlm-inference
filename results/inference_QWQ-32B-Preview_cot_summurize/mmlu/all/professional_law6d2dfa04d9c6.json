                    "text": "This is a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. So, we have a woman who bought some land with a deed that says she can't transfer any interest in the land for 10 years. She tries to sell it after 2 years, and the buyer finds out about this restriction and backs out. Now, she's suing for specific performance, which means she wants the court to make the buyer go through with the purchase.\n\nFirst, let's look at option A: \"The investor, because the woman cannot transfer any interest in the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\" Hmm, the deed says she can't transfer any interest for 10 years, and she's trying to transfer it after 2 years, which is within that 10-year period. So, technically, she's in breach of the deed's condition. That might mean the investor has a valid reason to refuse closing.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this. Is this condition in the deed something that affects the title? If the deed has a restriction on transfer, does that make the title unmarketable? Maybe. But the contract between the woman and the investor doesn't specify anything about the woman's title obligations. It's silent on that point.\n\nOption B says: \"The investor, because the woman's heirs did not join in the contract.\" Okay, the deed says \"to the woman, her heirs and assigns, provided however that said grantee may not transfer any interest in the land for 10 years from the date of this instrument.\" So, the heirs are mentioned in the deed, but in this transaction, it's just the woman selling the land. Do her heirs need to join in the contract? Probably not, because it's her personal property, and she's selling it during her lifetime. Heirs typically come into play upon her death. So, this seems less relevant.\n\nOption C: \"The woman, because the contract did not obligate her to provide marketable title.\" Now, this is interesting. The contract is silent on the woman's title obligation. In real estate transactions, usually, the seller is expected to provide marketable title, meaning title that is free from significant defects that would deter a reasonable buyer. But since the contract is silent on this, maybe the woman isn't obligated to provide marketable title. However, in many jurisdictions, there's an implied warranty of marketable title in real estate contracts, even if it's not expressly stated.\n\nOption D: \"The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\" This is another important point. Restraints on alienation, which are clauses that limit the owner's ability to sell or transfer the property, are generally disfavored in law and often void as against public policy. The idea is that property should be freely alienable. So, if this provision in the deed is void, then the woman shouldn't be restricted from transferring the land.\n\nBut, is this particular restraint void? In many places, reasonable restrictions on transfer are allowed, especially if they serve a legitimate purpose, like preventing premature development or maintaining certain standards in a neighborhood. However, a flat-out prohibition on transfer for 10 years might be too restrictive and thus void.\n\nGiven all this, let's consider who is likely to prevail.\n\nIf the restraint on transfer is void, then the woman can transfer the land whenever she wants, and the investor has to go through with the purchase. That would mean the woman prevails, and option D is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the restraint is valid, then the woman is in breach of the deed by trying to transfer the land within 10 years, which could make the title unmarketable. In that case, the investor is justified in refusing to close, and option A would be correct.\n\nNow, considering that restraints on alienation are generally void, unless they serve a specific, legitimate purpose, it's likely that this 10-year prohibition is unenforceable. Therefore, the woman should be able to transfer the land, and the investor should be compelled to go through with the purchase.\n\nAlso, since the contract is silent on title obligations, it might be argued that the woman isn't guaranteeing marketable title, but in practice, courts often imply such a warranty in real estate contracts.\n\nMoreover, even if the restraint is void, the investor might argue that they relied on the deed when deciding whether to buy the property. But ultimately, if the restraint is unenforceable, it shouldn't prevent the woman from selling the land.\n\nTherefore, I think the woman is likely to prevail, and the correct answer is D: \"The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another angle. Maybe the restraint isn't entirely void, or perhaps there are exceptions in this jurisdiction that allow such restraints for a certain period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the investor can argue that even if the restraint is void, the woman induced them to enter the contract by representing that the title was clear, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven that the question presents this as a multiple-choice problem, and option D seems the most straightforward and legally sound, I'll stick with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
