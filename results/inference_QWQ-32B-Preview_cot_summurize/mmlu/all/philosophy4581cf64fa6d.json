I remember that he talks about different kinds of knowledge and practical wisdom, but I'm not sure exactly what he transitions to next.\n\nLet me think about this. Ethics is part of his work on practical philosophy, right? So maybe he moves on to something related, like politics or maybe even aesthetics.\n\nWait, I think I remember something about theology being mentioned in his works, but I'm not sure if that's at the end of Ethics. Maybe in Metaphysics?\n\nLet me consider the options one by one.\n\nOption A is aesthetics. I know that Aristotle wrote about aesthetics, particularly in his Poetics, where he discusses poetry and drama. But is that what he segueways into at the end of Ethics?\n\nOption B is theology. Aristotle does discuss theology, especially in Metaphysics, where he talks about the first causes and God as the unmoved mover. But again, is that directly after Ethics?\n\nOption C is politics. Ethics is often followed by Politics in Aristotle's corpus. In Ethics, he discusses the good life for an individual, and in Politics, he extends that to the good life for a community or city-state. That seems like a natural progression.\n\nOption D is natural science. Aristotle wrote extensively on natural science, but I don't recall Ethics leading directly into that.\n\nWait, maybe I should look back at the structure of Aristotle's works. In the organized corpus we have today, Ethics comes before Politics. So it makes sense that he would be transitioning from individual ethics to political ethics.\n\nAlso, in Ethics, Aristotle talks about the highest good for a human being, which is eudaimonia, often translated as happiness or flourishing. And in Politics, he extends this to the idea of the polis, the city-state, achieving its own form of eudaimonia.\n\nSo, based on that, I think the answer is C, politics.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should consider if he mentions aesthetics at the end of Ethics. I don't recall any direct connection there.\n\nTheology might be a temptation because Aristotle does discuss divine beings in Metaphysics, but that's a different work.\n\nNatural science seems less connected to Ethics, at least in terms of immediate succession.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C, politics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
