                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Darwin and where he got the idea that the Earth is very old. The options are Georges Cuvier, Charles Lyell, Alfred Wallace, and Thomas Malthus. I know that Darwin developed the theory of natural selection, but I'm not sure who influenced his thoughts on the age of the Earth.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who these people were and what they contributed to science during Darwin's time.\n\nGeorges Cuvier was a French naturalist and zoologist who is considered the father of paleontology. He proposed the theory of catastrophism, which suggested that Earth's history was marked by a series of catastrophes that led to the extinction of species. So, he did believe in the Earth being older than thought by some, but I'm not sure if he supported the idea of an ancient Earth in the same way Darwin needed for his theory.\n\nCharles Lyell was a British geologist who wrote \"Principles of Geology.\" This book advocated for uniformitarianism, the idea that the same geological processes we see today have been acting consistently over very long periods of time. This would imply that the Earth is very old, which would give enough time for natural selection to work as Darwin proposed.\n\nAlfred Wallace is known for developing a theory of natural selection independently around the same time as Darwin. He is sometimes referred to as the co-discoverer of natural selection. So, he was more of a collaborator in the development of the theory rather than a source for the concept of Earth's ancient age.\n\nThomas Malthus was an English cleric and scholar whose work on population growth influenced Darwin's thinking about competition for resources in nature. Malthus argued that populations tend to grow exponentially while food supplies grow arithmetically, leading to struggles for existence. This idea was key to Darwin's conception of natural selection, but I don't think Malthus directly addressed the age of the Earth.\n\nGiven this, it seems like Charles Lyell is the most likely source for Darwin's concept of Earth's ancient age. Lyell's uniformitarianism provided the necessary deep time framework that Darwin needed for his mechanism of natural selection to operate gradually over millions of years.\n\nI remember that Darwin read Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\" during his voyage on the Beagle and was greatly influenced by it. Lyell's work helped Darwin to think in terms of vast geological time scales, which were essential for his theory of evolution by natural selection.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Charles Lyell.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
