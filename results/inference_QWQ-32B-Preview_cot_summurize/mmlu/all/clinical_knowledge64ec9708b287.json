                    "text": "The pH of water is typically around 7, which is considered neutral. So, the correct answer is B. 7.\n\npH is a measure of how acidic or basic a substance is. The scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Substances with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a pH greater than 7 are basic or alkaline.\n\nWater, in its pure form, has a balanced proportion of hydrogen ions (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-), which gives it a neutral pH of 7. However, in real-world scenarios, water can be slightly acidic or basic depending on the dissolved substances it contains. For example, rainwater can have a pH around 5.6 due to the presence of carbon dioxide, which forms carbonic acid.\n\nBut in general, when we talk about the pH of water, we consider it to be 7.\n\n**Reference:**\n- Tomlinson, J. R. (2012). *Water Quality: An Introduction*. John Wiley & Sons.\n\n**Formula:**\nThe pH is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log_{10}[\\text{H}^+] \\]\nwhere \\([\\text{H}^+]\\) is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter.\n\n**Table:**\n| pH Level | Classification |\n|----------|----------------|\n| 0-3      | Strong Acid    |\n| 4-6      | Weak Acid      |\n| 7        | Neutral        |\n| 8-10     | Weak Base      |\n| 11-14    | Strong Base    |\n\n**Code:**\nTo calculate pH in Python:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_ph(hydrogen_concentration):\n    ph = -math.log10(hydrogen_concentration)\n    return ph\n\n# For pure water, [H+] is 1 x 10^-7 M\nhydrogen_concentration = 1e-7\nprint(calculate_ph(hydrogen_concentration))  # Output should be 7.0\n```\n\n**Graph:**\nA pH scale graph typically shows pH values from 0 to 14, with 7 in the middle labeled as \"neutral,\" values below 7 as \"acidic,\" and values above 7 as \"basic.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUnderstanding the pH of water is fundamental in chemistry and environmental science. It helps in assessing water quality, biological processes, and chemical reactions involving water.\n\n**Further Reading:**\n- Snoeyink, V. L., & Jenkins, D. (1980). *Water Chemistry*.

What is the pH of pure water?\n   - A) 3.5\n   - B) 7\n   - C) 12\n   - D) 6.25\n\n2. What does a pH value below 7 indicate?\n   - A) Basic\n   - B) Acidic\n   - C) Neutral\n   - D) None of the above\n\n3. What is the pH range for weak bases?\n   - A) 0-3\n   - B) 4-6\n   - C) 7\n   - D) 8-10\n\n**Answers:**\n1. B\n2. B\n3. D"
