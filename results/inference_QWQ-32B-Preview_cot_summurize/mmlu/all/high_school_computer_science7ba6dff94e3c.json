                    "text": "This question is about how technology companies can use the observation that computer processing speeds double every two years for planning purposes. This concept is similar to Moore's Law, which is a guiding principle in the technology industry. Let's look at each option to see which one best describes how companies can use this observation.\n\nOption A says that companies can accurately predict the dates when new computing innovations will be available to use. While the observation about processing speeds doubling every two years provides a general trend, it doesn't guarantee the exact dates for new innovations. There are many factors that can affect the development timeline of new technologies, such as research breakthroughs, market demand, and economic conditions. So, relying solely on this observation to predict exact dates might not be accurate.\n\nOption B suggests that companies can plan to double the costs of new products each time advances in processing speed occur. This doesn't make much sense because generally, as technology advances, the cost per unit of processing power tends to decrease due to improvements in manufacturing efficiency and economies of scale. So, doubling the costs with each advance would go against this trend and might not be a viable strategy for companies.\n\nOption C states that technology companies can set research and development goals based on anticipated processing speeds. This seems like a reasonable approach. If companies expect processing speeds to double every two years, they can set their R&D targets accordingly. For example, they can aim to develop new technologies or optimize existing ones to take advantage of the increased processing power. This can help them stay competitive and meet the evolving needs of their customers.\n\nOption D suggests that technology companies can spend less effort developing new processors because processing speed will always improve at the observed rate. This is probably not a wise strategy. The observation about processing speeds doubling every two years is a trend, not a guarantee. It requires continuous innovation and investment in R&D to maintain this pace. If companies relax their efforts, they might fall behind their competitors and miss out on opportunities to improve their products and services.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to be the best choice. It suggests that companies can use the observation about processing speeds to set realistic and ambitious goals for their research and development efforts, which aligns with how companies might use such trends in their planning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
