These stockholders have varying levels of ownership depending on the number of shares they hold. The company is required to have its shares traded on a public stock exchange, making it accessible to a wide range of investors.\n\nWhile the CEO and the president play crucial roles in managing the day-to-day operations and strategic direction of the company, they are not the owners. Instead, they are typically appointed by the board of directors, which is elected by the stockholders. The board represents the interests of the stockholders and oversees the management team.\n\nThe government may have some regulatory oversight over publicly held companies to ensure they comply with laws and regulations related to financial reporting, corporate governance, and investor protection. However, the government does not own the company; it is the stockholders who are the owners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. the stockholders."
