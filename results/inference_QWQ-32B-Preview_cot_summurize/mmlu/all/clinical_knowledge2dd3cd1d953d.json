                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which one of these options is correct for transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria. So, I know that fatty acids are big molecules, and mitochondria have membranes that are selective about what goes in and out. So, there must be some kind of mechanism to get them inside.\n\nFirst, I remember that mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, and they use fatty acids for energy through a process called beta-oxidation. But to get into the mitochondria, fatty acids need to cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is impermeable to them directly.\n\nOption A is thiokinase. I think thiokinase is involved in the first step of fatty acid oxidation, where fatty acids are activated to form acyl-CoA. But I don't recall it being directly involved in the transport into the mitochondria.\n\nOption B is coenzyme A, or CoA. I know that fatty acids are activated by being joined to CoA, forming acyl-CoA molecules. This activation step happens in the cytosol before the fatty acids can be transported into the mitochondria. So, CoA is involved in the activation, but is it directly involved in the transport?\n\nOption C is acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is a key molecule in metabolism; it's produced from the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and it enters the citric acid cycle in the mitochondria. But I don't think it's directly involved in transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\nOption D is carnitine. Hmm, I think carnitine plays a role in fatty acid transport into the mitochondria. I recall that there's a carnitine palmitoyltransferase system that helps ferry fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. Fatty acids are first activated in the cytosol by thiokinase, forming acyl-CoA. Then, to get into the mitochondria, they need to be transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Since the membrane is impermeable to acyl-CoA, there must be a specific transport mechanism.\n\nI believe carnitine acts as a shuttle. It forms a complex with acyl-CoA, creating acyl-carnitine, which can then cross the mitochondrial membrane with the help of a carnitine-acyl-carnitine translocase. Once inside the mitochondria, another carnitine palmitoyltransferase converts acyl-carnitine back into acyl-CoA, and carnitine is recycled back out.\n\nSo, in this process, carnitine is bound to the fatty acid, in the form of acyl-carnitine, for transport across the membrane.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. carnitine.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any other option that could make sense?\n\nOption A, thiokinase, is involved in activation, not transport.\n\nOption B, CoA, is part of the activated fatty acid, but it's not the transport molecule itself.\n\nOption C, acetyl-CoA, is involved in metabolism inside the mitochondria, but not in the transport of fatty acids.\n\nSo, yes, D. carnitine seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
