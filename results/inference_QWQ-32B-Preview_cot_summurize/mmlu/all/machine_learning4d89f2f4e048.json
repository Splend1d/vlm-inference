                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two statements one by one and see if they're true or false.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"The back-propagation algorithm learns a globally optimal neural network with hidden layers.\"\n\nOkay, so back-propagation is an algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons. It does this by propagating the error from the output back through the network, hence the name.\n\nNow, the key phrase here is \"globally optimal.\" In optimization problems, a global optimum is the best possible solution out of all possible solutions. In the context of neural networks, this would mean that back-propagation finds the set of weights that results in the absolute lowest error across the entire training dataset.\n\nBut here's the thing: back-propagation is a gradient descent method, which means it iteratively adjusts the weights in the direction of steepest descent of the error function. However, gradient descent methods are known to get stuck in local minima, which are points where the error is lower than in the immediate surrounding points, but not necessarily the lowest possible error overall.\n\nIn other words, back-propagation can find a locally optimal solution, but it doesn't guarantee that it's the global optimum, especially in complex networks with many hidden layers and non-convex error surfaces.\n\nSo, I think Statement 1 is false because back-propagation does not guarantee a globally optimal neural network.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"The VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line.\"\n\nVC dimension is a concept from statistical learning theory that quantifies the capacity or complexity of a model. It represents the maximum number of points that can be arbitrarily labeled and still shattered by the model.\n\nIn the case of a line in two-dimensional space, we're talking about linear classifiers, like perceptrons.\n\nShattering means that for any possible labeling of the points, there exists a hypothesis in the model class that can correctly classify them.\n\nFor a line in 2D space, it can separate points into two classes based on which side of the line they fall on.\n\nNow, let's consider three points in general position in 2D space. If these points are not colinear, it's possible to draw a line that separates them in any binary classification way, meaning you can shatter them.\n\nHowever, if the three points are colinear, there are certain labelings that cannot be achieved by a linear classifier. For example, if you have three points on a line, labeled positive, negative, positive, respectively, there's no straight line that can separate them perfectly.\n\nBut the VC dimension is defined based on the maximum number of points that can be shattered in some configuration. So, even if there are specific configurations of three points that cannot be shattered, there are other configurations of three points that can be shattered.\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension of a line in 2D space is 3, not at most 2.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is false because the VC dimension of a line is actually 3.\n\nGiven that both statements are false, the correct choice would be B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
