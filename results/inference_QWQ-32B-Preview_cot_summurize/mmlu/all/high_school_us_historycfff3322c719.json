I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals\u2014if we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves. But again, I stand on my statement that I think that libertarianism and conservatism are traveling the same path.\"\nRonald Reagan, Interview published in Reason magazine, 1975\nWhich of the following groups would be most opposed to the sentiments expressed in the excerpt above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, we have an excerpt from an interview with Ronald Reagan in 1975, where he talks about conservatism and libertarianism. He seems to be equating conservatism with libertarianism, emphasizing less government interference, more individual freedom, and a preference for limited government functions.\n\nThe question is asking which group among the options would be most opposed to these sentiments. So, I need to understand what each of these groups stands for and see who would disagree the most with Reagan's views here.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Neoconservatives.\n\nNeoconservatives are generally associated with a more interventionist foreign policy and a blend of conservative and liberal policies. They might support a strong national defense and intervention abroad, but they also sometimes support government programs that are more typically associated with liberalism, like education and some social welfare programs. So, compared to Reagan's emphasis on less government interference and more individual freedom, neoconservatives might not fully align, but they're still part of the conservative spectrum. So, they might not be the most opposed.\n\nOption B: Reagan Democrats.\n\nReagan Democrats refers to Democrats, particularly working-class Democrats, who voted for Reagan in the 1980 elections, largely due to his economic policies and stance on social issues. These voters were attracted to Reagan's message of smaller government and economic conservatism. So, it's unlikely that this group would be opposed to Reagan's sentiments; in fact, they were drawn to them.\n\nOption C: Progressive Liberals.\n\nProgressive liberals are typically in favor of more government intervention to address social and economic inequalities. They support policies like universal healthcare, higher taxes on the wealthy, and expanded social safety nets. This is directly opposed to Reagan's call for less government interference and more individual freedom. So, this group might be strongly opposed to Reagan's views.\n\nOption D: Populists.\n\nPopulism can be tricky because it can come from both the left and the right. Populists often appeal to the \"common people\" against the elites, and their policies can vary widely. Some populists might favor more government intervention to protect domestic industries and jobs, while others might call for less government interference. So, without specifying left-populism or right-populism, it's hard to pin down their stance on Reagan's sentiments.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems that progressive liberals (Option C) would be the most opposed to Reagan's views expressed in the excerpt. Their support for more government intervention and social welfare programs directly contradicts Reagan's emphasis on less government and more individual freedom.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the other options again.\n\nNeoconservatives (Option A): While they might not fully agree with Reagan's limited government stance, especially on domestic issues, they are still generally conservative and might share some views with him.\n\nReagan Democrats (Option B): These voters were attracted to Reagan's policies, so they wouldn't be opposed.\n\nPopulists (Option D): As mentioned, populism is broad and can include both left and right variants, making it less uniformly opposed to Reagan's views.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Progressive Liberals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
