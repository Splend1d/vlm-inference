But this question is specifically about light, so maybe it's different.\n\nLet me think about this. In art class, when we mix paints, red, blue, and yellow are the primary colors because you can mix them to get other colors. For example, red and blue make purple, red and yellow make orange, and blue and yellow make green. But that's for pigments and paints.\n\nBut light is different. Light is about additive color mixing, whereas paints are subtractive. So maybe the primary colors for light are different.\n\nI think the primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. That's why they're called the RGB color model. So, red, green, and blue light can be combined in different ways to create other colors, including yellow.\n\nWait, so if red and green light combine to make yellow, then yellow isn't a primary color of light. It's a combination of red and green.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. red - that's a primary color of light.\n\nB. yellow - maybe this is the one that's not a primary color.\n\nC. green - primary color of light.\n\nD. blue - primary color of light.\n\nSo, yellow seems to be the odd one out here.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's recall the RGB color model. Red, green, and blue are the primary colors in additive color mixing, and they can be combined to create a wide spectrum of colors, including yellow.\n\nYes, yellow is created by combining red and green light. Therefore, it's not a primary color in the light spectrum.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. yellow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
