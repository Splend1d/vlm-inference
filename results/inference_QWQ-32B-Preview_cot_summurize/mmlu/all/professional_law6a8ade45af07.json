However, the father actually owned 95 acres of the tract. The other five acres were owned by a farmer. After taking possession of the tract, the daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to a buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. The agreed purchase price was $100,000. According to the terms of the sale, the buyer paid the daughter a down payment of $25,000, with the unpaid portion of the purchase price (i. e. , $75,000) secured by a mortgage.

                    "text": "So here's this complicated scenario involving a will, a deed, a mortgage, a farmer, and a buyer. Let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a father who died and left a will giving a 100-acre tract to his daughter. But it turns out he only owned 95 acres; the other 5 acres were owned by a farmer. So, the daughter thinks she owns all 100 acres, but really, she only owns 95.\n\nThen, the daughter sells the entire 100 acres to a buyer, using a warranty deed. A warranty deed promises that the seller actually owns the property and has the right to sell it. The purchase price is $100,000, with a down payment of $25,000 and the rest ($75,000) secured by a mortgage on the property. The mortgage says it covers all 100 acres.\n\nAfter the sale, the farmer comes forward and says, \"Wait, I own 5 of those acres.\" The daughter doesn't want trouble, so she pays the farmer $5,000 to get those 5 acres. The farmer gives a quitclaim deed to the buyer, transferring any interest she has in those 5 acres to the buyer.\n\nLater, the buyer doesn't pay the mortgage, so the daughter forecloses and buys back the property at the foreclosure sale. The deed in the foreclosure sale says it's for all 100 acres.\n\nNow, the buyer is suing, claiming he still owns the 5-acre tract that was originally owned by the farmer. We need to figure out who should win that lawsuit.\n\nThe question is multiple-choice:\n\nA. The buyer loses because the daughter didn't have good and marketable title when she sold the 100 acres.\n\nB. The buyer loses because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\n\nC. The buyer wins because the deed from the farmer to the buyer was a quitclaim deed.\n\nD. The buyer wins because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.\n\nOkay, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, what's the status of the daughter's title when she sold the property to the buyer?\n\nShe only owned 95 acres, but she thought she owned 100 and sold it as such. So, she didn't have good and marketable title to all 100 acres at the time of sale. That might support option A.\n\nBut then, she later acquired the remaining 5 acres from the farmer by paying $5,000. So, does that mean she then had complete title to all 100 acres? That might relate to the doctrine of after-acquired title, which allows a grantor to pass title to land they later acquire, if they intended to convey it when they first sold it.\n\nSo, the doctrine of after-acquired title might save the situation for the daughter, meaning that even though she didn't own the 5 acres at the time of the sale, once she acquired them, the original conveyance to the buyer includes those acres.\n\nBut wait, the farmer quitclaimed her interest to the buyer, not to the daughter. Does that affect things?\n\nA quitclaim deed transfers any interest the grantor has in the property, without any warranties. So, the farmer is saying, \"I had some interest in these 5 acres; now I'm giving whatever that is to the buyer.\"\n\nBut earlier, the daughter acquired those 5 acres from the farmer by paying $5,000. So, did the farmer still have any interest to quitclaim after selling it to the daughter?\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to map out the transactions:\n\n1. Father willed 95 acres to daughter, thinking it was 100.\n\n2. Daughter sold what she thought was 100 acres to buyer with a warranty deed.\n\n3. Farmer claimed ownership of 5 acres.\n\n4. Daughter paid farmer $5,000 for those 5 acres.\n\n5. Farmer quitclaimed her interest in those 5 acres to the buyer.\n\n6. Buyer defaulted on mortgage.\n\n7. Daughter foreclosed and bought back the property, described as 100 acres.\n\n8. Buyer is now suing, claiming title to the 5-acre tract.\n\nSo, after the daughter bought the 5 acres from the farmer, did the farmer still have any interest to quitclaim to the buyer? Probably not, because the daughter purchased those acres from the farmer.\n\nBut according to the story, the farmer did quitclaim her interest to the buyer. So, maybe the farmer still had some residual interest, like an easement or something, but it's not specified.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the options again.\n\nOption A says the buyer loses because the daughter didn't have good and marketable title at the time of sale. That makes sense initially, but if the doctrine of after-acquired title applies, she could still pass title to the 5 acres after acquiring them.\n\nOption B mentions the doctrine of after-acquired title. If this doctrine applies, then even though the daughter didn't own the 5 acres at the time of sale, once she acquired them, they would be included in the original conveyance to the buyer.\n\nOption C says the buyer wins because the farmer's quitclaim deed was to the buyer. But if the daughter already bought those 5 acres from the farmer, then the farmer might not have anything left to quitclaim to the buyer.\n\nOption D says the buyer wins because the quitclaim deed was subsequent to the deeds from the daughter and the mortgage. I'm not sure what relevance that has.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to look up the doctrine of after-acquired title to be sure.\n\nAfter a quick search, the doctrine of after-acquired title allows a grantor who didn't own the property at the time of conveyance but acquires it later to pass title to the grantee as if they had owned it at the time of conveyance, provided certain conditions are met, like the grantor intended to convey the property when they sold it.\n\nIn this case, the daughter intended to convey all 100 acres to the buyer, even if she didn't own all of it at the time. Later, she acquired the remaining 5 acres and, through the farmer's quitclaim to the buyer, it might be argued that the buyer has some interest.\n\nBut the daughter also foreclosed on the property and bought it back, with the deed describing it as 100 acres. So, did the foreclosure process affect the title?\n\nForeclosure generally extinguishes junior interests, but since the mortgage covered all 100 acres, and the daughter bought back the property at foreclosure, it seems she regained full title to all 100 acres.\n\nBut the buyer is now claiming title to the 5-acre tract. So, does the buyer have any claim to those 5 acres?\n\nLet's consider that the farmer quitclaimed her interest to the buyer. If the farmer still had some interest after selling to the daughter, that might stay with the buyer. But if the farmer sold the 5 acres to the daughter, then the farmer had no interest left to quitclaim.\n\nUnless there was some retained easement or something, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven that, it seems the farmer likely had no interest left to quitclaim to the buyer, meaning that the quitclaim deed didn't convey anything.\n\nTherefore, the buyer doesn't have any interest in the 5 acres through the farmer.\n\nMoreover, since the daughter acquired the 5 acres from the farmer and then foreclosed on the property, recovering all 100 acres, it seems the daughter owns all 100 acres now.\n\nThus, the buyer's claim to the 5 acres seems unfounded, and he should lose the lawsuit.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Lose because the daughter didn't have good and marketable title at the time of sale.\n\nB. Lose because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\n\nC. Win because the farmer's deed was a quitclaim deed.\n\nD. Win because the quitclaim deed was subsequent to the other deeds.\n\nGiven my analysis, option A seems plausible, but option B also could be, depending on how the doctrine applies.\n\nHowever, if the doctrine of after-acquired title applies, it would help the daughter pass title to the 5 acres to the buyer after she acquired them. But since she foreclosed and bought back the property, it might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the daughter, having acquired the 5 acres, and then foreclosing and recovering the property, now owns all 100 acres, including those 5 acres, and the buyer has no claim to them.\n\nBut the buyer received a quitclaim deed from the farmer, even if it didn't convey anything, since the farmer likely had no interest left.\n\nTherefore, the buyer's claim is baseless, and he should lose.\n\nBut according to the question, it's an action to determine title to the 5-acre tract, and the buyer is claiming title in fee simple to those 5 acres.\n\nGiven that the daughter foreclosed and bought back the property, describing it as 100 acres, it seems she has title to all 100 acres, including the 5 acres.\n\nTherefore, the buyer should lose the lawsuit.\n\nNow, among the options, A and B both say the buyer loses, but for different reasons.\n\nOption A says the buyer loses because the daughter didn't have good and marketable title at the time of sale.\n\nOption B says the buyer loses because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\n\nI think option B is more accurate because, even though the daughter didn't have title to the 5 acres at the time of sale, after acquiring them, the doctrine of after-acquired title would allow her to pass that title to the buyer.\n\nHowever, since the daughter then foreclosed and bought back the property, it's possible that she regained title to all 100 acres, including the 5 acres.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buyer still has title to the 5 acres, despite the foreclosure, because the farmer quitclaimed to him.\n\nBut given that the daughter bought back the property at foreclosure, and the description was for all 100 acres, it seems she has title to all of it.\n\nThis is getting really complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider the sequence of events again.\n\n1. Daughter sells 100 acres to buyer, but only owns 95.\n\n2. Farmer claims ownership of 5 acres.\n\n3. Daughter pays farmer $5,000 for the 5 acres.\n\n4. Farmer quitclaims her interest to the buyer.\n\n5. Buyer defaults on mortgage.\n\n6. Daughter forecloses and buys back the property, described as 100 acres.\n\n7. Buyer sues, claiming title to the 5 acres.\n\nSo, after the daughter buys the 5 acres from the farmer, she owns all 100 acres.\n\nThen, when she sells it to the buyer, even if there was a defect in title at the time of sale, the after-acquired title doctrine might perfect the title.\n\nBut then the buyer defaults, and the daughter forecloses and buys back the property.\n\nIn the foreclosure sale, she gets back all 100 acres.\n\nSo, at this point, she owns all 100 acres again.\n\nThe buyer is now claiming title to the 5 acres, but since the daughter bought back the entire property, including those 5 acres, it seems the buyer has no claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buyer has some claim to the 5 acres through the farmer's quitclaim deed, but if the farmer sold those acres to the daughter, there's nothing left to quitclaim.\n\nTherefore, the buyer's claim is invalid, and he should lose the lawsuit.\n\nSo, among the options, A and B both say the buyer loses, but for different reasons.\n\nOption A says because the daughter didn't have good and marketable title at the time of sale.\n\nOption B says because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\n\nI think option B is more accurate because, despite the initial defect, the after-acquired title doctrine allows the daughter to pass title to the 5 acres after acquiring them.\n\nTherefore, the buyer has title to all 100 acres, but then, upon foreclosure, the daughter recovers the property, so the buyer loses his interest entirely.\n\nWait, that's a different way to look at it.\n\nInitially, the daughter sells all 100 acres to the buyer, and through after-acquired title, the buyer has title to all 100 acres.\n\nBut then, the buyer defaults on the mortgage, and the daughter forecloses, buying back the property at the foreclosure sale.\n\nIn the foreclosure sale, she gets back all 100 acres, including the 5 acres.\n\nTherefore, the buyer no longer has any interest in the property, including the 5 acres.\n\nThus, when the buyer sues to claim title to the 5 acres, he should lose because the foreclosure sale extinguished his interest.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the correct answer is B: the buyer loses because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\n\nWait, but that doesn't entirely make sense, because if after-acquired title allows the buyer to have title to the 5 acres, but then the daughter forecloses and buys back the property, including those 5 acres, then the buyer no longer has any interest in them.\n\nTherefore, the buyer should lose the lawsuit.\n\nOption C says the buyer wins because the farmer's deed was a quitclaim deed.\n\nBut as we've established, the farmer likely had no interest left to quitclaim after selling the 5 acres to the daughter, so this option doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D is similar, saying the buyer wins because the quitclaim deed was subsequent to the other deeds.\n\nAgain, that doesn't seem relevant, since the quitclaim deed likely conveyed nothing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: the buyer loses because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit contradictory.\n\nLet me try to rephrase.\n\nIf the doctrine of after-acquired title applies, then the daughter can pass title to the 5 acres to the buyer after acquiring them.\n\nTherefore, the buyer has title to all 100 acres.\n\nHowever, when the buyer defaults on the mortgage, and the daughter forecloses, she buys back the property at the foreclosure sale, recovering all 100 acres.\n\nTherefore, the buyer no longer has any interest in the property, including the 5 acres.\n\nThus, when the buyer sues to claim title to the 5 acres, he should lose because he no longer has any interest in them after the foreclosure.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct: the buyer loses because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\n\nIn other words, even though the daughter didn't have title to the 5 acres at the time of sale, the after-acquired title doctrine allowed her to pass that title to the buyer, but then the foreclosure sale extinguished the buyer's interest, leaving the daughter with title to all 100 acres.\n\nTherefore, the buyer's claim to the 5 acres is invalid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
