I don't remember the exact statistic, but I think it was pretty positive. Maybe around 75% or 90%. Let me think about what was happening in 2019 in terms of U.S.-Germany relations.\n\nIn 2019, the U.S. and Germany were both part of NATO, and there were some tensions, like disagreements over defense spending and other policies. But overall, I believe the relationship was still considered good by many Americans. Maybe around 75% thought it was good.\n\nAlternatively, 90% seems too high because there were some issues being reported in the news. On the other hand, 60% seems a bit low, as I recall that a majority viewed the relationship positively. 45% seems too low, indicating a negative view overall, which doesn't align with my memory.\n\nLet me consider that in 2019, there were surveys and polls conducted on public opinion about international relations. Perhaps Pew Research Center or Gallup had data on this. I should look up some reliable sources to confirm.\n\nAssuming I don't have access to specific data right now, I need to make an educated guess based on what I know about U.S.-Germany relations in 2019.\n\nGiven that both countries are allies and have a history of cooperation, it's likely that a significant majority of Americans viewed the relationship positively. However, with some tensions existing, it might not have been as high as 90%.\n\nMaybe 75% is a reasonable estimate. It suggests a strong majority views the relationship positively, but acknowledges that there is room for disagreement.\n\nAlternatively, 60% could be possible if there was more negativity than I remember, but I doubt it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in 2019, under the Trump administration, there were some strains in the relationship, which might have affected public perception.\n\nBut generally, I think the public was still supportive of the alliance.\n\nLet me think about other factors that could influence public opinion. For example, economic ties between the U.S. and Germany are strong, which might contribute to a positive view.\n\nAlso, cultural exchanges and shared values could play a role.\n\nOn the other hand, specific policy disagreements could have a negative impact.\n\nOverall, I'm going to guess that about 75% of Americans viewed the relationship as good in 2019.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
