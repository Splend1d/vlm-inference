                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have to find which option isn't equivalent to 3 and 3/4 gallons. The options are in different units: cups (c), quarts (qt), and pints (pt). So, first, I need to convert 3 and 3/4 gallons into each of these units and see which option doesn't match.\n\nFirst, let's convert 3 and 3/4 gallons into each of the units given in the options.\n\nStarting with gallons to quarts:\n\nI know that 1 gallon equals 4 quarts. So, 3 and 3/4 gallons would be:\n\n3.75 gallons \u00d7 4 quarts/gallon = 15 quarts.\n\nSo, option B says 15 quarts, which matches our conversion. So, B is equivalent.\n\nNext, gallons to pints:\n\n1 gallon equals 8 pints. So, 3.75 gallons would be:\n\n3.75 gallons \u00d7 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints.\n\nOption C is 30 pints, which matches our conversion. So, C is equivalent.\n\nNow, gallons to cups:\n\n1 gallon equals 16 cups. So, 3.75 gallons would be:\n\n3.75 gallons \u00d7 16 cups/gallon = 60 cups.\n\nOption A is 60 cups, which matches our conversion. So, A is equivalent.\n\nLastly, option D is 13 quarts. But earlier, we saw that 3.75 gallons equals 15 quarts. So, 13 quarts doesn't match.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that conversion to make sure.\n\nConverting 3 and 3/4 gallons to quarts:\n\n3 gallons is 12 quarts (since 3 \u00d7 4 = 12), and 3/4 of a gallon is 3 quarts (since 3/4 \u00d7 4 = 3). So total, 12 + 3 = 15 quarts.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, option D says 13 quarts, which is not equal to 15 quarts.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a trick here. Let's check if perhaps 13 quarts could be equivalent to 3.75 gallons in some other way, but it doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the options. Let's make sure.\n\nOption A: 60 c, which we interpreted as 60 cups, and that matches our conversion.\n\nOption B: 15 qt, which matches our conversion.\n\nOption C: 30 pt, which matches our conversion.\n\nOption D: 13 qt, which does not match.\n\nSo, it seems clear that D is the incorrect option.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check the units again.\n\n- \"c\" likely stands for cups.\n\n- \"qt\" is quarts.\n\n- \"pt\" is pints.\n\nAssuming that's correct, our conversions seem accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the options, but based on standard abbreviations, this seems fine.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 13 quarts is not equivalent to 3 and 3/4 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
