George III was the English king at the time of the American Revolution.\n\nThe American Revolution took place between 1775 and 1783, during the reign of King George III. He was the monarch of the British Empire during this period, and his policies and the actions of his government played a significant role in the events leading up to the revolution and the conflict itself.\n\nTo provide some context:\n\n- **Charles I** reigned from 1625 to 1649. He was executed during the English Civil War.\n\n- **James I** was king from 1603 to 1625. He was the first Stuart king of England and is known for commissioning the King James Bible.\n\n- **Edward III** ruled from 1327 to 1377. He is famous for his military successes in the Hundred Years' War against France.\n\n- **George III** was king from 1760 to 1820. His reign saw significant political and social changes, including the loss of the American colonies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. George III.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nKing George III is often remembered in the United States for his role in the events leading up to the American Revolution. His government's imposition of taxes on the colonies without their representation in Parliament, such as the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, was a major source of discontent among the colonists. The colonists' resistance to these measures eventually led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775.\n\nThe war ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, in which Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States. This was a significant blow to George III's empire and marked a turning point in British colonial policy.\n\n**Historical Significance:**\n\nThe American Revolution had profound effects not only on the United States but also on Europe and the world. It inspired other movements for independence and democracy, including the French Revolution. The ideas of liberty and self-government that emerged during this period continue to influence political thought and systems around the globe.\n\n**King George III's Legacy:**\n\nGeorge III's reign was marked by several important events beyond the American Revolution, including the expansion of the British Empire in India and Africa, and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain. However, his later years were marred by periods of mental illness, which led to the establishment of the Regency, with his son, the future George IV, ruling in his place.\n\nIn summary, King George III was the English king during the American Revolution, and his rule was significantly impacted by the loss of the American colonies.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- \"The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain\" edited by Kenneth O. Morgan\n\n- \"The Penguin History of the United States of America\" by Colin G. Calloway\n\n- \"George III: A Personal History\" by Christopher Hibbert\n\n**End of Answer**\n\n**[Note: This answer is based on historical facts and does not include any personal opinions or speculative information.]**"
