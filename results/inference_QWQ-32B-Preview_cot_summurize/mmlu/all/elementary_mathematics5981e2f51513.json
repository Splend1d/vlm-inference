The question is asking how many stamps he has in total from all these countries.\n\nTo find the total number of stamps, I need to add up the stamps from each country. So, I'll add 22 + 34 + 17.\n\nLet me do this step by step.\n\nFirst, add 22 and 34.\n\n22 + 34 is 56.\n\nNow, add the stamps from Mexico, which are 17.\n\nSo, 56 + 17.\n\n56 + 17 equals 73.\n\nTherefore, Mark has a total of 73 stamps.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 53\n\nB. 63\n\nC. 73\n\nD. 83\n\nThe correct answer is C. 73.\n\nI think that makes sense because when you add those numbers together, it comes to 73. Maybe I'll double-check just to be sure.\n\nOkay, 22 + 34 is indeed 56.\n\nThen 56 + 17 is 73.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 73.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
