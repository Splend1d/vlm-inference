She identified a few different styles, right? Let's see: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and traditional. I need to remember what each of these styles entails.\n\nFirst, authoritative parenting. I think this is when parents are both demanding and responsive. They set clear rules and expectations but also encourage open communication and consider their children's feelings. This style is often associated with positive outcomes in children, like good social skills and independence.\n\nAuthoritarian parenting, on the other hand, is more about being demanding but not very responsive. Parents who are authoritarian expect a lot from their children but don't necessarily communicate openly or consider the child's feelings. This style can lead to children who are obedient but maybe not as independent or confident.\n\nPermissive parenting seems to be the opposite: low in demandingness but high in responsiveness. These parents don't set many rules or expectations but are very nurturing and accepting. Kids raised by permissive parents might be confident but could lack self-discipline and responsibility.\n\nThen there's traditional parenting, which I'm not entirely sure about. I think it might be similar to authoritarian, emphasizing respect for authority and following rules without question. But I'm not completely clear on how it differs from authoritarian parenting.\n\nGiven that, I think authoritative parenting is most likely to produce independent and self-confident adolescents. The balance between setting expectations and being supportive seems ideal for fostering autonomy and confidence.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I should look back at some of the research or recall specific points from Baumrind's studies.\n\nBaumrind's research suggested that authoritative parenting leads to children who are socially skilled, independent, and self-reliant. Authoritarian parenting can result in children who are compliant but maybe not as confident or socially skilled. Permissive parenting might produce children who are confident but lack self-control. And traditional parenting, if it's similar to authoritarian, might have similar outcomes.\n\nSo, based on that, I think the answer is A. authoritative.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider each option briefly.\n\nOption A: Authoritative. As I said, this style balances demands with responsiveness, which should foster independence and confidence.\n\nOption B: Authoritarian. This is more about strict rules and less about openness, which might not promote independence as much.\n\nOption C: Permissive. While permissive parents are responsive, their lack of rules might not provide the structure needed for developing independence.\n\nOption D: Traditional. Without knowing exactly what this entails, if it's similar to authoritarian, it might not be the best for fostering independence and confidence.\n\nSo, overall, authoritative seems to be the best fit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
