                    "text": "So I've got this question about ice cream and reinforcement schedules. Let me see if I can figure this out. So, every time I buy ice cream from the Yellow Brick Road parlor, they stamp my over-the-rainbow card. And once I get ten stamps, I get my next item for free. Okay, so it's like a loyalty program where after a certain number of purchases, I get a reward.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which type of reinforcement schedule this falls under. There are four options: variable-ratio, variable-interval, fixed-ratio, and fixed-interval. I think I remember something about reinforcement schedules from psychology class.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these terms means:\n\n1. **Fixed-ratio schedule**: This is when a reward is given after a set number of responses. For example, every time you buy ten ice creams, you get one free. So, it's a fixed number of purchases before the reward.\n\n2. **Variable-ratio schedule**: Here, the number of responses needed for a reward varies around an average. So, it might be sometimes eight purchases, sometimes twelve, but on average, it's ten.\n\n3. **Fixed-interval schedule**: This is when a reward is given after a set amount of time has passed, regardless of the number of responses. For example, getting a bonus every month.\n\n4. **Variable-interval schedule**: Similar to fixed-interval, but the time between rewards varies around an average. So, sometimes you get the reward after a week, sometimes after two weeks, averaging out to, say, ten days.\n\nIn this ice cream scenario, it's about the number of purchases, not the time between purchases. So, that rules out interval schedules. It's definitely about the number of times I buy ice cream.\n\nNow, between fixed-ratio and variable-ratio, the key difference is whether the number required for the reward is fixed or varies.\n\nIn this case, it's clearly stated: once you purchase ten items, you get your next item free. So, it's a set number of purchases\u2014ten\u2014before you get the reward.\n\nTherefore, this should be a fixed-ratio schedule.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any variation in the number of purchases needed for the reward? The question says \"once you purchase ten items,\" which seems like a fixed number. So, no variation there.\n\nAlternatively, if it were a variable-ratio schedule, it might say something like \"on average, every ten purchases, you get a free item,\" but the actual number could be less or more than ten each time.\n\nBut in this case, it's explicit: ten purchases, then a free one. So, it's a fixed number each time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Fixed-ratio.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
