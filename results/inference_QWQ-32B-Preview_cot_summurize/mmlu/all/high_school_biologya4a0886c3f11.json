                    "text": "Let's see what a heterotroph is. I remember that organisms can be classified based on how they get their energy and nutrients. There are autotrophs and heterotrophs.\n\nAutotrophs are organisms that can produce their own food using inorganic substances and energy from the environment. They are often called producers because they form the base of the food chain. Plants are a classic example of autotrophs; they use photosynthesis to convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nHeterotrophs, on the other hand, are organisms that cannot produce their own food and must obtain organic compounds from other sources. They are consumers because they consume other organisms or organic matter to get the energy and nutrients they need. This includes animals that eat plants or other animals, fungi that decompose dead organic matter, and many single-celled organisms like bacteria that feed on various organic substances.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. obtains its energy from sunlight, harnessed by pigments\n\nThis sounds like photosynthesis, which is something autotrophs do. Heterotrophs don't make their own food using sunlight.\n\nB. obtains its energy by oxidizing organic molecules\n\nThis seems plausible. Heterotrophs consume organic molecules from other organisms and then break them down through cellular respiration to release energy.\n\nC. makes organic molecules from CO2\n\nAgain, this is something autotrophs do during photosynthesis. Heterotrophs don't typically make their own organic molecules from CO2.\n\nD. obtains its energy by consuming exclusively autotrophs\n\nThis is partially correct, but not entirely accurate. Heterotrophs do consume other organisms for energy, which can include autotrophs, but they can also consume other heterotrophs. For example, a lion eats a gazelle, which may have eaten grass (an autotroph), but the lion is consuming another heterotroph.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the best answer. Heterotrophs obtain their energy by oxidizing organic molecules they have consumed from other organisms.\n\nTo double-check, let's think about some examples. Take humans, for instance. We eat food, which contains organic molecules like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Our cells break down these molecules through cellular respiration, which involves oxidizing them to release energy, which is then captured in the form of ATP.\n\nSimilarly, fungi decompose dead organic matter, breaking down complex organic compounds into simpler substances, and in the process, they extract energy.\n\nEven bacteria that are heterotrophic feed on organic substances, oxidizing them to gain energy.\n\nSo, in all these cases, the common theme is obtaining energy by oxidizing organic molecules obtained from other organisms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because that's characteristic of autotrophs, not heterotrophs.\n\nOption C is also about autotrophs, as they synthesize organic molecules from inorganic compounds like CO2.\n\nOption D is too restrictive because heterotrophs don't necessarily consume only autotrophs; they can consume other heterotrophs as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: obtains its energy by oxidizing organic molecules.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
