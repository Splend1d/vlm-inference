The predicates given are:\n\n- Cx: x is a child\n\n- Sx: x is a school\n\n- Gxy: x goes to y\n\nAnd I have four options to choose from:\n\nA. (\u2200x)(\u2203y)[(Cx \u2022 Sy) \u2022 Gxy)\n\nB. (\u2200x)[Sx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nC. (\u2200x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Sy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nD. (\u2200x)[Sx \u2022 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The sentence is \"All children go to some school.\" So, it's about children and schools, and the relationship between them is that children go to schools.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the quantifiers and connectives here.\n\nThe universal quantifier (\u2200x) means \"for all x,\" and the existential quantifier (\u2203y) means \"there exists some y.\"\n\nThe connective \"\u2022\" is conjunction, meaning \"and,\" and \"\u2283\" is implication, meaning \"if... then.\"\n\nSo, let's look at option A: (\u2200x)(\u2203y)[(Cx \u2022 Sy) \u2022 Gxy)\n\nThis reads: For all x, there exists some y such that x is a child and y is a school, and x goes to y.\n\nThis seems close, but I think it's not quite right because it's saying that for every x, if x is a child and there's a school y, then x goes to y. But actually, it should be saying that for all children, there exists some school that they go to.\n\nWait, maybe I'm splitting hairs here. Let's compare it to option C: (\u2200x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Sy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nThis reads: For all x, if x is a child, then there exists some y such that y is a school and x goes to y.\n\nThis seems more precise. It directly captures the idea that every child goes to some school.\n\nOption B: (\u2200x)[Sx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nThis reads: For all x, if x is a school, then there exists some y such that y is a child and y goes to x.\n\nWait, that's different. This is saying that every school has at least one child attending it. That's not what the original sentence says. The original is about children going to schools, not about schools having children.\n\nOption D: (\u2200x)[Sx \u2022 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nThis reads: For all x, x is a school and there exists some y such that y is a child and y goes to x.\n\nThis seems to be saying that every x is a school and has some child going to it. Again, that's similar to option B, emphasizing that schools have children attending them, which isn't the same as saying all children go to some school.\n\nSo, comparing A and C, I think C is better because it directly says that for all children, there exists some school they go to.\n\nOption A seems to be saying that for every x, if x is a child and y is a school, then x goes to y. But really, it should be that for each child, there is at least one school they go to, not that they go to every school that is a school.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the scope of the quantifiers more carefully.\n\nIn option A: (\u2200x)(\u2203y)[(Cx \u2022 Sy) \u2022 Gxy)\n\nThis is saying that for every x, there is some y where x is a child, y is a school, and x goes to y.\n\nBut this could include non-children going to schools, which isn't what we want. We only care about children going to some school.\n\nOption C: (\u2200x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Sy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nThis says that for all x, if x is a child, then there exists some y that is a school and x goes to y.\n\nThis seems more accurate because it restricts the statement to children only.\n\nLet me consider if there's any difference between A and C.\n\nIn A, the universal quantifier is outside, and the existence of y is inside, connected with conjunctions.\n\nIn C, the implication is inside, making it clearer that the existence of y depends on x being a child.\n\nI think C is the better translation because it correctly uses implication to restrict the statement to children.\n\nOption B and D are about schools having children, which is not what the original sentence is about.\n\nSo, the best answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
