                    "text": "I'm trying to understand how increasing the sample size from 200 to 2,000 affects the distribution of the sample proportion in this scenario about geese returning to the same breeding site. Let's see what I know about sample proportions and sample size.\n\nFirst, I recall that the sample proportion, often denoted as p-hat, is an estimate of the population proportion, p. It's calculated as the number of successes in the sample divided by the sample size, n. So, p-hat = x/n, where x is the number of successes.\n\nNow, the distribution of the sample proportion p-hat has some properties depending on the sample size. One key property is related to its spread or variability. Generally, as the sample size increases, the variability of the sample proportion decreases. This makes sense because a larger sample size provides more information about the population, leading to a more precise estimate of the population proportion.\n\nLet me think about this in terms of the options provided:\n\nA. The distribution of the sample proportion will be more spread out.\n\nB. The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.\n\nC. The spread of the distribution of the sample proportion will remain unaffected.\n\nD. The distribution of the sample proportion will more closely resemble the binomial distribution.\n\nOption A suggests that increasing the sample size makes the distribution more spread out. But according to what I just thought, larger sample sizes should decrease variability, so this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says the distribution will be less spread out, which aligns with my understanding that larger sample sizes reduce variability.\n\nOption C claims that the spread remains unaffected, but that contradicts what I know about sample size affecting variability.\n\nOption D says the distribution will more closely resemble the binomial distribution. Hmm, I need to think about that. I know that for large n, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution, but the sample proportion's distribution is itself approximated by a normal distribution under certain conditions, specifically when n is large and np and n(1-p) are both greater than 5.\n\nWait, actually, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion p-hat is approximately normal with mean p and standard deviation sqrt(p(1-p)/n) when n is large enough. So, as n increases, the standard deviation decreases, meaning the distribution becomes less spread out.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check by considering the formula for the standard deviation of p-hat. The standard deviation of the sample proportion is sqrt[p(1-p)/n]. So, as n increases, the denominator gets larger, which means the standard deviation decreases. That confirms that the distribution becomes less spread out with a larger sample size.\n\nOption D mentions that the distribution will more closely resemble the binomial distribution. Actually, for large n, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution, and similarly, the sampling distribution of p-hat is approximately normal for large n. So, in a way, both approach normality, but I think the key point here is that the sample proportion's distribution becomes less spread out, not necessarily that it more closely resembles the binomial distribution.\n\nIn fact, the binomial distribution is discrete, while the sampling distribution of p-hat is continuous and approximately normal for large n. So, I think option D is not the best answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B: The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
