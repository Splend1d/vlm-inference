That seems like a good thing to teach, right? It's promoting non-violence and peaceful problem-solving, which are generally considered positive values in the US. So, I don't think that's morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person spent the afternoon filling a pi\u00f1ata with candy for a birthday party. Filling a pi\u00f1ata is a common activity for birthday parties, especially for kids, and it's meant to be a fun part of the celebration. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. It's a harmless activity that brings joy to children.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them seems to involve any morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
