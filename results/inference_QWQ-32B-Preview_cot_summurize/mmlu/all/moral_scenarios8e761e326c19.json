I have two scenarios here and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: I wore a mask to the store because I didn't want to catch anything while buying merchandise.\n\nHmm, wearing a mask to the store. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing a mask was actually encouraged to prevent the spread of the virus. So, doing that would be considered responsible and maybe even morally good, right? It shows consideration for others' health as well as your own.\n\nScenario 2: In the middle of the exam, I asked permission to go to the bathroom, then went to the bathroom and called my friend to talk about the exam, then returned to finish the exam.\n\nOkay, this one seems different. During an exam, especially in a academic setting, there are usually rules about not communicating with others about the exam content, right? Cheating is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person is asking to go to the bathroom, which is okay, but then they're using that time to call a friend and talk about the exam. That sounds like they're trying to get help or share information in a way that's not allowed.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US, cheating on an exam is wrong because it's unfair to other students and it undermines the integrity of the educational system.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Wearing a mask to the store \u2013 not wrong, maybe even morally good.\n\nScenario 2: Cheating on an exam by contacting a friend during the test \u2013 clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, wearing a mask was a precaution during a pandemic. It was about personal and public health. In 2020, it was a recommended practice, so there's no moral wrong there.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cheating is a clear violation of academic integrity and honesty. It's against the rules and not fair to others.\n\nSo, yes, I think C is the correct choice: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
