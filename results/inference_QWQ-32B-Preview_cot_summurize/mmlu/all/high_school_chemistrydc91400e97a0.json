                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. We have three samples of phenol, each 25.00 mL and approximately 0.10 M. They're being titrated with KOH, and cresol red is used as the indicator. The endpoints are reached at 31.75, 32.38, and 41.75 mL of KOH. So, one of them required significantly more base compared to the others, and we need to figure out why that might be the case.\n\nFirst, let's understand the titration process. Phenol is a weak acid, and KOH is a strong base. So, in the titration, the KOH is neutralizing the phenol. The endpoint is detected by the color change of the indicator, cresol red, which is suitable for this pH range.\n\nNow, the volumes of KOH used are 31.75, 32.38, and 41.75 mL. The first two are quite close, but the third one is noticeably higher. So, there must be something different about that particular titration.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. The indicator was added too late.\n\nIf the indicator was added too late, it might lead to overshooting the endpoint, meaning more base was added before the color change was observed. However, in this case, the indicator was probably added at the beginning of the titration, as is standard procedure. If it was added too late, it might cause more base to be added beyond the equivalence point, but it's unlikely to cause such a significant difference in the volume of base required.\n\nB. The wrong indicator was used.\n\nCresol red is a suitable indicator for this titration because it changes color around the pH expected at the equivalence point of a weak acid and strong base titration. If a different indicator was used, it might have a different pH range for color change, which could affect the endpoint detection. However, the problem states that cresol red was used in all three titrations, so if the wrong indicator was used, it would likely affect all three titrations similarly, not just one.\n\nC. There was a base contaminating the unclean beaker.\n\nIf the beaker used for one of the titrations was not clean and had some base residue, that would effectively increase the amount of base present in the titration. This means that the initial solution would already contain some base, so it would require more acid to reach the endpoint, but in this case, it's the opposite: the sample required more base, not more acid.\n\nWait, no. Let's think carefully. The sample is the acid (phenol), and we're adding base (KOH). If the beaker had some base contaminant, that would react with the phenol before adding any KOH, effectively reducing the amount of phenol that needs to be neutralized by the KOH. So, actually, less KOH would be needed to reach the endpoint, not more.\n\nBut in the results, one sample required more base, not less. So, this option doesn't seem to fit.\n\nD. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.\n\nIf the beaker had some acid contaminant, that would add more acid to the titration. So, in addition to the phenol, there's extra acid from the contaminant. Therefore, more base would be needed to neutralize both the phenol and the extra acid.\n\nThis matches the observation that one sample required significantly more base to reach the endpoint.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the most plausible explanation.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: Adding the indicator too late might cause more base to be added, but it's unlikely to cause such a discrepancy in just one titration if the same procedure was followed for all three.\n\nOption B: Using the wrong indicator would likely affect all titrations similarly, not just one.\n\nOption C: Base contamination would require less base to be added, not more.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is probably D. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
