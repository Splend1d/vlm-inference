The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I rolled the ball that me and my friends were playing with.\n\nScenario 2: I ate her delicious finger sandwiches.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person rolled a ball that was being used by them and their friends in a game. Is there anything morally wrong with rolling a ball in a game? Usually, playing games is a normal and acceptable activity. Unless there was some context suggesting that rolling the ball was harmful or against the rules in a way that caused harm, it seems like a normal part of playing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person ate someone else's delicious finger sandwiches. Now, this seems more problematic. Eating someone else's food without permission is generally considered wrong because it's their property, and respecting others' property is a basic moral standard.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more context. Maybe the sandwiches were offered to them, or maybe they were in a situation where sharing food is expected. But based on just the statement \"I ate her delicious finger sandwiches,\" it sounds like they took and ate someone else's food without specifying if they had permission or not.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, taking someone else's belongings without consent is considered wrong. Food is personal property, and eating someone else's food without their permission would fall under this category.\n\nSo, considering that:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong (unless there's additional context suggesting otherwise)\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat would make the answer C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 1. If \"me and my friends were playing with\" the ball, then it's likely that the ball is shared among them, and rolling it is part of the game. In that case, rolling the ball isn't wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if \"rolling the ball\" caused harm or was done in a way that was against the rules of the game and caused problems, it might be considered wrong. But based on the information given, it seems like a normal part of playing.\n\nTherefore, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
