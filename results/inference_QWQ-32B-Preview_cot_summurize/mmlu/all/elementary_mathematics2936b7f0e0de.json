                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. A coach rounded the number of runners at a track meet to the nearest 10, and the rounded number is 400. I need to figure out which of these options could be the actual number of runners: A. 382, B. 397, C. 406, or D. 447.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how rounding to the nearest 10 works. When you round a number to the nearest 10, you look at the digit in the ones place. If it's 5 or greater, you round up. If it's less than 5, you round down.\n\nSo, if the rounded number is 400, that means the actual number must be somewhere between two numbers. Let's think about what those numbers are.\n\nIf a number rounds down to 400, it means it was closer to 400 than to 390. Similarly, if it rounds up to 400, it means it was closer to 400 than to 410.\n\nLet me try to find the range of numbers that would round to 400.\n\nFor rounding down, the smallest number that rounds up to 400 would be 395, because 395 rounds up to 400 (since the ones digit is 5).\n\nAnd the largest number that rounds down to 400 would be 404, because 404 rounds down to 400 (since the ones digit is 4).\n\nWait, but 405 would round up to 410, right? So, 404 is the highest number that rounds down to 400.\n\nSimilarly, 395 is the lowest number that rounds up to 400.\n\nSo, any number from 395 to 404 would round to 400.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. 382 - That's below 395, so it would round down to 380, not 400.\n\nB. 397 - That's between 395 and 404, so it should round to 400.\n\nC. 406 - That's above 404, so it would round up to 410.\n\nD. 447 - That's way above 404, so it would round down to 450 or something like that, but definitely not 400.\n\nWait, no. Let's think about 447.\n\nTo round 447 to the nearest 10, look at the ones digit, which is 7. Since 7 is 5 or greater, you round up to 450.\n\nSimilarly, 406 would round to 410, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, only option B, 397, falls within the range of 395 to 404, which would round to 400.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check the rounding rules again.\n\nIf a number is exactly halfway between two multiples of 10, the standard rule is to round up. So, for example, 395 would round up to 400, and 405 would round up to 410.\n\nSo, any number from 395 to 404 would round to 400.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 382 is below 395, so it rounds to 380.\n\nB. 397 is within 395 to 404, so it rounds to 400.\n\nC. 406 is above 404, so it rounds to 410.\n\nD. 447 is much higher, rounding to 450.\n\nTherefore, the only possible answer is B. 397.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe the coach used a different rounding method, like rounding half away from zero or something like that. But unless specified, we should assume the standard rounding rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding about what \"rounding to the nearest 10\" means.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the nearest 10,\" so it's clearly rounding to the nearest multiple of 10.\n\nMoreover, the options are pretty straightforward, and only one of them falls within the correct range.\n\nSo, I think B. 397 is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
