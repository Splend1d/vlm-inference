                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"Find the number that makes the statement 2 over 9 equals 14 over '?' true.\" And there are options: A. 14, B. 16, C. 15, D. 63. Okay, so it's asking for the value of '?' that makes the equation \\(\\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{14}{?}\\) true.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for two fractions to be equal. It means that they represent the same value, right? So, \\(\\frac{2}{9}\\) should be equal to \\(\\frac{14}{?}\\). To find the value of '?', I can use cross-multiplication. That's a method where I multiply the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other and set it equal to the product of the denominator of the first and the numerator of the second.\n\nSo, applying that here: \\(2 \\times ? = 9 \\times 14\\). That simplifies to \\(2 \\times ? = 126\\). Now, to find '?', I need to divide both sides of the equation by 2. So, ? = \\(126 \\div 2\\), which is 63.\n\nLet me double-check that. If I plug 63 back into the original equation, does \\(\\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{14}{63}\\)? Let's see. \\(\\frac{14}{63}\\) can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 7, which gives \\(\\frac{2}{9}\\). Yeah, that matches the left side. So, it checks out.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 63 is the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions. If \\(\\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{14}{?}\\), then the ratio of 2 to 9 should be the same as 14 to ?. So, if I multiply 2 by 7, I get 14, and similarly, I should multiply 9 by 7 to get ?, which is 63. That's another way to look at it.\n\nEither way, the answer is 63.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{63} \\]"
