The manufacturer's representative said, \"Deal.\" The next day the manufacturer's representative sent the supplier an unsigned note on company letterhead that stated, \"I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order.\" The manufacturer then sent catalogs to its regular customers advertising washing machines that included the specified motors. The manufacturer did not hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier called to say that it would be unable to supply the motors because it was no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Is the supplier's statute of frauds defense likely to succeed?\n\nA. No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.\nB. No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.\nD.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this contract law problem involving an appliance manufacturer and a supplier. It's about whether a contract for washing machine motors is enforceable or not, considering the statute of frauds. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the statute of frauds is. It's a legal rule that requires certain types of contracts to be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. This is to prevent fraud and disputes over whether a contract was even made or what its terms are.\n\nIn this case, the contract is for the sale of goods, specifically 300 washing machine motors, priced at $300 each, totaling $90,000. Since the price exceeds $500, it falls under the statute of frauds, which typically requires a writing for contracts involving the sale of goods over a certain amount.\n\nNow, let's look at the sequence of events:\n\n1. On June 1, the manufacturer calls the supplier to ask if they can provide 300 motors by October 1.\n\n2. The supplier offers to supply them at $300 each, totaling $90,000.\n\n3. The manufacturer's rep says, \"Deal.\"\n\n4. The next day, the manufacturer sends an unsigned note on company letterhead saying they're happy with the supplier supplying the motors and that they'll call soon about another order.\n\n5. The manufacturer then sends catalogs to regular customers advertising washing machines that include these specified motors.\n\n6. On July 1, the supplier calls and says they can't supply the motors because they're no longer carrying that model.\n\n7. The manufacturer sues for breach of contract, and the supplier defends using the statute of frauds.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether there's a writing that satisfies the statute of frauds.\n\nOption A says no, because the manufacturer relied on the contract by distributing catalogs, making the contract enforceable. I think this might be referring to the doctrine of part performance or promissory estoppel, where even if there's no writing, actions by one party can make the contract enforceable. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nOption B says no, because the supplier didn't object to the note sent by the manufacturer. I don't think that makes sense. The statute of frauds is about the requirements for the writing, not about objections to communications.\n\nOption C says yes, because the manufacturer's note wasn't signed. Maybe, because the statute of frauds typically requires a signature.\n\nOption D says yes, because there's no writing containing the quantity term of the contract. But in the unsigned note, it mentions that they're happy with the supplier supplying the motors, and earlier, the supplier offered 300 motors. So, maybe the quantity is established, but it's not in writing.\n\nLet me think about this again. The statute of frauds requires a writing that includes certain terms, like quantity, and it needs to be signed by the party to be charged.\n\nIn this case, the supplier made an offer: 300 motors at $300 each, total $90,000. The manufacturer accepted by saying \"Deal.\" So, orally, there's a contract. But since the amount exceeds $500, it needs to be in writing and signed.\n\nThe manufacturer then sent an unsigned note acknowledging the supplier will supply the motors and mentioning another order, but it's unsigned. So, does this unsigned note satisfy the statute of frauds? Probably not, because it needs to be signed.\n\nBut wait, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs sales of goods, has specific rules about the statute of frauds. Under UCC 2-201, a contract for the sale of goods priced at $500 or more must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged.\n\nIn this case, the supplier is the one raising the statute of frauds defense, so they're the party to be charged. The writing needs to be signed by them or contain sufficient evidence of the terms.\n\nLooking back, the supplier made the offer orally, and the manufacturer accepted orally. Then, the manufacturer sent an unsigned note acknowledging the supply but didn't include all the terms, and it was unsigned.\n\nAdditionally, the manufacturer relied on the contract by sending out catalogs advertising washing machines with these motors. Maybe this reliance can make the contract enforceable despite the lack of a writing, under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.\n\nPromissory estoppel allows enforcement of a promise even without a formal contract if one party relies on the promise to their detriment. Here, the manufacturer relied on the supplier's promise by advertising the motors, even if they hadn't received orders yet.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this reliance was sufficient to estop the supplier from relying on the statute of frauds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the series of communications between the parties can be construed as a sufficient writing. The supplier's oral offer and the manufacturer's acceptance, followed by the note, might together constitute a writing, but the note was unsigned.\n\nWait, perhaps the supplier's oral offer can be considered part of the writing if it's memorialized in some way. But I think the statute of frauds requires a writing signed by the party to be charged.\n\nGiven that, option C seems plausible: yes, the statute of frauds defense is likely to succeed because the manufacturer's note was unsigned.\n\nBut let's consider option A again: no, because the manufacturer relied on the contract by distributing catalogs. Maybe the reliance can overcome the statute of frauds requirement.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, if there's part performance or reliance on the contract, the statute of frauds can be excused. So, even without a signed writing, the contract might be enforceable.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer relied on the supplier's promise by preparing catalogs and possibly preparing to fulfill customer orders based on those catalogs.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors by the time the supplier backed out. So, perhaps the reliance wasn't substantial enough.\n\nMoreover, the supplier is the one raising the statute of frauds defense, and they didn't sign any writing.\n\nBut perhaps the manufacturer's note, even if unsigned, along with the oral agreement and the reliance, could be enough to enforce the contract.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me look up the relevant UCC provisions.\n\nAccording to UCC 2-201, for the sale of goods priced at $500 or more, the contract must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged.\n\nHowever, UCC 2-201 also provides exceptions, such as when there's a\u627f\u8ba4 of the contract in a document that provides sufficient evidence of its terms, even if not signed by the party to be charged.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer's unsigned note acknowledges the supply of motors, but it doesn't specify the quantity or price.\n\nMoreover, the manufacturer's actions in preparing catalogs might be seen as reliance on the contract.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the court could find that there's sufficient evidence of the contract's existence and terms, despite the lack of a signed writing.\n\nTherefore, option A might be correct: the statute of frauds defense is unlikely to succeed because the manufacturer's reliance on the contract makes it enforceable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option C is correct: the defense is likely to succeed because the manufacturer's note was unsigned.\n\nBut considering the reliance factor, I lean towards option A.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the supplier's oral offer, combined with the manufacturer's acceptance and the subsequent note, can be considered a sufficient writing, even if not signed.\n\nHowever, UCC 2-201 generally requires a signature.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the manufacturer's note, being on company letterhead, can be considered a sufficient writing, especially since it references the supply of motors.\n\nBut it's unsigned, and the statute typically requires a signature.\n\nGiven that, option C seems more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, option D suggests that there's no writing containing the quantity term. But the supplier offered 300 motors, and the manufacturer accepted. The note mentions supplying the motors, but doesn't specify the quantity.\n\nHowever, perhaps the quantity was established in the oral agreement, and the note is just acknowledgment.\n\nIn contract law, sometimes writings that reference prior agreements can be sufficient, especially if they're integrated with earlier writings or statements.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is C: yes, the statute of frauds defense is likely to succeed because the manufacturer's note was unsigned.\n\nThis seems to be the most straightforward application of the statute of frauds requirement for a signed writing.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
