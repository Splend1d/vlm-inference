                    "text": "Let's see what Valls says about discrimination in war. So, discrimination in war refers to the idea that there should be a distinction between who is a legitimate target and who isn't. I think this relates to the concepts of combatants and noncombatants.\n\nOption A says there's no difference between combatants and noncombatants. That seems extreme. In most ethical theories about war, like just war theory, there's a clear distinction made between those who are actively participating in hostilities and those who aren't. So, I doubt Valls would suggest that there's no difference at all.\n\nOption B says the difference is a matter of degree. That sounds more plausible. In reality, the line between combatants and noncombatants isn't always crystal clear. For example, in modern warfare, there might be civilians who are involved in supporting military operations, but they're not directly fighting. So, perhaps Valls is acknowledging that there's a spectrum here.\n\nOption C says the difference is categorical and clear. That seems to be in contrast to option B. If Valls thinks the difference is categorical and clear, then he might be taking a more traditional view where combatants are those who are part of the armed forces and noncombatants are civilians. But, given the complexities of modern warfare, this might not hold up.\n\nOption D defines \"terrorism\" as indiscriminate violence. That seems like a possible definition, but I'm not sure if Valls specifically endorses that. Terrorism is often characterized by attacks on civilians to instill fear, so indiscriminate violence aligns with that.\n\nI need to recall Valls' specific views on this. I remember that Valls emphasizes the importance of discrimination in war, meaning distinguishing between legitimate targets and innocent civilians. He likely argues that noncombatants should not be targeted, and combatants are those who pose a threat.\n\nGiven that, option C seems plausible because it suggests a clear categorical difference between combatants and noncombatants. However, option B also has merit because in practice, this distinction can be blurry.\n\nWait, perhaps Valls acknowledges the complexity but still maintains that there is a fundamental categorical difference. Maybe he recognizes that while there are gray areas, the principle itself is clear: combatants can be targeted, noncombatants cannot.\n\nAlternatively, if Valls is more nuanced, he might argue that the difference is a matter of degree, depending on the level of participation in hostilities.\n\nI think I need to recall the text better. Let me think: Valls discusses the principle of discrimination in war, which is a key principle in just war theory. This principle holds that there should be a distinction between combatants and noncombatants, and that only combatants are legitimate targets.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to align with this traditional view: there is a categorical and clear difference between combatants and noncombatants.\n\nHowever, Valls might also acknowledge that in practice, this distinction can be difficult to apply, which would lean towards option B: the difference is a matter of degree.\n\nOption A is probably incorrect because denying any difference would justify targeting anyone, which contradicts the principle of discrimination.\n\nOption D seems like a possible definition of terrorism, but it might not directly relate to the question about discrimination in war.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is C: the difference between combatants and noncombatants is categorical and clear.\n\nBut I should confirm this by recalling specific points from Valls' discussion.\n\nValls likely argues that in warfare, it is morally required to distinguish between those who are actively engaged in combat and those who are not. This is to minimize harm to innocent lives.\n\nHe might also discuss the concept of double effect, where sometimes harm to noncombatants is acceptable if it is an unintended side effect of a legitimate military operation.\n\nGiven this, emphasizing the need to distinguish between combatants and noncombatants suggests a clear categorical difference.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
