                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"What is the smallest positive integer with factors of 16, 15, and 12?\" And the options are A. 12, B. 22, C. 840, and D. 240. Hmm, I need to find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 16, 15, and 12. That sounds like finding the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.\n\nFirst, I should recall what LCM means. The least common multiple of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set. So, in this case, it's the smallest number that 16, 15, and 12 all divide into without leaving a remainder.\n\nTo find the LCM of 16, 15, and 12, one effective method is to use prime factorization. Let's factor each number into its prime factors.\n\nStarting with 16:\n16 is 2 multiplied by 8, which is 2 times 4, which is 2 times 2. So, 16 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 2^4.\n\nNext, 15:\n15 is 3 times 5, so 15 = 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nAnd 12:\n12 is 2 times 6, which is 2 times 3, so 12 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 2^2 \u00d7 3.\n\nNow, to find the LCM, I need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in these factorizations.\n\nLet's list the prime numbers involved: 2, 3, and 5.\n\nFor 2, the highest power is 2^4 (from 16).\n\nFor 3, the highest power is 3^1 (from both 15 and 12, but 3^1 is the highest).\n\nFor 5, the highest power is 5^1 (from 15).\n\nSo, the LCM should be 2^4 \u00d7 3^1 \u00d7 5^1.\n\nCalculating that: 2^4 is 16, multiplied by 3 is 48, and then multiplied by 5 is 240.\n\nSo, the LCM of 16, 15, and 12 is 240.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 12\n\nB. 22\n\nC. 840\n\nD. 240\n\nOption D is 240, which matches the LCM I just calculated.\n\nBut, to make sure, let's check if 240 is indeed divisible by 16, 15, and 12.\n\nFirst, 240 divided by 16: 16 \u00d7 15 = 240, so yes, it's divisible.\n\nNext, 240 divided by 15: 15 \u00d7 16 = 240, so yes.\n\nAnd 240 divided by 12: 12 \u00d7 20 = 240, so yes.\n\nGreat, that checks out.\n\nBut, is there a smaller positive integer than 240 that is divisible by 16, 15, and 12? Let's think about that.\n\nSince 240 is the LCM, it should be the smallest such number. But just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A is 12. Is 12 divisible by 16, 15, and 12?\n\nWell, 12 divided by 16 is 0.75, which is not an integer, so no.\n\n12 divided by 15 is 0.8, not an integer, so no.\n\nAnd 12 divided by 12 is 1, which is fine, but since it's not divisible by 16 and 15, it's not a valid option.\n\nOption B is 22.\n\n22 divided by 16 is 1.375, not an integer.\n\n22 divided by 15 is approximately 1.4667, not an integer.\n\n22 divided by 12 is approximately 1.8333, not an integer.\n\nSo, 22 is not divisible by any of these numbers, except possibly 12, but as above, it's not.\n\nOption C is 840.\n\n840 divided by 16 is 52.5, which is not an integer.\n\n840 divided by 15 is 56, which is an integer.\n\n840 divided by 12 is 70, which is an integer.\n\nBut since it's not divisible by 16, it's not a valid option.\n\nSo, again, 240 is the smallest number that is divisible by 16, 15, and 12.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is to consider that the number must be a multiple of each of these numbers, so it must be a common multiple, and the least common multiple is the smallest such number.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 240.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
