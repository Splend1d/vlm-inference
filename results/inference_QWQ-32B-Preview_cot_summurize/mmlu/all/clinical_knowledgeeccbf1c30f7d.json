It says, \"Our genetic material is made up of:\" and then gives four options: A. deoxyribonucleic acid, B. ribonucleic acid, C. dinitronucleic acid, and D. protein.\n\nSo, I need to figure out which one of these is the correct component of our genetic material. Genetic material refers to the information that's passed down from parents to offspring, determining our traits and characteristics.\n\nI remember from biology class that DNA is the molecule that carries our genetic information. DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. So, option A seems likely to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's think about the other options to make sure. Option B is ribonucleic acid, which is RNA. I know that RNA is involved in protein synthesis, but it's not the primary genetic material in cells. So, maybe B is not the correct answer.\n\nOption C is dinitronucleic acid. I've never heard of this term before. It doesn't sound familiar at all. Maybe it's a made-up option to distract me.\n\nOption D is protein. Proteins are important molecules in the cell, and they're involved in many functions, but they're not the genetic material itself. Proteins are produced based on the instructions encoded in the genetic material.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like A, deoxyribonucleic acid, is the correct answer. But I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nLet me recall: DNA is a double-stranded molecule that stores genetic information in the sequence of its nucleotides. It's responsible for passing on traits from parents to offspring and for directing the synthesis of proteins in the cell.\n\nRNA, on the other hand, is single-stranded and plays a role in translating the genetic code from DNA into proteins. So, while it's involved in gene expression, it's not the primary genetic material.\n\nProteins are the end products of gene expression, carrying out various functions in the cell, but they don't store genetic information.\n\nAnd dinitronucleic acid doesn't seem to be a recognized term in biology.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the correct answer is A. deoxyribonucleic acid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
