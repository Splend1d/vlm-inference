I need to figure out how the company's debts should be classified between current and long-term liabilities as of December 31, year 2.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the debts the company has:\n\n1. A $1,000,000 line of credit maturing in one year, with $250,000 drawn.\n\n2. A $750,000 secured note due in five annual installments.\n\n3. A $300,000 three-year balloon note.\n\nSince no debt repayments were made in December, the amounts remain as is.\n\nNow, I need to classify these debts into current liabilities (due within one year) and long-term liabilities (due after one year).\n\nStarting with the line of credit:\n\n- It matures in one year, so the entire $250,000 drawn is due within the next year. Therefore, this should be classified as a current liability.\n\nNext, the $750,000 secured note due in five annual installments.\n\n- Since it's due in five annual installments, each installment is $750,000 / 5 = $150,000 per year.\n\n- The first installment is due within the next year, so $150,000 should be classified as a current liability.\n\n- The remaining $600,000 ($750,000 - $150,000) is due after one year, so it's a long-term liability.\n\nNow, the $300,000 three-year balloon note.\n\n- A balloon note means that the principal is due at the end of the term, with possibly interest payments along the way.\n\n- Since it's a three-year note, the principal of $300,000 is due after three years, which is beyond one year from December 31, year 2. Therefore, it should be classified as a long-term liability.\n\nNow, let's sum up the current and long-term liabilities:\n\nCurrent liabilities:\n\n- Line of credit: $250,000\n\n- Secured note (next installment): $150,000\n\nTotal current liabilities: $250,000 + $150,000 = $400,000\n\nLong-term liabilities:\n\n- Secured note (remaining): $600,000\n\n- Balloon note: $300,000\n\nTotal long-term liabilities: $600,000 + $300,000 = $900,000\n\nSo, the correct classification should be current liabilities of $400,000 and long-term liabilities of $900,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Current liabilities of $1,000,000; long-term liabilities of $1,050,000\n\nB. Current liabilities of $500,000; long-term liabilities of $1,550,000\n\nC. Current liabilities of $400,000; long-term liabilities of $900,000\n\nD. Current liabilities of $500,000; long-term liabilities of $800,000\n\nOption C matches our calculation.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check because the line of credit is for $1,000,000, but only $250,000 is drawn. Does that mean the entire $1,000,000 is a liability? No, only the drawn amount is a liability. So, only $250,000 is current liability from the line of credit.\n\nSimilarly, for the secured note, it's a five-year note with equal annual installments, so each year $150,000 is due, with the first due within the next year.\n\nAnd the balloon note is due in three years, so it's long-term.\n\nAdding up again: current liabilities $250,000 + $150,000 = $400,000; long-term liabilities $600,000 + $300,000 = $900,000.\n\nYes, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other aspect I might have missed. For example, are there any interest payments that should be classified as current liabilities? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that any interest is either already included in the principal amounts or is immaterial.\n\nAlso, the line of credit matures in one year, so the entire drawn amount is current. The secured note has installments, with only the next installment being current.\n\nAnd the balloon note is due in three years, so it's long-term.\n\nI think the answer is C. Current liabilities of $400,000; long-term liabilities of $900,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
