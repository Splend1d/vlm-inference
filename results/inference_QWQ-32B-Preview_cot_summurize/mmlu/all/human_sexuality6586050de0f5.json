The options are:\n\nA. underarm hair\n\nB. sweat and oil glands\n\nC. deepening of the voice\n\nD. both A and B\n\nFirst, I need to remember what secondary sex characteristics are. These are physical traits that appear during puberty, beyond the primary sex characteristics which are the reproductive organs.\n\nOption A is underarm hair. I know that both males and females grow hair in their underarms during puberty, so that seems like it's a characteristic for both sexes.\n\nOption B mentions sweat and oil glands. Hmm, sweat glands are present in everyone, but maybe there's a change during puberty. I think sweat glands become more active in both males and females during puberty due to hormonal changes, but I'm not entirely sure if this is considered a secondary sex characteristic.\n\nOption C is deepening of the voice. I'm pretty sure this is more associated with males during puberty, when their voices break and deepen due to increased testosterone. Females also experience some vocal changes, but it's not as pronounced as in males.\n\nOption D is both A and B, which would mean underarm hair and sweat and oil glands.\n\nLet me think about this. Underarm hair does grow in both males and females during puberty, so that makes sense. As for sweat and oil glands, they are present in everyone, but their activity increases during puberty due to hormonal changes. Maybe this qualifies as a secondary sex characteristic in both sexes.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure about whether sweat and oil glands are specifically considered secondary sex characteristics. I know that body hair, breast development in females, and voice deepening in males are classic examples.\n\nMaybe I should look up the definition of secondary sex characteristics to be sure.\n\nAccording to my biology textbook, secondary sex characteristics are physical traits that appear during puberty, distinguishing males and females beyond the reproductive organs. These include things like facial hair in males and breast enlargement in females.\n\nUnderarm hair is another type of androgen-dependent hair growth that occurs in both males and females, so it's a secondary sex characteristic for both.\n\nSweat and oil glands are part of the skin and their activity increases during puberty due to hormonal influences, but I'm not sure if they are specifically classified as secondary sex characteristics.\n\nDeepening of the voice is primarily a male characteristic, although females do experience some changes, they are much less pronounced.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is D, both A and B, because underarm hair does occur in both sexes, and sweat and oil glands do become more active in both during puberty.\n\nBut I need to make sure about the sweat and oil glands part.\n\nLet me see, maybe option D is the correct answer, as it includes underarm hair and sweat and oil glands, both of which undergo changes in both males and females during puberty.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is only A, underarm hair, since that's a more clearly defined secondary sex characteristic in both sexes, whereas sweat and oil glands might not be considered as such.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Maybe I should consider that secondary sex characteristics include physical traits that become more pronounced or change in form during puberty, such as hair growth and changes in body shape.\n\nSweat and oil glands are more functional changes rather than physical traits, so perhaps they aren't considered secondary sex characteristics.\n\nIn that case, maybe option A is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, if both underarm hair and sweat and oil glands are considered secondary sex characteristics in both males and females, then option D would be correct.\n\nI need to decide based on what I know.\n\nUnderarm hair is definitely a secondary sex characteristic in both males and females.\n\nSweat and oil glands: their activity increases in both sexes during puberty, but I'm not sure if this is classified as a secondary sex characteristic.\n\nDeepening of the voice is more of a male characteristic, although females do experience some changes.\n\nSo, perhaps the safest answer is A, underarm hair.\n\nAlternatively, if both A and B are correct, then D would be the answer.\n\nI think I need to go with D, both A and B, assuming that sweat and oil gland changes are considered secondary sex characteristics in both males and females.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
