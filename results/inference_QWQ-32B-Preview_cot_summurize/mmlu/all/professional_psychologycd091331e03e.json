It asks: \"According to Hersey and Blanchard\u2019s situational leadership model, a leader should use a 'participative' style for subordinates who have:\"\n\nThen it gives options:\n\nA. low ability and low motivation.\n\nB. low ability and high motivation.\n\nC. high ability and low motivation.\n\nD. high ability and high motivation.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what Hersey and Blanchard's situational leadership model is all about. I recall that it's a model that suggests leaders should adjust their style based on the maturity or development level of their subordinates. Maturity here refers to the subordinates' ability and willingness to take on responsibility for their work.\n\nThe model proposes four different leadership styles:\n\n1. Telling (S1): High directive, low supportive behavior. This is where the leader gives clear instructions and closely supervises the work.\n\n2. Selling (S2): High directive, high supportive behavior. The leader still provides direction but also explains decisions and sells the ideas to the subordinates.\n\n3. Participating (S3): Low directive, high supportive behavior. The leader involves subordinates in decision-making and supports them.\n\n4. Delegating (S4): Low directive, low supportive behavior. The leader allows subordinates to take responsibility and make decisions on their own.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about the 'participative' style, which I believe corresponds to S3: Participating. So, I need to figure out for which type of subordinates this style is most appropriate according to their ability and motivation levels.\n\nLet's consider the options one by one.\n\nOption A: low ability and low motivation.\n\nIf subordinates have low ability and low motivation, they likely need a lot of direction and possibly some support to build their skills and confidence. So, a telling style (S1) might be more appropriate here because they need clear instructions and close supervision.\n\nOption B: low ability and high motivation.\n\nHere, subordinates may be eager to learn and improve but still lack the necessary skills. So, a selling style (S2) could be suitable because the leader can provide direction while also being supportive and encouraging.\n\nOption C: high ability and low motivation.\n\nSubordinates with high ability but low motivation might know what to do but lack the drive. In this case, a participative style (S3) could be effective because the leader can involve them in decision-making and provide support to reignite their motivation.\n\nOption D: high ability and high motivation.\n\nThese subordinates are both capable and enthusiastic. They likely need less direction and more autonomy. Therefore, a delegating style (S4) would be appropriate as they can take on responsibilities with minimal oversight.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option C seems to be the correct answer: high ability and low motivation.\n\nTo double-check, let's recall the situational leadership model's\u5339\u914d:\n\n- S1 (Telling): Low ability and low confidence.\n\n- S2 (Selling): Some ability but low confidence.\n\n- S3 (Participating): High ability but low confidence or motivation.\n\n- S4 (Delegating): High ability and high confidence.\n\nYes, S3 corresponds to high ability but low confidence or motivation, which aligns with option C.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. high ability and low motivation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
