NeuroAIDS. I need to figure out which one of these dementias is less likely to have cognitive symptoms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what dementia is. Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. It's not a specific disease but a group of symptoms that affect memory, thinking, and social abilities. So, cognitive symptoms are central to dementia.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Parkinson's: Parkinson's disease is primarily known for its motor symptoms like tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowness of movement). However, it can also lead to dementia in its later stages, known as Parkinson's disease dementia. So, cognitive symptoms can occur but might be less prominent initially compared to motor symptoms.\n\nB. Pick's: Pick's disease is a type of frontotemporal dementia that affects the front and sides of the brain, leading to changes in behavior, personality, and language. Cognitive symptoms are very much a part of Pick's disease.\n\nC. Huntington's: Huntington's disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and cognitive decline. So, cognitive symptoms are present in Huntington's disease.\n\nD. NeuroAIDS: This refers to dementia associated with HIV infection of the brain. It can cause a range of cognitive problems, including difficulties with memory, concentration, and multitasking.\n\nThe question is asking in which of these dementias cognitive symptoms are less likely. From what I've gathered, in Parkinson's disease, cognitive symptoms might not be as prominent initially compared to the motor symptoms. In the other options, cognitive symptoms are a key part of the dementia.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Parkinson's, because cognitive symptoms are less likely to be the primary presentation compared to the motor symptoms.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if any of the other options might have less cognitive involvement.\n\nPick's disease is all about frontotemporal dementia, which heavily involves cognitive and behavioral changes.\n\nHuntington's disease also includes cognitive decline as part of its progression.\n\nNeuroAIDS directly affects the brain and causes cognitive problems.\n\nTherefore, among these options, Parkinson's disease dementia might be the one where cognitive symptoms are less likely to be the primary or earliest symptoms, due to the prominence of motor symptoms.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Parkinson's.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
