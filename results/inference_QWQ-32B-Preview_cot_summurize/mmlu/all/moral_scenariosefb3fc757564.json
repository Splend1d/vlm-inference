                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I scored a goal in my soccer game, so the team's goalie punched me.\n\nScenario 2: I put a leash around a dragon and taught it to roll over and blow fire at peasants.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I scored a goal in my soccer game, so the team's goalie punched me.\n\nIn this scenario, the main character scored a goal in a soccer game, and as a result, the opposing team's goalie punched them. Now, from what I know about sports ethics and ordinary moral standards, physical violence, especially unprovoked violence, is generally considered wrong. Punching someone because they scored a goal is not acceptable behavior. It's one thing to have competitive spirit and drive, but it's another to resort to violence. So, in this case, the goalie's action seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the main character (who uses I/me/my). In this scenario, the main character is the one who scored the goal, and the goalie is the one who punched them. So, did the main character do something morally wrong here?\n\nWell, scoring a goal is part of the game; it's what you're supposed to do in soccer. It's a positive action. So, from that perspective, the main character didn't do anything wrong; they played their part correctly. The wrongdoing here is from the goalie's side, not the main character's.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, the main character didn't do something morally wrong; rather, something wrong was done to them.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: I put a leash around a dragon and taught it to roll over and blow fire at peasants.\n\nThis scenario seems a bit fantastical, involving a dragon and peasants, which might be from a fictional context, like a story or a game. However, I need to evaluate it based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, putting a leash on a dragon suggests some form of control or domination over the creature. Whether that's right or wrong might depend on the context, but teaching it to roll over might be comparable to training an animal, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nHowever, the crucial part is \"blow fire at peasants.\" Peasants typically refer to rural workers, often in a historical or fantasy context, but the implication here is that the dragon is being trained to attack or harm these people by blowing fire at them.\n\nIntentionally training an animal (or in this case, a dragon) to harm or attack people is generally considered morally wrong. It endangers the lives of others and shows a lack of concern for their well-being.\n\nSo, in Scenario 2, the main character is engaging in behavior that is clearly morally wrong because they are teaching a dragon to harm peasants.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: The main character didn't do something wrong; they were the victim of wrongdoing.\n\n- Scenario 2: The main character is doing something wrong by training a dragon to harm others.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nOption A is Wrong, Wrong, but in Scenario 1, the main character didn't do anything wrong.\n\nOption B is Wrong, Not wrong, but again, in Scenario 1, the main character didn't do anything wrong.\n\nOption C is Not wrong, Wrong, which matches my analysis.\n\nOption D is Not wrong, Not wrong, but in Scenario 2, the main character is doing something wrong.\n\nSo, C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other perspective.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps some might argue that scoring a goal led to the goalie's reaction, but still, scoring a goal is part of the game, and the responsibility for the punch lies with the goalie.\n\nIn Scenario 2, even if it's a fictional context, the act of training a creature to harm innocent people is universally considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
