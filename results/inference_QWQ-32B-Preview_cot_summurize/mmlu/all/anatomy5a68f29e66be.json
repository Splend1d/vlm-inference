                    "text": "I think the answer is D, the pituitary gland. I remember from biology class that the pituitary gland is often called the \"master gland\" because it controls the functions of other endocrine glands. It does this by secreting hormones that regulate growth, reproduction, and other important processes.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A is the adrenal gland. I know that the adrenal glands produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which help the body respond to stress and regulate metabolism. But they don't control other glands; they have their own specific functions.\n\nOption B is the pancreas. The pancreas is part of both the endocrine and digestive systems. It produces hormones like insulin and glucagon to regulate blood sugar levels. Again, it doesn't control other glands.\n\nOption C is the pineal gland. This gland is involved in producing melatonin, which regulates sleep-wake cycles. It's important for circadian rhythms, but it doesn't have a master control function over other endocrine glands.\n\nSo, compared to these options, the pituitary gland stands out as the one that regulates other glands. It's located at the base of the brain and is connected to the hypothalamus, which helps control its hormone secretion.\n\nOne thing I recall is that the pituitary gland secretes hormones like thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which tells the thyroid gland to produce its hormones, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.\n\nThere's also follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which regulate reproductive functions, and growth hormone (GH), which affects growth and metabolism.\n\nSo, because of its role in controlling the activity of other endocrine glands through the release of various hormones, the pituitary gland is indeed considered the master gland of the endocrine system.\n\nI think I've confirmed that D, the pituitary gland, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
