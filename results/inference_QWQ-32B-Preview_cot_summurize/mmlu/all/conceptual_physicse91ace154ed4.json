                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this problem about seeing my full-face image in a steamy mirror. It's asking for the minimum height of the patch I need to wipe away compared to the height of my face. The options are one-quarter, one-half, the same, or that it depends on my distance from the mirror.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how images form in a plane mirror like a bathroom mirror. I remember that in a plane mirror, the image is virtual, the same size as the object, and located behind the mirror at the same distance as the object is in front of it.\n\nSo, if I want to see my full face in the mirror, I need to ensure that the entire height of my face is visible in the mirror. That means the mirror (or in this case, the clear patch on the mirror) needs to be at least as tall as my face, right?\n\nBut wait, maybe it's not that straightforward. Let me think about it differently. Suppose my face is a certain height, say h. The mirror needs to reflect the top of my head and the bottom of my chin for me to see my full face.\n\nIn a plane mirror, the angle at which light reflects is equal to the angle at which it hits the mirror. So, if I'm standing a certain distance away from the mirror, the portion of the mirror that I need to see my full face might be less than the height of my face.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I'm very close to the mirror, maybe I can see my full face in a smaller patch, but if I'm farther away, I might need a larger patch. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, in a plane mirror, the height of the mirror needed to see your full height is half your height, as long as the mirror is placed at the right height. For example, if you're 6 feet tall, you only need a mirror that's 3 feet tall placed at about 3 feet above the ground to see your full body.\n\nWait, is that true? Let me think about it. If I have a mirror that's half my height and placed at the midpoint of my height, would I be able to see my full body?\n\nLet's say I'm 6 feet tall, and I have a 3-foot tall mirror placed 3 feet above the ground. If I look into the mirror, the top of the mirror should reflect the top of my head, and the bottom of the mirror should reflect my feet.\n\nBut actually, when you look into a plane mirror, the image is reversed up and down, but for the purpose of seeing your full height, it should still work.\n\nWait, maybe I should draw a ray diagram to figure this out.\n\nLet's consider a simple ray diagram for a plane mirror. Suppose I have a person of height h standing a distance d from the mirror. The mirror needs to be tall enough to reflect the top and bottom of the person's face.\n\nLet's denote the top of the person's head as point A and the bottom of the chin as point B. The mirror needs to reflect rays from A and B to the person's eyes.\n\nAssuming the person is looking straight ahead, their eyes are at the center of their face, so roughly at height h/2 from the chin.\n\nSo, rays from point A (top of the head) and point B (chin) need to reflect off the mirror and enter the person's eyes.\n\nLet's denote the mirror's height as m.\n\nI need to find the minimum m such that both A and B are visible in the mirror.\n\nUsing the law of reflection, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n\nLet me consider the ray from point A to the mirror and then to the eye, and similarly for point B.\n\nPerhaps I can use similar triangles to find the relationship between m, h, and d.\n\nLet me try to set up the coordinates.\n\nLet's place the mirror along the y-axis, with the bottom of the mirror at y=0 and the top at y=m.\n\nThe person is standing at x = d, with their eyes at height h/2, so eye coordinates are (d, h/2).\n\nThe top of the head is at (d, h), and the chin is at (d, 0).\n\nNow, the ray from A (top of the head) to the mirror reflects and goes to the eye.\n\nSimilarly, the ray from B (chin) to the mirror reflects and goes to the eye.\n\nI need to find the points on the mirror where these rays reflect.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the reflection point for A as P_a and for B as P_b.\n\nUsing the law of reflection, the angles of incidence and reflection are equal.\n\nAlternatively, in plane mirrors, the image is located behind the mirror at the same distance as the object is in front.\n\nSo, the image of the person is at x = -d, with the top of the head at (-d, h) and the chin at (-d, 0).\n\nThe person is looking at their image, so the rays from A and B in the image appear to come from behind the mirror.\n\nTherefore, to see point A, the person needs a clear path from their eyes to the image of A, which is at (-d, h).\n\nSimilarly, to see point B, they need a clear path from their eyes to the image of B at (-d, 0).\n\nIn reality, these rays reflect off the mirror at certain points.\n\nThe reflection point for ray from image A to the eye can be found using the properties of similar triangles.\n\nLet me find the coordinates of P_a.\n\nThe ray from (-d, h) to (d, h/2) reflects off the mirror at P_a.\n\nThe coordinates of P_a can be found by considering that the reflection point divides the segment from (-d, h) to (d, h/2) in a certain ratio.\n\nAlternatively, since the image is behind the mirror, the reflection point should be at the intersection of the mirror and the line from the eye to the image of A.\n\nSo, the line from (d, h/2) to (-d, h) intersects the mirror (x=0) at y_p.\n\nUsing the two-point form of the equation of a line:\n\n(y - y1)/(y2 - y1) = (x - x1)/(x2 - x1)\n\nPlugging in the points (d, h/2) and (-d, h):\n\n(y - h/2)/(h - h/2) = (x - d)/(-d - d)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y - h/2)/(h/2) = (x - d)/(-2d)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n(y - h/2)*(-2d) = (h/2)*(x - d)\n\nNow, at the mirror, x=0:\n\n(y - h/2)*(-2d) = (h/2)*(-d)\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2d y + h d = -h d / 2\n\nBring terms involving y to one side:\n\n-2d y = -h d - h d / 2\n\n-2d y = - (3 h d)/2\n\nDivide both sides by -2d:\n\ny = (3 h d)/(4 d) = 3 h / 4\n\nSo, P_a is at (0, 3h/4)\n\nSimilarly, for point B (chin), which is at (d, 0), and its image is at (-d, 0)\n\nThe line from (d, h/2) to (-d, 0) intersects the mirror at P_b.\n\nUsing the two-point form again:\n\n(y - h/2)/(0 - h/2) = (x - d)/(-d - d)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y - h/2)/(-h/2) = (x - d)/(-2d)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n(y - h/2)*(-2d) = (-h/2)*(x - d)\n\nAt x=0:\n\n(y - h/2)*(-2d) = (-h/2)*(-d)\n\n-2d y + h d = h d / 2\n\n-2d y = h d / 2 - h d\n\n-2d y = - h d / 2\n\ny = (- h d / 2)/(-2d) = h / 4\n\nSo, P_b is at (0, h/4)\n\nTherefore, to see both the top of my head and my chin, I need to wipe away a patch of the mirror from y=h/4 to y=3h/4, which is a height of 3h/4 - h/4 = h/2.\n\nSo, the minimum height of the patch to wipe away is half the height of my face.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. If I have a mirror that's half the height of my face, can I really see my full face?\n\nLet me check this again.\n\nIf my face is height h, and I wipe away a patch from h/4 to 3h/4 on the mirror, which is a height of h/2.\n\nBut, in reality, if my face is, say, 20 cm tall, I would need to wipe away a 10 cm tall patch on the mirror to see my full face.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me consider extreme cases.\n\nIf I am very close to the mirror, say almost touching it, would I still need to wipe away a patch that's half the height of my face?\n\nIntuitively, when I'm close to the mirror, I might think that a smaller patch would suffice, but according to this calculation, it's still half the height.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm very far from the mirror, would I need a larger patch?\n\nLet me check the calculation again, seeing if the distance d appears in the final result.\n\nIn the earlier calculation, the points P_a and P_b were at 3h/4 and h/4 respectively, and the height of the patch was h/2, independent of d.\n\nSo, according to this, the minimum height of the patch is indeed half the height of my face, regardless of my distance from the mirror.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me think about the field of view.\n\nThe mirror needs to reflect rays from the top of my head to my eyes and from my chin to my eyes.\n\nThe angle subtended by my face at my eyes depends on my distance from the mirror.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the angles involved.\n\nLet me consider the angles of incidence and reflection.\n\nThe angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.\n\nIf I consider the ray from the top of my head to the mirror and then to my eyes, and similarly for my chin, I can set up equations based on angles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the properties of similar triangles.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nConsider the triangle formed by my eye, the top of my head, and the reflection point P_a.\n\nSimilarly, the triangle formed by my eye, my chin, and the reflection point P_b.\n\nThese triangles should be similar.\n\nWait, perhaps not directly similar, but related through the properties of the mirror.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the magnification in plane mirrors.\n\nIn plane mirrors, the magnification is +1, meaning the image is the same size as the object.\n\nSo, the height of the image is equal to the height of the object.\n\nTherefore, to see my full face, I need a mirror that can capture an image of my entire face.\n\nGiven that the image is located behind the mirror at the same distance as I am in front of it, the mirror needs to be at least half the height of my face.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was half, but now I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look for a general formula or a known result.\n\nI recall that in plane mirrors, the minimum height of the mirror required to see your full height is half your height, provided the mirror is placed at half your height from the ground.\n\nIs that applicable here?\n\nIn this case, instead of full height, it's just the face.\n\nAssuming my face is a part of my total height, but perhaps we can consider it separately.\n\nIf my face is h tall, and I want to see my full face in the mirror, then according to that principle, I would need a mirror that's h/2 tall, placed at a certain height.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the mirror showing a certain field of view.\n\nThe mirror acts like a window to the image behind it.\n\nSo, the portion of the mirror that I need to see my full face is the portion that corresponds to the height of my face in the image.\n\nBut since the image is life-size, that would suggest that the mirror needs to be at least as tall as my face.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the mirror only needs to show the portion of the image that corresponds to my face.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the angles.\n\nLet me consider the angle subtended by my face at my eyes.\n\nThe angular size of my face depends on the distance from my eyes to my face, but since the mirror is reflecting the image, the angles should relate in a specific way.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach.\n\nLet me consider the height of the mirror needed to see the top of my head and the bottom of my chin.\n\nFrom the earlier calculation, with the reflection points at 3h/4 and h/4, the height of the patch is h/2.\n\nBut perhaps there's an error in that calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the coordinates.\n\nI placed the mirror along the y-axis, with the person at x=d, eyes at (d, h/2), top of head at (d, h), and chin at (d, 0).\n\nThe image is at x=-d, with top at (-d, h) and bottom at (-d, 0).\n\nThe ray from image top (-d, h) to eye (d, h/2) intersects the mirror at (0, 3h/4)\n\nSimilarly, the ray from image bottom (-d, 0) to eye (d, h/2) intersects the mirror at (0, h/4)\n\nSo, the patch from y=h/4 to y=3h/4 is m = h/2\n\nTherefore, the minimum height of the patch is h/2\n\nBut maybe I need to consider that the mirror needs to show both the top and bottom of my face simultaneously, and that depends on my field of view.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a general formula for the minimum mirror height to see an object of height h.\n\nLet me search for a general formula for the minimum height of a plane mirror to see an object fully.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that the minimum height of a plane mirror required to see your full height is indeed half your height, provided that the mirror is placed at half your height from the ground.\n\nSo, in this case, for your face, which is height h, the minimum mirror height would be h/2, placed at h/4 from the bottom.\n\nThis seems to confirm the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. one-half.\n\nBut the question is about the height of the patch compared to the height of your face, not your full height.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion between face height and total height.\n\nAssuming that \"height of your face\" refers to the vertical dimension of your face, say from chin to forehead, and not your full body height.\n\nIn that case, the principle still applies: the minimum mirror height needed to see your full face is half the height of your face, provided the mirror is placed at the midpoint of your face height.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. one-half.\n\nBut I'm still a bit uneasy about this conclusion. Maybe I should consider a numerical example.\n\nSuppose my face is 20 cm tall. According to this, I need to wipe away a 10 cm tall patch on the mirror to see my full face.\n\nIs that realistic? Let's say I'm standing in front of a steamy mirror, and I wipe away a patch that's 10 cm tall. Would I be able to see my entire face, which is 20 cm tall?\n\nIntuitively, it seems like I'd need to wipe away at least as much as the height of my face to see it fully. But according to this calculation, it's only half.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nLet me consider the placement of the mirror.\n\nIf the mirror is placed at the midpoint of my face, which would be at h/2, then wiping away a patch from h/4 to 3h/4 should allow me to see both the top and bottom of my face.\n\nLet me verify this with actual numbers.\n\nSuppose h = 20 cm, so h/2 = 10 cm (eye level), h/4 = 5 cm, and 3h/4 = 15 cm.\n\nSo, the patch to wipe is from 5 cm to 15 cm on the mirror, which is 10 cm tall.\n\nFrom this patch, I should be able to see the top of my head at 20 cm and my chin at 0 cm.\n\nBut how does that work?\n\nLet me trace the rays again.\n\nRay from top of head (20 cm) to eye (10 cm) reflects off the mirror at 15 cm.\n\nRay from chin (0 cm) to eye (10 cm) reflects off the mirror at 5 cm.\n\nSo, between 5 cm and 15 cm on the mirror, I have the necessary reflection points to see both the top and bottom of my face.\n\nTherefore, wiping away a patch that's half the height of my face, placed at the midpoint, allows me to see my full face.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to wipe away a smaller patch, say less than h/2, I might not capture both the top and bottom of my face.\n\nFor example, if I wipe away only h/4, say from 5 cm to 10 cm, then the reflection points for the top of my head might be above 10 cm, which is not wiped, so I wouldn't be able to see the top of my head.\n\nSimilarly, the reflection point for the chin is at 5 cm, which is wiped, so I can see the chin, but not the top of the head.\n\nTherefore, the minimum patch height is indeed h/2.\n\nHence, the answer is B. one-half.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
