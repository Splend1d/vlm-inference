States outside of the 'family of nations'\n\nC. Communist States\n\nD. The former Soviet states\n\nHmm, I need to think about what \"rogue states\" really refers to. I remember hearing the term in news and politics, but I'm not entirely sure about its exact meaning.\n\nLet me start by eliminating options that I think don't fit.\n\nOption A says \"States aligned with the USSR during the Cold War.\" Well, during the Cold War, there were indeed countries aligned with the USSR, but I don't think that's specifically what \"rogue states\" refers to. The term \"rogue states\" seems more recent, doesn't it?\n\nOption C, \"Communist States.\" Again, that's broad. Not all communist states are considered rogue states. So maybe that's not it either.\n\nOption D, \"The former Soviet states.\" After the USSR collapsed, there were many states that emerged, like Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and others. But not all of them are considered rogue states. So that doesn't seem right.\n\nThat leaves option B, \"States outside of the 'family of nations'.\" Hmm, that sounds vague, but perhaps it's closest to the idea of rogue states.\n\nLet me try to recall what \"rogue states\" actually means. I think it refers to countries that are considered to be unpredictably dangerous, often because they have authoritarian governments, support terrorism, develop weapons of mass destruction, or severely violate human rights.\n\nIf that's the case, then none of the options perfectly match that definition. But maybe option B is the closest, as \"outside of the 'family of nations'\" could imply that these states don't adhere to international norms and standards.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps \"family of nations\" refers to the international community that abides by certain rules and principles, and rogue states are those that don't play by those rules.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up what \"rogue states\" officially means.\n\nFrom what I recall, the term \"rogue states\" was coined by the US government in the 1980s to describe nations that were deemed to be financing or indulging in activities like the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting terrorism, or severely violating human rights.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option B seems to be the most appropriate, as it suggests that these are states that don't conform to the expected behavior of the international community.\n\nOptions A, C, and D seem too broad or specific to certain political systems or historical periods, whereas rogue states are defined more by their actions and policies.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. States outside of the 'family of nations.'\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
