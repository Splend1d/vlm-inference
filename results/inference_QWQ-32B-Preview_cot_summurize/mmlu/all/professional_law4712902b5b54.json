                    "text": "Let's dive into this real estate scenario. We've got three parcels of land: western, central, and eastern, all sitting next to each other with the central one in the middle. A business owner owns the central parcel and has his house there. He also has a right-of-way across the eastern parcel, which he can use on foot, by bike, or in his car. The eastern parcel is owned by a landscaper, and the western parcel was owned by an investor who sold it to the business owner.\n\nSo, the business owner now owns both the central and western parcels. He decides to build a big 15-story office building that covers both parcels and houses 6,000 people during work hours. All these people use the right-of-way across the eastern parcel, and the business owner uses it to deliver up to 30 loads of supplies per day.\n\nNow, the landscaper, who owns the eastern parcel, sues to stop the business owner and the office workers from using the right-of-way. The question is, what will the court most likely decide?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The business owner's right-of-way would be extinguished due to excessive use by the office workers.\n\nB. The business owner's right-of-way would be forfeited due to the unauthorized use by the office workers.\n\nC. The business owner, by making use of the right-of-way beyond the scope of the original privilege, would permanently be enjoined from using the servient tenement.\n\nD. Although the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way, the office workers would be enjoined from making such use.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a right-of-way is. It's an easement that allows the owner of one piece of land to cross another's land for a specific purpose. In this case, the business owner has a right-of-way across the eastern parcel for personal use on foot, by bike, or in his car.\n\nBut now, with the office building, thousands of people are using this right-of-way daily, which seems like a significant increase in usage beyond what was originally intended.\n\nOption A suggests that the right-of-way would be extinguished due to excessive use by the office workers. Extinguishment means that the easement no longer exists because of some legal event. Excessive use might be one such event if it exceeds the scope of the easement.\n\nOption B says the right-of-way would be forfeited due to unauthorized use by the office workers. Forfeiture typically occurs when there's a breach of condition or a violation of the terms of the easement.\n\nOption C proposes that the business owner would be permanently injunctioned from using the servient tenement because he used the right-of-way beyond its original scope. This means the court would order him to stop using it altogether.\n\nOption D suggests that the business owner can still use the right-of-way, but the office workers cannot.\n\nTo decide which is most likely, we need to consider how courts generally handle easements when there's a change in use.\n\nEasements are created for a specific purpose, and if the use changes significantly, it could be argued that the easement is being abused or that there's an excessive use.\n\nIn this scenario, the right-of-way was granted for the business owner's personal use, but now it's being used by thousands of people daily, which is a substantial increase.\n\nCourts generally look at whether the use is consistent with the original purpose of the easement. If the use has changed so dramatically that it imposes an undue burden on the servient tenement (the eastern parcel), the court might limit or even terminate the easement.\n\nHowever, in this case, the business owner owns both the central and western parcels now, and the office building is on both. So, one could argue that the use is still related to the central parcel, just on a larger scale.\n\nBut the key here is the number of users. The original easement was for personal use, not for thousands of people daily.\n\nOption A talks about extinguishment due to excessive use. This could be a possible outcome if the court finds that the use has gone beyond what was reasonably anticipated when the easement was granted.\n\nOption B mentions forfeiture due to unauthorized use. This could also be a possibility if the court determines that the office workers' use was not authorized under the original easement terms.\n\nOption C suggests that the business owner would be permanently injunctioned from using the servient tenement. This seems quite severe, as it would eliminate the easement entirely.\n\nOption D allows the business owner to continue using the right-of-way but stops the office workers from using it. This could be seen as a partial injunction, preserving the original purpose of the easement for the business owner while preventing the increased use by others.\n\nConsidering these options, I think the most likely outcome is that the court would find the use by the office workers to be beyond the scope of the original easement, and therefore, they would be enjoined from using the right-of-way, while the business owner could still use it for his personal purposes as originally intended.\n\nSo, option D seems the most plausible.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that in some jurisdictions, the court might consider the business owner's expanded use and decide to either modify the easement to accommodate the new use or terminate it altogether due to the excessive burden on the servient tenement.\n\nBut based on the options provided, D appears to be the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) Although the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way, the office workers would be enjoined from making such use."
