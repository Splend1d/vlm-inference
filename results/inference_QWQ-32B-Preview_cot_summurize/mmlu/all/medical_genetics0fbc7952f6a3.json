This can happen, for example, through the fusion of two fertilized eggs (zygotes) early in development, resulting in a single organism with multiple cell populations, each with their own distinct genetic makeup.\n\nMosaicism, on the other hand, refers to the presence of two or more genetically distinct cell lines within an individual, but these cell lines all originate from a single zygote. This can occur due to mutations or other genetic changes that happen after fertilization, leading to a mixture of cells with different genotypes within the same individual.\n\nDiploidy refers to the state of having two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent, which is typical for most human cells.\n\nAneuploidy is a condition where an individual has an abnormal number of chromosomes, meaning there are more or fewer than the usual two sets of chromosomes in their cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. chimaerism."
