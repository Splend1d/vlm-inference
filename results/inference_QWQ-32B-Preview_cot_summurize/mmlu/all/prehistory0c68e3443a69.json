                    "text": "I've heard about some really old cave paintings found in Indonesia, but I'm not exactly sure what they depict or how old they are. Let me see... The question is about painted art discovered in caves on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. The options talk about different subjects like animals, human bodies, hand stencils, and abstract shapes, and they give different time periods ranging from 15,000 to over 100,000 years ago. That's a huge time span! I need to recall or look up the specific details about these cave paintings.\n\nFirst, I remember that Sulawesi is famous for its prehistoric cave art. In fact, some of the earliest known cave paintings are found there. The images typically include depictions of animals and human figures, as well as hand stencils. So, options A and B mention animals and hand stencils, which seems promising.\n\nNow, regarding the dates. I think the cave paintings in Sulawesi have been dated using a method called uranium-series dating, which is used to date calcium carbonate deposits, like stalactites and flowstones, that form over the paintings. By dating these deposits, scientists can determine the minimum age of the paintings beneath them.\n\nI recall that some of the hand stencils in Sulawesi have been dated to around 40,000 years ago, making them some of the oldest known examples of figurative art. There are also images of animals, such as warty pigs and babirusas, which are unique to Sulawesi.\n\nLet me think about option C, which suggests animals and hand stencils from more than 45,000 to about 100,000 years ago. That seems too broad and perhaps too old. The current scientific consensus, based on dating methods, places the oldest Sulawesi cave art at around 40,000 years ago, not 100,000 years ago. So, option C might be exaggerating the age.\n\nOption D mentions animals and abstract geometric shapes from 15,000 to more than 100,000 years ago. Again, the time frame is very broad, and I don't recall abstract geometric shapes being a primary feature of Sulawesi cave art. The main subjects are animals and hand stencils.\n\nOption A says animals and human bodies from more than 15,000 to about 20,000 years ago. That seems too recent compared to what I remember about the Sulawesi cave paintings.\n\nOption B states animals and hand stencils from more than 35,000 to about 40,000 years ago. This aligns better with the scientific dates I've come across.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if there are any updates on the dating of these paintings. Maybe there have been more recent findings that push the dates even further back.\n\nUpon checking, I find that in 2014, a study published in Nature reported that the oldest hand stencil in Sulawesi was at least 39,900 years old, and the oldest figurative painting, a depiction of a pig, was dated to at least 35,400 years old. These dates make Sulawesi cave art some of the oldest in the world, comparable in age to the earliest European cave art.\n\nSo, based on this information, option B seems to be the most accurate: animals and hand stencils from more than 35,000 to about 40,000 years ago.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there are any other findings that might make option C plausible. Looking further, I see that some researchers have suggested that the oldest art in Sulawesi could be even older, possibly approaching 50,000 years ago, but these are not yet confirmed with robust dating methods.\n\nTherefore, sticking with the established scientific dates, option B is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
