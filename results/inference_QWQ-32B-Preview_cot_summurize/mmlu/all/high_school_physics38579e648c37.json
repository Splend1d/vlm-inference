                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a car that starts from rest and accelerates uniformly to a final speed of 20.0 meters per second in 15.0 seconds. I need to find out how far the car travels during this time. The options are 150 m, 300 m, 450 m, and 600 m.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the equations of motion for uniformly accelerated motion. Since the car starts from rest, its initial velocity is zero. It accelerates uniformly to a final velocity of 20.0 m/s in 15.0 seconds. I need to find the distance traveled, which is often denoted by 's' or 'd'.\n\nOne of the equations I remember is:\n\ns = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2\n\nwhere:\n\n- s is the distance traveled,\n\n- u is the initial velocity,\n\n- a is the acceleration,\n\n- t is the time.\n\nGiven that the initial velocity u is 0 m/s, the equation simplifies to:\n\ns = (1/2)at\u00b2\n\nBut I don't know the acceleration yet. I can find the acceleration using the formula:\n\na = (v - u)/t\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, and t is the time.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na = (20.0 m/s - 0 m/s)/15.0 s = 20.0 m/s / 15.0 s = 4/3 m/s\u00b2 \u2248 1.333 m/s\u00b2\n\nNow, plugging this back into the distance equation:\n\ns = (1/2)*(4/3 m/s\u00b2)*(15.0 s)\u00b2\n\nFirst, calculate (15.0 s)\u00b2 = 225 s\u00b2\n\nThen, s = (1/2)*(4/3 m/s\u00b2)*225 s\u00b2 = (2/3 m/s\u00b2)*225 s\u00b2 = (2/3)*225 m = 150 m\n\nSo, according to this, the distance traveled is 150 meters.\n\nWait a minute, but let's check if there's another equation that might be easier to use. I recall another equation that relates distance, initial velocity, final velocity, and time:\n\ns = (u + v)t / 2\n\nThis seems relevant because I know u, v, and t.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ns = (0 m/s + 20.0 m/s)*15.0 s / 2 = (20.0 m/s)*15.0 s / 2 = 300 m/s / 2 = 150 m\n\nAgain, I get 150 meters.\n\nHmm, but 150 meters is one of the options, but I'm wondering if there's a mistake here. Let me think about it differently. If the car is uniformly accelerating from rest to 20 m/s in 15 seconds, its average velocity would be the average of the initial and final velocities, which is (0 + 20)/2 = 10 m/s.\n\nThen, distance equals average velocity multiplied by time, so s = 10 m/s * 15 s = 150 m.\n\nAgain, the same answer. But now I'm thinking, maybe I should use the formula for final velocity in terms of acceleration and time to double-check.\n\nWe have v = u + at, and since u = 0, v = at.\n\nSo, a = v/t = 20 m/s / 15 s = 4/3 m/s\u00b2, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, using s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2, with u=0, t=15 s, a=4/3 m/s\u00b2, s=(1/2)*(4/3)*225 = (2/3)*225 = 150 m.\n\nEverything points to 150 meters.\n\nBut let's consider if perhaps there's a mistake in assuming it starts from rest. The problem says \"starts from rest,\" so u=0 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula s = vt - (1/2)at\u00b2, but that's not correct for this situation.\n\nWait, no, the correct formula is s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2, which I already used.\n\nAlternatively, s = vt - (1/2)at\u00b2 would be if the object was initially moving with velocity v and decelerating, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, I think 150 meters is the correct answer.\n\nBut why are there options up to 600 meters? Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nLet me try calculating s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2 again.\n\nu = 0 m/s\n\nt = 15 s\n\na = 4/3 m/s\u00b2\n\ns = 0*(15) + (1/2)*(4/3)*(15)^2 = 0 + (2/3)*225 = 150 m\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula s = vt - (1/2)at\u00b2, but again, that's not applicable here.\n\nWait, no, that formula is for when the object is moving with initial velocity v and decelerating, which is not the case.\n\nIn this problem, the car is accelerating from rest, so the correct formula is s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2, which gives s = 150 m.\n\nAlternatively, using s = (u + v)t / 2, which is s = (0 + 20)m/s * 15 s / 2 = 150 m.\n\nYet, I'm seeing that 150 m is an option, but I'm wondering if perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the car is moving with constant acceleration and find the distance using integration, but that's unnecessary for this level.\n\nIn calculus terms, velocity is the integral of acceleration with respect to time, and displacement is the integral of velocity.\n\nGiven constant acceleration a, velocity v = at (since u=0), and displacement s = (1/2)at\u00b2, which again gives s = 150 m.\n\nI think I'm firmly convinced that 150 meters is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if perhaps the car is not moving in a straight line or if there are other factors, but the problem seems straightforward: a car starting from rest, accelerating uniformly in a straight line to a final speed over a given time.\n\nTherefore, the distance traveled is 150 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150 \\text{ m}} \\]"
