One hour forward.\n\nDaylight-saving time (DST) is a practice where clocks are set forward by one hour during the summer months to make better use of natural daylight. This means that in the spring, when DST starts, people set their clocks ahead by one hour, effectively losing an hour of sleep that day. The idea is to have more daylight in the evenings, which can be beneficial for activities that take advantage of natural light.\n\nIt's important to note that not all regions observe DST. For example, Arizona and Hawaii in the United States do not participate in daylight-saving time. Additionally, the dates when DST starts and ends can vary by country, but in the U.S., it typically begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November.\n\nSo, to summarize, when daylight-saving time arrives in the spring, most Americans turn their clocks one hour forward."
