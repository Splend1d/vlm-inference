Marginal utility decreases with each additional unit of a good that is consumed.\n\nD. Marginal utility and total utility both decrease.\n\nI think the principle has something to do with how much extra satisfaction you get from consuming one more unit of something. Like, the first slice of pizza might be really satisfying, but each additional slice is less satisfying than the one before.\n\nSo, marginal utility is the additional satisfaction from one more unit. Diminishing marginal utility means that this additional satisfaction goes down as you consume more units.\n\nOption A says marginal utility stays the same, but that doesn't sound right because if marginal utility is diminishing, it should be decreasing, not staying the same.\n\nOption B says total utility stays the same. But total utility is the overall satisfaction from all units consumed. If marginal utility is decreasing, but still positive, total utility is still increasing, just at a slower rate. So, total utility doesn't stay the same.\n\nOption C says marginal utility decreases with each additional unit. That sounds like exactly what diminishing marginal utility means.\n\nOption D says both marginal utility and total utility decrease. But while marginal utility decreases, total utility actually increases as long as marginal utility is positive, just at a decreasing rate.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. Marginal utility decreases with each additional unit of a good that is consumed.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about it again. If I eat more and more slices of pizza, eventually, I might get to a point where another slice doesn't add any satisfaction, or maybe even decreases my total satisfaction if I'm too full. So, at some point, marginal utility could become zero or even negative.\n\nBut the principle of diminishing marginal utility primarily says that each additional unit provides less additional satisfaction than the previous one, assuming that you are still consuming units that give you positive utility.\n\nSo, yes, C seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
