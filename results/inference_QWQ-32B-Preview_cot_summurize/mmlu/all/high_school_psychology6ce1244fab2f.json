                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which concept best explains a doctor who knows smoking is unhealthy but thinks he can keep smoking because he eats healthily. The options are reaction formation, affective retraining, cognitive dissonance, and obsessive compulsion. Let's see what each of these means and which one fits best.\n\nFirst, cognitive dissonance. I think I've heard about this before. It's when a person holds two conflicting beliefs or behaviors, and it causes mental discomfort. So, in this case, the doctor knows smoking is bad, but he's still smoking, thinking that his healthy eating offsets it. That seems like a conflict between knowing smoking is unhealthy and justifying it with healthy eating. So, cognitive dissonance might be a good fit here.\n\nNext, reaction formation. I think this is a psychoanalytic concept where someone expresses feelings that are the opposite of their true feelings to hide their inner thoughts or desires. For example, someone who hates someone might show excessive love or affection. In this scenario, the doctor isn't really expressing something opposite; he's justifying his smoking with healthy eating. So, reaction formation doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nAffective retraining sounds like a method to change emotional responses, maybe through therapy or some kind of training. It doesn't seem directly related to the doctor's thought process in this scenario. He's not trying to change his emotions; he's justifying his behavior.\n\nObsessive compulsion is related to OCD, where someone has recurring thoughts or behaviors that they feel compelled to perform. Smoking could be a compulsive behavior, but the justification with healthy eating doesn't directly relate to obsessive-compulsive traits. It's more about justifying the behavior rather than being compelled to do it.\n\nSo, comparing all these, cognitive dissonance seems to be the best fit because it deals directly with holding conflicting beliefs and the mental discomfort that arises from it, which the doctor is trying to resolve by justifying his smoking with healthy eating.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. cognitive dissonance}} \\]"
