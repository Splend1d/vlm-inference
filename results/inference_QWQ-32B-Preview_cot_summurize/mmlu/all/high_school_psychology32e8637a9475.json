It deals with the order and connection of words and phrases to form sentences. For example, in English, the basic word order is subject-verb-object (SVO), as in \"The cat chased the mouse.\" Syntax helps us understand why this sounds correct, while \"Chased the cat mouse the\" does not.\n\nSemantics, on the other hand, deals with the meaning of words and sentences. Grammar is a broader term that includes both syntax and morphology (the study of word formation). Phonemes are the smallest units of sound in a language that can distinguish one word from another.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. syntax."
