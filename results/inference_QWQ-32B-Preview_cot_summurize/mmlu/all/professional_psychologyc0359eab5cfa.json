Let's see the options:\n\nA. Criterion-referenced testing\n\nB. Functional behavioral assessments\n\nC. Intellectual assessments\n\nD. Norm-referenced tests\n\nHmm, I think I remember something about norm-referenced tests, but let me make sure I understand each option.\n\nFirst, criterion-referenced testing. This is when the test measures whether a student has achieved a certain level of mastery over a particular body of knowledge or skills. So, it's about measuring against a set standard or criterion, not against other test-takers. For example, driving tests are criterion-referenced because you either meet the standards to get your license or you don't, regardless of how others do.\n\nNext, functional behavioral assessments. This seems more related to education or psychology, focusing on understanding why someone behaves a certain way, especially in educational settings. It's not directly about comparing test scores, so probably not the answer here.\n\nIntellectual assessments, like IQ tests, are designed to measure a person's cognitive abilities compared to a norm group, but the focus is on intelligence rather than academic achievement. While they do compare individuals to a norm group, the term might be too specific here.\n\nNorm-referenced tests, on the other hand, directly compare an individual's performance to a predefined group, known as the norm group. This is the standard approach in many standardized tests, like the SAT or ACT, where your score is interpreted based on how well you did compared to other test-takers.\n\nSo, considering the definitions:\n\n- Criterion-referenced: compares to a standard or criterion\n\n- Functional behavioral assessments: about behavior analysis\n\n- Intellectual assessments: measure intelligence against a norm group\n\n- Norm-referenced tests: compare individual performance to a norm group\n\nThe question is asking for tests that compare an examinee\u2019s performance to the performance of a specified group of participants. That sounds exactly like norm-referenced testing.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Norm-referenced tests.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about it again. In norm-referenced testing, the individual's score is interpreted based on where it falls in the distribution of scores from the norm group. So, if you score in the 85th percentile, it means you did better than 85% of the norm group. This is clearly comparing your performance to others.\n\nCriterion-referenced testing, as I mentioned, is about meeting a specific standard without regard to what others score. So, that doesn't fit the description in the question.\n\nFunctional behavioral assessments are more about understanding behavior in context, not about comparing test scores.\n\nIntellectual assessments, while they do compare to a norm group, are specifically focused on measuring intelligence, which might not cover all types of standardized tests.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and general answer is D. Norm-referenced tests.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
