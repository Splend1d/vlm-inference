Three: harm to students; lack of informed consent; invasion of privacy on social media.\n\nB. Four: harm to participants; lack of informed consent; invasion of privacy; involvement of deception.\n\nC. Two: ethical and unethical.\n\nD. Two: right and wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Diener and Crandell said about ethical principles in research. I think they discussed several key ethical considerations that researchers must keep in mind when conducting studies involving human participants.\n\nOption A mentions three categories: harm to students, lack of informed consent, and invasion of privacy on social media. While these are important ethical issues, I'm not sure if Diener and Crandell specifically categorized ethical principles into these three areas.\n\nOption B lists four categories: harm to participants, lack of informed consent, invasion of privacy, and involvement of deception. This seems more comprehensive, and I believe Diener and Crandell did discuss these four main ethical principles.\n\nOption C simplifies it to two categories: ethical and unethical. While this is a basic classification, it doesn't provide much detail about specific ethical concerns.\n\nOption D is similar to Option C, categorizing ethical principles into right and wrong. Again, this is too broad and doesn't specify particular ethical issues.\n\nConsidering what I remember from their work, Diener and Crandell emphasized several key ethical principles in research, including ensuring no harm comes to participants, obtaining informed consent, respecting privacy, and being transparent about any deceptive practices used in the study.\n\nSo, it seems that Option B is the most accurate reflection of their categorization. They refer to four main categories of ethical principles: harm to participants, lack of informed consent, invasion of privacy, and involvement of deception.\n\nI think the answer is B. Four: harm to participants; lack of informed consent; invasion of privacy; involvement of deception.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
