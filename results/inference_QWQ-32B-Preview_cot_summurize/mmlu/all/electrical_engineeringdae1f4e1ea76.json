                    "text": "The Ward-Leonard system is a method used for speed control of DC motors, particularly in applications requiring smooth and precise speed regulation, such as elevators and ship propulsion systems. It achieves this by controlling the voltage supplied to the motor armature while maintaining a constant field current.\n\nIn this system, a DC generator supplies power to the armature of a DC motor, and the field winding of the generator is separately excited. By varying the field current of the generator, the output voltage to the motor armature can be controlled, thereby controlling the motor speed.\n\nNow, regarding the lower limit of speed in the Ward-Leonard system, let's consider the options provided:\n\nA. Field resistance.\n\nB. Armature resistance.\n\nC. Residual magnetism of the generator.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nFirst, let's understand what imposes a lower limit on the speed in this system.\n\nThe speed of a DC motor in a Ward-Leonard system is proportional to the armature voltage and inversely proportional to the field flux. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\n\\[ N \\propto \\frac{V_a}{\\phi} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the motor speed.\n\n- \\( V_a \\) is the armature voltage.\n\n- \\( \\phi \\) is the field flux.\n\nTo reduce the speed, the armature voltage is decreased by reducing the generator field current, which in turn reduces the output voltage of the generator.\n\nHowever, there is a limit to how much the field current can be reduced before the generator loses its ability to generate voltage effectively. This limit is related to the residual magnetism of the generator.\n\nResidual magnetism refers to the\u5269\u78c1 (\u5269\u78c1 means residual magnetism in Chinese, but in English, it's more commonly referred to as residual magnetism or remanence) present in the magnetic circuit of the generator even when the field current is zero. This residual magnetism allows the generator to build up voltage when the field current is applied, even if it starts from zero field current.\n\nWhen the field current is reduced to a very low level, the generator's output voltage may become unstable or drop to zero if the residual magnetism is not sufficient to maintain the voltage build-up.\n\nTherefore, the lower limit of speed in the Ward-Leonard system is imposed by the residual magnetism of the generator. If the field current is reduced too much, the generator may not be able to maintain a stable voltage output, leading to a loss of speed control.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Residual magnetism of the generator.\n\nTo further elaborate:\n\n- Option A, field resistance, affects the field current, but it's not the limiting factor for the lower speed limit. Field resistance can be adjusted to control the field current, but there's still a limit imposed by the residual magnetism.\n\n- Option B, armature resistance, affects the motor's performance and speed regulation but does not directly impose a lower limit on the speed in the Ward-Leonard system.\n\n- Option D, none of the above, is incorrect because residual magnetism does play a crucial role in determining the lower speed limit.\n\nUnderstanding this concept is important for designing and operating Ward-Leonard systems to ensure stable speed control across the desired operating range.\n\n"
