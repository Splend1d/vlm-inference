                    "text": "So I have this problem here: Mrs. Kinney bought batteries in packs of 4 for the students' science experiments. And I need to figure out which of these numbers could be the total number of batteries that she bought. The options are 22, 26, 28, and 30.\n\nAlright, first things first. She's buying batteries in packs of 4. That means whatever total number of batteries she has, it should be a multiple of 4, right? Because each pack contains 4 batteries, so she's buying 4 at a time.\n\nSo, to find out which of these numbers is a multiple of 4, I can divide each one by 4 and see if there's no remainder. If there's no remainder, that means it's perfectly divisible by 4, and hence, could be the total number of batteries she bought.\n\nLet's start with option A, which is 22.\n\n22 divided by 4 is 5.5. Wait, that's not a whole number. That means there's a remainder, so 22 is not a multiple of 4.\n\nOkay, next is B, 26.\n\n26 divided by 4 is 6.5. Again, not a whole number. So, 26 is not a multiple of 4.\n\nNow, C is 28.\n\n28 divided by 4 is 7. That's a whole number, no remainder. So, 28 is a multiple of 4.\n\nLastly, D is 30.\n\n30 divided by 4 is 7.5. Not a whole number, so 30 is not a multiple of 4.\n\nSo, based on this, the only option that is a multiple of 4 is 28.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check just to be sure.\n\nOption A: 22. 4 times 5 is 20, and 22 minus 20 is 2. So, remainder 2.\n\nOption B: 26. 4 times 6 is 24, and 26 minus 24 is 2. Again, remainder 2.\n\nOption C: 28. 4 times 7 is 28. No remainder.\n\nOption D: 30. 4 times 7 is 28, and 30 minus 28 is 2. Remainder 2.\n\nYes, confirms that 28 is the only one that's perfectly divisible by 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 28.\n\nBut, just to think about it another way, maybe there's something else I'm missing. The problem says \"could be the total number of batteries that she bought.\" And since she's buying them in packs of 4, the total should indeed be a multiple of 4.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this? Maybe if she bought a certain number of packs, but I don't think so. The question seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trick here, and I need to consider something else, like if the packs are not all of the same size, but the problem clearly states \"packs of 4,\" so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are batteries already present, but again, the problem doesn't mention that. It seems like it's solely about the batteries she bought in packs of 4.\n\nSo, sticking to the initial approach, 28 is the only multiple of 4 in the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 28.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
