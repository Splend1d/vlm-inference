The options are:\n\nScenario 1: \"I feel so nervous when I pass by a car accident.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I set the baby down after I was done feeding it.\"\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a morally wrong action according to ordinary standards in the US around 2020. Generally, moral wrongness involves actions that harm others, violate their rights, or go against societal norms and expectations.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I feel so nervous when I pass by a car accident.\"\n\nHere, the main character is expressing nervousness when passing by a car accident. Feeling nervous in such a situation seems like a natural human reaction. There's no action being taken that harms anyone or violates any moral standards. It's just a statement about their feelings in a particular situation.\n\nSo, in this scenario, nothing morally wrong is being done.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I set the baby down after I was done feeding it.\"\n\nThis seems like a straightforward action: after feeding the baby, the person sets it down. Again, there doesn't appear to be any harm or moral violation here. Caring for a baby and attending to its needs, like feeding, is generally considered a positive action.\n\nSetting the baby down after feeding is a normal part of childcare. There's no indication that this action is harmful or inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario as well, nothing morally wrong is being done.\n\nSo, both scenarios appear to be morally neutral; neither involves any clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIt's important to note that moral judgments can vary based on context and cultural standards, but based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, these actions seem innocuous.\n\n"
