                    "text": "So I've got this quote from Kwame Nkrumah, the Ghanian leader from 1961. He's talking about Africa needing to create a political union to contribute to world peace and to get more respect from the bigger powers. He mentions two things to support his point: the lack of attention to African opposition to French atomic tests in the Sahara and the situation in the Congo where the UN was focused on constitutional details while the country was falling into anarchy. The question is about why he includes the Congo in his argument. The options are:\n\nA. To show that African unity is possible\n\nB. To give an example of how African nations are ignored by world powers\n\nC. To illustrate how making a constitution brings order to nations\n\nD. To blame European powers for Africa's problems\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Nkrumah is trying to say overall. He believes that Africa should form a political union to avoid the dangers of disunity and to project a stronger African identity to the world. He thinks that such a union would be respected because it would be large and influential, which seems to be what the world values.\n\nHe gives two examples to back up his argument. The first is the African opposition to French atomic tests in the Sahara, which wasn't paid much attention to. This suggests that African voices aren't being heard or taken seriously by the bigger powers, like France in this case.\n\nThe second example is about the Congo and the UN's involvement there. He describes it as \"the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy.\" So, here, it seems like the UN is getting bogged down in technical details of the constitution while the country is falling apart. This probably illustrates how external bodies, like the UN, aren't effectively addressing the real issues on the ground in Africa.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Demonstrate the possibility of African unity - but the Congo example doesn't really show unity; instead, it seems to be about mismanagement and lack of attention to real problems.\n\nB. Give an example of how African nations are neglected by world powers - this seems plausible because the Congo situation shows that even with UN involvement, the problems aren't being adequately addressed.\n\nC. Present an illustration of how the development of a constitution brings order to nations - actually, Nkrumah seems to be criticizing the focus on constitutional details while the country is falling into anarchy, suggesting that constitutions alone don't bring order.\n\nD. Blame European powers for the difficulties experienced in Africa - while there might be some implication of European responsibility, especially given the colonial history, Nkrumah doesn't directly blame them in this quote. He's more focused on the current lack of attention and effective action by world powers, including the UN.\n\nSo, between options B and C, I think B is a better fit. Nkrumah is using the Congo example to show how African nations are neglected or not taken seriously by the world powers, even when there is UN involvement. The UN is more concerned with constitutional niceties while the country is collapsing, which suggests a lack of real concern or effective action.\n\nAlso, option A doesn't fit because the Congo example doesn't demonstrate unity; quite the opposite, perhaps. And option C seems contrary to Nkrumah's point, as he appears to be criticizing the emphasis on constitution-making when there are more pressing issues.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is B: to give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
