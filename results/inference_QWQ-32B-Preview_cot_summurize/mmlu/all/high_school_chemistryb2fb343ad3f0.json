                    "text": "Distillation is a separation technique that relies on differences in boiling points of the components in a mixture. In this case, we have a mixture of four different compounds in aqueous solution: KCl(aq), Fe(NO3)3(aq), MgSO4(aq), and N2H4(aq). To determine which of these would be easiest to separate via distillation, we need to consider the boiling points of these compounds and how they compare to that of water.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in an aqueous solution, the solute (the compound dissolved in water) can affect the boiling point of the solution through a phenomenon called boiling point elevation. However, for distillation purposes, what's more important is the volatility of the solute\u2014that is, its tendency to evaporate at a given temperature.\n\nCompounds with higher volatility will evaporate more easily and thus can be separated more readily via distillation. Conversely, compounds with lower volatility will remain in the liquid phase at lower temperatures and are harder to distill.\n\nLet's look at each compound:\n\nA. KCl(aq): Potassium chloride is an ionic compound that dissociates completely in water to form K+ and Cl- ions. Ionic compounds generally have high boiling points and are not volatile. Therefore, KCl is not easily distilled.\n\nB. Fe(NO3)3(aq): Iron(III) nitrate is also an ionic compound that dissociates in water to form Fe3+ and NO3- ions. Like KCl, it has a high boiling point and is not volatile, making it difficult to distill.\n\nC. MgSO4(aq): Magnesium sulfate is another ionic compound that dissociates in water to form Mg2+ and SO42- ions. Again, it has a high boiling point and is not volatile, so it's not easily distilled.\n\nD. N2H4(aq): Hydrazine is a molecular compound with a lower molecular weight compared to the ionic compounds listed. Molecular compounds can have a range of volatilities depending on their molecular weight and intermolecular forces. Hydrazine has a boiling point of about 113.5 \u00b0C at standard pressure, which is higher than that of water (100 \u00b0C), but it is more volatile compared to the ionic compounds in the list.\n\nGiven that all the other compounds are ionic and have much higher boiling points (typically in the range of several hundred degrees Celsius), hydrazine, with its lower boiling point, would be the easiest to separate via distillation.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that distilling hydrazine can be dangerous due to its toxicity and flammability. Additionally, in a real-world scenario, the presence of water in the solution would also affect the distillation process, as water would evaporate before hydrazine.\n\nBut for the purpose of this question, considering only the relative ease of distillation based on volatility, N2H4(aq) would be the easiest to separate via distillation compared to the other compounds listed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
