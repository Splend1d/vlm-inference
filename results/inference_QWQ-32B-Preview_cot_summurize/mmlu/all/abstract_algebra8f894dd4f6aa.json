                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the sum of two polynomials, f(x) and g(x), in the polynomial ring Z_8[x]. The polynomials are f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2. The options are:\n\nA. 2x^2 + 5\n\nB. 6x^2 + 4x + 6\n\nC. 0\n\nD. x^2 + 1\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to add polynomials in Z_8[x]. I know that Z_8 refers to the integers modulo 8, so all the coefficients of the polynomials will be reduced modulo 8.\n\nSo, to add f(x) and g(x), I just need to add their corresponding coefficients.\n\nLet me write down the polynomials again:\n\nf(x) = 4x - 5\n\ng(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2\n\nTo add them, I'll align them by the powers of x:\n\ng(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2\n\nf(x) =       4x - 5\n\nNow, add them term by term:\n\nThe x^2 term: only g(x) has it, so it's 2x^2.\n\nThe x term: -4x + 4x = 0x.\n\nThe constant term: 2 + (-5) = -3.\n\nSo, the sum should be 2x^2 + 0x - 3, which simplifies to 2x^2 - 3.\n\nBut since we're working in Z_8[x], I need to reduce the coefficients modulo 8.\n\nLet's see:\n\n2 modulo 8 is 2.\n\n0 modulo 8 is 0.\n\n-3 modulo 8:\n\nTo find -3 mod 8, I can add 8 to -3 to get a positive equivalent:\n\n-3 + 8 = 5.\n\nSo, -3 mod 8 is 5.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 2x^2 + 0x + 5, which is 2x^2 + 5.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 2x^2 + 5.\n\nWait, but option B is 6x^2 + 4x + 6, option C is 0, and option D is x^2 + 1.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, adding the polynomials:\n\ng(x) + f(x) = (2x^2 - 4x + 2) + (4x - 5)\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n2x^2 + (-4x + 4x) + (2 - 5) = 2x^2 + 0x - 3\n\nNow, reducing coefficients modulo 8:\n\n2 mod 8 = 2\n\n0 mod 8 = 0\n\n-3 mod 8 = 5\n\nSo, 2x^2 + 0x + 5 = 2x^2 + 5\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any mistake in understanding the polynomial ring Z_8[x].\n\nIn Z_8[x], the coefficients are elements of Z_8, meaning they are integers modulo 8.\n\nSo, my approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about adding the polynomials and then reducing each coefficient modulo 8, which is what I did.\n\nI don't see any error in my calculation.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 2x^2 + 5, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
