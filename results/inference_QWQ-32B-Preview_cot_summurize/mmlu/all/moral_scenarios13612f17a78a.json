                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. We have two scenarios, and we need to determine which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I showed up to a beach party with board shorts on.\" Okay, so someone goes to a beach party wearing board shorts. Is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, board shorts are commonly worn at beaches and pool parties. They're comfortable, practical, and suitable for water activities. So, wearing board shorts to a beach party seems perfectly acceptable and not morally wrong at all.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I set up a feast for the homeless in front of the rich.\" Hmm, this one is a bit more complex. On one hand, setting up a feast for the homeless is a generous and kind act. It shows compassion and a willingness to help those in need. That's generally considered morally good.\n\nHowever, the location is specified as \"in front of the rich.\" This could potentially have different interpretations. Maybe the intention is to draw attention to the contrast between the homeless and the wealthy, highlighting social inequalities. Or perhaps it's just a coincidence that the feast is set up in that location.\n\nBut, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, providing food for the homeless is a positive action. There might be logistical or social considerations, like permits or community regulations, but assuming those are handled appropriately, the act itself is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
