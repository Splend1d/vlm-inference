                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Plato's theory of knowledge. So, Plato believed that true knowledge comes from understanding eternal Forms or essences, which are beyond the physical world we perceive through our senses. He thought that the physical world is just a shadow or imitation of these perfect Forms.\n\nFor example, when we think about triangles, we don't get our understanding from looking at physical triangles, which can be of different sizes and imperfections. Instead, we have an innate idea of what a perfect triangle is, which is the Form of triangularity. This perfect triangle exists in a realm of Forms, and it's this ideal that makes all particular triangles recognizable as triangles.\n\nNow, Plato concluded that all knowledge is innate because he believed that our knowledge can't come from sensory experience alone. Sensory experience is flawed and changing, but our knowledge is certain and unchanging. So, how do we have this certain knowledge if not from the senses?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. From the moment we are born, we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory. Plato argued that knowledge isn't derived from senses because senses are unreliable. So, saying that knowledge comes from sensory ideas contradicts Plato's view.\n\nB. Since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\n\nAgain, this goes against Plato's assertion that senses are unreliable and that true knowledge comes from beyond the sensory world.\n\nC. Our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\n\nThis seems closer to Plato's idea. He did emphasize the importance of mathematics and ideal forms in understanding the world. But is this exactly what he meant by knowledge being innate?\n\nD. Since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\n\nThis option suggests that sensory experience triggers recall of innate knowledge. That aligns with Plato's theory of recollection, where learning is a process of remembering knowledge from before birth.\n\nPlato believed in the theory of recollection, which posits that the soul existed before birth and had knowledge of the Forms. Birth is a kind of forgetting, and learning is recollecting that knowledge.\n\nSo, according to Plato, we have innate knowledge of the Forms, and sensory experience serves only to trigger the recollection of that knowledge.\n\nOption D seems to capture this idea: knowledge isn't derived from senses but is innate, and senses merely trigger its recollection.\n\nOption C is also relevant because Plato did emphasize understanding the world in terms of ideal Forms, which are grasped through reason, not senses. But it doesn't directly address the innateness of knowledge.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Plato didn't believe knowledge comes from sensory ideas; quite the opposite.\n\nOption B is also incorrect for the same reason.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\n\nThis aligns with Plato's theory of Forms and his belief in the innateness of knowledge, accessed through recollection triggered by sensory experience.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
