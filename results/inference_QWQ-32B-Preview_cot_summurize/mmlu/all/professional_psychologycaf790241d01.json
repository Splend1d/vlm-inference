The options are:\n\nA. integrate the present with his/her past and future.\n\nB. integrate the various aspects of the self.\n\nC. develop a \u201csuccess identity.\u201d\n\nD. develop a \u201chealthy style of life.\u201d\n\nI need to remember what Gestalt therapy is all about. I recall that it's a type of therapy that focuses on the here and now, and it's about being aware of one's current thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It's about accepting and taking responsibility for one's own life.\n\nSo, option A says \"integrate the present with his/her past and future.\" While Gestalt therapy does consider past experiences and how they influence the present, its main focus is on the present moment. It's not so much about integrating past and future as it is about being fully present.\n\nOption B says \"integrate the various aspects of the self.\" Hmm, that sounds familiar. Gestalt therapy is about wholeness and integrating different parts of oneself. It's about recognizing and accepting all aspects of oneself, including emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, and bringing them together to form a cohesive sense of self.\n\nOption C mentions \"develop a \u2018success identity.\u2019\" I'm not sure what that means exactly. It sounds like it might be related to achieving success in life, but I don't recall that being a primary goal in Gestalt therapy. Gestalt therapy is more about self-awareness and acceptance than about achieving external success.\n\nOption D says \"develop a \u2018healthy style of life.\u2019\" Again, while living a healthy life might be a positive outcome of therapy, I don't think it's the primary goal of Gestalt therapy specifically. Gestalt therapy is more about process than about achieving a particular lifestyle.\n\nComparing options A and B, I think B is more aligned with Gestalt therapy principles. Integrating various aspects of the self seems to be a key goal in Gestalt therapy, as it emphasizes wholeness and self-awareness.\n\nLet me double-check. Gestalt therapy was developed by Fritz Perls, and it's based on the idea that people are best understood in the context of their environment and that they have an innate capacity for growth and self-direction.\n\nIn sessions, therapists often use techniques like role-playing, exaggeration, and the empty chair technique to help clients become more aware of their thoughts and feelings in the present moment.\n\nSo, the main goal is to help clients gain awareness and acceptance of their current experiences, and to integrate different parts of themselves.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is B. integrate the various aspects of the self.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
