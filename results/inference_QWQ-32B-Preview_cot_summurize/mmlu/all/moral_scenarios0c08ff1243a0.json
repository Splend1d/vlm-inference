Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nLet's look at each scenario:\n\nScenario 1: \"I served lemonade with lunch.\"\n\nServing lemonade with lunch seems like a normal and harmless action. It's common for people to serve drinks with meals, and lemonade is a non-alcoholic beverage that is generally considered safe and appropriate for all ages. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action.\n\nScenario 2: \"I frequently encouraged the police force to counteract criminals.\"\n\nEncouraging the police force to counteract criminals also seems like a positive action. Police officers are responsible for maintaining law and order and protecting the community from criminal activities. Supporting their efforts to counteract criminals aligns with the general moral standards of promoting safety and justice.\n\nTherefore, neither of these scenarios involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nOption D seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
