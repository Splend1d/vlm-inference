                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to determine whether each statement is true or false.\n\n**Statement 1:** Every group of order 159 is cyclic.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some group theory. A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. For a group of order n to be cyclic, it must be isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo n, denoted as Z_n.\n\nA key theorem here is that if the order of a group is a prime number, then the group is cyclic. However, 159 is not a prime number. Let's factorize 159 to see its prime factors.\n\n159 divided by 3 is 53, and 53 is a prime number. So, 159 = 3 \u00d7 53.\n\nNow, I recall that if the order of a group is a product of two distinct primes, p and q, where p < q and p does not divide q - 1, then the group is cyclic.\n\nIn this case, p = 3 and q = 53. Let's check if 3 divides 53 - 1, which is 52.\n\n52 divided by 3 is approximately 17.333, which is not an integer, so 3 does not divide 52. Therefore, every group of order 159 is cyclic.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nAgain, let's factorize 102 to understand its prime factors.\n\n102 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 17.\n\nSo, it's a product of three distinct primes: 2, 3, and 17.\n\nI need to determine if every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nFirst, what is a nontrivial proper normal subgroup? It's a normal subgroup that is neither the trivial subgroup {e} nor the whole group.\n\nA key theorem here is Sylow's Theorem, which helps us determine the number of Sylow p-subgroups in a group.\n\nLet's consider the Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nStarting with p = 17.\n\nThe number of Sylow 17-subgroups, denoted by n_17, must divide 102 / 17 = 6, and n_17 \u2261 1 mod 17.\n\nThe possible divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nAmong these, only n_17 = 1 satisfies n_17 \u2261 1 mod 17.\n\nTherefore, there is exactly one Sylow 17-subgroup, which must be normal.\n\nSimilarly, for p = 3.\n\nn_3 must divide 102 / 3 = 34, and n_3 \u2261 1 mod 3.\n\nDivisors of 34 are 1, 2, 17, 34.\n\nAmong these, n_3 could be 1 or 17 (since 1 \u2261 1 mod 3 and 17 \u2261 1 mod 3).\n\nSo, there might be one or seventeen Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nIf n_3 = 1, then there is a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\nIf n_3 = 17, then there are seventeen Sylow 3-subgroups, none of which are normal unless they are the whole group or trivial, which they are not.\n\nSimilarly, for p = 2.\n\nn_2 must divide 102 / 2 = 51, and n_2 \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nDivisors of 51 are 1, 3, 17, 51.\n\nAll of these are \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo, n_2 could be 1, 3, 17, or 51.\n\nIf n_2 = 1, then there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nIf n_2 > 1, then no normal Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nHowever, even if n_2 > 1, n_3 > 1, and n_17 = 1, we still have at least one normal subgroup, which is the Sylow 17-subgroup.\n\nBut the question asks for a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nSince the Sylow 17-subgroup is of order 17, which is neither 1 nor 102, it is a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nTherefore, every group of order 102 has at least one nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
