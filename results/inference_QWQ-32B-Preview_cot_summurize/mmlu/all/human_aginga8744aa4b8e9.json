Spoiling the grandchildren\n\nC. Having others to wait on you\n\nD. Remembering when they were grandchildren\n\nI need to figure out which one of these is NOT considered a rewarding aspect according to grandparents.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each option means in the context of grandparenthood.\n\nOption A: Feelings of immortality. I think this refers to the idea that through their grandchildren, grandparents feel a continuation of their legacy or family line, which gives them a sense of lasting impact beyond their own lives.\n\nOption B: Spoiling the grandchildren. This probably means indulging their grandchildren with treats, attention, and perhaps letting them get away with things their parents might not. Grandparents often enjoy this role because it allows them to nurture and show affection without the responsibilities of day-to-day parenting.\n\nOption C: Having others to wait on you. This suggests that grandparents expect or receive care and attention from their grandchildren or possibly their own children. It might imply a sense of being waited upon or served.\n\nOption D: Remembering when they were grandchildren. This could mean reflecting on their own experiences as children or grandchildren and relating to their own grandparents' roles.\n\nNow, I need to consider which of these is NOT reported as a rewarding aspect by grandparents.\n\nI know that grandparents often cherish the time they spend with their grandchildren and enjoy the emotional connection. Options A and B seem positive and are likely to be rewarding.\n\nOption D might also be rewarding as it could bring fond memories and a sense of continuity.\n\nOption C, however, seems different. \"Having others to wait on you\" might not be universally seen as a rewarding aspect of grandparenthood. While some grandparents might appreciate assistance or care from their family, others might not view being waited upon as a primary source of fulfillment in their role as grandparents.\n\nIn fact, many grandparents take pride in being active and independent, and they may prefer to be givers rather than receivers. So, having others wait on them might not be as rewarding as the other options.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Having others to wait on you.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about it another way. If I were to ask grandparents what they enjoy most about being grandparents, they might say things like feeling connected to the next generation (immortality), spoiling their grandchildren with love and gifts, and reminiscing about their own childhood. Being waited upon might not be as central to the grandparenting experience and could even be seen as passive or less desirable compared to the other options.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Having others to wait on you.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
