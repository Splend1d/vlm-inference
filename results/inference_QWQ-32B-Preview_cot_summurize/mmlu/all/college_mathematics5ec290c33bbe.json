                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a counterfeit die. It says that the die is six-sided, numbered 1 through 6, but it's counterfeit because the probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number. I need to find the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the probabilities of rolling each number on this counterfeit die. Since the die is biased, the probabilities for even and odd numbers are different. Let's denote the probability of rolling an odd number as \\( p \\). Then, the probability of rolling an even number would be \\( 2p \\), according to the problem.\n\nNow, there are three odd numbers on a die: 1, 3, and 5. And there are also three even numbers: 2, 4, and 6. Since these are the only possible outcomes when rolling the die, the sum of all probabilities must equal 1.\n\nSo, the total probability is:\n\n\\[ 3p + 3(2p) = 3p + 6p = 9p = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( p = \\frac{1}{9} \\).\n\nThat means:\n\n- Probability of rolling a 1: \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\)\n\n- Probability of rolling a 2: \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\)\n\n- Probability of rolling a 3: \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\)\n\n- Probability of rolling a 4: \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\)\n\n- Probability of rolling a 5: \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\)\n\n- Probability of rolling a 6: \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\)\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability that the first roll is a 5 and the second roll is a 6. Since the rolls are independent events, I can find the probability of both events happening by multiplying their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, probability of first roll being 5 is \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\), and probability of second roll being 6 is \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\). Therefore, the combined probability is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{2}{81} \\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2/81\n\nB. 1/18\n\nC. 2/27\n\nD. 1/9\n\nIt seems that option A is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the probabilities:\n\n- Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, each with probability \\( p \\)\n\n- Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, each with probability \\( 2p \\)\n\nTotal probability:\n\n\\[ 3p + 6p = 9p = 1 \\]\n\nSo, \\( p = \\frac{1}{9} \\), which seems correct.\n\nThen, probability of first roll being 5 is \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\), and second roll being 6 is \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\). Multiplying them:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{2}{81} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider if the rolls are independent. The problem doesn't specify otherwise, so assuming independence is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem, but I can't think of any at the moment.\n\nSo, I think the answer is indeed \\( \\frac{2}{81} \\), which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{81}} \\]"
