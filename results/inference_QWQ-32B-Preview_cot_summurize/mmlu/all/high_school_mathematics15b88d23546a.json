                    "text": "So Mr. Patrick is making a five-question true-false quiz, and he decides each answer by flipping a coin. Heads is true, tails is false. He does this for each of the five questions. We need to find the probability that the sequence of answers comes out to be True, False, True, False, True (TFTFT).\n\nFirst, I need to understand how probabilities work in this scenario. Each coin flip is independent, meaning the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the others. Since it's a fair coin, the probability of heads (true) is 1/2, and the probability of tails (false) is also 1/2.\n\nSo, for each question:\n\n- Probability of True (T): 1/2\n\n- Probability of False (F): 1/2\n\nNow, the sequence TFTFT means:\n\n1. Question 1: T (1/2)\n\n2. Question 2: F (1/2)\n\n3. Question 3: T (1/2)\n\n4. Question 4: F (1/2)\n\n5. Question 5: T (1/2)\n\nSince each flip is independent, the probability of getting this specific sequence is the product of the probabilities of each individual outcome.\n\nSo, probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2)\n\nThat is, (1/2)^5.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(1/2)^5 = 1/32\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. Is there any other factor to consider here? Is there any dependency between the flips? No, each flip is independent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total number of possible sequences. Since each question has 2 possible answers (T or F), and there are 5 questions, the total number of possible sequences is 2^5 = 32.\n\nOnly one of these sequences is TFTFT.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/32.\n\nLet me see the options again:\n\nA. 1/6\n\nB. 1/64\n\nC. 1/32\n\nD. 1/2\n\nOption C is 1/32, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if the coin is fair or not. The problem says he flips a coin before writing each question, and it's heads for true and tails for false. Assuming it's a fair coin, which is typical unless stated otherwise.\n\nIf the coin were unfair, say, biased towards heads or tails, then the probabilities would be different. But in this case, it's a fair coin, so each flip has a 1/2 chance of being heads or tails.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the binary choices. Each question is independent, and each has two outcomes, each with equal probability.\n\nSo, the probability of any specific sequence of five answers is (1/2)^5 = 1/32.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1/32, which is option C.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't any trick here. Is there any reason why it wouldn't be 1/32? For example, is there any dependency between the questions that I'm missing?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"He flips a coin before writing the first question. If it is heads, he writes a true statement and if it is tails, he writes a false statement. He continues this until all five statements are written.\"\n\nEach statement is determined by an independent coin flip, so no, there are no dependencies.\n\nThus, the probability remains 1/32.\n\nI think the answer is indeed 1/32, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{32}} \\]"
