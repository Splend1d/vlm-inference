                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this scenario where a non-custodial parent is asking Dr. Maxine Miller, who's a school psychologist, for the results of some tests she did on his 5th grade son. And the question is, if Dr. Miller gives him the test results, would she be acting legally and ethically, legally but unethically, illegally but ethically, or illegally and unethetically?\n\nFirst, I need to think about the laws and ethics regarding sharing student test results, especially when it comes to non-custodial parents.\n\nIn most places, educational records, including test results, are protected by privacy laws. One of the main laws in the U.S. is the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, commonly known as FERPA. FERPA generally gives parents certain rights regarding their children's education records, including the right to inspect and review those records.\n\nNow, regarding non-custodial parents, it can get a bit tricky. FERPA doesn't specifically address non-custodial parents, but it does state that schools may release education records to parents unless there's a court order or other legally binding document that specifically revokes those rights.\n\nSo, if there's a court order that designates who has access to the child's educational records, Dr. Miller would need to follow that. If there's no such order, and both parents have equal rights, then perhaps she could share the information with the non-custodial parent.\n\nBut ethics come into play here too. As a school psychologist, Dr. Miller likely has a code of ethics to follow, which probably includes maintaining confidentiality and considering the best interests of the student.\n\nSharing test results with a non-custodial parent might be ethically okay if it's in the best interest of the student and doesn't harm anyone. However, if there are any concerns about the relationship between the parents or potential conflicts, she might need to proceed with caution.\n\nAlso, she should consider whether the custodial parent has given consent for sharing the information with the non-custodial parent. If the custodial parent has not given consent, sharing the information might be unethical, even if it's legally permissible.\n\nGiven all that, if Dr. Miller shares the test results with the non-custodial parent without considering these factors, she might be acting illegally and unethically.\n\nWait, but if it's legally permissible and she does it ethically, then it could be A. legally and ethically.\n\nOr if it's legally permissible but she doesn't consider the ethical implications, it could be B. legally but unethically.\n\nIf it's illegal but she does it for ethical reasons, it could be D. illegally but ethically.\n\nAnd if it's both illegal and unethical, it would be C.\n\nSo, I need to decide which one fits best.\n\nGiven that FERPA governs the release of educational records and that school psychologists have ethical obligations to protect student confidentiality and consider the student's best interests, I think that sharing the test results with a non-custodial parent without considering these factors could be both illegal and unethical.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C. illegally and unethically.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps in some cases, it's legally acceptable to share the information with a non-custodial parent, especially if both parents have equal rights to the child's educational records.\n\nIn that case, if she shares the information appropriately, it could be A. legally and ethically.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be implying that sharing the information might not be entirely appropriate, hence the need to choose among these options.\n\nGiven that it's a multiple-choice question, and without more context, I'll go with C. illegally and unethically, assuming that there are reasons why sharing the information would not be appropriate in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
