                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about art movements. It says, \"The intention of making traditional, saleable art objects was abandoned by...\" and then it lists four options: A. Impressionists, B. Pop artists, C. Abstract Expressionists, and D. Conceptual artists. I need to choose which one of these groups abandoned the idea of creating traditional, saleable art objects.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"traditional, saleable art objects\" means. I think it refers to art that follows conventional styles and techniques, something that art buyers and collectors are familiar with and are likely to purchase. So, the question is asking which of these art movements moved away from creating such conventional art pieces that are easy to sell.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Impressionists. I know that Impressionists were a group of 19th-century artists who rebelled against the traditional painting methods of the time. They focused on capturing light and movement, often painting outdoors, which was unusual. Their works were initially controversial but later became very popular and valuable. So, while they did break some traditions, their art eventually became saleable and is now highly prized. So, maybe they didn't entirely abandon the intention of making saleable art objects.\n\nNext, B. Pop artists. Pop art emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, and it incorporated elements from popular culture, like advertising and mass media. Artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein created art that was often bright, colorful, and recognizable. While Pop art was a departure from traditional art subjects, it was also very marketable and appealed to a broader audience. Many Pop art pieces are now considered classics and are sold for high prices. So, again, it seems like Pop artists didn't entirely abandon the intention of making saleable art objects.\n\nOption C. Abstract Expressionists. This was an art movement that emerged in the 1940s and 1950s, primarily in the United States. Artists like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko created non-representational art, focusing on emotion and the process of painting. Their works were often large-scale and emphasized the physical act of painting. While Abstract Expressionist art can be challenging to understand for some people, it has become highly valued in the art market. Many of these pieces are considered masterworks and are sold for millions of dollars. So, even though they departed from traditional representational art, their works are still very saleable.\n\nFinally, option D. Conceptual artists. Conceptual art emerged in the 1960s and emphasizes the idea or concept behind the work over the artistic skills or the finished product. Conceptual artists often use everyday materials or documentation of actions as their medium. The artwork is about the idea it represents, and sometimes the physical object is minimal or even non-existent. This approach can be seen as a departure from traditional art objects that are created to be visually appealing and collectible.\n\nGiven this, it seems like Conceptual artists might be the group that abandoned the intention of making traditional, saleable art objects. Their focus on ideas over physical products might mean that their works are less concerned with being marketable in the traditional sense.\n\nBut wait, I should think about whether conceptual art is actually saleable. In reality, even conceptual art can be bought and sold, sometimes for high prices, especially by famous artists. However, the nature of conceptual art might make it less accessible to mainstream art buyers who are looking for more traditional, visually appealing objects.\n\nComparing all the options, the Impressionists, Pop artists, and Abstract Expressionists all created art that, despite being innovative, eventually found a place in the art market and are considered saleable. Conceptual artists, on the other hand, seem to have departed more radically from the idea of creating traditional art objects, focusing instead on ideas and concepts.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. Conceptual artists.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
