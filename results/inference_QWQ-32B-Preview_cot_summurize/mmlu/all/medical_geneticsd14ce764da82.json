                    "text": "In eukaryotic cells, the process of gene expression involves transcription and translation. During transcription, DNA is copied into a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA), which then serves as the template for protein synthesis during translation. However, the initial mRNA transcript, known as the primary transcript or pre-mRNA, undergoes several modifications before it is ready to be translated into a protein.\n\nOne of these modifications is the removal of certain sequences from the pre-mRNA. These sequences, called introns, are non-coding regions that do not contribute to the final protein product. The remaining sequences, called exons, are the coding regions that will be translated into amino acids.\n\nSo, to answer the question: The component of transcribed RNA in eukaryotes that is present in the initial transcript but is removed before translation occurs is the intron.\n\nLet's look at the other options to ensure clarity:\n\nA. Intron - Correct, as explained above.\n\nB. 3\u2019 Poly A tail - This is actually added to the pre-mRNA during processing, not removed. The poly-A tail is a sequence of adenine nucleotides that is added to the 3\u2019 end of the mRNA and helps in mRNA stability and export from the nucleus.\n\nC. Ribosome binding site - In eukaryotes, the ribosome binding site is not present in the mRNA. Instead, eukaryotic mRNAs have a 5\u2019 cap, which is important for mRNA stability and translation initiation.\n\nD. 5\u2019 cap - This is added to the 5\u2019 end of the pre-mRNA during processing and plays a crucial role in mRNA stability and translation initiation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Intron.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
