                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We have a molecule with two energy levels, alpha and beta, for the 1H nucleus, and they're in equilibrium with populations n_alpha_eq and n_beta_eq respectively. Then, there's a 5.0 \u03bcs pulse applied with a magnetic field B1 = 4.697 mT, and I need to find out what the populations are after this pulse.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how NMR pulses affect the populations of nuclear spin states. In NMR, a radiofrequency (RF) pulse can rotate the magnetization vector in the Bloch sphere, which affects the populations of the energy levels.\n\nThe standard equations for population inversion or rotation depend on the angle of the pulse, which is determined by the flip angle \u03b8. The flip angle is related to the pulse duration and the strength of the RF field B1.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\n\n\u03b8 = \u03b3 * B1 * \u03c4\n\nwhere:\n\n- \u03b8 is the flip angle in radians\n\n- \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus (for 1H, it's approximately 2\u03c0 * 42.58 MHz/T)\n\n- B1 is the RF field strength in Tesla\n\n- \u03c4 is the pulse duration in seconds\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the flip angle \u03b8.\n\nGiven:\n\nB1 = 4.697 mT = 4.697 * 10^-3 T\n\n\u03c4 = 5.0 \u03bcs = 5.0 * 10^-6 s\n\n\u03b3 for 1H = 2\u03c0 * 42.58 MHz/T = 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 10^6 rad/s per T\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b8 = \u03b3 * B1 * \u03c4\n\n= (2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 10^6 rad/s per T) * (4.697 * 10^-3 T) * (5.0 * 10^-6 s)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \u03b3 * B1:\n\n= 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 10^6 * 4.697 * 10^-3\n\n= 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 4.697 * 10^(6 - 3)\n\n= 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 4.697 * 10^3 rad/s\n\nNow, multiply by \u03c4:\n\n\u03b8 = 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 4.697 * 10^3 * 5.0 * 10^-6\n\n= 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 4.697 * 5.0 * 10^(3 - 6)\n\n= 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 4.697 * 5.0 * 10^-3 radians\n\nLet me compute the numerical value.\n\nFirst, 42.58 * 4.697 \u2248 200.05\n\nThen, 200.05 * 5.0 = 1000.25\n\nThen, 1000.25 * 10^-3 = 1.00025\n\nSo, \u03b8 \u2248 2\u03c0 * 1.00025 radians\n\nBut 2\u03c0 radians is 360 degrees, so \u03b8 \u2248 360 * 1.00025 degrees \u2248 360 degrees\n\nWait, that seems off. Maybe I made a mistake in units.\n\nWait, \u03b3 is in radians per second per tesla, B1 is in tesla, and \u03c4 is in seconds, so \u03b8 should be in radians.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03b8:\n\n\u03b3 = 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 10^6 rad/s per T\n\nB1 = 4.697 * 10^-3 T\n\n\u03c4 = 5.0 * 10^-6 s\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b8 = (2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 10^6) * (4.697 * 10^-3) * (5.0 * 10^-6)\n\n= 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 4.697 * 5.0 * 10^(6 - 3 - 6)\n\n= 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 4.697 * 5.0 * 10^-3 radians\n\nNow, 42.58 * 4.697 \u2248 200.05\n\n200.05 * 5.0 = 1000.25\n\n1000.25 * 10^-3 = 1.00025\n\nSo, \u03b8 \u2248 2\u03c0 * 1.00025 radians\n\nBut 2\u03c0 radians is 360 degrees, so \u03b8 \u2248 360 * 1.00025 degrees \u2248 360 degrees\n\nWait, that would mean a full rotation, which should bring the populations back to equilibrium.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to consider that 2\u03c0 * 1.00025 is approximately 2\u03c0, so \u03b8 \u2248 2\u03c0 radians, which is a full circle, meaning no net rotation.\n\nBut in NMR, a 2\u03c0 pulse is supposed to invert the magnetization, but I think that's for a spin-1/2 system.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that \u03b8 = \u03b3 * B1 * \u03c4, and then find the rotation matrix that corresponds to this angle.\n\nFor a spin-1/2 system, the populations after a pulse can be found using the rotation operators.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider the populations before and after the pulse.\n\nIn equilibrium, n_alpha = n_alpha_eq and n_beta = n_beta_eq.\n\nAfter a pulse, the populations will depend on the flip angle \u03b8.\n\nFor a general flip angle \u03b8, the populations will be:\n\nn_alpha = n_alpha_eq * cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + n_beta_eq * sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nn_beta = n_alpha_eq * sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + n_beta_eq * cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nThis comes from the rotation of the density matrix or the Bloch vector.\n\nGiven that \u03b8 \u2248 2\u03c0 radians, which is 360 degrees, cos(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03c0) = -1, and sin(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03c0) = 0.\n\nTherefore,\n\nn_alpha = n_alpha_eq * (-1)^2 + n_beta_eq * (0)^2 = n_alpha_eq * 1 + n_beta_eq * 0 = n_alpha_eq\n\nn_beta = n_alpha_eq * (0)^2 + n_beta_eq * (-1)^2 = n_alpha_eq * 0 + n_beta_eq * 1 = n_beta_eq\n\nSo, the populations remain the same as equilibrium.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. A 360-degree pulse is often considered to bring the system back to its original state, but in some contexts, it might introduce phase changes without affecting populations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that a 360-degree pulse effectively does nothing to the populations, only to the phases.\n\nBut according to the equations above, the populations remain unchanged.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. n_alpha = n_beta_eq and n_beta = n_alpha_eq\n\nB. n_alpha = n_alpha_eq and n_beta = n_beta_eq\n\nC. n_alpha = \u00bd(n_alpha_eq + n_beta_eq) and n_beta = \u00bd(n_alpha_eq + n_beta_eq)\n\nD. n_alpha = n_alpha_eq + n_beta_eq and n_beta = n_alpha_eq + n_beta_eq\n\nAccording to my calculation, the correct answer should be B.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pulse is not a 360-degree pulse but something else.\n\nWait, let's recalculate \u03b8.\n\n\u03b3 = 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 10^6 rad/s per T\n\nB1 = 4.697 * 10^-3 T\n\n\u03c4 = 5.0 * 10^-6 s\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b8 = 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 10^6 * 4.697 * 10^-3 * 5.0 * 10^-6\n\n= 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 4.697 * 5.0 * 10^(6 - 3 - 6)\n\n= 2\u03c0 * 42.58 * 4.697 * 5.0 * 10^-3 radians\n\nNow, 42.58 * 4.697 \u2248 200.05\n\n200.05 * 5.0 = 1000.25\n\n1000.25 * 10^-3 = 1.00025\n\nSo, \u03b8 \u2248 2\u03c0 * 1.00025 radians\n\nWhich is approximately 2\u03c0 radians, or 360 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the populations should remain unchanged, as per the equations above.\n\nAlternatively, if \u03b8 is exactly 2\u03c0, then cos(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03c0) = -1, and sin(\u03b8/2) = 0, leading to n_alpha = n_alpha_eq and n_beta = n_beta_eq.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any phase change or other effects that might affect the populations.\n\nIn NMR, population changes are usually only significant for pulses that transfer population between energy levels, such as \u03c0 pulses, but for 2\u03c0 pulses, they often just rephase or introduce a certain evolution.\n\nGiven that, and based on the equations, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
