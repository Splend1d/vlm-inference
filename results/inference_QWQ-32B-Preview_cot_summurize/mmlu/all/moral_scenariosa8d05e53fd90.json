It's more of a hygiene or housekeeping issue.\n\nIn scenario 2, hugging, kissing your wife, and buying her flowers are all expressions of affection and love, which are generally considered positive and morally acceptable actions.\n\nSo, neither scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
