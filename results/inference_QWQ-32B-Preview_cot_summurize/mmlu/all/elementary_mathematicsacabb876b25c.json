First, I need to remember the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nIn this expression, 52 + 6 * 2, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I look at multiplication and division first. There's a multiplication: 6 * 2, which equals 12.\n\nNow the expression is 52 + 12.\n\nAdding those together gives me 64.\n\nSo, the answer should be 64, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here. In some programming languages, the '*' operator has higher precedence, but in standard mathematics, multiplication and division are handled before addition and subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps someone might misread \"52\" as fifty-two, but in this context, it's likely meant as 52, not 5*2.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if there are any implicit groupings, but again, the expression is straightforward: 52 + 6 * 2.\n\nSo, sticking with the order of operations, multiplication first, then addition, the answer is indeed 64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
