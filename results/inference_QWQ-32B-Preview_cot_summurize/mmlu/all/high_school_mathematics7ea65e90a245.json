Hmm, I'm not entirely sure how to approach this, but I think I should start by finding the derivative of the function and setting it to zero to find the critical points. That's usually how we find maxima and minima in calculus.\n\nSo, first, let's find f'(x). The function is a product of x and e^{-x}, so I'll need to use the product rule. The product rule says that if you have f(x) = u(x)v(x), then f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x).\n\nHere, u(x) = x, so u'(x) = 1.\n\nv(x) = e^{-x}, so v'(x) = -e^{-x}.\n\nTherefore, f'(x) = (1)(e^{-x}) + (x)(-e^{-x}) = e^{-x} - x e^{-x} = e^{-x}(1 - x).\n\nNow, to find the critical points, I set f'(x) = 0.\n\nSo, e^{-x}(1 - x) = 0.\n\nSince e^{-x} is never zero, the only solution is 1 - x = 0, which means x = 1.\n\nAlright, so x = 1 is a critical point. Now, I need to determine whether this is a maximum or a minimum. Maybe I can use the second derivative test.\n\nLet's find f''(x).\n\nWe have f'(x) = e^{-x}(1 - x).\n\nTo find f''(x), I'll use the product rule again.\n\nLet u(x) = e^{-x}, so u'(x) = -e^{-x}.\n\nv(x) = 1 - x, so v'(x) = -1.\n\nTherefore, f''(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x) = (-e^{-x})(1 - x) + (e^{-x})(-1) = -e^{-x}(1 - x) - e^{-x} = -e^{-x}(1 - x + 1) = -e^{-x}(2 - x).\n\nNow, evaluate f''(x) at x = 1.\n\nf''(1) = -e^{-1}(2 - 1) = -e^{-1}(1) = -1/e.\n\nSince f''(1) is negative, that means the function has a local maximum at x = 1.\n\nGreat, so the maximum occurs at x = 1. Now, I need to find the value of the function at that point.\n\nf(1) = (1)e^{-1} = 1/e.\n\nSo, the maximum value is 1/e.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 1/e, B is e, C is 1, and D is -1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 1/e.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should check the behavior of the function as x approaches infinity or zero or something.\n\nAs x approaches infinity, e^{-x} approaches zero, so x * e^{-x} approaches zero.\n\nAs x approaches zero, x * e^{-x} approaches zero.\n\nAs x approaches negative infinity, x is negative and e^{-x} grows exponentially, so x * e^{-x} approaches negative infinity.\n\nSo, yes, the maximum should be at x = 1, and the maximum value is 1/e.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{e}} \\]"
