Theravada.\n\nTheravada Buddhism is considered the oldest existing branch of Buddhism and is known for its strict adherence to the original teachings of the Buddha as recorded in the Pali Canon. It emphasizes personal enlightenment and the attainment of Nirvana through individual effort and meditation.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, Buddhism has a long and rich history dating back to the 3rd century BCE when it was introduced by Mahinda, the son of the Indian emperor Ashoka. Over the centuries, Theravada Buddhism has become deeply ingrained in Sri Lankan culture and society, influencing art, architecture, literature, and daily life.\n\nWhile other forms of Buddhism like Mahayana, Pure Land, and Zen are practiced in different parts of the world, Theravada remains the predominant tradition in Sri Lanka.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Mahayana Buddhism:** This branch is prevalent in East Asia, including countries like China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. It emphasizes the Bodhisattva path, where individuals vow to attain enlightenment for the sake of all beings.\n\n- **Pure Land Buddhism:** This is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism that focuses on devotion to Amitabha Buddha and the aspiration to be reborn in his pure land, where conditions are favorable for achieving enlightenment.\n\n- **Zen Buddhism:** Also known as Chan in China and Seon in Korea, Zen is another branch of Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes meditation and direct experience over scriptural study.\n\nEach of these branches has its own unique practices and interpretations of Buddhist teachings, but Theravada remains the primary form in Sri Lanka.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- \"A Concise History of Buddhism\" by David Watson\n- \"Introduction to Buddhism\" by Peter Harvey\n- \"Buddhism in Sri Lanka: A Short History\" by Walpola Rahula\n"
