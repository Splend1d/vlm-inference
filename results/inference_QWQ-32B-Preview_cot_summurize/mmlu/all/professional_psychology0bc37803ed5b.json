                    "text": "Let's see. I need to identify which statement is about a skewed distribution from the given options. First, I should recall what a skewed distribution is.\n\nA skewed distribution is one where the data is not symmetrical, meaning that one tail of the distribution is longer or fatter than the other. This is in contrast to a symmetrical distribution, like the normal distribution, which is bell-shaped and has both tails as mirror images of each other.\n\nOption A says, \"It is commonly called the bell-shaped curve.\" I know that the bell-shaped curve refers to the normal distribution, which is symmetrical. So, this is not about a skewed distribution.\n\nOption B states, \"It is symmetrical (half falls above the mean, half below).\" Again, this describes a symmetrical distribution, specifically the normal distribution where the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center. Skewed distributions are not symmetrical, so this doesn't fit.\n\nOption C says, \"It has asymmetrical frequency distributions.\" This sounds like it's describing a skewed distribution because skewness implies asymmetry in the data. So, this might be the correct choice.\n\nOption D is, \"It is used most commonly with a large number of data points.\" I'm not sure what this is referring to specifically. The normal distribution is often used with large data sets due to the central limit theorem, but skewness can occur in distributions of any size if the data is not symmetrically distributed. This option doesn't directly address skewness.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that option C is the one that pertains to skewed distributions because it mentions asymmetrical frequency distributions, which is a key characteristic of skewness.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
