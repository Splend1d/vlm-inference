                    "text": "I think I've got this one, but let me double-check. So, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC for short, is a big deal in the US economy. I remember that it's related to the Federal Reserve, which is like the central bank of the US. So, option B says it's part of the Federal Reserve System. That sounds right.\n\nOption A says it advises the President of the United States. Hmm, I don't think that's its main role. The FOMC is more involved in setting monetary policy, like interest rates and managing the money supply, not directly advising the President. So, I think A is not the best answer.\n\nOption C says it has seven members. I think that might not be accurate. I recall that the FOMC consists of 12 members: the seven members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and five of the Federal Reserve Bank presidents, who rotate. So, total membership is 12, not seven. Maybe it's a trick question?\n\nOption D says it promotes free trade. Again, that doesn't sound like the FOMC's primary function. Free trade is more related to international trade policies and agreements, which are handled by other agencies like the US Trade Representative or through international organizations. The FOMC is focused on monetary policy and financial stability.\n\nSo, based on what I know, option B seems to be the correct answer. The FOMC is indeed part of the Federal Reserve System. But to be thorough, let me make sure none of the other options are also correct.\n\nOption A: Advises the President. I don't think so. The FOMC operates independently in terms of setting monetary policy, although the Federal Reserve does coordinate with the government.\n\nOption C: Has seven members. As I recall, the FOMC has 12 members: seven governors and five Reserve Bank presidents. So, seven is only part of the picture.\n\nOption D: Promotes free trade. That doesn't align with its functions. Its focus is on maintaining price stability and maximum employment through monetary policy.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B: is part of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
