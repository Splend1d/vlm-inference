                    "text": "So I've got this question here about infant brain development and sleep. It says that according to Dr. William Sears, who's an expert on babies and childcare, infant brain development is partly influenced by longer and more frequent periods of active sleeping and dreaming. Then it gives options: A. REM sleep, B. NREM sleep, C. delta sleep, D. stage 3 sleep. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these sleep stages is. I know that sleep is divided into REM and NREM sleep. REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement, which is when we dream, and NREM is Non-Rapid Eye Movement, which has different stages.\n\nNREM sleep is further divided into stages. Stage 1 is light sleep, stage 2 is when you're lightly asleep but harder to wake up, and stage 3 is deep sleep, also called delta sleep because of the slow delta waves in the brain.\n\nSo, the question mentions \"active sleeping and dreaming or,\" and then the options start with REM sleep. I think REM sleep is associated with active dreaming.\n\nDr. Sears is saying that longer and more frequent periods of this type of sleep influence infant brain development.\n\nI recall that infants spend a lot of time in REM sleep, more so than adults. Maybe because their brains are developing so rapidly.\n\nSo, if infant brain development is influenced by active sleeping and dreaming, which is REM sleep, then option A seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about NREM sleep. Stage 3, or delta sleep, is important for physical growth and recovery. Infants do have a lot of growth happening, but the question specifically mentions \"active sleeping and dreaming,\" which sounds more like REM sleep.\n\nDelta sleep is deep sleep, but it's not typically associated with active dreaming. In fact, dreaming mostly occurs during REM sleep.\n\nSo, considering that, I think REM sleep is the right answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider each option:\n\nA. REM sleep: Associated with dreaming and active brain activity. Makes sense for brain development.\n\nB. NREM sleep: More about physical recovery and less about active brain activity.\n\nC. Delta sleep: That's stage 3 of NREM sleep, which is deep sleep. Important for growth, but maybe not as directly related to brain development through dreaming.\n\nD. Stage 3 sleep: Same as delta sleep, which is NREM sleep.\n\nSo, again, REM sleep seems to be the best fit.\n\nI think the answer is A. REM sleep.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
