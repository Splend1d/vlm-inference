So, for two ratios a/b and c/d to form a proportion, a/b = c/d, which is true if and only if a*d = b*c.\n\nLet's examine each option step by step.\n\nOption A: 2/5 and 8/10\n\nFirst, simplify 8/10:\n\n8 \u00f7 2 = 4\n\n10 \u00f7 2 = 5\n\nSo, 8/10 simplifies to 4/5.\n\nNow, compare 2/5 and 4/5. They are not equal.\n\nAlternatively, cross-multiplying:\n\n2 * 10 = 20\n\n5 * 8 = 40\n\n20 \u2260 40, so they do not form a proportion.\n\nOption B: 2/5 and 10/15\n\nSimplify 10/15:\n\n10 \u00f7 5 = 2\n\n15 \u00f7 5 = 3\n\nSo, 10/15 simplifies to 2/3.\n\nNow, compare 2/5 and 2/3. They are not equal.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n2 * 15 = 30\n\n5 * 10 = 50\n\n30 \u2260 50, so they do not form a proportion.\n\nOption C: 2/5 and 4/25\n\nCompare 2/5 and 4/25 directly. They look different, but let's check by cross-multiplying.\n\n2 * 25 = 50\n\n5 * 4 = 20\n\n50 \u2260 20, so they do not form a proportion.\n\nOption D: 2/5 and 6/15\n\nSimplify 6/15:\n\n6 \u00f7 3 = 2\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\nSo, 6/15 simplifies to 2/5.\n\nNow, compare 2/5 and 2/5. They are equal.\n\nAlternatively, cross-multiplying:\n\n2 * 15 = 30\n\n5 * 6 = 30\n\n30 = 30, so they form a proportion.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
