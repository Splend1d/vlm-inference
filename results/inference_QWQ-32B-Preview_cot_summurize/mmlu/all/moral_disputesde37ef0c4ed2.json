                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about a message that Nathanson believes can be sent by abolishing the death penalty. So, first things first, I need to understand what abolishing the death penalty means. Death penalty is when a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime they committed, usually for very serious crimes like murder. Abolishing it means stopping that practice, so no more executions by the state.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the message this sends, according to Nathanson. There are four options:\n\nA. Criminals deserve inhumane treatment.\n\nB. Killing in self-defense is never morally justified.\n\nC. We should have respect for the dignity of human beings.\n\nD. Murderers should be killed by the state.\n\nLet's look at each one.\n\nOption A says that criminals deserve inhumane treatment. But abolishing the death penalty is about not executing people, which is a form of humane treatment. So, this seems contradictory. If you abolish the death penalty, you're probably against inhumane treatment, right? So, A doesn't seem likely.\n\nOption B is about killing in self-defense. I'm not sure how abolishing the death penalty relates directly to self-defense. The death penalty is about state-sanctioned execution for crimes, whereas self-defense is about individuals using force to protect themselves from immediate harm. These seem like different things. So, B might not be the best choice.\n\nOption C is about respecting the dignity of human beings. This seems plausible. Abolishing the death penalty could be seen as valuing human life, even for those who have committed serious crimes. It suggests that all human beings have inherent dignity that should be respected, and taking someone's life is not the way to handle even the most heinous crimes. This aligns with certain moral and ethical viewpoints that prioritize the intrinsic worth of every person.\n\nOption D says that murderers should be killed by the state. But abolishing the death penalty would mean stopping the state from killing murderers. So, this option directly contradicts the act of abolishing the death penalty. Therefore, D doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nBetween the options, C seems to be the most appropriate. It reflects a view that values human life and dignity, which is consistent with abolishing the death penalty.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about why someone might choose another option. For example, someone might think that abolishing the death penalty sends a message that criminals shouldn't be punished severely, but that's not exactly what any of the options say.\n\nOption A says criminals deserve inhumane treatment, but abolishing the death penalty is about not treating them inhumane ly, so it's the opposite.\n\nOption B is about self-defense, which is a separate issue from the death penalty.\n\nOption C aligns well with a philosophy that values human life and dignity, regardless of the crime committed.\n\nOption D is directly contrary to abolishing the death penalty.\n\nTherefore, the most logical choice is C: We should have respect for the dignity of human beings.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
