                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We start with nine bags of bird feed in the storage room. Then, throughout the week, more bags are delivered on different days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. We need to find out how many bags there will be in total by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the deliveries:\n\n- Monday: 17 bags\n\n- Tuesday: 22 bags\n\n- Wednesday: 3 bags\n\n- Thursday: 11 bags\n\n- Friday: 18 bags\n\nWe also have the initial nine bags already in the storage room.\n\nSo, the total number of bags will be the initial nine bags plus all the bags delivered during the week.\n\nLet's add them up one by one to avoid mistakes.\n\nStarting with the initial nine bags.\n\nPlus Monday's delivery of 17 bags:\n\n9 + 17 = 26 bags.\n\nNext, Tuesday's delivery of 22 bags:\n\n26 + 22 = 48 bags.\n\nThen, Wednesday's delivery of 3 bags:\n\n48 + 3 = 51 bags.\n\nThursday's delivery of 11 bags:\n\n51 + 11 = 62 bags.\n\nFinally, Friday's delivery of 18 bags:\n\n62 + 18 = 80 bags.\n\nSo, by the end of the week, there should be 80 bags in total.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that addition to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 9 bags.\n\nAdd Monday's 17: 9 + 17 = 26.\n\nAdd Tuesday's 22: 26 + 22 = 48.\n\nAdd Wednesday's 3: 48 + 3 = 51.\n\nAdd Thursday's 11: 51 + 11 = 62.\n\nAdd Friday's 18: 62 + 18 = 80.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could add up all the deliveries first and then add them to the initial nine bags.\n\nSo, deliveries:\n\nMonday: 17\n\nTuesday: 22\n\nWednesday: 3\n\nThursday: 11\n\nFriday: 18\n\nAdding those together:\n\n17 + 22 = 39\n\n39 + 3 = 42\n\n42 + 11 = 53\n\n53 + 18 = 71\n\nNow, add the initial nine bags: 71 + 9 = 80.\n\nWait, that's the same total as before.\n\nBut earlier, when I added them step by step, it came to 80, but now it's coming to 80 again.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the second method, I added the deliveries first: 17 + 22 + 3 + 11 + 18.\n\nLet me make sure that's correct.\n\n17 + 22 is 39.\n\n39 + 3 is 42.\n\n42 + 11 is 53.\n\n53 + 18 is 71.\n\nThen, add the initial nine bags: 71 + 9 = 80.\n\nBut in the first method, I had:\n\n9 + 17 = 26\n\n26 + 22 = 48\n\n48 + 3 = 51\n\n51 + 11 = 62\n\n62 + 18 = 80.\n\nBoth methods give me 80, so it seems correct.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 9\n\nB. 25\n\nC. 60\n\nD. 80\n\nOption D is 80, which matches my calculation.\n\nWait a minute, but in the second method, I had deliveries totaling 71, plus initial 9, equals 80.\n\nBut in the first method, step by step addition also reached 80.\n\nSo, the answer should be 80.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any possibility of miscounting.\n\nMaybe I should add the deliveries again.\n\nMonday: 17\n\nTuesday: 22\n\nWednesday: 3\n\nThursday: 11\n\nFriday: 18\n\nAdding them up:\n\n17 + 22 = 39\n\n39 + 3 = 42\n\n42 + 11 = 53\n\n53 + 18 = 71\n\nYes, deliveries total 71 bags.\n\nAdding the initial 9 bags: 71 + 9 = 80.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem.\n\nMaybe I can think of it as the initial amount plus the sum of all deliveries.\n\nInitial amount: 9 bags.\n\nSum of deliveries: 17 + 22 + 3 + 11 + 18.\n\nWe can add them in a different order to see if it still sums to 71.\n\nFor example:\n\n17 + 22 = 39\n\n3 + 11 = 14\n\n14 + 18 = 32\n\nThen, 39 + 32 = 71.\n\nYes, same total.\n\nAdding to initial 9 gives 80.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bags by the end of the week is 80.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 80.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
