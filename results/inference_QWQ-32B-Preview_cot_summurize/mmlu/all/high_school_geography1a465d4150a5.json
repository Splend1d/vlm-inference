Let's see:\n\nOption A says they are both capitals of countries formerly colonized by the English. I know that India was colonized by the British, but Varanasi isn't the capital of India. The capital is New Delhi. Mecca is in Saudi Arabia, which was never colonized by the British, as far as I know. So, this option doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says they are destinations for vast numbers of pilgrims. Varanasi is a very holy city in Hinduism, and Mecca is the holiest city in Islam. I think lots of people visit both places for religious reasons. So, this could be a possible answer.\n\nOption C mentions that they are financial centers for a large fraction of the world's economy. I don't think Varanasi or Mecca are known for being major financial hubs. There are cities like New York, London, and Tokyo that are more famous for finance. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption D says they are examples of modern urban planning. I'm not sure about this. Varanasi is an ancient city, and Mecca also has a long history. Maybe they have modern parts, but I don't think that's what makes them alike in a significant way.\n\nComparing all the options, option B seems the most appropriate because both cities are important religious sites\u5438\u5f15\u5927\u91cf\u671d\u5723\u8005\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6211\u9009\u62e9B\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
