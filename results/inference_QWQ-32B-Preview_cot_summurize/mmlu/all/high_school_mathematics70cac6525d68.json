                    "text": "This problem seems to be about exponential decay, where the rate of removing contaminants is proportional to the amount left to remove. It's similar to how radioactive materials decay or how substances dissolve in a solution.\n\nGiven that the rate of removal is proportional to the amount remaining, this suggests an exponential relationship. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( C \\) is the amount of contaminant at time \\( t \\),\n\n- \\( k \\) is a positive constant representing the rate of removal.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the contaminant is decreasing over time.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can separate variables:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dC}{C} = -k \\, dt \\]\n\nIntegrating both sides:\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{1}{C} \\, dC = -k \\int dt \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln|C| = -kt + C_0 \\]\n\nExponentiating both sides to solve for \\( C \\):\n\n\\[ C = e^{-kt + C_0} = e^{C_0} e^{-kt} \\]\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\( e^{C_0} \\) as \\( C_0 \\), the initial amount of contaminant at \\( t = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ C(t) = C_0 e^{-kt} \\]\n\nNow, we're told that 20% of the contaminant is removed during the first minute. That means that after 1 minute, 80% of the contaminant remains.\n\nSo, at \\( t = 1 \\) minute:\n\n\\[ C(1) = 0.8 C_0 \\]\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\n\\[ 0.8 C_0 = C_0 e^{-k \\cdot 1} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.8 = e^{-k} \\]\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.8) = -k \\]\n\n\\[ k = -\\ln(0.8) \\]\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n\\[ k \\approx 0.22314 \\, \\text{per minute} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the time \\( t \\) when 98% of the contaminant has been removed, meaning that 2% remains.\n\nSo, \\( C(t) = 0.02 C_0 \\)\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\n\\[ 0.02 C_0 = C_0 e^{-kt} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.02 = e^{-kt} \\]\n\nTaking natural logarithm:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.02) = -kt \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln(0.02)}{-k} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( k \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln(0.02)}{-(-\\ln(0.8))} = \\frac{\\ln(0.02)}{\\ln(0.8)} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\nFirst, find \\( \\ln(0.02) \\) and \\( \\ln(0.8) \\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.02) \\approx -3.91202 \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.8) \\approx -0.22314 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-3.91202}{-0.22314} \\approx 17.52 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest option, that would be approximately 18 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the decontamination process will take approximately 18 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18 \\text{ min}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
