                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about a Hindu community known for environmental activism. The options are Puranas, Bishnoi, Rajasthan, and Jambho. I think I need to figure out which one is a community involved in protecting the environment.\n\nFirst, I know that Puranas are ancient Hindu texts that contain stories and myths about gods and goddesses. They're important religious texts but I don't think they're a community associated with environmental activism. So, maybe Puranas is not the right answer.\n\nNext, I have Bishnoi. I've heard of the Bishnoi community before, and I think they are known for their strong connection to nature and conservation efforts. There's even a famous story about a woman named Amrita Devi who sacrificed her life to protect trees from being felled, and many others followed her lead. This sounds like environmental activism to me. So, Bishnoi seems like a strong candidate.\n\nThen, there's Rajasthan. Now, Rajasthan is a state in India, known for its rich culture and history. While it's possible that environmental activism happens there, Rajasthan itself isn't a community; it's a geographical region. So, I don't think that's the right answer.\n\nLastly, Jambho\u2014hmm, I'm not familiar with this term. I think it might be a misspelling or perhaps refers to Jambhothar, which is another name for the Bishnoi community. If that's the case, then it might be related to the Bishnois, who are known for their environmental practices.\n\nGiven this, I believe the correct answer is Bishnoi, as they are a community known for their environmental activism, particularly in protecting trees and wildlife. The other options either refer to religious texts or a geographical location, which don't fit the description of a community involved in environmental causes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
