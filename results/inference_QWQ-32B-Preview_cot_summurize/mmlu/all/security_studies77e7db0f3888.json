Structural violence, and D. Pervasive violence. I need to figure out which one is NOT considered one of the three forms.\n\nFirst, I should recall what postcolonialism is. Postcolonialism is a field of study that examines the cultural, political, and economic impacts of colonialism and its aftermath. It often critiques the power dynamics that persist even after formal colonial rule has ended.\n\nNow, regarding the forms of violence in postcolonial theory, I remember that violence isn't just physical; it can be more subtle and systemic. Let's consider each option:\n\nA. Material violence: This probably refers to physical, tangible harm\u2014like wars, massacres, or destruction of property. That seems straightforward. Postcolonial studies certainly address these direct forms of violence.\n\nB. Epistemic violence: I think this term refers to the violence done to knowledge systems and ways of knowing. It's about how colonialism imposed its own epistemologies, suppressing or invalidating indigenous knowledge. So, this is definitely recognized in postcolonial theory.\n\nC. Structural violence: This is a concept that refers to systematic ways in which social structures harm or disadvantage certain groups. In postcolonial contexts, it could be seen in unequal distribution of resources, discriminatory policies, and ongoing economic exploitation. So, yes, structural violence is a key aspect in postcolonial analysis.\n\nD. Pervasive violence: I'm not sure about this one. \"Pervasive\" means widespread or all-encompassing. Maybe it's similar to structural violence, but I'm not entirely sure. I need to think carefully.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that in some readings, postcolonial theorists identify three main forms of violence: material, epistemic, and structural. Pervasive violence isn't a term that comes up in that context. Maybe it's a different concept or perhaps a misnomer in this question.\n\nLet me double-check. Material violence is physical harm, epistemic is about knowledge systems, and structural is about systemic inequalities. These three seem to cover the main types of violence discussed in postcolonial studies.\n\nPervasive violence, if it means violence that is widespread and ongoing, might be a way to describe structural violence. But based on what I know, it's not specifically identified as a separate form in postcolonial theory.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. Pervasive violence is NOT one of the three forms identified by postcolonialism. Instead, it might be a way to describe how structural violence operates.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if pervasive violence could be a distinct category. Maybe in some theories, it is. However, based on my knowledge, it's not one of the primary three forms discussed in postcolonialism.\n\nSo, I'll go with D. Pervasive violence as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
