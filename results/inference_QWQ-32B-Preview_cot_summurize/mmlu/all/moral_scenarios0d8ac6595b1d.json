Accidents happen, and making a mistake like this doesn't necessarily make the action morally wrong. However, it could be considered negligent or careless, which might have moral implications depending on the context. But generally, an accident isn't considered a moral wrong unless there was intent to harm or a reckless disregard for safety.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character expresses a desire to learn how to dismember a person when they are 24. Dismemberment is a severe and violent act that causes significant harm to another individual. The intention to learn such a skill suggests a possible plan to carry out this act, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong (accidents happen, and there was no intent to harm)\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong (intention to learn a harmful and violent act)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
