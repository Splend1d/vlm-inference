                    "text": "So I've got this question here about factors that reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. The options are Vitamin C, dietary fiber, alcohol, and estrogen. I need to figure out which one of these actually helps lower the risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what colorectal cancer is. It's cancer that starts in the colon or the rectum, which are parts of the digestive system. Preventing it would involve looking at things that can keep the cells in these areas healthy and less likely to turn cancerous.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Vitamin C. I know that Vitamin C is an antioxidant, which means it helps protect cells from damage caused by harmful molecules called free radicals. Some studies have suggested that a diet high in antioxidants might help lower the risk of certain types of cancer, including colorectal cancer. So, Vitamin C could be a possible answer.\n\nNext is dietary fiber. Fiber is something that comes from plant foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It's known for its role in keeping the digestive system healthy. High-fiber diets have been associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Fiber can help move food through the digestive system more quickly, which might reduce the time that potentially harmful substances stay in contact with the colon lining. So, dietary fiber seems like a strong candidate.\n\nAlcohol, on the other hand, is something I associate with increasing health risks, not decreasing them. In fact, I believe that excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor for colorectal cancer, among other cancers. So, this one is probably not the answer.\n\nLastly, estrogen. Estrogen is a hormone that plays a role in the development of female sex characteristics. I'm not sure how it relates to colorectal cancer risk. I know that hormone levels can affect the risk of some types of cancer, like breast cancer, but I'm not sure about colorectal cancer. Maybe it's neutral or perhaps even a risk factor, but I don't think it reduces the risk.\n\nConsidering all this, both Vitamin C and dietary fiber seem like they could reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but dietary fiber has a more direct relationship with colorectal health. Alcohol and estrogen don't seem to help reduce the risk, and alcohol might even increase it.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is dietary fiber.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
