It is a brittle semi-metallic poor metal under standard conditions and is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb2S3). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used for cosmetics; metallic antimony was known, but rarely used in ancient times. The antimony metal is silvery white, opaque, and has a brilliant luster. It is hard and brittle, and fractures conchoidally.\n\nAntimony is primarily used in flame retardants, batteries, semiconductors, and as a hardening agent for lead alloys. It is also used in various other applications, including medicine, where it has been used as a treatment for certain types of cancer and as an antiparasitic agent.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. W - This is the symbol for Tungsten.\n\nB. Sb - This is the symbol for Antimony.\n\nC. Fe - This is the symbol for Iron.\n\nD. An - This is not a standard chemical symbol for any element.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Sb.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
