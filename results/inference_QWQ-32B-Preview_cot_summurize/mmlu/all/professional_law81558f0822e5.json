The corporation is supposed to locate missing children. The options are:\n\nA. ANDERSON\n\nB. FBI Consultants, Incorporated\n\nC. Private Eye Partners\n\nD. Child Finder Company\n\nI need to figure out which one would be a proper name for their corporation. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider what makes a name proper for a corporation. I think it should reflect the business's purpose, be distinctive, and comply with legal requirements for naming corporations.\n\nLet's look at option A: ANDERSON. This seems too generic and doesn't really indicate what the corporation does. It's just one person's name, Anderson, who is presumably one of the founders. But doesn't give any clue about the business's activity, which is locating missing children. So, this might not be the best choice.\n\nOption B: FBI Consultants, Incorporated. Hmm, this one suggests some connection to the FBI, which is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Now, I'm not sure if Anderson and Parker actually have any affiliation with the FBI. If they don't, using \"FBI\" in their name might be misleading or even illegal, as it could imply a relationship that doesn't exist. Plus, the FBI is a government agency, and using their name might require permission or could be restricted. So, this one seems problematic.\n\nOption C: Private Eye Partners. This name suggests detective work, which is related to locating missing people, including children. It's a bit more general, as private eyes might do various kinds of investigations, but it does hint at the kind of work the corporation does. It's also distinctive and doesn't imply any false associations.\n\nOption D: Child Finder Company. This one is very straightforward and directly states what the corporation does: finding children. It's clear and concise, and there's no ambiguity about the business's purpose.\n\nComparing these options, I think option D, Child Finder Company, is the most appropriate name for their corporation. It clearly communicates the service they provide, which is locating missing children, and it doesn't have any potential legal issues like implying a connection to the FBI without having one.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should also consider if any of these names are already in use by other corporations, as duplicate names might not be allowed, depending on the jurisdiction. But since the question doesn't provide that information, I'll assume that these names are available.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any legal restrictions on using certain words in a corporation's name. For example, using \"Incorporated\" or \"Company\" might require the business to be incorporated legally. Since the question mentions that they are forming a corporation, using such terms would be appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that \"Child Finder Company\" is the proper name for their corporation, as it accurately describes their business purpose and avoids any potential legal issues associated with implying false affiliations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
