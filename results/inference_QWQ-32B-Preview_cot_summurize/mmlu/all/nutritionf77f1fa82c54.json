It is produced in the liver through the breakdown of amino acids and is excreted by the kidneys. The other options\u2014uric acid, ammonia, and creatinine\u2014are also nitrogenous compounds found in urine, but urea is the most abundant among them in humans.\n\n- **Uric acid** is the main nitrogenous waste in birds and reptiles, but in humans, it is present in smaller amounts.\n\n- **Ammonia** is highly toxic and is not the primary form of nitrogenous waste in humans. Some ammonia is produced in the body but is quickly converted to urea in the liver.\n\n- **Creatinine** is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle and is also excreted in urine, but it is not the main nitrogenous compound.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Urea."
