                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this partnership problem. So, we have Studio Partnership with three partners: Ross, Stone, and Taylor, with profit and loss percentages of 15%, 35%, and 50% respectively. Then on April 9, Stone sells his entire interest to Taylor. The question is about Studio's status as a partnership for tax purposes, and I need to determine which statement is correct regarding whether it terminated and if so, when.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules for partnership termination for tax purposes. Generally, a partnership terminates when there is a withdrawal or admission of a partner, unless certain exceptions apply. One key exception is if the partnership agreement provides for changes in interests without terminating the partnership.\n\nIn this scenario, Stone sells his entire interest to Taylor. This seems like an admission of Taylor to take over Stone's interest, but actually, Taylor was already a partner with 50% interest, and now is acquiring Stone's 35% interest, which would increase Taylor's total interest to 85%, while Ross remains with 15%.\n\nI think the relevant tax rule here is that a partnership terminates if there is a withdrawal or admission of a partner. However, in this case, it's more of a transfer between existing partners. Taylor was already a partner, and is acquiring Stone's interest. So, Stone is withdrawing, and Taylor is acquiring his interest.\n\nAccording to IRS rules, a partnership terminates when there is a withdrawal of a partner, unless the partnership agreement provides otherwise. In this case, since Stone is withdrawing by selling his interest to Taylor, it might trigger termination.\n\nBut, there's a concept called \"technical termination,\" where if all partners withdraw and are replaced by new partners, it's considered a termination. But in this case, Ross is still there with his 15% interest, and Taylor is acquiring Stone's interest, so it's not a complete replacement of partners.\n\nAlternatively, there's another rule that if more than 50% of the capital and profits interests change hands in a year, it can be considered a termination. Here, Stone's 35% interest is being transferred to Taylor, who already has 50%. So, the change is 35%, which is less than 50%, so perhaps that doesn't trigger termination.\n\nWait, I need to check the actual tax regulations on this. According to IRS Code Section 708, a partnership terminates when there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in partnership capital and profits within a 12-month period.\n\nIn this case, Stone is selling his 35% interest to Taylor. Taylor already has 50%, so the total change is 35%, which is less than 50%. Therefore, according to this rule, there should be no termination.\n\nHowever, another consideration is whether Stone's withdrawal causes termination. If Stone withdraws, and his interest is sold to Taylor, it might be considered a termination of the old partnership and formation of a new one.\n\nBut, since Taylor is already a partner, it's more of a transfer between existing partners, which might not trigger termination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the partnership continues, but with revised profit and loss sharing ratios.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Studio terminated as of January 1.\n\nThat can't be right because the transaction happened on April 9.\n\nB. Studio terminated as of April 9.\n\nThis suggests that the partnership terminated on the date of the transfer.\n\nC. Studio terminated as of December 31.\n\nThis would imply that the partnership continued but terminated at the end of the year.\n\nD. Studio did not terminate.\n\nThis suggests that the partnership continued without termination.\n\nGiven the analysis, since the transfer is less than 50% and Taylor was already a partner, it's likely that the partnership did not terminate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Studio did not terminate.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other rules that might apply. For example, if Stone completely withdraws and is no longer a partner, does that affect the continuation of the partnership?\n\nPartnership acts usually provide that a partnership continues until all partners agree to dissolve it or until all partners withdraw. In this case, Stone is withdrawing, but Taylor is acquiring his interest, so the partnership might continue with Ross and Taylor.\n\nHowever, according to tax law, particularly IRS rules, the partnership might still continue if the change in interests doesn't exceed 50% within a 12-month period, which in this case, it doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Studio did not terminate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
