                    "text": "The Newtonian law that states \"An object in motion tends to stay in motion\" is known as the Law of Inertia. This is actually the first of Newton's three laws of motion. So, the correct answer is A. Law of Inertia.\n\nTo provide a bit more context, Newton's first law, or the Law of Inertia, essentially tells us that an object will continue in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is acted upon by an external force. This means that if an object is at rest, it will remain at rest, and if it is moving, it will continue to move at a constant velocity, unless a force causes it to change its state.\n\nOption B, the Law of Thermodynamics, is a set of laws in physics that describe the relationships between heat, work, temperature, and energy. It doesn't relate to motion in the way described in the question.\n\nOption C, the Law of Relativity, is a theory developed by Albert Einstein that deals with the laws of physics being the same for all non-accelerating observers, and the speed of light in a vacuum being the same no matter the speed at which an observer travels. This is not related to the statement about objects in motion.\n\nOption D, the Law of Gravitation, is Newton's law that describes the attraction between two masses. It explains phenomena such as why objects fall to the ground and the orbits of planets, but it doesn't directly state that an object in motion tends to stay in motion.\n\nSo, among the options provided, A. Law of Inertia is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
