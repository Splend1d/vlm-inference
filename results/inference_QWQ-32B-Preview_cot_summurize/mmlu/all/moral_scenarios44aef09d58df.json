Physically harming someone is generally considered morally wrong because it causes pain and potential injury without consent. It's an act of aggression that violates the other person's bodily integrity.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character lies about being at work to cheat on their husband. Cheating on a spouse is typically viewed as morally wrong because it breaks the trust and fidelity expected in a marital relationship. Additionally, lying to cover up the infidelity exacerbates the moral breach.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
