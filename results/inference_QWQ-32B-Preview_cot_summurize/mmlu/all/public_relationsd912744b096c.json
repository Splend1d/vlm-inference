                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The Web was effectively invented by Berners-Lee in which year?\" And the options are 1980, 1989, 1991, and 1993. I need to figure out the correct year when Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web.\n\nFirst, I know that Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact year. I remember that it was developed in the late 20th century, probably in the 1980s or early 1990s.\n\nLet me think about this. I know that the Internet itself has been around since the 1960s, but the Web is a different thing. The Web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. So, it's not the same as the Internet.\n\nI think that in the late 1980s, Berners-Lee was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, and that's where he developed the Web. So, maybe it was around 1989 or 1990.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, 1989 is one of them. But I also remember that the first website was launched in 1991, so maybe the Web was invented a bit before that.\n\nLet me see. If he was working at CERN in the late 1980s, perhaps he proposed the idea in 1989 and then developed it over the next couple of years.\n\nI recall that in 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a proposal for a system that would allow scientists to share information easily across the Internet. That sounds like the beginning of the Web.\n\nThen, in 1990, he built the first web browser and editor, and the first web server. And the first website went live in 1991.\n\nSo, if I had to pick when the Web was effectively invented, I would say it's around 1989 when he conceived the idea and started developing it.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I should look up some key dates related to the invention of the Web.\n\nOkay, according to my knowledge, in 1989, Berners-Lee proposed the idea of the World Wide Web. In 1990, he built the first web browser and server. In 1991, the first website was launched, and the Web became publicly available.\n\nSo, the invention process started in 1989, but it was in 1991 that it became available to the public.\n\nHmm, so depending on how you define \"effectively invented,\" it could be either 1989 or 1991.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the invention refers to the initial conception and development, which would be 1989, whereas 1991 is when it was released to the public.\n\nGiven that, I think 1989 is the most accurate answer among the options provided.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\n1980 is quite early; the personal computer revolution was just beginning then, and the Internet was mainly used by academics and researchers. So, it's unlikely that the Web was invented in 1980.\n\n1993 is when the Mosaic browser was released, which was significant because it popularized the Web among ordinary people. But that was after the Web had already been invented.\n\n1991 is when the first website went live, making the Web publicly available.\n\nBut since the question says \"effectively invented,\" I think it's referring to when Berners-Lee first developed it, which was in 1989.\n\nSo, I'll go with option B, 1989.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
