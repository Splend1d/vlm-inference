The options are Tiger Beat, Outside, National Geographic, and Smithsonian.\n\nFirst, I know that National Geographic is famous for its coverage of natural science, exploration, and culture. It's full of articles about animals, environments, and scientific discoveries. So, that's definitely a natural science magazine.\n\nSmithsonian is another one that I think covers a broad range of topics including science, history, and culture. I remember seeing articles about archaeology and space exploration in there, so it seems like it also focuses on natural science.\n\nOutside magazine, from what I recall, is more about outdoor activities like hiking, climbing, and skiing. While it might have some elements of natural science, it seems more geared towards adventure and recreation.\n\nThen there's Tiger Beat. I'm not super familiar with this one, but I think it's more focused on celebrity news and entertainment for teenagers. I don't recall it having much content related to natural science.\n\nSo, comparing all of them, Tiger Beat seems like the least likely to focus on natural science. Outside might have some science, but its primary focus is on outdoor activities, whereas Tiger Beat is more about celebrities.\n\nTherefore, I would say the answer is A. Tiger Beat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
