Specifically, one stroke over par on a single hole is called a \"bogey.\" So, if a hole is rated as a par-4 and a golfer takes five strokes to complete it, that's one over par, which is a bogey.\n\nTo provide more context:\n\n- **Par**: This is the expected number of strokes it should take an expert golfer to complete a hole or the entire course.\n\n- **Birdie**: One stroke under par. For a par-4 hole, completing it in three strokes is a birdie.\n\n- **Eagle**: Two strokes under par. On a par-4, that would be two strokes under, completing it in two strokes.\n\n- **Dormy**: This term isn't commonly used in the way the question suggests. \"Dormy\" can refer to a type of golf club or, in some contexts, to being even par for the match in match play.\n\nSo, among the options provided, \"bogey\" is the correct term for one stroke over par.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nGolf scoring terms for strokes relative to par include:\n\n- **Bogey**: +1 on a hole\n\n- **Double Bogey**: +2 on a hole\n\n- **Triple Bogey**: +3 on a hole\n\n- **Par**: 0 (neither under nor over)\n\n- **Birdie**: -1 on a hole\n\n- **Eagle**: -2 on a hole\n\n- **Albatross (or double eagle)**: -3 on a hole\n\nThese terms help golfers track their performance relative to the course's difficulty, as indicated by the par ratings."
