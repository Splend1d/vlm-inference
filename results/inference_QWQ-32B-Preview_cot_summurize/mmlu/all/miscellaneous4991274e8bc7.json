CO2 from fossil fuels\n\nC. Dust clouds from volcanoes\n\nD. Depletion of Earth's ozone layer\n\nHmm, let's think about each one.\n\nStarting with A, atomic warfare. If there were a large-scale nuclear war, it could potentially release a lot of dust and particles into the atmosphere, which might block sunlight and actually lead to cooling, something like a nuclear winter. So, that seems counterintuitive for causing a temperature rise.\n\nOption B is CO2 from fossil fuels. I know that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas releases a lot of CO2 into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat and lead to warming, so this seems like a strong candidate for causing a rise in average temperature.\n\nC. Dust clouds from volcanoes. Volcanic eruptions do release dust and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which can reflect sunlight and cause temporary cooling. For example, Mount Pinatubo in 1991 caused a global temperature drop for a few years after its eruption. So, again, this seems more likely to cause cooling rather than warming.\n\nD. Depletion of Earth's ozone layer. The ozone layer protects us from harmful UV radiation. Its depletion allows more UV rays to reach the Earth's surface, which can have various environmental impacts. However, the relationship between ozone depletion and global temperature is complex. Some studies suggest that ozone depletion can lead to cooling in the stratosphere but may have a small warming effect at the surface. But compared to the other options, it seems less directly linked to a significant rise in average temperature.\n\nComparing all these, option B, CO2 from fossil fuels, seems to be the most direct cause of a rise in Earth's average temperature. It's widely accepted in climate science that increasing levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are leading to global warming.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. CO2 from fossil fuels.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
