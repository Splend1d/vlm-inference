                    "text": "Let's see. So, in this trial for personal injuries from a traffic accident, the plaintiff first calls the defendant to testify as an adverse party. Then, the plaintiff calls a witness who was a passenger in the plaintiff's car; interestingly, this witness is also the defendant's former employer. During direct examination, this witness talks about how the accident happened and also gives his opinion that the defendant is not a truthful person.\n\nNow, the question is about cross-examination. It's asking which area of questioning would most likely be considered beyond the proper scope of cross-examination. So, I need to think about what's allowed in cross-examination and what isn't.\n\nFirst, I recall that cross-examination is supposed to be limited to the matters that were raised during direct examination. It's an opportunity for the opposing party to challenge the witness's testimony or to explore issues that the witness has already touched upon.\n\nSo, in this case, during direct examination, the witness testified about two main things: the circumstances of the accident and his opinion on the defendant's truthfulness.\n\nTherefore, cross-examination should generally stick to these topics. It can include questioning the witness's perception, memory, or bias regarding the accident, and it can also address his opinion about the defendant's truthfulness.\n\nBut, there are some limits. For example, cross-examination shouldn't be used to bring in entirely new matters that weren't covered in direct examination, unless they're necessary to assess the witness's credibility or the relevance of their testimony.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. In letters to prospective employers, the witness has described the defendant as very honest and dependable.\n\nThis seems relevant because it goes to the witness's opinion about the defendant's truthfulness, which was discussed in direct examination. So, questioning about inconsistent statements regarding the defendant's character for truthfulness would be within the scope.\n\nB. The defendant recently filed an action against the witness for breach of contract.\n\nThis might be relevant if it shows some animosity or bias between the defendant and the witness. If the defendant is suing the witness, perhaps the witness has a motive to testify unfavorably against the defendant. So, this could be within the scope of cross-examination to assess the witness's potential bias.\n\nC. The plaintiff's injuries were not as serious as the plaintiff is claiming.\n\nHmm, this is interesting. The witness was a passenger in the plaintiff's car during the accident, so perhaps he has some observation about the injuries. However, unless the witness testified about the severity of the plaintiff's injuries during direct examination, bringing this up in cross-examination might be beyond the scope. Wait, in direct examination, he only testified about how the accident occurred and his opinion about the defendant's truthfulness. He didn't say anything about the extent of the plaintiff's injuries. So, questioning about the seriousness of the injuries might not be directly related to his direct testimony and could be considered beyond the proper scope of cross-examination.\n\nD. The witness has been falsifying his income tax returns.\n\nThis seems like it would be relevant to the witness's credibility. If the witness has been dishonest in his tax returns, that could impeach his credibility and suggest that he's not a truthful person. Since his truthfulness is already in question, given that he testified about the defendant's truthfulness, this might be allowed as cross-examination to challenge his credibility.\n\nWait a minute, let's think carefully. Option D is about the witness falsifying income tax returns, which goes to his character for truthfulness. Since he already expressed an opinion about the defendant's truthfulness, his own character for truthfulness is now in play. Therefore, questioning about his own dishonesty could be permissible to attack his credibility.\n\nOption C, on the other hand, is about the plaintiff's injuries, which wasn't part of his direct testimony. So, it seems like questioning about the plaintiff's injuries would be beyond the scope of his direct examination.\n\nBut, let's consider if there's any connection. The witness was a passenger in the plaintiff's car during the accident, so he might have observed the plaintiff immediately after the accident. Maybe his presence as a passenger implies that he has some knowledge about the injuries. However, since he didn't testify about the injuries during direct examination, it might not be proper to bring it up in cross-examination.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and D are more directly related to the witness's testimony or his relationship with the defendant.\n\nTherefore, option C seems most likely to be held beyond the proper scope of cross-examination.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if the plaintiff's injuries are relevant to the witness's testimony. Well, the witness testified about the accident and the defendant's truthfulness. The severity of the plaintiff's injuries might be relevant to assess the witness's potential bias or motivation to testify a certain way, but it wasn't part of his direct testimony.\n\nHowever, in general, cross-examination is supposed to be limited to the matters raised in direct examination, unless they're necessary to assess the witness's credibility or the relevance of their testimony.\n\nIn this case, the witness didn't testify about the plaintiff's injuries, so questioning about the seriousness of the injuries might be seen as beyond the proper scope.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
