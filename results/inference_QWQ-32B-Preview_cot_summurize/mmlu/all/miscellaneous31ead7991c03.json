Hmm, I'm not super familiar with bowling terms, but I'll try to figure this out.\n\nFirst off, yahtzee is a different game altogether, right? It's that dice game where you roll five dice and try to get certain combinations. So, that probably isn't the answer.\n\nMulligan, I think that's a term from golf, isn't it? Like getting a do-over, another chance to hit the ball. So, that doesn't seem related to bowling strikes.\n\nAce, that sounds like maybe one strike, but three in a row? Not sure.\n\nTurkey, now that sounds familiar. I think in bowling, a turkey is when you get three strikes in a row. Yeah, I've heard that before. Let me double-check though.\n\nLet me think about it. In bowling, a strike is when you knock down all the pins with the first ball. So, three strikes in a row would be pretty impressive. I think they have special names for multiple strikes in a row.\n\nI recall that a single strike is just called a strike, two strikes in a row is called a double, and three strikes in a row is called a turkey. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nLet me see if that makes sense. So, if one is a strike, two is a double, three is a turkey. Maybe after that, there are other terms, but for now, turkey seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's eliminate the other options again. Yahtzee is definitely not related to bowling; it's a dice game. Mulligan is from golf and means getting an extra turn, which isn't the same as scoring strikes in bowling. Ace might refer to a single strike, but not three in a row.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. turkey.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
