Let me see how to do this.\n\nFirst, I remember that to solve for x, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. That means I need to get rid of the -10.5 that's being subtracted from x. To do that, I can add 10.5 to both sides of the equation. That should keep things balanced.\n\nSo, if I have x - 10.5 = -11.6, and I add 10.5 to both sides, it should look like this:\n\nx - 10.5 + 10.5 = -11.6 + 10.5\n\nNow, -10.5 and +10.5 on the left side cancel each other out, so I'm left with:\n\nx = -11.6 + 10.5\n\nOkay, now I just need to calculate -11.6 plus 10.5. Let's see, -11.6 plus 10.5... that's like subtracting 11.6 and adding 10.5, which is the same as subtracting 1.1, right? Because -11.6 + 10.5 = -1.1.\n\nSo, x = -1.1\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. -22.1\n\nB. 1.1\n\nC. 22.1\n\nD. -1.1\n\nIt looks like option D is -1.1, which matches what I got.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculation to be sure. -11.6 plus 10.5... yes, that's -1.1. Alternatively, I can think of it as 10.5 - 11.6, which is also -1.1. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can plug the value back into the original equation to verify.\n\nSo, x - 10.5 = -11.6\n\nIf x = -1.1, then -1.1 - 10.5 should equal -11.6.\n\nLet's calculate -1.1 - 10.5: that's -11.6, which matches the right side of the equation. Perfect, that confirms it.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is D. -1.1\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
