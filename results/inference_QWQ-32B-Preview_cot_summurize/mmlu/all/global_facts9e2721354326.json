The question is: \"As of 2015, what percentage of the global population over 15 years old was literate?\" and the options are A. 81%, B. 86%, C. 91%, and D. 96%. I need to pick the correct percentage.\n\nFirst, I need to recall or find information about global literacy rates around that time. I remember that literacy rates have been improving worldwide due to various education initiatives, but I'm not sure about the exact percentage for 2015.\n\nLet me think about what organizations might publish such statistics. The United Nations, especially UNESCO, often reports on education and literacy rates globally. Maybe I can look for reports from UNESCO around that time.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the World Bank also collects and publishes data on education indicators, including literacy rates. Perhaps I can check their database for the specific year 2015.\n\nSince this is a multiple-choice question, maybe I can eliminate some options based on what I know. For instance, a 96% literacy rate seems too high, considering that there are still many regions with significant illiteracy issues. Similarly, 81% seems too low, as literacy rates have been increasing over the years.\n\nThat leaves me with options B and C: 86% and 91%. Between these two, I have to make an educated guess. I think the global literacy rate was closer to 86% in 2015, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that in some developed countries, literacy rates are nearly 100%, but in developing countries, especially in some African and Asian countries, literacy rates can be much lower. So, the global average would be somewhere in the middle.\n\nPerhaps I can try to calculate a rough estimate. If I assume that half of the world's population is in developed countries with 99% literacy and the other half is in developing countries with, say, 70% literacy, then the global average would be around 84.5%. But this is a very rough estimate and probably not accurate.\n\nI think the best approach is to remember that according to UNESCO, as of 2015, the global literacy rate for adults was around 86%. So, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me verify this information. According to a UNESCO report from 2016, the global adult literacy rate was indeed around 86%. The report stated that approximately 781 million adults lacked basic literacy skills, which corresponds to about 14% of the global population over 15 years old. Therefore, the literacy rate would be 86%.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 86%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
