                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about DNA. It says: \"In a double-stranded molecule of DNA, the ratio of purines : pyrimidines is:\n\nA. variable.\n\nB. determined by the base sequence in RNA.\n\nC. genetically determined.\n\nD. always 1:1.\"\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to remember what purines and pyrimidines are in the context of DNA. I know that DNA is made up of four different types of bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Among these, adenine and guanine are purines, and thymine and cytosine are pyrimidines.\n\nNow, the question is about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule. So, I need to think about how these bases pair up in the double helix.\n\nI recall that in DNA, adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine. This is known as base pairing or Chargaff's rules.\n\nSo, in a double-stranded DNA molecule, each purine in one strand is paired with a pyrimidine in the other strand, and vice versa.\n\nLet me see if I can express this in terms of ratios.\n\nIf I have a certain number of adenines (purines) on one strand, they will be paired with thymines (pyrimidines) on the other strand. Similarly, guanines (purines) will be paired with cytosines (pyrimidines).\n\nSo, for every purine on one strand, there is a corresponding pyrimidine on the other strand, and vice versa.\n\nBut the question is about the overall ratio of purines to pyrimidines in the entire double-stranded molecule.\n\nWait a minute, in a double-stranded DNA, the total number of purines should equal the total number of pyrimidines, because each purine is paired with a pyrimidine.\n\nLet me think about that. If I have 10 adenines on one strand, there will be 10 thymines on the other strand. Similarly, if I have 15 guanines on one strand, there will be 15 cytosines on the other strand.\n\nSo, total purines = adenines + guanines = 10 + 15 = 25.\n\nTotal pyrimidines = thymines + cytosines = 10 + 15 = 25.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is 25:25, which is 1:1.\n\nWait, but is this always the case?\n\nLet me consider another example. Suppose one strand has 20 adenines and 30 guanines.\n\nThen, the other strand will have 20 thymines and 30 cytosines.\n\nTotal purines = 20 A + 30 G = 50.\n\nTotal pyrimidines = 20 T + 30 C = 50.\n\nAgain, the ratio is 1:1.\n\nHmm, it seems like no matter what the base composition is, as long as it's double-stranded DNA following base pairing rules, the total number of purines should equal the total number of pyrimidines.\n\nIs there any exception to this?\n\nI think in some single-stranded DNAs or in RNA, the base composition might not follow this rule, but since this question is specifically about double-stranded DNA, I believe the ratio should always be 1:1.\n\nBut let's look at the options again.\n\nA. variable.\n\nB. determined by the base sequence in RNA.\n\nC. genetically determined.\n\nD. always 1:1.\n\nOption A says variable, but based on my reasoning, it seems like it's not variable in double-stranded DNA.\n\nOption B mentions RNA, but the question is about DNA, so I think this is irrelevant.\n\nOption C says genetically determined. I'm not sure what this means. Is the ratio determined by genetic factors? Well, the base sequence is genetic information, but in double-stranded DNA, the ratio still should be 1:1 regardless of the sequence.\n\nOption D says always 1:1, which aligns with my reasoning.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something I'm missing. Let me think about modified bases or anything like that.\n\nIn standard double-stranded DNA, with A-T and G-C pairing, the ratio should be 1:1.\n\nUnless there are unusual base pairings, but in standard biology, that's not the case.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D. always 1:1.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider some special cases.\n\nFor example, in regions with a lot of AT-rich or GC-rich sequences, but even then, as long as A pairs with T and G pairs with C, the total purines should equal pyrimidines.\n\nAnother thing is that in some viruses, there might be single-stranded DNA, but the question specifies double-stranded DNA.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe the answer is D. always 1:1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
