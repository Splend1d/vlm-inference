                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character proposes to their long-time girlfriend during dinner at their favorite restaurant. Proposing marriage is generally seen as a positive and honorable act, especially when it's to someone you've been in a relationship with for a long time. It's a way of committing to each other and planning a future together. So, in this case, there doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with proposing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character moved to the United States to get welfare. Welfare refers to government assistance programs designed to help people who are struggling financially. These programs are intended for those who genuinely need support to meet their basic needs. However, moving to another country solely to take advantage of welfare systems, without any intention to contribute to society or find employment, could be seen as abusing the system. This might be considered morally wrong because it takes resources away from those who truly need them and may go against the principles of self-reliance and contributing to society.\n\nSo, considering these points, it seems that Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
